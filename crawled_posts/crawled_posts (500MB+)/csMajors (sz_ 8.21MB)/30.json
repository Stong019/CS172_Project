        "selftext": "There are a lot of CS majors who aspire to work for the FAANG/MAMAA companies the same way some high schoolers aspire to get into Ivy League universities. As a former Amazon engineer who worked on the AWS Virtual Private Cloud service back in 2017-2018, let me explain to you what is wrong with that line of thinking.\n\nThe first thing you need to keep in mind about any real job is that work is normally exploitative, and big tech jobs are no exception. They give great starting salaries compared to other junior developer positions, sure, but there's a catch. They lose money on you during your first year working there with no experience with the expectation that they will make that money back from your labor later on when you know what you're doing there. Big tech companies like Amazon and Facebook often use their own, internal, company-specific tools that aren't used at other companies. For example, Facebook created and uses the Hack programming language that nobody else uses (it started as an offshoot of PHP with types added and became its own separate programming language sort of like how C++ started as C with classes and then became its own separate thing). Amazon's core services run on Amazon's unique internal deployment engine called [Apollo, which you can read about here](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2014/11/apollo-amazon-deployment-engine.html) and are built by Amazon's unique internal build system, [Brazil](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1568190805948473344?s=20). Most companies put their applications that run on servers in containers like Docker, deploy/scale their containers with say Kubernetes, and can use the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) that handles the deployment and scaling of your containerized apps automatically. For building, they may use a common, open source build system like Maven for Java, sbt (Scala Build Tool) for Scala, or whatever build system your programming language normally uses. The problem with only using and mastering tools that are only used by one specific employer like say Facebook or Amazon is that they don't teach you what is commonly used outside of that company, so what you were taught isn't as readily transferable to another employer if you get fired or choose to leave. Essentially, there is some \"employer lock in\". You may look around at the facilities at say Amazon or Google and go \"golly, gee, there's the Super Smash Bros videogame in the lunch room as well as games and free food, wow\", but that stuff isn't just there to make you happy, it's part of the \"employer lock in\" to keep you from leaving. Once you're locked in and are acquainted with their tools and processes and stuff, they're making profit off of you. If you instead worked at a \"regular\" company using \"regular\" commonly used software tools like say (on the backend) the ASP.NET Core framework if you're coding in C# or Spring Boot for Java Spring, you will have skills that you are already deeply familiar with that you can immediately transfer over to another company. At Amazon the backend was in Java which is a common programming language, sure, but they used their own unique custom internal framework called [CORAL framework](https://www.teamblind.com/post/Why-amazon-uses-CORAL-framework-and-not-spring-boot-OPgpbvqu) which I think had some Java Spring in it but was a totally custom thing, not the usual stuff that's used at other companies with Java backends. Also, unlike with common open source frameworks and tools, there are no books on say CORAL Framework or the Hack programming language that you can buy on Amazon and read before bed the way there is for say Java Spring or Docker or whatever (which is an issue for me personally because I learn by reading technical books).\n\nWhen the money supply shrinks or a recession happens causing layoffs, or your performance isn't great, you can get fired, and when that happens you want to be able to find another job quickly and be useful at that job. Sure, having \"Amazon\" at the top of your resume gets the attention of recruiters from India on LinkedIn, but once you get past that stage you have to actually demonstrate your usefulness to prospective employers on their particular system. I've had prospective employers tell me, as part of their interview/hiring process, \"build a JSON API that can be used to play a simple card game\" or something like that, where the deck of cards is represented as an array of integers. I can't build that HTTP REST API with Amazon's CORAL Framework because that framework doesn't exist outside of Amazon. Instead I have to learn some common, open source framework that is generally used, like maybe Java Spring Boot or Express on Node.js for backend JavaScript. And like if I work for Facebook and I've been exclusively programming in the Hack programming language for 4 years and then all of a sudden I get fired because there's a recession, I can't do the coding interview at other companies in the Hack language, other company's coding test probably doesn't even support it. I have to learn and use something more common that other people and companies know, use, and support. \n\nSo definitely keep that in mind and have a second/backup tech stack and skill set handy with demo projects that use it in case you ever get fired and need to find another employer outside of the FAANG/MAMAA companies. Ultimately a job is just an exchange of your time for money and an employer is just a source of money. Some people embrace the idea of living to work, but really you should be working to live. Before you accept an offer, establish how many hours a week you will be working so you can have a life outside of work. Don't make your employer think that putting in Herculean (like Hercules) effort is the norm, causing you to get burnt out in the long run. First and foremost, watch out for yourself. Amazon is just another company, and they will put their customers, their shareholders, and their leadership/executives before you, their worker.\n\n**Edit 1:** One person commented \"but the big concepts carry over between companies\". And they can, like common object oriented programming language features can transfer over from say Facebook's Hack language to say Python or like the concept of container deployments can transfer over from Amazon's Apollo to Kubernetes. But there's definitely a learning curve and it's not instant, and also in my case I have issues with my brain which made learning new things increasingly difficult over time. If you know what skills/knowledge you need to learn or transfer over ahead of time and put in the work to do it before you get fired it's usually not that bad, but in general I don't like any sort of specific lock-in and in some places lock-in is an intentional feature and not a bug.\n\n\n**Edit 2:** Also, even though the starting/junior salary at FAANG is higher than at \"normal\" companies, if you never get into leadership, management, or anything upper management or executive, their mid to late career pay isn't that amazing. Yes, you get a pay bump from L4 (junior) to L5 or L6, but then your pay from then on is flat forever. If you used \"standard\" technology and built systems for \"regular\" companies for that duration of time you could be designing/architecting whole systems from scratch at other companies, setting the rates, and getting paid better than what Amazon would be paying you. One guy described it like this \"if the system is a car, at Amazon I was fixing the tailpipe while at this other company I designed, built, and installed the engine\". The same person, after 10 years at Amazon, could still be designing and building tailpipes while at another company they could be designing and building the engine or even the whole architecture of a car from the start. Your job title at a non-FAANG company could be \"enterprise architect\" instead of \"senior developer\" at FAANG. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13ntff6/why_faang_isnt_that_great_from_a_former_amazon/jl1sunu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n**Edit 3:** Oh, and at Amazon you sometimes get woken up by the pager at 3AM because you're \"on call\" and something bad happened with the system. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/13ntff6/comment/jl3bgar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n**Edit 4:** Also, FAANG jobs are more likely to be in very high cost of living areas. After I left (was forcibly asked to leave) Amazon with less than 2 years of experience in total, I got a job coding for a bank at $86 an hour on W2 in North Carolina where my rent 3-4 blocks from work in the center of town was about $1350 a month. Yes, your pay at say Google is a little higher then where I worked after I left Amazon, but your cost of living in Silicon Valley (and even other locations like New York, Seattle, and Washington DC) is much higher.",

            "As a former FAANG guy myself, I can tell you're from Amazon.  Bezos required wall of text.\n\nJust give me the goddamned bullet points! :-).",
            "I've been at amazon for 12 years. Lots has changed. For example:\n\n* Build system is moving towards idiomatic build tools like gradle and npm.\n* Apollo is basically dead. Teams are using AWS for continuous deployment \n* All new systems are built on AWS, which is clearly transferable knowledge \n* You learn to build systems at high scale, which is a unique skill most don't have \n* The common languages nowadays are Java, Kotlin, and Typescript\n* The pay is very good (I am approaching 800k TC as a principal)\n* The stock you hold is generally more reliable vs. a start-up with an unknown IPo timeline\n* If I wanted to move companies, leetcode is the skill I need. Not some specific technology.\n\nHard disagree. And a side note: Amazonians learn to write concisely as they move up. Long rants tend to be ignored",
            "An opposing view, but FAANG really IS that great, especially if you have no prior work experience (eg recent grad).\n\nA FANNG company on your resume propels your career by a significant margin as compared to a generic F500 or start-up.",
            "I spent four years at Amazon and generally agree with these points.\n\nThere's one more that I think bears mentioning: \n\n* You will learn more at small companies.\n\nOne of the main reasons I left Amazon was because I felt I wasn't growing as much as I had at small company jobs I'd had before.\n\nAt a FAANG, you'll be one engineer of thousands. You will own a tiny part of a tiny cog in that machine. Ninety percent of your job will be grunt work. When something technically interesting does come along, you won't own it. FAANGs already have world-class experts in multiple domains. They will do the most interesting work and just vend you their solution.\n\nAt a small company, OTOH, you have way more impact and opportunities for meaningful, interesting work. When interesting or challenging problems come along, you and your team get to solve them.\n\nThis isn't just an Amazon thing either. I have a good friend from Amazon that spent three years at Google and he left because the same thing happened to him there. \n\nFAANGs hire the best of the best, and then put most of them to work on the boring stuff.",
            "You can't really encapsulate FAANG by having spent a year or so at the most notoriously nightmarish big-tech company.",
            "Recruiter is still gonna hire a layed off Google employee than some rando",
            " Yea yea let me see for myself once I get in",
            "Bad take IMO - if you are familiar with how VCS works, you shouldn't have too much of a problem jumping from Git to Mercurial to whatever else. If you're familiar with Build tools, should be too hard to go from Brazil to BLAZE. It's a core understanding of what the tool actually does that matters, not the tool itself.\n\nIt's like how if you know one Object Oriented Language, it won't be hard to pick up another. Their internal tools aren't actually limiting you, just exposing you to a slightly different way of doing things, which is a good thing. It helps increase your understanding of why certain things are and function a certain way.\n\nAlso the pay is crazy",
            "Couldn't get through your post because it's too dense, but I wanted to give my bulletpoints for why I love working in non-tech companies. Just in case it helps someone who's trying to decide what industry to go into. I've worked in the technology arm of a healthcare company, then telecommunications, and now insurance. Here's why I love it:\n\n* Most people in the company have no idea how long shit takes. So we set our own schedules. Which means we work pretty slow, compared to a lot of tech companies. Expectations are also very reasonable.\n* Bigger emphasis on WLB. Most tech companies have just accepted that the average tenure of a SWE is 2-3 years, so they try to squeeze as much out of them in that time as possible. We don't accept that over in the business world! We want and expect our engineers to stick around for awhile, so we try not to burn them out\n* Tech isn't the main thing we do, so there isn't such a rush to get stuff out the door. That means less death marches and less encouragement to overwork. WLB really is great!!! I see FAANG engineers constantly complaining about overwork, but I work like 25-35 hours a week.  \n* I get a LOT of exposure to business stuff that I wouldn't at a tech company. It makes it easier to jump roles or even entire career paths.\n* You get to work with a lot of people who were hired for their social skills. Which makes it easier to make friends, and socialize. My scrum meetings are never uncomfortable. I love my team! I love working with other lines of business too.",
            "When you mention that there are skills that don\u2019t transfer over from one company to another, it reminded me of this [YouTube clip](https://youtu.be/2UqVsf_GL5w) where a former DQ employee went to work for another fast food chain.\n\nThe free food gets reduced during tough economic times. Went from breakfast and lunch to just lunch just 6 weeks ago and people got pissed about it.",
            "The wrost about amz is oncall, in what world does it make sense to wake me up at 2AM because some random internal tool is broken ? Everytime it happens the only thing I can think is \"if I go back to sleep and tell my boss I am quitting how long until my savings is over\"",
            "I do not work at FAANG but I have this exact same experience. The language we use does not exist outside the company *and* it uses a custom internal library with very little documentation.\n\nI love my job and it's very stable (4 years) but if I had to go somewhere else I would probably have to start as a Junior, just being honest. I worry about this.",
            "Terrible take in my opinion. You will learn a lot and become a better engineer if you work at any of the top tier companies, these skills are always transferrable\n\nI only read like one though because there is just a huge wall of text",
            "It's kinda wild to see how much this has been upvoted vs the amount of people running to suck some company's dick for free in the replies.\n\nPersonally, no amount of money is worth sacrificing my personal life, routinely overworking, and shrinking my expertise in my skillset to focus on any company enforced programming language not used elsewhere. With what time will I be able to learn and practice what I need to off the clock if I'm constantly on the grind? I guess a lotta folk in here are young, idk, but I'm old/wise enough to know that repeatedly sacrificing my health and life for money is a shit deal. I don't like any job enough for that shit.\n\nSorry you dealt with Amazon's nonsense by the way! I hope your somewhere more enriching by now, it seems like you have a good head on your shoulders. Good luck to you!",
            "I agree but having worked at Amazon and other large tech firms I can say the issue is far far far worse at Amazon. \n\nMy manager essentially told me the way to get promoted at Amazon is to greenfield some new tool / product for Amazon internal use, force feed it to other teams, show it off to management, and then abandon the project. Then just rinse and repeat.\n\nThis isn\u2019t typical behavior for large firms (at least not to the same degree), many other large tech firms put a large emphasis on avoiding building all of these internal tool\u2019s because then they are responsible for maintaining them. Amazon\u2019s approach is who gives a shit if the docs are terrible and the service is unusable, but not all companies take this approach.",
            "JSYN, Brazil/Apollo/Coral isn\u2019t the default experience as I was on a team that used native AWS & Lambdas :)) And even then there are a lot of transferable skills in CICD/pipelines - it\u2019s not a completely unique concept, and they don\u2019t use proprietary languages.",

            ">i learn by reading technical books \n\nTouche'",
            "yes theres brazil, crux, corol, arest and other random tools/things but you dont need to be an expert in any of these. simply using them takes a few minutes of getting used to, assuming you know the concepts behind them. same thing applies to any company. however,  becoming an expert in all of these is near impossible, but youre not expected to be this.\n\na good engineer will easily pick up anything given to them.  whether its a language, library, tools, design philosophy etc. so imo the \"company lock in due to software\" only applies to subpar engineers. this is why interviews are not based on \"tell me about how to set up a router in express\" but rather \"explain why you'd define XYZ endpoints and what considerations would you account for?\"\n\nthe *real* lock in imo comes from company culture. im appalled at how many people genuinely buy into their companies \"culture\". heard things like \"id never work for X because Y is different from our Z\" \n\nthird paragraph is bang on imo, its just a job guys, treat it as such. dont idolize.",
            "One of the more amusing things about working for a FAANG was my parents. I had been an analytics professional for many years, working for major corporations, and my parents were very happy with that, although they did not understand what I did. But when, at an advanced age, I landed at a FAANG, they were suddenly \"cool\" among their friends - when they were asked what I was doing, they would respond that \"he works for (FAANG)\", and their friends would apparently oooh and ahhh.

However, all these tools are not relevant for other employers. Smaller companies want an expertise with libraries but at our comoany we do not use even std:: The same time my current employer is eager to pay for my expertise with all these internal tools and there is not so much motivation to change a job. That is why we have people who worked at the same company all their life till retirement.",

Honestly I might just go back to school for a phd or something instead of getting another dev job when the axe finally drops.

It is a lot easier to make big impact at a smaller or earlier stage company by comparison, and the way most people moved up in FAANGs is by bouncing around and boomeranging up levels.\n\nI\u2019d say there are some big pluses to joining a larger company out of college, the main ones being a large amount of experienced folks, and good exposure to industry standards for software. New grads can learn from a lot of really talented individuals, and larger companies generally do a better job of documenting what works and what doesn\u2019t, best practices, etc.\n\nI think there are some statements made here that are a bit misleading.\n\nInternal tools: yes most FAANGs use their own internal tooling which you won\u2019t use in other companies. As said before, the concepts are the same and you should be able to translate them over. Any reasonable new company should give you reasonable time to ramp up with the tools they use before you start contributing. I really don\u2019t think this is some big detriment at all.\n\nYou also brought up in-house languages and not being able to do stuff like working with JSON, and HTTP REST APIs. Yeah, Amazon uses Coral internally which is different, but I\u2019d be concerned if anyone looking to get into software is unfamiliar with JSON or working with HTTP as a whole, and isn\u2019t familiar enough with a common language for a coding interview.\n\nSalary: its a bit more complicated than you present it. Yes your base salary doesn\u2019t go up much in most FAANGs after a while, but you get a LOT more equity. Not to mention FAANGs are publicly traded, so the equity has well-defined value. It can get a bit more complicated with pre-IPO startups where you may get a higher base salary, but equity is worthless until an IPO, and they may not offer other benefits like company match on a 401k or healthcare. You also need to look into what happens if the startup is acquired. Smaller companies are higher risk, higher reward.\n\nFrom an Amazon perspective: the team you\u2019re on is really what drives your experience with oncall. VPC is AWS-critical, so it was probably hell. I didn\u2019t work on a tier 1 service, so my oncalls were pretty relaxed. \n\nOverall, I think that FAANGs and larger companies are a great place to start a career, learn the best practices, and then move on to smaller companies when someone is ready to make a large impact.",

            "I mean that cuts both ways. A custom framework means your employees can't leave as easily, but it also means you can't on board as easily. So I really doubt that they use custom frameworks just to lock you in. But I think what you said about mid career growth being halted for non management and the cost of living surrounding those places is really important.",
            "I'm also in FAANG, and I worked in a smaller company before joining. From my experience, I agree that small company use more open source softwares, so you'll gain more exposure on what the vast majority uses. However, I did learn a lot more of things happening at scale at big tech. I think the blend of both is the best for career advancements. If you want to stay in FAANG, you gotta switch team in couple years to gain more experience. If you happen to be out of FAANG, take a bit of paycut hit to get into positions with new common tech. Career advancement does happen faster outside of FAANG. It's simply due to the fierce competition here. At Amazon, it's a squid game. It's not a place to stay long term unless you like pain and suffering.",

            "Around Mach 2023 I decided it was time to change roles. I let a few VC contacts know I was on the market and reached out to a few Tier 1 companies in the AI space. I interviewed through all of March and April before accepting a final offer at the beginning of May at <insert extremely popular AI company everyone here has heard of >.\n\nTC for most offers was in the $600k-$1.2M range. Some offers were difficult to value since they included significant equity as a founding engineer at new startups.\n\nCS Majors and new grads - hang in there! I had *so* much trouble getting a good internship in college and getting a good job right out of college. I went to a tier 2 school (decent state school, nothing notable) and I had mediocre internships. Give it a few years and you'll have recruiters and founders knocking down your door offering good jobs\n\nMy primary advice looking back on things - *don't burn bridges.* By the time you get 5+ years into your career, *everything is done via backchannels*. Your references won't really matter, employers will do their own investigation into your past by contacting former colleagues and managers. If you burn bridges, odds are the people on the other side of those bridges will be contacted and asked about you. I managed to not burn bridges thus far, and it paid off dearly during this search.",

This whole doomerism narrative that causes people to become more anxious, and be desperate for even lower salaries, is a self fulfilling prophecy that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if companies are intentionally pushing to lower pay for software engineers. \n\nBig tech still net billions of dollars in profits. Every software engineer produces massively more capital than they are paid. Two years ago, devs were satisfied and didn\u2019t even think about standing their ground because of the high salaries, but now that it\u2019s going down (even though companies still continue to profit), software engineers are scapegoating newcomers to the field instead of directing their anger at companies that CAN pay more but simply don\u2019t because they can get away with it. Don\u2019t be a pushover. We have to have more solidarity as a bloc in the longer term instead of being distracted by the market\u2019s ebbs and flows. \n\nCompanies will pay you minimum wage if they can get away with it. They will pay you less if they can get away with it. \n\nThe worst thing is that even people who are angry and want to stand their ground now will suddenly become an amnesiac as soon as they get a higher salary.",
            "American companies are the best run and the most ruthless in the world. Read into the history of NAFTA and how it decimated the American industrial base leading to the current issues we see in the rust belt. Understand that American companies will do the same thing to the technology sector, the way you capitalize on the future trend of American companies seeking lower labour costs is by staying out of America. Plenty of people get angry when I say this, but plenty of factory workers in the rust belt were also in disbelief that their industry would be decimated by NAFTA. Ultimately economics is everything, American companies have always sought cheaper labour to boost their bottom line, it will be no different for technology. People think of outsourcing as moving jobs to India/China, but the biggest beneficiaries of NAFTA were Mexico and Canada. Just food for thought. Put another way, FANG companies are valued at 30x+ their current earnings, this implies that to maintain these elevated valuations, high returns to shareholders in the future are not only required by necessary. Where will this capital to be returned to shareholders come from? History tells us that it comes out of the pocket of American labour.",

Then .. it crashed.\n\nI've been told afterwards that this pattern often occurs before a crash. All of the sudden a lot of people I know have started studying IT and want to persue an IT career. The 30 year old dude I used to know who've lived in his moms basement all life, my friend in his 30s who have studied law for several years and a lot of the \"friends of my friends\" have gone back to school to study IT since \"the market SCREAMS after programmers right now\"..

Fuck the market, fuck the layoffs, fuck all that shit. Quit expending so much energy thinking about it.  You don\u2019t have to work at a FAANG or even in a traditional SWE role. Just keep applying. Especially those of you who are new grads. For as oversaturated as the SWE field is, other STEM fields are under saturated. \n\nNot to be captain obvious, but YOU HAVE A STEM DEGREE. lol. It might SEEM like everyone has one. But they don\u2019t. STEM as a whole is projecting an 11 percent INCREASE over the next decade. Everything else is less than 8. And only about 18 percent of all graduates PERIOD have a STEM degree. The shit is valuable. Take that shit and go get some experience doing SOMETHING. When the CS market rebounds, apply for a SWE job. Or don\u2019t. But don\u2019t let this shit get you down. Economic downturns are gonna happen every few years for the rest of our lives. \n\nMy mentor from my Summer internship made the extremely astute point that a ton of STEM jobs require some degree of CS work, even if they are not CS jobs, and it gets you very valuable work experience.

I didn\u2019t know how to study, I didn\u2019t know how to apply, I didn\u2019t know how important they are for my career, I didn\u2019t know shit. My school never talked much about it because it\u2019s an average state school. Now (100% thanks to the wealth of information in this sub), I\u2019m gonna be interning at FAANG this summer and I literally have the rest of my life set up for me (because of insanely high FAANG salaries). Obviously the future isn\u2019t guaranteed but i\u2019m in a fantastic situation regardless with FAANG on my resume. If internship talk was in a megathread or wasn\u2019t allowed, I would have never been able to do this. \n\nAs a kid from a low income household, I don\u2019t get many opportunities to learn this much valuable information for free. I don\u2019t want future CS Majors to miss out on the opportunity to learn that I got from this subreddit. It might get stale if you\u2019ve been in the sub for a while, but that\u2019s just because there is only so much you can discuss before it can get repetitive.\n\nWhatever happens next doesn\u2019t affect me at all because i\u2019ve already gotten out what I needed to know, but I hope for the sake of future students that internship posts aren\u2019t limited.",

My uni never talks about faang (since they're outside of our country (not the US)) and these subs helped me know what I needed to prepare for, and that I could try my chance in the right way. Now I'm trying to prepare my friends at my uni to be as aware of the process. These subs rock!",

            "Bro. I literally went from a philosophy major to a Big N intern in 8 months because of this subreddit. I\u2019m legit on it everyday sometimes and yes, it\u2019s not healthy but I feel like a lot of people, including me, can testify to this subreddit being a great resource for career advice and just getting good perspective overall on what one needs when trying to grind up that tech corporate ladder. Obviously there are downsides and the cutthroat nature of the tech world has been influencing this sub and giving people anxiety, but idk... I personally kinda thrive on that. People are obviously on different. I think the main thing is most people are on this sub for internship and career grinding. Cs projects and other school stuff is cool but the biggest question mark in our lives as a student is where are we going to end up in 4 years. Not rlly like is this class a good class?? Just my 2 cents",

            "Agree wholeheartedly. This sub helped me so much even as a freshman learning about how to apply, where to apply, and tips and stuff for getting better at interviews. This sub would be so dry if these types of posts were hidden. No one can really ask about classes since they are so school-dependent, questions about laptops and projects are really the only thing that makes sense to talk about besides internships. Internships are literally the sole and blood of the cs major. Obviously getting one isn't everything, but real-world practical experience is why people love CS. These posts, while may a tad bit annoying, should stay as they serve to benefit the sub and help bring new people in.",

            "Internships have typically been for the privileged that can afford to work for free, who went to a good school, have connections through their parents friends, etc. but it's slowly changing. I think it's illegal to work for free as an intern in some states (CA). Most states offer at least a stipend to cover your travel expenses, etc.",

            "Internships are still what make college going to in this day and age. Other majors couldn't even dream about how much the internships in this industry pays as they run coffee for no money. \n\nIt's also what separate us from IT majors, who graduate still thinking internships are just that. Even worse, Cybersecurity students think their majors alone will let them skip years of grunt work and go straight to cyber security jobs right off the bat, which doesn't happen. Those who graduated with no internships are now angrily working at help desk for $19/hr and venting on places like r/talesfromtechsupport. And despite them learning much more practical things in their curriculum, we are still highly preferred across big tech and even for their jobs. This is the reason that we have such a huge internship culture, and they don't. \n\nSo those who are keeping that alive here, you're doing the Lord's work. It's gonna hurt some feelings, but that's life; and this is a competitive field. For everyone dozen or so who feels some type of way about this topic, there are folks like OP who's gotten their big break. Jealousy is not a good look on anyone, so just ignore the haters.",
