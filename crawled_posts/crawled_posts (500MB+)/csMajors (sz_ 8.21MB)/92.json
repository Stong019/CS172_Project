            "Yeah lol, I had an internship that paid $11/hour and the interview (there was just one single interview) was literally just Fizzbuzz and a couple of basic Java questions. The guy interviewing me seemed to know that beggars can't be choosers. After I answered everything correctly, he gave me a tour of the office and all but offered me the job on the spot. It was actually a really positive internship experience. Everyone was really nice and they were genuinely invested in my learning and growing. You'd expect a place that underpays employees to be extremely toxic, but they were just severely underfunded and couldn't afford more. \n\nI think you can differentiate between toxic and non-toxic places like this. If they pay shitty but are self-aware about it, you're likely to have a better experience. The person you report to as an intern is unlikely to have anything to do with salaries, anyway.",

As a decent engineer, you can get to a similar figure (~300k+) given some extra time, but you get a consistent salary every single month, can completely switch off outside your work hours and probably enjoy some really cool benefits or lucrative stock options.",

But he didn't make 6 figures, it is very difficult. I got really invested in learning off the top sellers and when I found out they were just socially engineering people into buying what they don't need, I lost a lot of fire I had from YouTube videos being like, \"find win/win solutions, sell the solutions to people's problems\". If you can turn off your conscious, be charming and call people 10hrs a day you'll make money. And most people you call, don't want to hear from you. Even if you can actually help them, they'll still cuss you out. I didn't like it as a career. Maybe if I sold a better product I'd change my mind on it.",

If you still won't take my advice, you're just on here to complain.\n\nSo many CS majors don't have communication skills to explain their thinking while they code. You have to realize what your interviewer is thinking and adjust your communication appropriately.\n\nIllustrate your approach. Don't just solve the question:\n- ask clarification first to show you're thinking about edge cases\n- say what the brute force solution is to show you thought about other approaches and not just coding the first solution that comes to mind\n- explain what the optimal solution is before you start coding so it's easier for the interviewer to follow along.\n\nIf you can't solve it optimally, say that you KNOW it's not optimal and say what your guess is for an optimal solution approach.\n\nI've passed interviews without coding the optimal solution (LC hard, Google). I've failed interviews even thought my code was flawless (LC medium, Duolingo).\n\n\n\nFor the record, it's not \"luck\" I got into Google, Amazon, and FB. It's hard work, practice, and more side projects with different groups of friends than I can count. Make some friends instead of sitting at home all day.\n\nIn response to the post about school name recognition, I go to the University of Maryland. Smart, hard workers everywhere get into FAANG. The ones that don't work hard at ivies don't get in to FAANG. The dropout rate at ivy leagues is around the same as state schools because not-hard workers are everywhere, just like how smart hard workers are everywhere. Don't discount yourself :)\n\n\nEDIT:\nSome of y'all still aren't getting it. I'm not saying there isn't any luck involved, but \"getting unlucky\" is a rare occasion. After a long aggregate list of interviews, \"unlucky\" is not as commons as you might think. Here is where I've had technical interviews with:\nGoogle, FB, Amazon, Microsoft, Snapchat, Adobe, Salesforce, Morgan Stanley, Duolingo, IBM, Capital One, Target, Nordstrom Rack, Fannie Mae, Discover Credit, Leidos, NSA, + a number of startups",

If you have passed with brute force on all your rounds consider yourself lucky on those days. You haven't seen what others face then and are concluding based on your interviews. Anyways you do what you think is correct and I wish you all the best. The only way you can pass interviews today, is if you can code the solutions optimally and have a good background.

            "I did competitive programming in high school after picking up programming in middle school. There are a lot of smaller competitions that middle/high schoolers can do to get engaged in programming. I started programming in middle school (officially) while creating a cool game for a state/national competition called TSA.\n\nI started with fundamentals and worked my way up during middle school, and got good enough in hs. It does take awhile, and cp in hs is kinda toxic, but cs fundamentals like OOP and data structures aren't insanely difficult to master, even for college students who had no prior experience. After that, it's just practice and understanding of algorithms. Understanding what cases and data structures are applicable.\n\nDo you need to track indices? Hashmaps or pointers are efficient (albeit pointers are better in most cp cases). Need to solve a graph/tree/LL problem? You should be able to at least be able to traverse them, then write cases for them.\n\nJust as it takes college students years to master, it took me almost 5 years to be even competent enough to compete in things like Hack the Interview, and even longer for IOI. It's just practice and time, it doesn't matter when you get started, as long as you get started. Fuck people who are elitist about starting early and put people down for not doing so. It takes time and practice regardless.",

We had to build our own computers and solve lots of hardware issues on our own. We learned Fortran, Pascal (Modula 2), assembler / machine code (in multiple CPUs), etc. As I have grown in the industry and learned about every syntax in every language, I am surprised that many CS graduates do not go through the process of learning about the underpinnings of the systems they code on beyond theory. I am not saying that they make for bad employees, but there is an advantage to being a good software dev guy that understands memory management before there was garbage collection at a very detailed level. These guys figure out how to fix anything, they just hide in the shadows because they do not want to be bothered, have already made their money through two major tech explosions and would just rather pay someone else to solve problems now.",

That's what annoys me the most about this stereotype.  \n  \nIn my mind, it's very similar to the asian stereotype where, if an asian kid is good in school, it's natural, their effort aren't rewarded in any way. However if the kid is at the same level as their peer, they're considered \"bad\" when they're really just normal",

I remember when I failed the msft explore interview and the Amazon  SDE intern interview I was depressed as a sophomore. I managed to pass the Microsoft interview the next year. I also have always failed the Amazon final interview lol. \n\nIt's not the end of the world if you can't land one of these top internships or new grad positions. \n\nMultiple people have personally told me that this subreddit/cscq/blind is damaging their mental health seeing people achieve what they cant but desperately want.\n\nNews flash, even if you do no projects and just barely graduate you will find a job even if it's a crappy one. I know a guy who can barely code who got a job out of college for 80k. He can't even do a leetcode easy.\n\nOnce you get 2 to 3 years of experience at any company you can apply for SDE 2 roles at FAANG which there are way more of than intern or sde 1. I know a guy who finished his degree at 28 years old at a crappy college worked at a no-name crappy company for 2 years and now is a L3 at Google. \n\nYou can interview for SDE 2 and they might downlevel to sde 1 but you will still make it into FAANG. College isn't your only chance to do it. Some kids in college have told me they have depression seeing their friends get these internships. Never become depressed about this. \n\nYou are probably not even 21 yet and you have 30 to 40 years ahead of you to work and make money. If you can't get into FAANG at 20 you'll have hundreds of opportunities to get in at 22,23,24... Etc\n\nThe fact that you're doing computer science and going to college puts you at a better spot than 95% of people. My dad has 30 years of experience as an accountant yet my friend who barely knows how to code (he can't do leetcode easy) has the same salary as him at his first job. \n\nAnyways enjoy your college. Socialize with people and take care of your health. You're going to be grinding for another 20-30 years anyways.\n\nAlso somebody achieving one of these internships doesn't make them better than you by the way. Plenty of assholes in this industry who were not good at anything in their life except for coding/vidya that have a huge ego.",

You'll get worked to the bone for 60+ hour weeks depending on your clients and the office and you're also expected to get the CPA which opens you up for further promotion.\n\nAll of that is for starting around $60,000 entry level.\n\nObviously though this is balanced out by the fact that accounting and business coursework is way less rigorous in general. The interviews for roles are literally just 2-3 behaviorals (unless something's changed that I don't know about). The career itself is very stable, pretty hard to be out of work if you didn't burn every bridge and did spend time building up your knowledge base.",
