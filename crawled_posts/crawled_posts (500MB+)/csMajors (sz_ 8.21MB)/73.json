        "selftext": "I really feel like you can do anything as a CS major, and although my story isn't standard I think there's some value in it.\n\nI went to a business school for a semester fall of 2020 and hated it. I had never written a line of code but I happen to learn the absolute bare bones of python in one of my business classes. After a semester of continuing to learn Python and researching CS/Data Science, I decided to pursue that path. My school sucked for CS, I was warned by the upperclassmen, and overall I didn't like the small school vibe so I dropped out in the second day of the spring semester.\n\nMonths with nothing on my plate, I decided to dive into projects and leetcode. Somehow I managed to get an internship at a local small tech company doing web dev (React and C# [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net)). Honestly I think the company made a mistake in hiring me, but it played in my favor and I was able to learn fast enough at the internship to keep pace.\n\nAn important note is that when covid hit a year before, I spent a lot of time reading self help books, working out, meditating, building good habits, and I think all of that was key in keeping myself disciplined and motivated to learn without a formal academic environment.\n\nFor leetcode, I read a data structures and algorithms textbook and did a problem or two a day. Easys were a struggle at first, but eventually, I got to the point of comfortably doing mediums.\n\nAlso, I am lucky to have parents that we're able to let me grind away in my bedroom rent-free for a few months. I did keep a part-time job just for some cash flow but most of my time was learning to code and making YouTube videos. That doesn't mean I wasn't reading books, rolling a TON of Jiu Jitsu (got a blue belt in this time period), and visiting my friends to party and hangout at their schools. You can grind AND have a well-rounded life.\n\nWhen internship season came this last fall I was a CS student at a large state school taking intro to CS, calc 3, linear algebra, physics, and intro to computer graphics. I applied to a ton of companies, did a few OA's, but pretty early in the process I had an interview with Amazon and I got the offer. I pretty much stopped the grind after that because classes were becoming too much to do while leetcoding heavy. I did get denied from General Motors, FaceBook, Capital One, and a couple other's who's OAs I failed.\n\nIn January I got a Google OA months after applying and went through the interview process. I did apply with a referral from someone I interviewed on my YouTube channel.  I got in. After only intro to computer science which I hadn't even finished when I applied.\n\nThere is a lot of luck in this story with the good parents, local internship, and other little things, but I want the moral of the story to be if you really grind anything it is possible. I think that the luck sped up the timeline, but that so long as I grinded it out I would have been able to make it eventually.\n\nSo thats (in very broad strokes) how I went from 0 lines of code to Google in a year (and a half-ish). I am picking Google over Amazon. The offer expired while I was in project search so that was nerve breaking.\n\nAsk me anything.\n\nThe DSA book was Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich.",

I have been practicing leetcode for few hours everyday for past 3 months and it really works guys as long as you are consistent! \n\n\n* Bio: Grad student at a state school, 1 IT internship experience and 1 SWE internship experience at unknown companies.\n\n* Offer Details:\n\n    * Salary: $9350 per month pre tax (NYC total income tax will be like 33% lmao)\n\n    * Rent Stipend: $2425 per month after tax\n\n    * Location: NYC\n\n\n\n\n**I was not in US during interview process but this is the timeline in eastern time:**\n\nFriday, July 16, 2:16AM - submitted application\n\nThursday, July 22, 4:09PM - got invited to 2 part OA (not 3 parts with debugging)\n\nMonday, July 26, 5:42 AM - finished part 1 and part 2 of OA \n\nFriday, July 30, 2:52 AM - final interview scheduling invite\n\nWednesday, August 4, 2:19 PM - Another final interview scheduling invite lol\n\nThursday, August 5, 2:28 PM - final interview time confirmation\n\nMonday, August 9, 4:00 PM - final interview\n\nWednesday, August 11, 3:00 PM - portal update to new location\n\nThursday, August 12, 2:38 PM - offer letter!\n\n\n**Detailed explanation of interview process and prep:**\n\n* Part 1 of OA was hacker rank coding assessment. I got full test cases for first problem, and half the test cases for second problem. In part 2 work simulation, I tried to answer every question using leadership principles. For example they repeatedly asked would I push the deadline to fully finish a project or would I finish the core parts by deadline. I always answered finish it by deadline because Amazon has notorious culture of tight deadlines.\n\n* I got invited to schedule the interview on 7/30 and I selected the 8/2 monday and 8/3 tuesday timeslots. They didn't even confirm my interview selection and did not reply to me at all. After 8/3 passed, they finally got back to me on 8/4 wednesday and asked me to select new timeslots! \n\n* 2 years ago I made it to final round of amazon as well and I crammed like 50 most frequent Amazon questions on leetcode. They asked me an objected oriented design question which is so different from a normal leetcode algorithm question, I bombed it lol. Apparently the question they asked me was 70th most frequent amazon tagged question on leetcode so I almost got to it during my cram session \ud83d\udc80\n\n* This year for prep I didn't do any Amazon tagged questions because I am also preparing for interviews with other companies. Past 3 months I did around 150 leetcode problems (mostly medium and some hard) in a depth first manner. Meaning I would do 10 two pointer questions, then 10 bfs questions, then 10 topological sort questions, etc. You want your brain to understand each pattern well and only focus on mastering that one pattern. Don't move back and forth between 20 different problem types. As bruce lee said, \"I fear a man who practiced one punch 100 times more than a man who practiced 100 different punches once. \" \n\n* My tip for doing leetcode: After doing a problem delete the whole code and code it again. Write down what mistake you made and what key thing you learned for each problem in a notebook. When you do a new leetcode problem, code it again from scratch the next day and one week from that day. Reviewing is probably more important than doing a new problem. \n\n* My tip for behavioral: Come up with 1-2 example per leadership principle and in your answer use STAR format. Also drop in some leadership principle words without making it obvious for example say \"I wanted to **satisfy the customer**\" or \"I took **ownership** of the project.\" \n\n**My tips for coding interview:**\n\n1. First ask questions to clarify everything like is there a null input, negative numbers, are we returning the length of an array or the actual array?, etc. \n\n2. Write down on the board or screen how you would do an example manually using pseudocode or plain english. \n\n3. Optimize pseudocode and explain time and space complexity.\n\n4. Only at the very end, code your solution and test it using examples.\n\nedit. \n\n**I forgot the most important coding interview tip: Communicate!! During the entire coding question round, talk slowly and clearly. Never be silent for more than few seconds. Let the interviewer know everything you are thinking. Even if you are writing \"x = x+1\" say it out loud and explain why you are adding 1 to x.**",

            "Yes. I still see quite a lot of internship opportunities available. For companies, this is the best approach to take since interns are temporary so there's not much risk. When/if the economy recovers to a level for expanding HC by next fall, they can always extend return offers for those interns. For new grads, it's much trickier since financing a FTE is much much more riskier for companies. It is sad to be a 2023 CS grad (but probably still better than 2001 CS grad xD).",

            "Yeah\u2026My return offer was delayed, but I eventually got it. The amount of return offers that my company gave out ended up being lower than they projected when I accepted the internship though (I asked).
