It\u2019s a small and new school so we don\u2019t appear in a lot of rankings despite comparable institutions being there.

Response rate is about 20% including rejections, and about 2% non-rejection responses. Also have been working with school\u2019s career center to make sure my application materials are good (not for every application but spot checks). \n\nI agree with what another commenter said, most of the new grad things require graduating Fa23 or Sp24. I\u2019ve been writing to anyone I can when applying for these jobs explaining that I was unable to apply previously due to an accident and so far have had no success. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing something wrong or if it\u2019s the market, but it\u2019s been rough.

Yet, I wouldn't mind working on side projects in the meantime to build more on my portfolio of projects; however, capitalism exists and that's something I can't afford to do. People have bills man. To exist in this world, you gotta work. That's capitalism 101. Nothing's free. I don't have time to build a robust piece of software and have it in the app store, pay all my bills, and conduct my job search. That's why I invested time to attend a university to get my bachelor's of science!\n\nShit... I got student loans that I have to pay for that are coming up and some of these companies are still asking for five - six multiple round interviews. Don't get me wrong, I know what I signed up for, yet there's a radical idea in the back of my mind that is stating that things would be a lot more straightforward if capitalism didn't come knocking on the door once a month. This is the world we live in and until a major change is made, it is what it is. Nobody cares, work harder.",

            "Graudated DEC22 with a BS in CS. 3.7 gpa overall. Not from a T20, but we have a lot of companies inputting what our curriculum should revolve around. (intel, aws  techtronics and others). Feels like a competent CS Prog. \n\nI had 2 internships, multiple extracurricular activities (student orgs), I was a CS tutor/tutor coordinator within the engineering college, I did 5 years in the mil, and sent around 90ish applications. Response rate was around 11%ish. Pretty low. I still have applications in review status from OCT22. That is still currently true.\n\nStarted job search at the beginning of SEPT22, and I didn't get a full-time position until JUN23. I'm glad the search is over tbh. It felt more like luck was the thing that helped me because the full-time position wasn't offered at first. I had to do contract work at the same org before getting offered a ft position - they hired 2 for the same position but gave the full-time to the other \"qualified\" person. The other person couldn't hack it and ended up resigning (resulting in me getting his jira ticket). Later, it was explained that on paper, he had more FTE and that it was a formula that led to him being hired. Obviously, per my current mgr, I had more intangibles on paper and presented a more curious perspective along with being a potential leader (self-sufficient). He [mgr] had reservations about the ft hiree, but a few on the hiring committee sought the other person more so.\n\nI'm trying not to bash the other person they hired initially or be passive-aggressive. I actually tried to help them out and help them push through. He actually did not like the position to begin with. These are words from the other person who was hired for the full-time position.\n\nReason I explained that was because I feel like resume workshops matter must less because someone could easily spin up a functional resume (without concrete dates) and yet, they could not effectively git rebase and merge their feat branch. Networking can help, too. I got referrals from friends, but for instance, I didn't want to go through what felt like a 2 month process with several interviews to only be disappointed... Epic Systems\n\n\nHopefully, this time, like in the dotcom bubble, hiring woes will reside, and hiring folks actually take the time to vet more candidates vs. sitting on resumes. Idk the remedy, tbh, other than purely persisting for what you want and having a flow income to weather this economy.",

Sallery was 48k plus bonuses so around 54k. Typical salary for Juniors in Germany. Ended up leaving that company 1 month ago though.\n\nWhile working at the first company I sent out 3 applications to other companies refocusing on FPGA development.

New salary increased to 54k plus bonuses and a raise to 60k plus bonuses as soon as my onboarding is completed.\n\nFrom this experience I'd assume that either our market here is the opposite from yours in America and we are way more in desperate need for qualified computer engineers or there's something wrong with the applications ppl send who also post here that they can't get a job.\n\nTo answer your question: it's been a cake walk for me.",

Some people will tell you you'll be fine and not to worry. Truth is somewhere in the middle - it's both market dependent and literally just whether that one offer works out. \n\n\nThat said, 2 important things imo:\n\n1) Not everyone is leetcoding 24/7, this subreddit is a very skewed sample. Further, I highly doubt everyone's stats are as impressive as they say in every single post, it's like asking guys what their dick size is and expecting accurate data to be self-reported lol. \n\n2) Like everyone will tell you repeatedly, networking is huge, and you never know where you'll find it. Go work part time jobs, join clubs, volunteer, fuck around with friends and meet new people, you never know who will have a friend of a friend in the right company.

They are struggling because it's not in a city that everyone immediately wants to move to (Phoenix).\n\nMore anecdotal evidence: A company that a friend works for has been hiring like crazy, even fresh graduates. \"Downside\" is that it's in defense and requires clearance. Pay is 80-100k with signing bonuses ranging from 5-10k, including relocation. They are struggling to find people partly due to people not wanting to work in the sector.\n\nPeople need to stop looking at the obvious companies for work.

I keep thinking that this is a big joke or something because why would any company, much less Amazon, want to hire me?

I had two behavioral questions and one coding. The coding one was a leetcode medium dynamic programming, and I'd never tried to solve it before but it was straightforward. I also didn't do the final interview coding perfect on the first try, my interviewer gave me some criticism which I used to improve my answer. I had 5/7 on OA1 and 1.5/2 on OA2 (half testcases passed for the last question).\n\nThe position said Seattle, I requested Bay Area, and I ended up getting DC Metro Area. I had no referral / recruiter, I just cold applied.\n\nAlso for anyone who's interned at Amazon, do I need to do anything to get a background check or is that process automatic?",

For the extreme version of this, see https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition , which of course takes it to an extreme, but a lot of Java code kind of feels like that.",

However it\u2019s unfair comparison, since Python is a different category language.\nSo when you don\u2019t need double digit micros, Java is a go to.\n\nPython is older than Java.

Until academia picked it up (due to its easiness and syntax sugar), and build up ungodly amount of math and research libraries.\n\nEverything has its use.

I don't know whether this is due to negligence or the preverse incentive that writing hard-to-understand code makes the company more reliant on you to maintain the codebase.\n\nOn the topic of Java, I really like the language and with some recent additions like virtual threads I am seriously wondering what even is the point of languages like Go.

            " I can't begin to understand how you say more verbosity is better. I hope you work for Oracle. Java is bloated, verbose, and slow. It's based on the philosophy that Object Oriented Programming is the correct approach for any programming problem which is obviously ridiculous. C++ has every possible thing you'd want from the object oriented side of Java + Speed + the option to do procedural programming which is probably the best approach for most problems anyway. And, for those of you who are going to complain about pointers and segfaults, cpp reference is free and available online read it carefully. If you need pointers to understand pointers, just sign up for a class and learn. And for those of you who say, \"i sHoUldNt hAvE tO wOrRy aBoUT tHat\", I will have you know at the end of the day, under the hood that's whats going on. Most complaints about C++ come down to one thing: SKILL ISSUE. Get better and learn the only high level programming language that trusts the programmer with full access to their resources.",
