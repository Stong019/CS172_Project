Stress can take a huge burden on your mental health especially when you are dealing with school and job hunting at once. Also, don't compare yourself to your peers. I know it sucks to hear your friends or people you know get return offers from their internships and make 100k salary or whatever and if you compare yourself to them, you will feel like complete crap and distracts you from accomplishing your goals. Also, don't go on Linkedin unless for good reasons like networking or job hunting because it can also feels discouraging when you see posts with your peers announcing job offers when you have nothing at the moment. Always keep your head up, keep working hard, and stay focused. At the end of the day, I truly believe you can get to where you need to be if you put in the work and focus. It may take longer for some but just play your own game.",

            "The name of the school, maybe. The connections, hiring pipelines, and cultural drive to get good internships and new grad positions of top schools is what really makes the difference.",

            "I do see people from no name schools at top tech companies. For sure it's less though. In top tier non faang like linkedin I do see more non ivies. \n\nThe question is: are ivy league grads getting these positions because they went to a better school or because they are better candidates?\n\nOutside of the 8 ivy league and a few choice schools I doubt it makes a difference. I'm not in faang, but I know when I'm reading resumes I'm not looking up your school's ranking. If it's not in ivy league or like Carnegie Mellon, I'm not even going to know if the school is good or not.",
            "Oh it definitely does. Going to a Top 50 college matters a lot especially if you want to be able to relocate.",

            "Or those students tend to also be more motivated and definitely more motivated by \u201cprestige\u201d. I work at a faang and yes there are a lot of grads from top schools but there are also grads from schools I\u2019ve never heard of before. It can matter if you use it right but it can also not. It matters less than you would think honestly",
            "The right perspective is this:\n\nOver the course of a 30+ year career, your lifetime earnings, highest ranking job title, and working environment are very weakly predicted by the school you attend.\n\nFor the first job (2-5 years, usually), your school gives you the network and the brand recognition to get more interviews. Notably, doing horribly in a top school won't get you interviews. I knew lots of CS undergrads at Duke who couldn't get interviews and bombed them, graduating with 0 offers.\n\nFor the next job, your first job gives you the skills and experience you will be leveraging to get your next offer. Companies want to see that you graduated from a school and took programming classes, but will take the best employee who can code well, regardless of school name. Technical interviews are actually a boon in this regard, since they can separate a lousy coder who attended MIT from a great coder who attended a school no one's heard of.\n\nAfter that, the fact that you graduated only kind of matters. A self-taught superstar programmer who makes it 6-10 years in the industry has skills that speak for themselves. I know many incredible, $150k + salary mid and senior devs who never set foot in a top tier school. Any competent programmer that has grown to mid or senior level is so dramatically more valuable than a new grad that educational history is more for a background check than anything else.\n\nNow, a student who is a mediocre programmer with middling grades and poor technical interview skills will get more shots at interviews than a good programmer from a school with less renown. But school name stops mattering very quickly.",
            "It matters but not in accordance to us news. I think Carnegie Mellon and Georgia tech mean more than a place like WashU where I did my undergrad",
            "It *might* help you get into a pipeline to get your first internships and jobs.  However, what people don't know is that companies have pipelines into all sorts of colleges and not just the top ones. They like the diversity, and have found great talent everywhere.  It *might* provide a richer experience with more clubs, undergrad research etc.  That assumes you take full advantage of them.  And if you graduated from one of the very top schools *and also are a rock star*, some people might give you some added cred along the way.  In some silly ways it might still be used, \"this is Tom our VP of Engineering, I think he went to MIT as well...\"  Oh, bias for PhD programs is still a thing so if you are thinking about that path prestige is still important.        \n\nBeyond that and 1-2 jobs, **any added benefit all goes away so that is also true too**.  \n\nEveryone has their own story to tell on why it does or doesn't matter which are anecdotal.   \n\nRankings are argued about, but maybe no more so than Forbes' most recent one.  Still worth looking at since they tried to cover this question with a larger datasets.  And yes, on average, graduating from certain CS schools pay out more.  So if you trust their data sources, then the answer from a statistical standpoint would be, yes it does matter.  In some cases, a lot.      \n\nThe problem with this is that no one is the \"average\".  If you suck at a great school, you still suck.  If you rock at a great school, you rock.  If you rock a*t a less than great school*, you also rock.",
            "There was a study that showed that people who got accepted to Harvard and didn't go had the same incomes etc as people who did go. \n\nPeople in CS subs are something else, constantly consumed by self-pity and a masochistic need to think that everything wrong with your life is out of your control. You can keep convincing yourself that there's no point in trying because of this random reason, but even if you had been accepted into Harvard or Stanford, you would have found yet another reason why you shouldn't try hard because it's all stacked against you anyway.",

            "I mean so much research shows the biggest predictor of success is where you place in your class not what school you went to. I would wager if you went to a ivy and drowned vs went to a stay school and excelled you'll likely be better out of state.\n\nThere is also a survivorship bias. There are lots of CS students that switch degrees in a ivy out of STEM who may have graduated with STEM if they were in a state school.\n\nAt the end of the day its important for internships and entry level and if you plan on your school being the best thing on your resume\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nEdit: classic gladwell talk on this https://youtu.be/7J-wCHDJYmo?si=bebhAGgPlOuV1CrP",

            "From my personal experience, it depends. I think in the US and Canada first school might not matter for really large companies as a swe since they have to filter out 99% of the applicants based on very arbritary and set rules. It will give you an advantage in some companies that pay well on your first job. Barely anyone asks about your degree after your first year of working and no one has asked me about my degree and I only have about 3 and a half years of experience.",
