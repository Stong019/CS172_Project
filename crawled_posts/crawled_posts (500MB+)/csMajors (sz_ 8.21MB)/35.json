            "Really depends on the school. Career fairs are known to be bad at my school since there\u2019s too many people that go. The recruiters are in a rush because of the long lines and end up chucking our email addresses into their data banks and never reaching out again.\n\nThere was a recruiter that even said I\u2019m exactly the person they were looking for for their new grad position. That my background really puts an edge over other applications. Never heard from him again\u2026",
            "People really do underestimate their career fairs. Both of my internships came from meeting people from the company, then applying.",

            "what school do you go to",
            "Not in my experience. Careers fairs have led me nowhere. I\u2019ve handed my physical resume, applied online, messaged recruiters using the email they gave me during our conversation, connected with them on Linkedin, etc. Not a single response. \n\nI guess it definitely depends on what school you go to and its reputation with employers, so I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m surprised since I go to a university primarily known for its business program. Nonetheless, It would be nice to receive a response from those in person/online applications even if it is a rejection.",
            "What was your resume like any projects?",
            "When I was in undergrad I told myself that I wasn't allowed to leave the career fair until I talked to 10 companies, and brought 10 copies of my resume. After 6 or 7 I was feeling extremely spent and almost left but forced myself to stick it out. 9th table I went to I ended up hitting it off with one of the developer reps that they had sent and we just nerded about Ruby. She put my resume into a short stack which got me an interview which lead to an internship and fulltime offer after the summer internship. Got to go into senior year with a job lined up. Previously I had applied online to dozens of places and only gotten like 3 interviews as I had no prior internships and only middling GPA. That job led me to get a variety of connections which have driven all my career hops since. Also made some friendships from that internship that have lasted for a decade now.\n\nTLDR: go to the career fair, be pleasant and humble, try to make connections, it can change your life.",
            "Depending on school, my school career fair is subpar and lacks companies that hire software engineers, especially for internship positions and career fair is held little bit late compared to recruiting season.\nToo many students but they always say apply online anyway, some companies take resume but often it's just for formality.",
            "I went to SWE career fair in 2021 and got called to interview for everywhere I went. Granted I had FAANG internship on my resume. But my friends without any prior experience also got offers while they couldnt even get a coding challenge before.\n\nI get that it is a different time now. Even SWE recently got bombarded with many students but it is still better than online.",

            "Career fairs are great! When I was a student I always looked forward to them, so many opportunities that I would\u2019ve never even know about otherwise!",
            "They are most definitely worth it. I can\u2019t stress this enough. I got TWO offers from a career fair last week. Had a simple interview for one. The other was a slightly more difficult technical interview. I got moved to the final phases for both. Got offers from both. \n\nOver half the companies told me to apply online, but the ones that did allow me to connect with them were very kind and took my resume. \n\nI took the offer I had received the same week (which was last week) as the other offers that I applied for online instead. They pay was a little bit less but the work seemed more interesting. \n\nNonetheless, always go to your career fair. If you\u2019re worried you won\u2019t get much from the career fair, you are wrong. Work on projects, network, and attend the career fair.",

You might be asking yourself, what do I do now? \n\n\n\nNo need to worry. Here are 5 tips for things you should be doing post internship.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tip 1.** Add your team and fellow interns on LinkedIn\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is the single most important thing you can do for your career. Why is this so you might ask. Well did you know that by getting referred you are 4x more likely to be hired? How do you get referrals? By having a strong network and there are no better people to add to your network than those that have worked with you.\n\nThis is especially true for those that may not have received a return offer. If you are in this category, leveraging your network can lead to a direct referral to your next role.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tip 2.** Ask for recommendation on LinkedIn\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHave a colleague that enjoyed working with you? Ask them for a [recommendation](https://lisamariediasdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/13-1280x720.png) on your LinkedIn! If they give you one, be sure to return the favor and give them one  as well.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tip 3.** Write down the specific things that you did during your internship.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReally this should be done during your internship pretty much right after you complete something. If you didnt do so, its ok you can do it now. By writing down what you specifically did, you will have no issues when adding your internship experience to your resume. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Tip 4.** Send thank you emails to the people that helped you\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLeave a positive and lasting impression on those that helped you before and during your internship. From the recruiter that contacted, to your manager, mentor, and VP if you had one. Writing a simple email letting them know of your experience and how thankful you are may be what helps you get a return offer.\n\nIf you want to take it over the top, you can write a thank you note and leave it on their desk (if you are not remote).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Tip 5.** Ask for feedback and next steps\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen your internship is over be sure to ask for feedback from those who worked closest to you which could include your manager, mentor, or fellow devs. This is another one of those tips that you can periodically do during your internship, but if you did not get a chance the end is good too.\n\n\nWhen asking for feedback you can ask some or all of the following?\n\n- Did I meet or not meet the expectations for the role? How could I have met them?\n- If I were to come back to the team, what next steps would I take to get to the next level?\n- What things can I improve on?\n- What things did you like and should continue doing?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere you have it, 5 things you should do after finishing your internship. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!\n\nedit: Have a topic youd like for me to cover?

CS students with a good grasp of basic DS & A but find leetcode terrifying or difficult.\n\n**What's the target?** The goal is not to master all the hardest problems, rather to accurately code for medium-level (sometimes popular hards) questions in 20 mins + 5 mins explaining. Code should be easy to read, explain and debug.\n\n**Language:** I would recommend choosing Python along with one of C++/Java. Debugging, explaining, coding are much faster in Python. That means you will learn much faster. Sometimes Python is not available so you can fall back to C++/Java\n\n**When to start leetcode:** Starting leetcode without any background in DSA is like jumping into a wall of frustration. I would recommend you at minimum get a grasp of the following :\n\nArray: Searching, Sorting\n\nLinkedList, Ordered and Unordered Sets and Trees: Traversal, Add, Remove\n\nTrees: BST, DFS, BFS,\n\nGraph: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path\n\n**How to build intuition? :** Tbh it's hard to have intuition at the start, so one thing you could do after reading the problem is to fix the data structure and then think about algo. It doesn't work always but it's a good approach without any experience.\n\n**How to prepare? :** My recommendation is to prepare in 2 alternating sessions, let's call them depth and breadth sessions.\n\n1. **Depth sessions** focus on areas you are already familiar with (new problems from known topics). It will be timed to 1 hour and within that hour you will have to code, debug and explain your thought process aloud for all the problems you have assigned yourself. Don't see hints or solutions within this period.\n2. **Breadth Sessions** just pick a random problem (preferable medium and hard from an unfamiliar topic) and think about it deeply. The challenge is not the coding but the thought process. Give yourself a lot of time, if you think you are stuck unlock a hint or the expected time complexity. Then try again.\n\nI used to do 1 breadth session daily. I started with 2 meds in 75 mins, then went to 1 med 1 hard, and now I can pull off 2 hards in an hour. Pace yourself as you find suitable. I used to competitively do depth sessions with a friend. Remember to keep 5 mins to explain the thought process aloud as if you are in the interview.\n\nFor breadth read the problem and take your time, I usually gave myself 1 day to solve it.\n\n**Filling the gaps:** let's assume you have made good progress and can solve most problems but there are a few rare ones that you haven't seen and might trick you. Now go through the first 400 LC, that you have not solved already.\n\nIt took me about 2 months to reach this stage.\n\n**Revising Before Interviews:** Do LC tagged questions for that company.\n\n**How to conduct yourself in an interview:**\n\nInitially explain a few lines on what you want to do.\n\nWhile coding explain each block of code as you type. Don't go into details but give a high-level idea, so the interviewer can understand your intentions.\n\nOnce your code is completed immediately test it (dry run or use compiler) before the interviewer intervenes. If errors come after he/she takes over it counts as a negative. Find errors on your own.\n\nOnce the interviewer is satisfied with the solution, go ahead and state its time and space complexity.\n\nThis approach worked for me pretty well and I hardly ever miss an OA or interview question. Hope this approach works for you too.\n\n**Update:** A lot of the comments say that what I am describing is too difficult to attain or impossible. Well to be frank this is my third shot at interview prep. I had done the same stuff in my junior, final year, and now doing it again as a master's student.\n\nFurther, I come from an education system where solving questions is 100% of what matters in getting a job, apart from your university. Resumes, projects, etc matter very little. So leetcode is not an option it's all you do.",

You can complain to the professor but there is a chance he'll say something stupid like: \"Come on he was just goofing around\" so be prepared to be disappointed.\n\nCongratulations on the FAANG gig! I'm a guy but I know in my company there are multiple networks and events for women by women within the company, some self-organized, some sponsored by our employer. From what I've heard, these can provide a lot of support and are a welcome change of pace to the male-majority project teams. Even when not faced with blatant sexism as in your case, it's always good to have a network of like-minded colleagues looking out for each other. \n\nThis can be a good strategy at uni (but it sounds like you've almost graduated so it might be a bit late for this) and will definitely pay off when you've started working.",

            "That's funny because my perspective has always been... Jeez it's hard to succeed as a man and all I have to do is my job. But women are expected to do the job and then also compose their appearance (clothes, makeup, physique) at a level that most men get away with ignoring in themselves.  It's like women have to navigate two roads at the same time.  Anyone who would see what's really happening and claim life is easier for women is pathologically blind to reality.",

Unlike a few people recommending you ignore them (out of fear of retaliation), I recommend that you report them and stand your ground (while also refusing to help them in the future).\n\nIgnoring them may give you temporary peace but will only embolden them to think their behavior is acceptable and consequence free. Without being held accountable now, they will just continue being people that make their female colleagues feel uncomfortable and isolated in the workplace",

His comments were way over the line and the fact that he kept going after the first shows that he\u2019s just gonna keep thinking this is okay. I\u2019m surprised none of the other guys who overheard said anything, and you definitely don\u2019t have to keep interacting with them. What the one guy said to you was extremely misogynistic and rude and the rest of them should\u2019ve said something. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you",

            "I'm so sorry.  No one deserves that kind of disrespect and harassment.  Please do not let them get away with this.

It will only make you feel miserable and powerless.\n\nSending virtual hugs your way!",
            "As a woman who studied CS and has been in the real tech world for a decade, the boys in college generally lack confidence and an identity. They don\u2019t know how to interact with women, or people in general. They lack social skills and awareness. \n\nMy suggestion is, do tell the professor but be prepared that the professor will probably do nothing. \n\nNext time, if this happens with another individual , I suggest don\u2019t laugh it off. Say, \u201cThat\u2019s a really weird thing to say publicly, I actually worked really hard for <thing>, like my male counterparts\u201d. Then get up and relocate.\n\nEdit: In the tech industry I haven\u2019t had this experience, personally. Men in the work environment generally respect women and I\u2019ve personally felt very valued. \n\nI\u2019m sure this behavior does persist into the work environment to an extent, but in the work environment, these people eventually get weeded out or lose their jobs for these comments.",

This guy is jealous of you that you know something that he does not and also you got offer from faang.\n\nPeople like him exist .\n\nyes u can report to the professor . But think if you report , then he may start showing  more inappropriate behavior towards you.  Even outside the college , who knows.\n\nFirst of all, avoid him . Donot talk with him. Even you come face to face  with him, think of him just a stranger.",
            "In my experience, there\u2019s a lot of people in cs that are extremely socially stupid. They just don\u2019t understand normal social interactions and what is ok to say and not to say. Idk about math majors though. Sorry that happened to you",
            "When someone says something like that to you in front of others, calmly respond, \u201ccan you repeat that?\u201d.  They awkwardly either will repeat it, or will start backtracking.  Either way, it shines a spotlight on that statement and student.",
            "Some men are miserably beings and never got the attention they wanted.\n\nWhile yes, you can report them, they might be even worse to you in and off campus.\n\nI would laugh it off, ignore them and think about how miserable they have to be to say stuff like that.\n\nAnd of course not help them with their problems in the future.",

            "Reporting to the authorities doesn\u2019t work anymore. You should have told him: \u2018why do you ask? You want a job that desperately? I don\u2019t think even you sucking someone\u2019s d would help you get a job. You need at least half a brain\u2019.",
            "It could be a dickhead kid, or you are in the friend banter zone (i have asked male friends whos dick they sucked when they get jobs). Does he talk like this to his buddies? If it is focused on you I would complain, or just not help them anymore",

            "1. Sorry you experienced that. Even if you don\u2019t report them, try to distance yourself cuz u don\u2019t need people like that in your life.\n2. I\u2019ve been noticing this as a trend now a days \u2026 a problem with aggressively DEI-ing and affirmative action is that the role\u2019s value drops.

Sadly, certain people find it easier to think others have an unfair advantage rather than acknowledging they\u2019re not very good. \nBy any means, report it if you think it\u2019s useful. But no matter how uncomfortable it might be, also learn to push back. Next time someone makes a joke you don\u2019t like at your expenses, don\u2019t laugh. Ask them why would they say something like that, point out that they\u2019re being assholes for no reason, and don\u2019t be afraid of doing so in public. I found there\u2019s no need to shout or get angry, just calmly point out that you\u2019d expect a university student to be more well-informed than the average boomer",

I think it's because I don't like confrontation. It's better to stand your ground, be serious and let it be uncomfortable. \n\nPeople who behave like this will misbehave with someone else tomorrow.",

I don\u2019t really understand what you\u2019re saying can you explain what you mean.  Having to explain them selves will make them feel stupid.

            "There misogyny mixed into it especially that guy, all granted.\n\n**They reframed how they see you and their interest for you**.\n\nAt the core this is them having to recognize your success, that you are \"better\" than they are and that they have to reframe what they think of you. You also basically show that you are as interested and competent in science as they are or more.\n\nIt would happen 100% to a man if suddenly they would learn that man was rich or famous or got the same job that you got.\n\nNow that they know you have this GAFAM job, they know you are extremely smart, will have a top salary and career. They know that what you say is high value and that maybe you could even get them a job in that place through referral and even that if you were to be their partner they'd benefit of your brightness and money. In other words, you become more interesting or charismatic.\n\n**Some will be jealous for sure**\n\nSome of them are jealous. Why you that they mostly ignored until now and why not themselves ? \n\nThat's unfair that you had the audacity to succeed and not them. They will hate you for that. And if they are misoginistic, they will 100% be more outraged you managed as a woman.\n\nYou will always encounter people like that, and with time, you will understand it is better if people don't know that you are or about to be extremely saucerful and wealthy. The extra attention and jealousy will backfire more than anything else.\n\nAnd you can report to the professor, but this will just make the situation worse for everybody. If there consequences, they will resent you more and they will react even more strangely when with you. You will also create a reputation for yourself and people will avoid you.\n\nAs much as possible, ignore and avoid jerk and befriend nice people.",

Sure you report it to ur prof; however, sadly this won't be the last negative/offensive comment you might get so I'd advise you to stand up for yourself and get back to the guy let him know that you don't appreciate what he said.

            "I think you made a mistake when you laughed it off the first time, it probably made him think it's alright to behave that way and told the other guys you were cool with it. As others have said reporting this to the professor is certainly one way to go, but consider that there's not always going to be a professor to report to. In my experience,  such men(or women) take their social image too seriously,  and a simple retort like \"Wow. I can't believe you'd actually say that when I'm literally helping you out\" is enough for them to lose their composure. I'm not faulting you in any way, as a guy I can't even imagine how I'd react in such a situation. Just trying to give you a useful suggestion.",

You noticed that it has weight and alters your identity to these guys. \n\nIf you wanted you can easily use this new weight of yours to change the attitude of the one guy that was making the misogynistic comments. If you don\u2019t get that in line soon then it could just as easily spread to the other guys. \n\nAny one can change the culture of any place OP, most ppl just don\u2019t think too much about it.

But also keep in mind that this won\u2019t be ur last time dealing w fuckers like this. So what better time than now to get ur practice in",

            "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. For this situation yes you could report it to your professor but there is probably a more appropriate way to report on campus as well. I would ask your student union or student affairs.\n\nI also say this with so much compassion and know you shouldn\u2019t have to deal with these things but as a woman with a CS degree you will likely continue to run into this behavior. It will come out of the blue or when you least expect it just like this did. It may not happen for years at a time but unfortunately it will benefit you to be prepared for it. \n\nYou are going out into the world as a new graduate with a great job as an adult and you will need to start taking on your own authority. I am not trying to criticize how you responded to the situation in your post. I have been there and understand completely why you reacted that way. This is for future situations. \n\nYou will need to clearly set boundaries and shut this off in the moment when it happens because laughing it off won\u2019t make it stop. Laughing it off gives others around you a license to do the same, it condones the comment, even if someone else is bothered by it you have accepted the comment with a laugh so for them to do anything else is having a more extreme reaction that you do.\n\nYou do not need to be aggressive of confrontational in this but simply stating something\u2019s along the lines of do not make sexual comments about me or please don\u2019t make crude jokes about my career or a casual not cool or whatever you put together that fits your style. A simple general statement that doesn\u2019t repeat what they said and doesn\u2019t give them a foothold to pushback on. Practice this statement, say it out loud when alone. Get comfortable with it so when that moment comes and you\u2019re in shock from what was said you are so practiced at it that it comes out smoothly and calmly. It\u2019s going to be uncomfortable as hell. You might feel nauseated just thinking about it and at the time it will be worse. It gets easier the more you have to do it. To a lesser degree the same thing goes for saying no and setting boundaries in other ways sometimes. \n\nThis will probably make everyone just a little uncomfortable in the moment but it should because that comment wasn\u2019t ok and it shouldn\u2019t be passed over like it was. Honestly at this point you would be doing that jerk a favor as he\u2019s going to get himself fired once he\u2019s employed. This will also make that space for coworkers to be a public ally. Once the pause has passed get back to the topic at hand like it didn\u2019t happen. If it becomes a pattern escalate as needed to superiors at work or HR. \n\nThis advice is for professional group settings which includes a college classroom, especially at that level. \n\nIf you are alone and someone makes comments of that nature literally just leave. You have no idea if they are just a misogynist or something worse so I wouldn\u2019t call it out in that instance. Just saying I\u2019m going to go now is enough. Do not polite yourself into a worse situation. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t already please join some subs for women in technology and it\u2019s also good to look for women in tech professional associations or groups local to you. \n\nYou will learn when you have a supportive workplace and when you don\u2019t and what you will need to do to deal with it. \n\nBest of luck finishing out your semester and with your future job. Sounds like you have an absolutely amazing start!",
            "The most painful part to read wasn't the misogyny; it was the response to it. Laughing it off? I hope you learned your lesson; I've had similar experiences in the past and nowadays any time I'm confronted with a decision on how to react to a bad situation, the first question I ask myself is this:\n\nAre the coming months/years of mentally agonizing over my failure to stand up for myself REALLY worth being non-confrontational for these few seconds???\n\nHopefully, you're still in the same class as them. This gives you the opportunity to tell the guy what he said isn't okay. There's a 99% chance his \"friends\" are completely opposed to what he said. I am not sure why you assumed they'd side with him, especially since even YOU did not confront him and just laughed it off so it's hypocritical to say they should've done more (even though yes you all should've)",
            "You really should have stood your ground imo. If it were me in your shoes (I'm also a woman in STEM), like immediately after they made those comments, I would have just deadpan stared said something along the lines of \"that's pretty rude to say, don't talk to me like that. I don't need to suck someone's dick to get a job I'm qualified for\" and shut them down calmly with some silent confidence. Usually I stare dead straight into their eyes in silence to let what I said sink in until they start getting uncomfortable, most people usually do if they have some kind of shame. Its kind of a mind game to show them not to mess with you. (This was learned behavior from my mother so it's second nature whenever someone really pisses me off) Most of the time, I'm always just happy and helpful and also a bit of a pushover with most things.\n\n\n\n\nLaughing it off will make them think you're okay with being made fun of like this and they might actually think you're one of the \"chill girls\" who get their weird brand of misogyny that their circle of male friends are privy to, they might not even realize they're being rude because this is how they've operated for most of their life.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEdit: please stand up for yourself more, dont tolerate rude things like this. Most people are non-confrontational and will back off if you present a strong front. I think this is a soft skill you need to learn if you're going into a male dominated or high performing field in general. You don't have to yell and shout or say any bad words or call them bad names. You don't even have to engage more than you need to after saying what you needed to say once, if they backtrack and start saying more rude things to you that obviously don't make any sense in retaliation. Just don't laugh it off, nip it in the bud.",

He even said it himself how his subscribers got job offers but he was unemployed. But he ended up getting a job later. Also, remember watching his day in a life video. He has made it unlisted but I have saved it in my playlist :). Used to watch it whenever I felt like giving up. It was super wholesome. I also chat a couple of times with him on Discord and also made contributions to the neetcode solutions just to give in return. Personally, I have felt like I have grown with him.

            "Ok, I'm gonna break down my advice into 2 parts:\n\n1) You should still apply to roles. I don't mean for your dream role (maybe you have a company in mind you'd definitely wanna work for), but more like those \"safety options\". You will see what works to get an interview and what doesn't, what behavioural questions are like and how to answer them calmly and well-structured, and get some practice in how to answer technical questions, e.g., how to explain why and what you're doing while (pseudo-)coding your solutions. This is a skill that needs to be practised like any other, and the best way is during interviews you care little about. \n\n\n\n2) \"Grinding leetcode\"/hackerrank etc. is another skill in itself: How do you get the most out of it? Don't do too many problems at once. If you can easily solve one, then go on to the next. But when you get stuck, Google the question **conceptually**, i.e. \"count length of string\", \"efficient quicksort\", etc.. Do not copy-paste the question, learn to structure the problem and abstract its core concept. This is so valuable for your own skillset as well as to interview well. Once you found the solution and solved the problem successfully, summarise the concept in your own words and maybe add a couple of sentences on major takeaways. I prefer handwritten notes to myself but anything goes, from word doc to txt. The main point of this is that you do not just move on to the next problem but reflect. This ensures growth. If you do one or two problems a day it doesn't add too much to your day but you ensure growth on a daily basis. Good luck!",

            "I never leetcoded but got offers. You just have to know how to mess with loops and arrays for the most part, bonus if you remember dictionaries from python. This is not the hard ones just easy/med lc which a ton of companies ask. Know loop tracking and debugging well like setting flags etc. and just try like a couple lc problems if you suck then go learn your data structures better (no need to memorize patterns or algo)",

It's usually been some logic-oriented coding assessments rather than testing for what data structures and algorithms you have in your arsenal. Other times it's stuff like showing you know how to use Context in React or make a button do something with HTML and Javascript.\n\nFor FAANG junior sde roles leetcode is probably common. I wouldn't know because I don't apply to those.",

You don't have to know everything but you will actually have to know how to write code and come up with novel solutions yourself when you work as a programmer. You're not going to be hired to look up the solution to Leetcode problems all day.",
            "Got an internship without studying any leetcode",
            "I've never leetcoded and got a well paying internship + full time return offer (last year). If you have a good understanding of programming fundamentals, you're fine. Having a portfolio of project(s) to point at helps too, or just being able to talk about notable work you've done in school in good detail.\n\nLeetcode definitely helps you prepare for the questions themselves, but it's definitely not necessary.",
            "Just apply and at least you'll get better at the interviews slowly. Your ego will take a hit but you'll survive.",
            "Thanks for the motivation I actually did stop applying for a week or 2 cause of lost hope",
            "Not everyone can code under pressure during an interview, so if you weren't able to actually get the implementation working, it's not the end of the world, its just some extra brownie points if you do.I think what's more important is the portion before coding where you try to articulate how you plan to tackle the problem. \n\nIf the interviewer has to coerce you towards a solution or give you hints, that's where I think you might lose the most points. My understanding was that the interview was basically over at that point. They might let you continue going and do the coding portion for the sake of formality and stuff.\n\nCoding is not for everyone, might be better to consider looking into business side doing requirements/management.",
            "I highly recommend the \u201ccracking the coding interview\u201d book.",
            "You should probably apply and do Leetcode at the same time.

            "I don't even know if leetcode is necessary to succeed in that. There are plenty of stuff that you have to train on. Writing code is only one of them. \n\nThis is how you got into uni as well in the first place.",

            "A lot of big companies are indeed asking leetcodes but there are start ups and consulting firms that dont even ask leetcode.

So I'm changing careers, have a math degree, eventually completing my BSEE, but since I want to work remote, I'm concurrently completing a masters in SWE (there's reasons for the last part I'd rather not share with everyone).  So I need to knock out leetcode problems?  I counted 2950 problems after a quick search.  Some premium, and some not.  I guess since I have no industry experience and I'm going from a completely different career into engineering with hopefully a focus on the software side of things, I'm looking for a little guidance.",

            "Leetcode is a waste of time. I have been in the industry for 10 years and every job that made me leetcode for an interview wanted to lowball me every time. It\u2019s to create an illusion that the company is elite and that you should drool over working for them. I interviewed for a few FAANG companies and they wanted to pay me $40k less than the job I currently held. It\u2019s just a fad and most of the time, the leetcoders make shit engineers.",

Leetcode is helpful but not necessary.\n\n>then there is no point in applying\n\nIf you mean this literally, I disagree. Firstly, you might be overestimating what it takes to get the position.

            "you can know basic oop concepts & basic dsa & still definitely fail a bunch of OAs. i have only passed 1 OA out of the many i\u2019ve taken and it\u2019s definitely because i haven\u2019t been exposed to many similar leetcode problems. i too have mostly done easies & i can\u2019t past most OAs even with close to 100 problems completed.",

            "I was even prepared for this kind of reality during pre-pandemic hiring. My dad told me to analyze the team, the manager and the coworkers before even accepting a offer. My priority during my first year at working as a engineer was to get exposure on how a development works in a corporate setting, how to handle teammates and disagreements and how to improve myself so I can adapt to the company process sooner and start delivering sooner. As soon as I got exposed, my career goals changed and I no longer attached my goal to a company, but rather questioned where I would thrive long term. I was MAGA crazy, however that changed during the first year at work. It was a lot of work to humble myself, and to change the tune that it\u2019s okay to not work in a MAGA company, the team and the type of manager and the type of work and the value that it generates is more important than being unhappy at a MAGA company and not delivering anything of value. It\u2019s more important to save money and better others than to show you\u2019re earning too much money. \n\nTBH, I\u2019m still learning and changing my behaviors and trying to see where I will create value. I still want to earn more money, I just don\u2019t see myself doing it in a MAGA or coinbase. For me, WLB with a good pay and good insurance with a good amount of leaves is more important than being overworked and burned out like my friend is in Google. My other friend works at insurance and she makes big bucks, along with a great pay bump and additional benefits to the promotion she got this year. She loves the work after switching two teams and her manager always gives her high revenue generating projects to work on. She was smart in capitalizing on her talent with devops and really proving to her manager that she created a good value in one of her initial projects. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the company, it\u2019s about the people and how you \u201cshow\u201d your work to them.
