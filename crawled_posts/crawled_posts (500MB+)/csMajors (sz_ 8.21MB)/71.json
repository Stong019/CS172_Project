Over the past 4 years that\u2019s grown to ~$250k and I just accepted an offer going back to the original company for $293k. Once your foot is in the door with a large company it opens up a lot of opportunities that make the next steps easier and easier. My resume isn\u2019t anything spectacular, minus the company names. One page with backend experience (primarily focused on SRE-type roles)."

Lo and behold we're 3 days before the submission date and didn't even start.\n\nSo I gave her 2 of the algorithm questions and asked her to do them. I did the other 2 made sure they passed tests and started working on the game. \n\n2 days later she gives me her solution I explicitly ask her how it went and if they pass the basic tests and more advanced tests that were shared in the forum. She reassures me that she got help from someone and that it went well and passed all the tests. So I move on and continue working on the game to finish it cuz at this point it would take longer to explain to her what's I'm doing than finishing it on my own. \n\nSo I finish the game with 30 minutes away from submission and submit all the exercises including hers. (Which runs the basic tests automatically) and her solutions DONT FUCKING PASS THE BASIC ONES. \n\nI was dead tired at that point and wasn't in a state to do recursion questions but I push through and finish the first but slightly after the deadline which means it was for nothing cuz there are big penalties on late submissions. \n\nThat was so infuriating, why would she fucking LIE to me about them passing and even reassuring me that she got help so it will pass the more advanced tests.",

The extravert gets the recruiter's email, reaches out with an interesting intro, and gets a conversation started. And that's more likely to lead to an interview. Or they ask a ton of friends and even random acquaintances to put them into a ton of companies' referral systems.\n\nI've seen it in action, where extraverted people with lower GPAs, and worse technical skills get ahead of highly technical introverted people.

Good teams know how to lean on each other, resulting in a team that is greater than the sum of it's parts. This is what makes those teams so great. You can be an introvert and still learn how to be a great team member. You aren't supposed to speak incessantly, just communicate thoughts and ideas. That is what you are being paid for.",

Then there are people that are very smart but so socially awkward that they are unemployed (due to stuff like anxiety).  I fall in the socially awkward category so don't make much money (I'm not in computer science) but a lot of it literally has to do with how you interact with people.",

            "(grooming jokes aside) It's only \"helpful\" if it gives you a skill that you like. \n\nLike a Japanese minor is helpful since their are few times in your life you will get to practice learning japanese conversationally without living in Japan. A kineseollogy minor is helpful since you can become certified as a personal trainer in your free time. A teaching minor is helpful since it gets you certified to teach. \n\nIn my opinion, if you don't have a tangible skill you are seeking and you are aiming to take a few extra classes, you are better off taking graduate courses and reserving them since you could normally transfer 9-12 credits to a masters porgram or PhD later in life. It is smart since these courses will be free ( you will be charged full time tuition for 12 or 16 hours right? ) and they will dramatically reduce any burden you have should you chose to go to grad school. \n\nIf you want a minor that doesn't have a tangible skill, I'd say don't do it . You may find a minor you like better later anyways . Besides, your resume will get so full so fast after your first / second job, your minor will probably evaporate from your resume.",

            "Pick a minor in a business discipline like business administration, marketing, accounting, etc. there\u2019s a lot of good ideas here that really will come in handy if you start a business one day. \n\nYou might not think you will, but who knows? I didn\u2019t really plan to but then life happened and I was like fuck it, sure, let\u2019s give it a shot! \n\nI had a business in my early twenties, unrelated to cs or tech, and it was small online thing. I basically sold sports memorabilia on sites like eBay and Amazon and others. I didn\u2019t go to college before, I worked a lot of odd jobs, so I could reinvest time & focus into my business and keep it going when I wasn\u2019t making anything or losing money. The odd job $$ was enough to sustain. It was all really risky. And ultimately, I went negative and it got to a point where it didn\u2019t make sense to keep it going, so it failed. I learned a ton though, it was worth it.\n\nHowever, the reason why it failed is because really I just had no idea what I was doing. I thought I knew the concerns of business. I had worked for them, seemed obvious. But I didn\u2019t *run* businesses before. That\u2019s the difference. \n\nI thought it was just all practical ideas that one could observe. Like I used to do when I worked the odd jobs at businesses. And maybe they are somewhat like that, but having a little direction in terms of important concepts would\u2019ve definitely helped. I didn\u2019t have that haha. I didn\u2019t know terminology or ideas or concept of things I probably was dealing with at the time. And I also didn\u2019t know how to leverage my skills more or what skills made sense where, cause I didn\u2019t know how to code back then and wasn\u2019t actively practicing math haha. I was doing a lot of buy/sell actions like trading stocks, but with sports stuff, there\u2019s a shit ton of science & business ideas there, I had no idea haha. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to just guess and for things to work. 99% of the time they will fail. And that\u2019s why I failed, I was just guessing, empirical reasoning solely, not verifying my knowledge, not finding other ideas that were already there, etc. the task of running the business was a lot because I was the sales, the researcher, the maintainer, the customer service, the advertiser, everything. It\u2019s a lot of work!\n\nThat said, pff hell yeah, I\u2019d do it again tho. It was really fun even though it failed haha. It made sense going for a science after, these skills play nicely with that area. Now, I can leverage my coding skills to do my own analytics and not have to make the same mistakes again in my next venture once I get more perspective. CS *is* awesome in many ways, but not all. But, yeah still having an idea of business concerns would be valuable. I\u2019m thinking grad school for it myself cause I\u2019m done with the cs degree. \n\nTL;DR do a minor in business. If you run a business one day, this information will come in handy. It doesn\u2019t need to be tech related even, it could just be any business. If you do that, this knowledge WILL help you for sure!",

Its encouraged to have interests besides CS but I dont always think its worth the time and money to take classes for them unless you\u2019re specializing in something for your career. \n\nIf you have free time in college and just want to explore, there are ways to do that outside of a classroom. You can learn a language on your own, pursue hobbies, join organizations meant for networking, intern, etc. or anything else that will make you a stronger candidate in the post-grad job market.

I had a 3.2 gpa and only 2-3 major class projects to show. I applied to every job I could for 3 months post grad (had been applying to more 6 months prior to graduating) and felt hopeless constantly receiving rejection emails without even an interview. I only landed 3 interviews in total. One before my graduation, and I failed the technical interview. One recently after graduation, did better but the job opportunity fell through. And one 3 months after graduation, me, the hiring manager, and the project manager connected very well and they were happy to train me to do the job even if I was under qualified. It\u2019s a security engineer position, which isn\u2019t my ideal career, but it\u2019s a starting point. My boss even has me help with development projects on the side so I get experience for that and can change jobs later to what I wanna do. Sometimes it\u2019s just about finding the right environment and for the company the right person for the team isn\u2019t always the most qualified, but the one who fits in most.

I still am griding leetcode even today for an interview at one of the big 5 (an interview out of many companies applied to over the course of all of 2020). It took me 6 months to land a job at one of my lower choice companies, but I managed to save up a solid 9 months of expenses in the 4ish months I've been working for this \"lower choice\" company.
