        "selftext": "I'm a college senior and I remember reading this sub for advice years ago early in my degree so I wanted to return the favor. Some background on me: top 50 CS school, 5x internships, 4x FAANG. Below are bits and pieces of advice and things I learned or wish I knew when I was younger plus some thoughts addressing common posts I see frequently on this sub. Hopefully this can help some of you!\n\nRegarding your CS degree\n\n* \"I'm struggling in class. Am I not cut out for CS?\" **Struggling is a sign of learning and growth, not failure**. CS is not easy. Persevering through challenges is not only useful for your degree but for your life after. You don't need to be naturally gifted to do well in CS. I personally bombed my intro classes and it took me \\~4 months for things to start clicking. During those four months I just kept re-reading the material and going to my professor's office hours to ask questions. There will be very rare cases where CS doesn't mesh with some but for most, do not give up when things get hard if this is something you truly want to do.\n* In addition to the bullet above, you'll always feel like there are people that have to work way less to do well/understand the material and **that's ok**. I see a bunch of threads about how students feel that they have to put in more work than their peers/it seems like everyone else in the class just gets the material while they don't. Many of the people that were \"loudest\" in my intro classes were putting on an act because they were afraid to show weakness and look dumb. Lots of these people either dropped out or are struggling with the rest of us in the upper level classes. Your competition is not your peers but yourself. By comparing your learning and current abilities with your past self, you eliminate a ton of stress from your peers. The way that I look at it is if I am a better programmer today than I was yesterday then I am getting closer to achieving my goals.\n* **Be comfortable with looking stupid.** There were times in class where I was afraid of asking a question because it was on something so basic that I thought that I'd look dumb to everyone else. Know what's worse than looking stupid? Going the whole semester never getting that question answered and performing poorly on exams/future classes that required strong understanding of that topic. You are paying a ton of money to attend class so use your money's worth and ask questions until you understand. More often than not, there will be other classmates that have that same exact question but are too afraid to ask it. This will help you in your job as well because the worst engineers are the ones that are unwilling to learn/admit their lack of knowledge.\n* **Do not cheat/copy code**. You are paying potentially tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for an education. I'm not talking about risking getting caught and expelled. When you cheat, you are cheating yourself by not learning the material. Embrace failure and use it to learn because everyone fails at things they are new at and anyone that says otherwise is a liar. If you cheat, yes you may get a higher grade, but you are paying thousands of dollars to end up exactly the same as before you started your degree. A degree/good grades can open doors but it won't get you past the technical interview.\n* **Survivorship bias**. \"All my friends/peers are doing so well in class and getting amazing job offers.\" Social media and LinkedIn makes it difficult to not compare ourselves to our peers. However, no one posts about the interviews they bombed. No one has a LinkedIn header of \"failed X onsite\". Behind every offer can be a story of countless rejections and failures that aren't apparent because \"hey they got the offer at X company so they must be naturally amazing\". When I got my first internship, I applied to 100+ companies and only heard back from 1 which ended up giving me an offer after only a behavioral interview. There may be a small subset of geniuses who always do well but most people still find success and are just good at hiding their failures.\n* **Having strong technical skills and writing lots of code does not make you a better programmer**. Lets say person A is the next Alan Turing; they write brilliant code at 5x the output of their peers. You might think that they can get a job anywhere. Wrong. They might write code so brilliant that no one is able to understand it and it takes a team of 10 people just to maintain and refactor their code for the rest of the company to understand. While writing complex code might make you seem \"smart\", no one wants to be the person to maintain the code after you inevitably move projects/companies. An average coder with great communication skills and coding conventions is capable of being more valuable to companies than genius coders. Don't neglect writing clean/easy to understand code and non-technical skills. Be someone that people want to work with.\n* **Everyone's timeline is different**. Don't be discouraged that you haven't gotten your dream internship/job yet. I was originally an engineering major and switched to CS after 3 semesters. I constantly felt behind people my year as I was stuck taking intro classes while they were taking advanced courses and using that knowledge to pass interviews at amazing companies. I almost didn't get a coding job as my first internship. I've had to push off non-academic semesters and go back to school because I couldn't get any internships. Be confident in yourself that you'll end up where you want if you keep trying.\n* Learn how to improve from your failures. What usually happens to me is that I think the answer is X when it is actually Y. Then I investigate what thoughts/assumptions caused me to arrive to X as the answer and rewire my thinking/logic for the future. Create your own methods for learning from your mistakes to help you learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding internships/jobs/interviewing\n\n* **\\*\\*\\*Apply to that company even if you think there's no chance you'll get it\\*\\*\\*.** Never write yourself off from a company because you think you won't get past the resume screen or you'll bomb the interview. That decision is for them to make not you. Even if you bomb the interview, you now have data on what kinds of questions you can expect if you apply in the future to better prepare. The year I got my first FAANG internship, I was rejected/ghosted from all the other 80+ local and big tech companies (many of which were far less competitive). I was already on Christmas break expecting to go back to classes in a few weeks when I unexpectedly got my only offer. Apply, apply, apply.\n* IMO the two most difficult things about interviewing are your resume and communication skills. It can be difficult to objectively critique your resume since you're essentially picking which things you wrote about yourself don't meet the bar. Critiquing your communication during an interview is also difficult because you're focused on answering the question, not seeing if you are communicating well in real time. Get your resume reviewed by a few trusted sources and do some mock interviews to find potential issues with your communication habits.\n* **\\*\\*\\*You can do everything perfectly and still not get the job\\*\\*\\***. This is one of the hardest things I've had to come to terms with. I've had many interviews where I thought I nailed every question and got rejected after. I'd spend days after questioning myself and why I didn't receive an offer. Unless there was some glaringly obvious issues in communication or implementation, you probably did just fine. There are so many factors that are out of your control (interviewer was having a bad day, position got filled, your communication style didn't fit the interviewer, etc) that dwelling on the why can be counter-productive. Interviews are flawed by nature so don't spend too much time reading between the lines for things that aren't there. Do you best, reflect if there were big mistakes that you could improve on but move on to the next interview.\n* **Getting a job/internship is a numbers game**. Going off the bullet above, you will be interviewed by people you get along with and people you don't. There will always be things you can't control that can prevent you from getting the offer. You'll get questions that you aren't strong with. Just doing more interviews increases your chances of everything aligning for a great interview.\n* Learn what leetcode is and use it early (I understand there are large amounts of companies that don't ask leetcode-type questions but most competitive companies do nowadays). Use leetcode to reinforce your understanding of algorithms and the pros/cons of data structure to understand when they are useful. **Do not use leetcode to memorize questions**. Using leetcode to memorize questions for certain companies is IMO a waste of time because the chance you get that question is very small and memorizing often times does not equal understanding. If you have solid understandings of most data structures, coming up with solutions to new questions will be must easier.\n* Good interviews are where you work with the interviewer to build a solution. A beginner mistake is to think you have to walk through a whole solution by yourself. Part of the interview is to see how well you communicate with others engineers (the interviewer). I always work with the interviewer during the question. When I'm making a solution I'll usually say \"I'm thinking of doing X because of Y assumptions. Does this sound reasonable to you?\" or \"I can't think of a good solution to X because of Y. Do you have any ideas where we can go from here?\". Your interviewer wants you to succeed and is there to help you and point you in the right direction if you get lost. Don't neglect the interviewer as a source of information since it also shows you're a good communicator.\n* If I didn't say this before, you'll get bad interviewers. It happens, move on. Some of the advice above might not always apply because the interviewer is not cooperating or is doing a bad job. Realistically there's not much you can do to salvage this situation so just move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is most of what I can think of off the top of my head. Hopefully this helps! Feel free to ask other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that luck plays a big part in getting a job/life in general. I have no side projects and don't think of myself as a genius coder. I consider myself to be very lucky that I got my foot in the door with my first FAANG offer. Keep trying til the odds are in your favor.",

            "I've been working in industry for almost 6 years\n\nI originally got into the field not for money, but because I was genuinely passionate about programming and the computer science underpinning it. I feel like when this sort of topic comes up, a lot of people who are passionate about CS as a subject will express frustration with people who've joined the field just for a job. Maybe they feel like there's a lot of inauthentic bandwagoners in the field? Not saying that OP feels this way of course, but there are some people who do.\n\nI have to say, if you're not directly interested in CS on its own, and you're mainly just interested in the career/money.. **go for it**! I unapologetically think that it's perfectly fine and understandable to want a high paying career.\n\nMy family was poor when I was born. As I grew older, as I saw my folks climb to middle class and gained stable, modest jobs as public servants. During this transition, I saw the positive effect it had on their lives. I don't have any familial wealth to fall back on. So with that in mind, I care about having a good job, and I unapologetically care about money. Not in an unhealthy, Scrooge McDuck sort of way, but because I genuinely respect that having it is life changing. As they say, money can't buy happiness, but it sure removes a lot of blockers to being happy. So yes, I find it understandable that this is something many people want.\n\nNow, I'm not unrealistic. Anyone who actively dislikes CS and programming is probably not going to succeed. Sure. But I'm not going to gatekeep people from entering this field \"for the wrong reasons\". Because career/money is a *great* reason IMHO.\n\nI have a friend who switched to CS from like Polisci. He's very smart and he would have excelled in more or less any subject, but among all the possible suitors so to speak, he chose CS since it would make him money. And he learned to like it. And now he is no worse than me, a person who was genuinely \"passionate\" as a kid. We are both very comfortable in our careers right now. We will both probably retire early.\n\n6 years later, I am no longer really passionate about CS. I also can't say I \"love\" programming. I find it somewhere between tolerable and enjoyable, but my emotions don't run as high about the topic as they did back in college. But, I don't need passion to do my job well. I don't need to love my job to do it well. It's just what I do.\n\nSo yeah, I guess my point after all the rambling is... I suspect like a lot of people with a good bit of industry experience are just like me. People who used to be \"true believers\", as well as people who joined because CS looked lucrative - after enough years, we're all the same anyway. A lot of us are no longer \"passionate\", but it doesn't matter. So if you don't really care about CS and you just want a good job.. if you're smart enough to learn the CS along the way, you'll do fine probably",

So many applicants don\u2019t read the job description and just fire off applications in the dark. \n\nFor mid-level roles with specific requirements, we\u2019ll get *hundreds* of junior candidates with \u201cdeep technical expertise\u201d, yet their most impressive project is a to do list.
