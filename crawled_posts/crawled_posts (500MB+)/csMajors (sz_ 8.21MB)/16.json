It seems like there is such a drive to be competitive and everyone acts like CS is supposed to be the hardest degree program. Some professors seem to go out of their way to trick students and make things harder than they have to be. Even though I am doing well, it seems to be mentally exhausting me just having to deal with all the BS. Sometimes I feel like I picked the wrong field, but I genuinely enjoy Computer Science. \n\nI consider myself a laid back person, so the constant studying, trying to get internships or building a ton of projects seems excessive to me. The only project I built outside of class so far is a website for my brother's farm, which I am slowly expanding upon. I haven't had an internship yet, but I don't feel super compelled to go out of my way to get one. I just want a career where I put at most 40 hours in, go home and enjoy myself. I don't want to be engrossed in my work, I want to enjoy my life.",

            "One of my goals in studying CS is eventually getting to a place where I can afford to own some mountain property, perhaps WFH. So I am viewing my time in school as a sacrifice I am making right now, in the name of having a better future with more work-life balance, and plenty of room to spend time in nature. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grind is definitely unhealthy and there is a culture here is not aligned with reality. TBH I just ignore much of it - the emphasis on leetcode, applying for internships 8 months ahead of time, grinding code in ALL of your spare time - it's just not how the real world works for the majority of people. Reddit is not reality. I think that most people land jobs eventually without doing all that stuff. A lot of these people who have crazy ambitions to work for faang never stop to question their true motivation - I mean, does working for google really even matter that much? Who's to say you'll be happier there, versus a smaller company that hires you because you were a better cultural fit, or just more personable? Does prestige mean anything at all? It's a huge industry with lots of room for mobility in many directions. Don't let the pressure to be an over-achiever get to you. \n\nAs for professors making things harder than it has to be, there is a bit of an element of gatekeeping within CS degrees. Theres usually a \"washout\" class. But for the most part, the professors should be a resource for you to learn, and if you feel you're being \"tricked\" and not uplifted, thats something you should be bringing up to the professor.",

I really like CS a lot, and I definitely am studying my favorite subject, but man. I just want a 9 to 5 that\u2019s fulfilling, not draining. The field generally does pay well, but I\u2019m not willing to change my entire lifestyle to make a little more and work a little more.",
            "I got my cs degree in 2017, so I\u2019ve pretty much had the same feelings you are having. I remember during midterms for my Architecture class the average was 85%. Everyone was happy Except for the professor, she said she will have to make the final much harder... just to give you a little insight to what\u2019s ahead, you\u2019ll probably never stop learning technologies and constantly study and read code and documentation, most tech companies will make you work more than 40+ hours a week, and the stress feels even harder than it is in university.",
            "The way I look at it is if I\u2019m not going to be a monk, live in the mountains, or that lifestyle, I might as well do what I actually enjoy with CS. So I\u2019m pretty much planning on only applying to shit that I find interesting as long as I make a livable wage. \n\nIdk, there are so many jobs in this field that pay well but just seem boring as fuuuuck to me. Just grinding out random problems in cubicle for a machine that probably has a net negative effect on humanity. Maybe I\u2019ll get paid well but as you said what\u2019s the point. \n\nThat\u2019s my solution though, to just do shit I like and stay outta the culture of it",

Grinding is basically what we only know at this point.\n\nEDIT: So, I just realized that the other side was never supposed to be the promised land. There really is no other side. It\u2019s the same side. All it did was teach how to live this hell of a life. \n\nTo the dude, applying to 4.5k jobs - *are you fcuking crazy?* Do you realize that you could just skill up in that time and either have a better shot at the first 100 you applied to or have only 50 applications to send because you picked up a skill that\u2019s in demand?",
