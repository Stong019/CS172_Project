            "Just ask GPT-4: P and NP are two classes of problems. P (Polynomial time) is the class of problems for which a solution can be found and verified quickly (in \"polynomial time\"). NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) is the class of problems for which a solution, if given, can be checked quickly.\n\nThe question \"P=NP?\" asks whether every problem for which a solution can be verified quickly also has a solution that can be found quickly. In simpler terms, it's asking if verifying the correctness of the answer is as hard as finding the answer in the first place.\n\nIf P=NP, this would mean that for every problem where we can verify a solution quickly, we could also find that solution quickly. This would have profound implications for fields like cryptography, optimization, and more.\n\nHowever, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the question remains unresolved. The Clay Mathematics Institute has even designated it as one of the seven \"Millennium Prize Problems,\" offering a $1 million prize for a correct solution.",

            "courtesy of some llm:)\n\nThe most important aspect in the P versus NP discussion is whether P is equal to NP or not. This question remains unsolved and is one of the biggest unsolved problems in computer science. If P equals NP, it means that problems with efficient verifiability (in NP) also have efficient solutions (in P). In other words, any problem for which we can quickly check a solution would also have a fast algorithm to find the solution. However, if P does not equal NP, it implies that there are problems for which verifying a solution is relatively easy, but finding a solution efficiently is difficult or may even be impossible.\n\nMany important real-world problems, such as the traveling salesman problem and the satisfiability problem, belong to NP. While no efficient algorithm is known to solve them in the general case, these problems still have practical applications, and researchers continue to study them in hopes of finding efficient solutions or approximation algorithms.\n\nIt's worth noting that the P versus NP problem is an open question, and proving either case would have significant implications for various fields, including cryptography, optimization, and algorithm design.",

They have lots of school work. Random adventures with friends.

I remember the burger place near by had to ban a bunch of them for aggressive takeout sessions right by the door.\n\nThere were dudes with hair so shiny and stuck down I could be convinced it was plastic.

However, this wouldn't be representative of the entire field.\n* **Shower Stereotype:**\u00a0The stereotype might play on the idea of CS students spending a lot of time at their computers, neglecting showers.

            "To an extent, but there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s a stereotype. The lecture hall of a upper-div cloud course at my uni literally smelled like BO as soon as you walked in. Like yes there are plenty of us that are clean but lots of these mfers really do smell like shit",

For those who are unfamiliar with the process, I got reached out to a recruiter (possibly because I applied in the past and found my application in the pool), who helped me revamp my resume, did an OA, and scheduled my interview for about a month later. I used  leetcode75 and top interview 150, hacker rank, and coding ninjas. I even did some practice interviews with preamp and some friends because this was my first technical interview. \nThere were two interviews. The first one, I needed more help than I would\u2019ve hoped to need, but I had great conversation with my interviewer, and was able to find the solution, and then optimize it. My second interview, I was able to quickly get to the solution, and optimize it, and I even also had a great conversation with my interviewer. Overall, I had a great experience and thought it was super fun! I\u2019m happy to answer anyone\u2019s questions. \n\nEven if I don\u2019t get it, I had a lot of fun interviewing. From this whole process, I\u2019ve learned more about myself and have ultimately become a better programmer! I just wanted to share my experience :).

I went to one of HYPSM and got a software engineer job at one of the \"prestigious hedge fund/trading firm\" right after college. After this I realized what a mistake it was and now work at a FAANG/MANGA.\n\nThis job literally consumed my entire life. No one left at 5 pm. You leave at 7-8 pm on good days. If you leave at 5/6 pm, people literally shout at you and you're viewed as a some degenerate taking who's taking a \"half day\". The work I did was dull and most of the time I had to work with legacy code. I had to listen to traders bitch about something that didn't work, and because of this job I almost lost my relationship of 2 years since I couldn't spend anytime with my partner. I started feeling burnt out and this really affected my mental health badly. I started shouting at my colleagues and developed anger issues. Guess what? No one gives a fuck about your mental health at these hedge funds!\n\nI started leetcoding again and soon found a job at FAANG. Now I make about less now but now I'm working on products that I like and have a nice tech stack. I leave work at 5pm and spend my time with my partner and my dog. When you join these hedge funds, you average 80-85 hours per week so your hourly rate is same as FAANG/MANGA employee. These HFTs that say \"we value work life balance\", yeah shut up. That's still around 70 hours. This industry is fucked by ex-Investment Bankers from Goldman Sachs who bring in their toxic work culture. These companies \"groom\" you with posh housing and trips through through their internship program, they overwork you when you join full-time. There's not much you can do with an extra 100k/200k when you don't have a life outside work. From being a full-timer at both FAANG/HFTs, I truly believe the tech industry provides the best compensation, career growth, and actually values work-life balance.\n\nIf you have an offer from a top tech company and a trading firm, and you value your life outside work even a little bit, do yourself a favour and join the tech company.\n\nTC: 350k (At MANGA)\n\nYOE: 2.5",

Also, a Terms of Reference can be really helpful for group projects moving forward. It clearly defines roles, responsibilities and expectations in terms of behaviour. Make a TOR template and bust it out for each project.

Either way, at most they'll ask you to resubmit it, not flat out fail you.\n\n>a classmate submitted his code in a Microsoft Word document instead of zipping the whole project and submitting it\n\nThe professor/TA still has the submitted code from the student. To fail someone over something so trivial is pretty stupid. At best a 5 point dedication or small note would be made.

Engineering, finance, whatever field you can think of - they\u2019re all in the same situation as you, if not worse.

I graduated in 2009, and had the same problem. It took a lot of my friends years to get their careers really started.
