You can be the best programmer out there, but if you communication is shit because all you do is leetcode in your dark room, then you're not going to make it buddy.\n\nHonestly. Try gaining some soft skills experience by contributing to open source projects (through a slack channel for examle). Much more benefitial for your personal development than leetcode",

We can complain all day about how LC is not 1:1 with what you'll do at your job but that still sounds like a worthwhile trade to me.",
            "Not to justify Leetcoding practice and the broken tech interview system that we have, but history has it that the alternatives to standardised test framework (e.g. standardised exams, technical interviews) are usually even more unfair \u2014 filled with nepotism and insider connections that largely benefits the rich and well resourced. Take comfort to the fact that at least for Leetcoding culture, even though the interview process is dumb and algorithm qns are mostly irrelevant to the real job, it can be overcome by hard work and practice.",
