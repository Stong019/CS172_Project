            "Fellow CS major who struggled with calc here. I was able to get through Calc I okay, but failed Calc II and waited a few years to re-take it. Here\u2019s what worked for me on the second go around:\n\n-\tFirst and foremost, I found a new professor. I had the same professor for Calc I & II and I didn\u2019t love her the first time, and really didn\u2019t like her the second time, but she was the only prof that worked with my schedule. If you don\u2019t LOVE your prof and you end up retaking this class, consider looking for another one. On that same note, my college offered both regular Calc classes and \u201cengineering\u201d Calc classes which were basically the same, but only 4 credit hours instead of 5, and somewhat applied concepts more to physics/engineering which I personally found very helpful. A good prof can make all the difference in any class, but I\u2019ve found it to be absolutely essential for math classes.\n-\tJust like CS, don\u2019t try to memorize formulas and answers, focus on the algorithms and if you\u2019re confused on a certain type of problem, try to zoom out a bit and see if you can figure out how to actually build up to the algorithm and/or formula that you need. There have been formulas that for the life of me didn\u2019t make sense, but I would go to office hours or a tutor and have them explain how this formula actually came to be and then it would all click. Sometimes understanding the foundation of something like that can be way more helpful than just memorizing a formula and trying to blindly plug it in. \n-\tFrom my last point, utilize office hours and any tutoring services you have at your disposal. I worked full-time (40 hours a week) and did 14 credit hours a semester, and I still made time for both these things. What I would do is right after Calc class (or your soonest break after it) go sit inside/right outside your prof\u2019s office and start working on your homework. This way it\u2019s fresh in your mind from class, and as soon as you get stuck on something, they\u2019re right there to help you out. IME office hours are rarely utilized by other students, and most profs are very willing to help you out once they see that you\u2019re really trying. Tutoring can be the same way, and for me having both was really helpful in different ways. Calc comes easy to some while others such as you and I really have to work hard at it, and in either case, many of those people end up tutoring the subject and can help you do things the ways that worked for them. Study groups can be helpful here too, but sometimes that\u2019s the blind leading blind - either way it\u2019s another thing to at least try. Regardless of whatever tools you have available to you at your school, USE them!\n-\tAnother tool I used religiously and really loved  was the Khan academy videos. That dude can explain just about anything and have it make sense. I can\u2019t tell you how many hours of those videos I watched, again while I was doing my homework and applying it to the problems I was actually working on. For me, blindly trying to come up with a solution on my own that I didn\u2019t actually understand got me nowhere. \n-\tAs others have said GET SOME SLEEP! Don\u2019t ever stay up late studying the night before an exam. Say no to going out with friends or playing video games that night and study during that time and go to bed at a reasonable if not early hour. It makes a massive difference in your brain\u2019s ability to focus and recall the stuff you\u2019ve been working on and it\u2019s not optional. Don\u2019t pull an all nighter, don\u2019t get a few hours of sleep, don\u2019t supplement your lack of sleep with adderall and/or caffeine - just get 7.5 hours of sleep as consistently as possible and especially before exams. \n-\tI found that I performed the best on exams when I was in a good headspace. I started a routine before any big exam where I would get up a little early, go get some of my favorite food/drink, listen to my favorite music, and very lightly study for about 30min - an hour before my exam. It doesn\u2019t have to my some drawn out thing, and often for me it was just spending a couple extra bucks on lunch, or grabbing a donut and some Starbucks, but taking that time to just get in the right headspace always left me feeling energized and really mentally prepared for an exam. It sounds kind of dumb, but it really helped me out. \n-\tSlightly unethical, but you\u2019re a CS major and you won\u2019t ever need this shit so I say go for it, but cheat when it makes sense to. Now don\u2019t be a dumbass and copy answers from other people, do some nonsense coughing with your friend, or try to print tiny text on your water bottle and read it. For those formulas that you do need to memorize, just type them into your calculator\u2019s programs menu or download a tool from the internet. Obviously this doesn\u2019t work if you have one of those shitty prof\u2019s who make you clear out your programs before exams, but in my mind, there are times where some \u201ccheating\u201d can make sense and some prof\u2019s even get that in the way of open book tests, allowing you a note card, giving you the formulas, whatever. It might even be worth bringing this up with your prof if it\u2019s something you struggle with and just be like \u201chey, I\u2019m having a hard time memorizing these complex formulas and I\u2019m trying to focus more on how to use them and solve problems than just memorize this stuff. Would you allow us to use some tool during the test to reference these formulas so that we can focus on the important stuff?\u201d\n-\tLastly, know you can do it. I didn\u2019t try hard enough in Calc I and that probably set me up for failure in Calc II, but I also just didn\u2019t believe in myself. I told myself I sucked at Calc, that this shit didn\u2019t matter, it wasn\u2019t relevant for me degree, and studied hard, but I wasn\u2019t genuinely trying to learn anything. I re-took Calc II as a junior and had grown some by then and set my sights on an A. I told myself this was it, I\u2019ve already wasted money on one F, and that if I could figure out how to code some of the shit I had by that point, I could figure out how to do some math. You\u2019re smart and you can do it. \n-\tBonus tip: learn physics. If you do retake this class or a future Calc class, try to do it alongside a physics class. And if not, try to learn a little now on your own or from a tutor. Knowing *why* calculus exists and how things like derivatives are actually used in the real world can be super helpful for understanding calc.",

Nothing large or intense, just a small and quick test of which derivatives I knew and which I didn't. \n\nIf you can calculate derivatives you can calculate integrals (for Calc I). Memorizing both derivatives and integrals is double the work so knowing just the derivatives and then working backwards helps save on time.\n\nMy Calc I class had a \"Calculus Bible\" or whatever we called it with just a list of the common derivatives and integrals. I just attended class and studied those derivatives and felt little pressure from Calc I. \n\nSide note: this blew my mind when taking the class so I just like to mention it. Integration is the inverse of differentiation. Just like how division is the inverse of multiplication. It's literally its opposite/counterpart. Integration is a strong tool when applying it to daily life but when doing calculations, I always found it helpful to just think of it as the opposite of differentiation.",

There were only a few times I didn\u2019t get outright 100s or very high A\u2019s on tests in my state school (that had very low ~60-65% class averages). \n\nThat said, there were sometimes curveball questions that threw me for loops. Those questions either relied on some extra knowledge I didn\u2019t quite pick up on or know explicitly about some mathematical transmutation or they required a little more creativity than I had to give at that particular moment. \n\n**TLDR:** Much of Calculus can be satisfied with rote memorization.

The pot of gold you're picturing at <Your favorite FAANG> won't last forever, so don't break yourself getting there or feel worthless if you don't reach it!**\n\nI'm pretty new to this sub, so this may have been talked about before, but after reading people's posts on here I felt compelled to write about this topic. Whether you're still in the midst of college or if you're like me and working on finding a full-time job, the CS rat race isn't everything it's hyped up to be. It can be really easy to think from reading this sub that there are 0 jobs available and that if you're not leetcoding 24/7 to land a job at a FAANG you're gonna be homeless. This is NOT TRUE! If you're studying computer science, you have a foundation for one of the most important skills for the rest of history: working with computers. There *is* life outside the FAANGs, and there are many many many ways to have meaningful work outside of the Big Tech companies. In fact, I'd posit that it's *easier* to make bigger impacts at different companies, because you won't just be another cog in the machine. There's nothing wrong with wanting a FAANG job! But don't set all your hopes on it and then get burned when it doesn't pan out. You're a really smart individual who has a lot to contribute and who will be able to find a place where you belong and can make a difference.\n\nAnother thing to remember: *we're all at the literal start of our careers.* Please don't overburden yourself with expectations that are way past where you are in life. It's true that you have to start thinking about career stuff pretty early in college, but don't burn yourself out before you even begin the real thing! You have a ton of time to build a solid career. Don't feel like your first job is going to define who you are as a technologist and especially not as a person. Y'all are awesome and you got this!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** I'm really glad my thoughts have gotten a lot of conversations started! A quick point about ambition/hard work: I am in no way saying that you shouldn't work hard! It is nigh impossible to achieve any kind of success in life without hard work. I wrote this post as a graduating senior at a top-tier CS school who has seen lots of friends and classmates burn out on the job hunt grind. I'm a firm believer that you should try to be excellent at everything you do, and that hard work is one of the only ways to be excellent. My issue/point is that we should be wary of what our definition of \"personal success\" is. If success for you is defined in very very narrow terms, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment down the road. In my experience, having a definition of personal success in life that isn't completely tied to things like where I work has helped me maintain a decent level of joy, particularly in the area of computing. By all means work hard (and in prepping for interviews, practice makes perfect!), but I advise y'all to not tie whether or not you feel like a successful person to a dream job or internship. Hopefully that clarifies where I'm coming from!",

These people can and should shoot for top jobs and want an online community of people similarly shooting for those jobs. \n\nThose communities can be really exhausting and toxic, but they also contains lots of helpful information and honestly can be pretty motivating.

            "I work at a FAANG company as a SWE, never did leetcode at all. I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t useful, definitely practice a little to get your problem solving chops up (problem solving is the foundation upon which everything else is built for cs), but there are so many other skills and other factors that really matter that I think a lot of students overlook. One of these is communication - being able to talk about what you are doing and explain technical concepts simply and concisely is a big deal both in practice and in the interview. My advice is to try to TA CS courses at your school to build out this skill! I find that all the skills you learn from teaching others (including developing a further mastery of whatever you are teaching) translate super well to full time work and coding interviews. Also, make sure your code is clean and easy to read in addition to \u201cgetting the right answer\u201d. Naming your variables in a way that makes sense semantically and breaking out helper methods/building out classes etc. to make your code easy to validate and understand is also important. This will help with validation which is another thing we look for in interviews. Lastly, being a competent and easy person to work with, someone who is kind and passionate/excited about the work and genuinely friendly and fun to be around/has high EQ is so important. We are hiring our peers and whether or not you would want to work with someone is often how we phrase interview feedback on top of everything else. Listen to your interviewer and genuinely interact with them! In general, try to be a friendly and helpful person and live your life. Make friends with your fellow CS peers instead of seeing them as competition.",

Help each other out, listen and give constructive criticism, and at the end create something beautiful as a group. \n\nCS doesn't have that aspect, at least not to the degree of music. Yes you have group projects, but usually it's just \"hey you do x and I'll do y\" which usually makes it so you only meet once or twice a week with small texts in between. Even when you do get into a good group there's always (well at least for me) that lingering feeling that you're the bottom of the barrel. That and everyone is too busy building up their personal portfolio that they dont really have time to fully commit to anything group related. Happened to me and my buddies this summer, where i spent the majority of the day in a discord group call telling them that I'm down to chat and work on stuff whereas they rather spent the time focusing on their own aspect. \n\nIdk man. Most of my friends are not from the CS major. It's rough out there.",

            "I was thinking about this. First year I made an effort, by second year every Friday/Saturday night was spent on the internet.

        "selftext": "When I got my first job as a software engineer, which I am still grateful to this day that they decided to take a chance on me, I made many mistakes. Most of which were avoidable. After my first job, I was at facebook for 4 years and now I help people study for programming interviews.  I have compiled everything that I have experienced and learned into a post for anyone who is starting out their career or may have experienced the same fuck ups.\n\n**Read the stack traces**\n\nI cannot tell you the number of times I would ask stupid questions because I couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with my code. I would get stuck and I\u2019d ask the senior engineer on my team for help. He would usually roll over to my desk, look at the stack trace, and read me the answer right off of it\u2026it was just embarrassing.\n\nIt was so hard for me to read that block of red text. It felt so intimidating and I just never wanted to do it. BUT as it turns out, reading the stack trace almost always gave me info on what is wrong with my code. If would have just taken the time to read it, I would have saved myself and my team soo much frustration.\n\n**Identify where you are uncomfortable and lean into it**\n\nIt took me two months to open a JSON file. I didn\u2019t know anything about them and every time they came up at work I would avoid being involved in the conversation. There was some mental block that came up every time I heard someone say \u201ccheck the JSON\u201d file. It wasn\u2019t until I ran into it one day and actually opened it that I realized how fucking simple they were. I still can\u2019t believe it took me that long to even learn what they were.\n\nThe real lesson here is that avoiding a topic because it makes me uncomfortable hindered my growth as a software engineer. As they say at Replit: \u201cseek pain\u201d.\n\n**Think about the system**\n\nAs a junior engineer, I only really thought about the specific files that I was working on. The system was all broken up into pieces in my mind and I never took the time to understand how everything came together. This mindset was fine, but what really allowed me to level up was thinking about the entire system as a whole.  I would write better code and avoiding bugs. Not to mention I became a better communicator with my team.\n\n**Avoid Unnecessary refactors**\n\nIt was easy to write off my mistakes and inefficiencies by saying things like \u201cthis codebase is a mess\u201d. There was a natural urge to refactor code that I didn\u2019t write. One time, my team spent months working on a complete API rewrite to \u201cclean the codebase\u201d. When we finished, although the code was \u201ccleaner\u201d, nothing measurable had really changed. Management was confused as to why the entire team just spent months rewriting everything to have 0 measurable impacts on the business. I try now to always have a measurable metric that I plan to improve with every major refactor.\n\n**Do not Undervalue communication**\n\nWhen I was studying for programming interviews, I learned how important it was to be able to talk about my code. I contribute me getting offers at Facebook & Google to my ability to talk through the work that I just did. It was helpful also as I grew to be able to communicate my ideas. As a junior engineer I was just writing code I was assigned. But, as I worked my way up to a senior engineer, I was designing systems and delegating tasks which is where it was important for me to have strong communication skills.\n\nOverall, just think a little bit deeper about what you are doing when you start your career. Everything you are doing is apart of a bigger picture. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions (as long as you are positive the answer isn\u2019t in the stack traces). And be confident.",

            "Great advice. I would add \"ask to see the system\" to \"Think about the system.\" I have seen so many developers who have no idea how the system works because no one has ever showed it to them.

            "There are??? No thanks, I'm gonna keep applying to only $50/hour internships and then complain I'm jobless",
            "WHAT?! I was told if I solve leetcode problems I\u2019m guaranteed an offer..",
            "Exactly there's also HFT",
            "Half of the stories on this sub are made up, and the other 40% are filled with crazy stories or delusional posts. The rest are legit.",
            "[deleted]",
            "As an international student, is a bit harder to find smaller companies, as they in some cases have to either wait longer or help with visa sponsorship, when those FAANG companies have teams to help you with that.\n\nAlso, unrelated but I hate the word FAANG. I propose calling it MAGMA (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon)",
            "What are some other companies that pay well but aren't as competitive as FAANG?",
            "I always understood FAANG as a reference to any big well known tech company which has FAANG or FAANG equivalent salaries. As long as I\u2019m rolling in dough I couldn\u2019t care less whether it\u2019s one of those five.",
            "Unfortunately I apply to everything, smaller business, faang, gov, banks, it\u2019s always going to be rejections",
            "I really can\u2019t care less about FAANG. Some people here are delusional.",
            "Honestly people should look at government. Certain agencies are just as hard to get into but look a lot better on your resume than faang. Having that plus a security clearance means you get contracting roles or government-serving faang roles for way much more than you would\u2019ve had if you just started out at a faang company",
            "Very excited to be hired, blow a ton of money on a huge house, work 60 hrs per week, get PIP in 6 months, and unemployed for another year\n\nThe American dream, baby!",
            "wait you're telling me that there are more than 10 companies that hire developers and pay well? /s",
            "Honestly if your whole plan was come to the US and get a job at FAANG to get sponsorship maybe you should have thought a little harder about whether that was likely to work.",
            "This. If you make great stuff, people will recognize your value one way or another. I tried too hard to impress recruiters at one point I forgot what I wanted to be best at. (Certainly not the best Leetcode solver, nor the best employer, though some can pursue it.)",
            "Find me one that\u2019ll pay me $250k+ a year with 3 years Jr experience and let\u2019s me live in the Bay Area and you\u2019ve got a deal",
            "Even spicier take: tech bros who parrot the \u201cother companies than FAANG\u201d line don\u2019t have to consider visa sponsorship when applying for jobs",
            "i mean if you go to a decent school, are a junior, are a r/csmajors user (has no outside life) then you probably already have a decent offer. \n\nI got an offer from walmart so now all I'm applying to FAANG. Why would I even bother with anything else, I have nothing else to do in life.",
            "Wait.... The earth is flat? I thought I could only see faang from where I am!",
            "I'd rather they didn't",
            ">People want to make more money??? Rather than less money???? How could this be?!?!?!?!?\n\n\\- OP, lmfao",
            "NOPE. Unless google is prepared to pay me big I\u2019m not interested in a small company - I know my worth",
            "Why people don't get why people are obsessed with faang, they simply pay more lol,and on top of that they are the ones that usually develop the last tech,so more money + more exciting workplace,at the cost of having a bad work-life balance,but guess what,many people here don't have a life so who cares. I cringe a little for they getting so nervous and worshiping these companies but okay I get it. I also would want to enter faang,shoot for the stars ,if I don't reach it then I still will be on the air.",
            "It must be nice accepting that you're mediocre. Takes a lot of stress off your shoulders.",
