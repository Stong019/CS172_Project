I mean new grad and entry level for them is having legit industry experience. And unless you had like an amazing internship where you worked with some of these technologies you\u2019re out of luck. And then they\u2019ll still pick someone with a year or two more experience. \n\nI\u2019ve had the same experience. I\u2019ve applied to over 70 places now and only two small companies interview me. Meanwhile top companies have contacted me. I\u2019m just not in a place where I feel confident in my skill to nail a top company interview. And we shouldn\u2019t all be expected to in order to get gainful employment. I shouldn\u2019t also have to move to the Midwest or a random ass state to get gainful employment either, especially just to work for some small ass company. I\u2019m not moving to a completely new state with no friends or family for 50k when people without a CS degree make the same and can be by their friends and family. The value is not there.\n\nYou\u2019re still early. I think you need to change your approach with Leetcode. For me, I read the problem, and if see if my brain can understand and process it. So if it\u2019s like a search problem or a string or something I\u2019m like does this make sense? If I have a grid of letters can it make this target word? Do you see the target word in the grid? If I don\u2019t understand it I reread it until I can make sense of it. Then I come up with a steps. Like if I recognize the pattern, how did I recognize it? Yes, I see the target word in the grid but how did we get here? And it becomes a step by step process because I break it down. Like I looked at the first letter, saw it in the grid, looked at the second letter saw it in the grid, etc. And my brain was like oh there\u2019s the target word. Ok now program that. Then use the algos you know to complete the solution, because the underlying method to get the answer will be one of those. Definitely if improve your pattern recognition everything then becomes about syntax and optimization after.",
            "My two cents.   \nLeetcode is good as long as you don't memorize the solutions dude. Look at a couple different approaches to a problem and understand why people did what they did. Why did they choose one approach over the other? Try establishing similarities, find patterns. You got this!  \n\n\nI am in the same boat as you and I read somewhere that \"all the grind we put in now will be worth it\" and I am sure once you get a job, you'd say the same. Just keep going.

I have an MBA and have taken several MSCS courses as well and will generally only recommend an MSCS or MSIS degree to someone who does **not** already have a BS-CS, because it's less technical than a CS degree, more about \"technical leadership\", and not particularly applicable to most developers who aren't project managers or directors of some type.\n\nBut an MBA will tech you skills that you can use immediately in your career on day 1.

        "selftext": "Kinda petty, but I find it so funny that a company that preaches so much about \u201cequality, diversity, access\u201d chose 150 random kids, all from Ivy plus schools, skipped them directly to the final round and then filled up their entire intern class with them, forgoing their regular process for everyone else.\n\nShould serve as an indication to every cs major: these companies don\u2019t care about you, or their supposed \u201cgoals\u201d. They only care about making money, and that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t kill yourself over them.",

This year I applied again and even by being part of an organization they parner I don't even got an OA. I literally had and internship at Microsoft and a strong resume, but they still rejected me. The only thing is that my school is unknown in a remote island. So seeing this is interesting.",
