At this point, I had two companies looking at me, one of them a small telecommunications company, and the other a large well-known government defense contractor.

I applied to over 80+ companies, and those are the only application I kept track of. I can't believe I'm going to make $73k right out of college.

And at that point you'll be out on your own and can more easily ignore their foolishness than you can as a student.",

            "I was watching some FIRE videos earlier too. I only have a crude understanding of it, but here's my take anyway:\n\nNo offense to your parents, but expecting retirement by 30 is frankly insane. Possibly, they do not have a good grasp of finances themselves or misunderstood what FIRE actually accomplishes?\n\nEarly retirement is still like late 40's to early 50's if ur lucky and invest well. I mean, invest 25% of your income and assuming constant annual raises. Oh! And also assume no emergencies that could wipe out your savings (cancer, lawsuits, etc).\n\nRetirement in 30's is only realistically achievable if you can save and invest something like 70% of your income. Obviously meaning you must be able to live off the remaining 30%.\n\nIn either case, saving 25% or 70% you can only safely withdraw 2-4% of savings from retirement accounts. That might get you close to maintaining your pre-retirement standard of living.\n\nFIRE gets YOU financially free. Meaning you only need to work because you like it. The interest generated on savings covers all your living expenses. It is definitely not designed with the idea of THREE PEOPLE RETIRING OFF ONE INCOME!! Your parents pulling from your savings (besides being obviously greedy on their part) jeopardizes the constant growth of your savings. If you lose too much or fall too far behind inflation, you could end up forced out of retirement.\n\nDisclaimer:  I am only regurgitating bits of what I understood from a handful of podcasts. (Shout out to Dave Ramsey, The Money Guy, and Caleb Hammer!) It's admirable to look after your parents, but only do what is financially sensible for you.",
            "Eh, my parents still see me as a failure (\\~15 yoe) and keep saying I should try to be a youtuber instead.\n\nLook on the bright side, with a little luck, in a few years, you won't be able to hear them over the sound of your spouse, house, and rugrats.",

            "My parents are the opposite. They planned their finance around the assumption that I\u2019m an incapable fuck who will live in their house for the rest of my life, and ignore how many times I told them I\u2019ll be absolutely fine on my own. I just graduated and is making well over 200k right out of college, guess what, my mom stills says one day I\u2019ll fuck up my job and move back to their basement.",

But if you paid attention they had moved to the middle of nowhere, the husband worked remotely and the wife took care of the kids while doing YouTube stuff on the side. In reality no one was retired. \n\nI have a 40 year old neighbor who claims to be retired. He\u2019s actually a stay at home Dad. His wife works full time. Nothing wrong with that, but it\u2019s not retirement. \n\nThere may be some people who truly retire very young, but not many.

            ">but my parents are legit planning their retirement off of me making big bucks once I graduate\n\nI would be very careful about this. I'm all for transparency for how much you're making to other people to educate others about how much you potentially can be made, but this sounds like a potential downside when you are transparent with your parents. Money is one of the really sour topics I have learned over the years in particular to never talk with my mom about because she also has really delusional expectations around it. I was asked by my mom a year ago 6 months into moving into a new place after furnacing my entire place from scratch with absolutely no help on top of her also taking away funds from me during a time when I owed a lot of debt from credit card payments and student loans since I was living with her if she could borrow 60k from me because of issues that she made for herself on some damages related to her house. I refused, then she proceeded to go to a complete stranger she's never seen before talking a whole bunch of shit about how I was ungrateful a son to her because of the income I was now making while completing my taxes, at a time when I was close to making a 6 figure income.  Not saying that you're parents are doing this, but just to highlight that money in particular is one of those topics that absolutely can change people, especially to those that don't have it.\n\nParents shouldn't be planning retirement for their kids. This could just be them playing or them giving you warning signs about how they potentially may act when you start to actually have a decent income for yourself. I would encourage you to steer clear away from this topic just from personal experience navigating around some of my own family members in my life after I gained a decent income for myself and even encourage moving far away from your parents after you graduate. Not saying that you shouldn't help them out if you have the means to do it, but you have to take care of yourself first before you start to help out other people.\n\nHaving a high income doesn't mean that you retire early. Retirement is solely based on how much time you're saving given all of the expenses that will come up in your life. To retire that early, you would've needed to start hustling and making money at the age of 14 while putting money into a brokerage fund to build up making a 5-6 income with no responsibilities to pay for anything else.",

So the answer to your question about how to \"deal\" with them, is you don't. You're an adult.

Even if you lived frugally ($40k/yr), don't make huge purchases, invested 100% of your remaining income at the average 6% return, according to my calculations you'd be left with about $1.05 mil at 30. That's nowhere **near** enough just for 1 person to retire on. Just your personal frugal expenses alone, with inflation and typical return, you'd be broke by the age of 47.\n\nIgnore them and do your own thing.",

Don't compare yourself to others with different backgrounds, just compare yourself to your past self. As long as you're improving and better than yesterday, that's what matters\n   * Imposter syndrome is normal - use it to your advantage. thinking your entire team is smart should motivate you to get to that level, not keep you from learning. everyone starts somewhere and soon you'll have people looking up to you too\n   * don't do CS for the money unless you have an extremely strong will. this field will burn you out if you do it for money unless you're somehow able to separate the outcome and your day-to-day. i would recommend against it\n   * laptop recommendations get asked a lot. I would personally say get a mac product (used or new) made in the last \\~1-3 years for simplicity. things will work out of the box and you have unix support from day 1. If you're more adventurous, get a pc and load linux, or get a VM or build a hackintosh. these approaches require a lot of work. Swappa is a good place to find used deals\n   * Programming languages don't really matter too much - I would recommend python or java to get started with\n   * College is what you make of it - you can go to a low-tier school and do great if you push yourself. You can go to MIT and be a bum. it is easier to do well if you go to a high tier school and push yourself though\n   * CS is a learning experience even past college. you'll be learning new technologies, frameworks and having to brush up interview skills continuously. make sure you enjoy learning new things\n   * bootcamps vs college is an interesting debate. bootcamps teach the high-level knowledge without in-depth fundamentals. that you have to learn on your own. don't expect just a bootcamp to set you up for success against college grads. you have to put in more work than the minimum. [Would you choose a coding bootcamp or a computer science related degree? Why? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Would-you-choose-a-coding-bootcamp-or-a-computer-science-related-degree-Why) The top answer here is a solid one. Generally, bootcamp grads are extremely rare in FAANG because they want fundamental knowledge. bootcamp grads do very well at small local tech companies that might want something basic without having to worry about scale\n* Once you're in college\n   * Try new things. go to hackathons, try new clubs, make friends. You learn from those around you and this is an easy way to surround yourself with smart people\n   * go to class. as someone that skipped a lot of classes, it's not worth it. you'll spend the same amount of time if not more trying to learn things yourself. the only potential exception is if the classes are recorded and you have enough discipline to watch them\n   * GPA matters and it doesn't matter. It matters for government, trading firms, traditional companies (although they'll stop caring once you hit a few years of experience). Normal tech companies don't really care ASSUMING you can show your value in other ways. Having a low GPA and no projects is a bad combo\n   * Personal projects are just another way to showcase your skills. it can be substituted with a contribution to open source, part-time work, etc.  It's better to have them than not\n   * Core classes to take in college IMO are network security, databases, algorithms, linear algebra, up to calc 2, an advanced data structures class, compilers, OS. you don't need to take the highest level classes but knowing these are good.\n   * Have a social life - growing as a software engineer requires soft skills. you can be the smartest person in the room but won't grow unless you're also easy to learn with\n   * Be humble and eager to learn. try not to be in an environment where you're the smartest person in the room. Goes back to point 1 where you should get comfortable being uncomfortable and learning\n   * Careers fairs are good but do your research. some companies just tell you to apply online, others will give you an interview on the spot. Go first to the ones that will give you an interview and go to the other ones last\n   * Hackathons and clubs are a good place to find jobs too\n   * [http://angel.co/](http://angel.co/) is a good place to get started on the startup hunt\n   * your professors and TA's are there to help you - ask them for help\n* Internships/new grad jobs\n   * getting the first internship is the biggest hurdle. after that it kind of compounds\n   * there's a correlation between the number of applications submitted and job offers. success = attempts x success rate. even if your success rate says the same, applying to twice as many places is good\n   * failing interviews is normal. its not a reflection of you as a person or your skillset but your demonstration of that skillset given at the time and situation. learn from it and move on\n   * Algorithms and data structures is the core of CS. Do leetcode and get started on these things as soon as possible\n   * FAANG has specific programs (FBU, Google engineering practicum, Microsoft explorer) geared towards underrepresented minorities and freshman/sophomores. apply to them\n   * [GitHub - j-delaney/easy-application: Over 400 software engineering companies that are easy to apply to](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application) and [Intern Supply](https://intern.supply/) are good places to start\n   * Optimize your internships for learning and growth. Learning means trying new things, pushing boundaries etc. Growth means jumping around from company to company. Use a defense contractor to go to Big N and then to FAANG.\n   * Learning standard tools like git, docker, etc can make you more effective at internships\n   * being young is the best time to take risks. if you want to do a startup over a large company, go for it but do your research. don't turn down google for a company that does IoT socks.\n   * information is power. especially when it comes to negotiating. sites like [https://www.teamblind.com/](https://www.teamblind.com/), reddit, and [https://www.levels.fyi/](https://www.levels.fyi/) are crucial to make sure you're compensated fairly\n   * practice coding on paper/whiteboards. most interviews expect this and will probably be the norm once covid ends\n* Industry experience/new grad tips\n   * Optimize your first job for (in order) learning, manager, interest in work, compensation. How much they matter should be up to you. ex - don't turn down a 100k job for a 50k job that has a slightly better learning opportunity. but a 90k vs 95k job, optimize on things other than compensation\n   * FAANG is overrated and underrated at the same time.  There are plenty of smart people but also plenty of slackers. That being said, the pay and benefits is fantastic. But there are always different and potentially better opportunities. Finance for higher pay and worst wlb, unicorns for higher pay but with more uncertainty, gov't for wlb and low stress. The one thing about FAANG is, there are very few other places in the world where you can work on things at such a large scale\n   * silicon valley is a good place to be when you're young, not so much when you're older (unless you're doing really well). living in a house with 3 roommates paying 1500/month is fine in your 20's but paying 2 million for a small house in your 30's with kids is not optimal\n   * not all jobs are in silicon valley/est coast but a lot of them are. new york and DC are also top contenders now\n   * learn personal finance. ESPECIALLY if you already have internships. Invest as early as you can so you set yourself up for a financially successful life\n   * invest in a good setup if you can - ergonomic chair, keyboard, a mouse so you don't have to deal with issues later on\n   * dual monitor/ultrawide screens are great for productivity\n   * noise-canceling headphones are essential for office work\n* General life tips\n   * your health is your wealth. eat well, sleep, exercise. money, success, intelligence means nothing if you die early\n   * be kind to people - you never know when you'll run into them again\n   * take risks when you're young, it'll be harder (not impossible) once you hit 30ish\n   * generally have a balanced life. an extreme of anything tends to be bad\n   * have a good group of friends - they mean a lot once you get out of college. as time goes on, the opportunities to make new friends come by less often - people go out less often and you don't get the same interaction levels you get in college with clubs and classes. once you're late 20's/early 30's you've pretty much made your core friend group and it becomes harder to break into new friend groups (not impossible though)\n   * spend time with family - by now you've spent 90% of the time you will with them so make the last 10% really count\n   * money and other things in life are only a part of it. i know people worth tens of millions that barely spend time with family, i know people making a very average income that are happier than people making 300k. everyone has their own issues\n\nI can't really think of anything else at the moment.
