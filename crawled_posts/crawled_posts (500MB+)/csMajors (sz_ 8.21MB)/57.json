We are a group of advisors and mentors from major US companies (Citi, Google, Microsoft, ATT and more) who want to help out.\n\nIn real-life, developers don\u2019t work alone. So we set up a space to match participants in groups to work on projects together. Our goal is to give a \u2018real\u2019 internship experience. As you know, projects on a resume is a critical way to get noticed for a first job.\n\nHere\u2019s how the process works: \n\n* You fill out a [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/d5hSs2RXFanseDyq7) about your programming ability, favorite languages, and technologies;\n* We match you up in groups of similar experience and interests;\n* We help you find a project that matches your group, interest, and professional goals;\n* Our industry mentors give feedback and notes on your project idea;\n* We ask you to assign clear roles (architect, product owner, scrum master) to avoid confusion on the team;\n* We set you up with the tools, processes, and feedback loops that are used in companies and startups on real projects;\n\nThese initiatives tend to get everyone excited at first, but then fizzle quickly. We ask you to please apply only if you are serious about coding and adding a project to your resume. Similarly, if someone drops off of your project (that happens), we help you find a replacement with similar skills.\n\nYou can start your journey by filing the [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/d5hSs2RXFanseDyq7) and we will add you to the project. You will also need to join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/x6mAjHe) which allows you to connect with other members, share tips and resources, and more. LAstly, you can checkout our landing page at www.hackyourown.org and share it on social media.\n\nPlease also check out these similar initiatives.

I'm a senior now, and there's probably been more days of me visiting this sub in the last two years than not visiting. As a sophomore I was blown away by people here choosing between multiple six figure offers, thinking I would be overjoyed to achieve half of what some of you guys here have done. It's very surreal now to be in the position of those I looked up to a few years back.\n\n\nI won't miss the hopeless nights of thinking I'll be unemployed forever and the hundreds of rejections, but I'm glad I stuck with it and made it through. I signed a new grad offer recently that I'm pretty happy with, so I'll delete reddit soon and go touch some grass. If it weren't for this sub I wouldn't even have known there were such great jobs out there let alone how to get an offer. \n\n\nThank you guys, good luck to those still searching - no matter how hopeless it feels now, I hope five years from now you think back with pride to how you overcame this adversity.",

They may treat you a little weird if you\u2019re too shy, but acting too comfortable is a way more dangerous side to err on.

It sucks, but you are \u201cselling yourself\u201d in an interview.\n\n\nAlso, you have every right to distance your business relationship with any company or person, and it does sound like the interviewer was quite unprofessional so distancing may be the right move if you don\u2019t want the job. However, usually you want to still \u201csell yourself\u201d and leave your options open until you\u2019ve taken some time to think if you want the job or not.\n\n\nNext time, try to politely correct them and say \u201cI do actually have a couple other offers.\u201d And explain a little more and then quickly restate two or three differentiating skills that you have to offer that make you stand out as a candidate. Then later on reflect if these are actually the kinds of people you can stand to work for, and politely reject the offer if you feel it doesn\u2019t suit you. Give yourself time to think.\n\n\nOverall your comment, whether or not your realize it, burnt a bridge, which feels good, but you need to really pick your battles and always make it so you have the most options.

In your case you are laughing at something they said so it doesn\u2019t quite do it. \n\nI\u2019m also British btw",
