            "This is a complex but very relevant topic. See, I went to the university in 1999 as a computer engineer and majored in 2006 in fault tolerant systems. For a rather long time I thought that most of the stuff we learned was useless, because I was working during that time to pay my bills and what we learned and what I did to earn money were so much disconnected. Or so I thought. After a couple of years when I was part of various projects I just realized what they told us but could not understand at that time: at the school you learn the abstractions of various problems and how to solve them. You learn engineering. What we lacked at that time was experience in the industry so we could not really internalize the material, to make it our own. But after so many years in industry at one point something just clicked, the dots became connected, and had the aha moment. From that on my view of the world changed and I started applying the theory on real world problems very conciously and with a great success. \n\nSo I would say that don't stress yourself too much on that, try to learn as much as you can, and later you will thank yourself. Also enjoy your youth. Make mistakes. Do silly things. Learn, adapt, and grow. Good luck college.",

Until December I would rant a lot to my friends and family, cry my eyes out that everyone around me is getting what they want but WHY NOT ME. And then came January and I was just so involved, I somehow shut every emotion I knew. I realised that talking to people about stress was making me more stressful so I started shutting everything off and putting all the free time into applications and connecting with people on LinkedIn (reached my weekly limit lol). And then I finally had an offer but ykw I didn't shed a tear (did it for the location though :p) \nI'm talking about all this bc I just want to tell you \nWhat doesn't kill you, makes you stronger! \nFeeling stressed and depressed is natural when everyone around you is raving about getting a job, not letting that affect you is in your hands. \nPeople talk about their offers, no one talks about their journey. To feel depressed bc of these success stories, be ready to live every moment of their life in their shoes. Be ready to give up your whole being and existance to be someone else. Everyone has a different story and struggles and hence a different timeline to success. Someone getting a job at 20 doesn't mean everyone should have it at 20. We wouldn't know life like we know rn if everyone and everything was the same. \nHave faith in your journey and in yourself.  \nNo one can take what's meant for you (bc it's not meant for them).",

I detest Amazon as a company and I would refuse to work there even if I had an offer in hand right now.

People here expect 2x or more from themselves than the comp sci people I know IRL, and during a time when it's wayyyyy harder to achieve those results. This sub is inspirational in a way, but also incredibly discouraging if you don't know how ridiculously high the standards are here. Don't let this be the only place where you get advice about your major. Professors, classmates, and school advisors will likely have much more realistic expectations.\n\nThis major is literally one of the most in-demand majors, and the salaries and benefits are very reasonable.
