He is involved in recruiting Software Engineering positions at a Fortune 500 Company that places a strong emphasis on diversity.\n\nI talked to him about their approach to \u201cDiversity Hires,\u201d . Their actual strategies are much more complex:\n\n\t1.\tUniform Bar for Interviewees: All candidates who make it to the interview stage are held to the same standards. Only if two candidates are at the same performance level will the company choose the one who belongs to an underrepresented group (e.g., women).\n\n\t2.\tExpanding the Underrepresented Pool: The company actively works to increase the pool of underrepresented candidates. This is achieved through various methods:\n\n\t\u2022\tTargeted Outreach: They reach out to specific conferences, clubs, and groups where underrepresented individuals may participate.\n\t\u2022\tStrategic Selection: When faced with a large applicant pool (e.g., 1000 applicants), but only able to interview a fraction (e.g., 200), they ensure that the selected pool is diverse by implementing quotas (on the pool) not on those who get hired. (Big Difference)\n\n\t3.\tInternship and Early Career: For individuals at the internship and early career stages, the company does enforce %20 quota. This is specifically applicable to summer term internships and is intended to help those still in the learning phase. At this stage merit will be created. So if more underrepresented people are given a chance here, in the future it will create a more diverse pool of potential employees who meet the hiring bar. This does not mean they pick underrepresented people simply for being underrepresented. But what happens is they have 1000s of qualified applicants. They will choose a diverse set of these applicants.\n\nI will give you a case study so you can understand my point better:\n\nImagine there are 1000 applicants for an internship (on average it requires you to be a 3rd year student with experience in two programming languages)\n\nMany of these applicants will meet the criteria. Let\u2019s say 300 people meet it. Out of those people, recruiters will then select a diverse set.\n\nThis means all selected people have met the requirements.\n\n\nAs a woman, it hurts when I got told I achieved what I did because I am a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d. Since I did an interview like any else and was able to solve the hard questions that got thru at me. I studied hard, gridded leetcode. Applied early, practiced for interviews a lot. \n\nYou should stop blaming others for your own failures, instead, try to work on your self and have accountability. Just my 2 cents and a rant on being called a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d.",

Just my 2 cents and a rant on being called a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d.\n\nYeeeeah well some hiring managers have literal quotas to fill with URMs that has a direct impact on my bonus at a F100 company so yeah, not every URM hire is a diversity hire, but some definitely are. The world is not black and white.",
            "Being involved in an actual recruiting process myself, I can tell you that obviously no one/company is silly enough to admit on paper that they don\u2019t \u201cheld every candidate to the same standards\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s admit that most of our jobs aren\u2019t that hard, companies barely ever need the \u201cbest\u201d candidate. They just need someone who is \u201cgood enough\u201d to do the job, and can also fit the business KPI (like gender/race quotas).\n\nSo it really doesn\u2019t matter if there are 100 or 1000 candidates that have way better qualifications and interview performance than you do. If you are from underrepresented group and \u201cgood enough\u201d, you\u2019re in, the rest don\u2019t matters.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of opportunities that you, as the underrepresented candidate, has access to, that other people, no matter how good, don\u2019t.\n\nI just find it funny that when it comes to acknowledging one\u2019s own privileges, one suddenly becomes so naive and ignorant.",

            "Nobody on the internet can say whether you specifically were a diversity hire or not. But your argument that diversity hiring is a myth is terrible. All you did was provide an anecdote that your relative engages in diversity hiring practices that makes it easier for women to get hired at their company. And that's precisely the point. DEI necessitates it. Your chance of getting a job is far easier than a comparable man. And this relative ease holds true all the way down the ladder of desirable to undesirable jobs.",
            "1. Strategic selection at the \"who gets interviews\" level STILL DIRECTLY DETERMINES WHO GETS THE JOB by directly opting to ghost equally qualified majority applicants.\n2. Internships and early career hiring quotas DIRECTLY DETERMINE WHO GETS INTERNSHIPS AND EARLY CAREER EXPERIENCE UPON WHICH THEY CAN BUILD THEIR CAREERS YOU CRETIN. THAT IS DIRECTLY CHOOSING MINORITIES OVER MAJORITY CANDIDATES SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF RACE, GENDER AND AGE WHICH IS OSTENSIBLY ILLEGAL, provided the group being suppresed is not a member of the majority applicant group, i.e. white males in which case it is the letter of the law to say \"eh, fuck em\" and toss their resumes in the trash unless they have <5 YoE because WE GOTTA HIT THOSE EARLY CAREER QUOTAS. This later results in those over selected minotity canidates having \"better qualifications\" because THEY GOT THE INTERNSHIPS ON EASY MODE AND THE MAJORITY CANDIDATES GOT GHOSTED ON THEIR INTERNSHIP APPLICATIONS AND WERE DENIED THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO EARN THEIR EARLY CAREER QUALIFICATIONS.\n\nYou are dense as a brick if you don't see anything wrong with these policies...\n\nAnd OP, was that a LC easy, medium or hard on your interview? I got ONE shot at a google interview, they asked me to turn on my webcam, glanced up from their phone and pulled up a random LC Hard and told me I had 10 minutes to solve it in C++ for a job that only required Python. That MFer was playing angry birds with his volume up and glancing up periodically and saying \"yup\".",

It\u2019s the same reason we get bombarded by posts by nerds claiming their life is over because they didn\u2019t get a FAANG internship their first semester freshman year and asking if it\u2019s okay to ONLY make 80k at a non-tech firm doing what they like to do.

            "just here to give a different perspective that it IS hard to be a minority in a field\u2026 being a female in tech, it\u2019s much harder to make friends, which can really be disadvantageous in situations such as job prep. i know a lot of friend groups who share interview questions they were asked, hackerrank screenshots etc which directly affect your chances. and other aspects such as group work, sharing assignment answers or help, giving each other referrals, etc also play a part. plus tech being a male dominated / male associated industry deters a lot of females from entering, or even considering tech as a career path from a young age, so naturally it would be harder to gain experience early (which a lot of males do, due to early exposure). i don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a bad thing to neutralise these with diversity hiring advantages",
            "Why does this topic keep surfacing? It just confirms to me that men in the SWE space are generally hostile toward minorities in their line of work. For the love of Christ, everyone who is not a White, Asian, or Indian male isn\u2019t just inherently worse at the job because they\u2019re doing it, but that\u2019s what it seems most of you are becoming frustrated enough to believe.\n\nQualified minorities are treated like unicorns, because that\u2019s the definition of being a minority, they\u2019re rare. If under represented minorities were screwing over qualified majority applicants in any significant way, then wouldn\u2019t there be more in the field? More at your job? Most likely, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. You know what is? Even after all the diversity efforts from the company, 90% of the companies STEM employees are still White, Asian, and Indian men.\n\nA lot of you are frustrated that the market is in shambles and it\u2019s significantly harder to find work\u2026 but that\u2019s everyone across the board, even folks with experience are having a hard time. Stop explicitly blaming minorities for your lack of employment at big tech, it\u2019s not their fault. And when you have this sort of blanketed ideal toward minorities that they\u2019re all diversity hires and therefore less qualified than yourself, you\u2019re really just being as racist and discriminatory as the thing you\u2019re pointing your fingers at. If you can\u2019t be better, then you have no right to ask others to be.\n\nAs a minority who has worked in big tech in the past, who has been jobless and looking for work for over half a year now, I can assure you that no one is holding out a red carpet for me. I grind LeetCode and sys design just as much as the rest of you. I\u2019m not worse at my job just because I\u2019m different than the majority of SWEs.",

There are so many institutional sexist practices, whether you are aware or not. I don\u2019t even know all the subtleties of working while being a different color than white, but I bet it\u2019s absolutely disheartening, discouraging, and overall disgusting as well.\n\nThese diversity practices are implemented in most industries in order to combat the bullshit minorities have put up with their entire lives that have inherently set them up to have worse confidence, worse privilege, etc.",

            "I hate to say it but what your relative said absolutely confirms the problem of diversity hiring. Some people may think diversity hires are inferior in their skills. Personally I think that's an overly simplistic way of viewing diversity hiring and I think most people who have a problem with it share that sentiment. People's problem with it is, nobody should ever be at an advantage or disadvantage due to anything that classifies as a \"protected trait\". That is almost the textbook definition of the verb of \"prejudice\". \n\nYour feelings are totally valid as well. They are partially my argument against diversity hiring and that's, it creates space for resentment to build between coworkers on the grounds of they were hired due to something other than skillset.

And if you don\u2019t think you got the easier route, just imagine if you were white or Asian male, and see if you would gotten the same opportunity.

I know this as I am a very well-educated, skilled, experienced and talented underrepresented computer scientist and engineer.\n\nIt will require thick skin to handle this, but my advice is to develop a good support circle outside of work, get what you can out of an opportunity so that it will forward your career, but do not hesitate to get out of that role if it will not advance your learning as it could damage your spirit, and do not give up as you will eventually find the right place for you and/or an influential ally that will see you for the excellent talent that you are and will genuinely value your participation in their organization. \n\nAnd speak up for yourself in a calm and professional manner and document your experiences. If the organization does not properly address your concerns for the behaviors you are experiencing, then you really should consider moving on at your convenience. To this end, you should also learn how to appropriately assert your legal rights to opportunity and a workplace free of harassment.\n\nBut never give up! You deserve the opportunity to pursue the career that you desire for yourself.",

            "I would like to challenge your post and hear your genuine opinions on this, if you are willing to debate. \n\nIn actuality, humans are diverse in a multitude of ways. Gender, sexuality and race are only 3 categories in a pool of a million different other categories. So what makes a female candidate\u2019s perspective stand out from a male candidate\u2019s simply because of their gender? If you\u2019re telling me that the code that a woman writes is better than a male somehow? Or that a woman contributes more to Google\u2019s search algorithm because she\u2019s a female? If so, then I would understand the need for diversity hiring based on gender.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why there are these proxy \u201ccategories\u201d to judge someone based on what their group might represent in the talent pool. E.g. the African American community is on average less well-to-do thus hiring African Americans give a leg up to impoverished coders. Why can\u2019t you just directly hire based on social class instead of use this arbitrary proxy then?\n\nUltimately, I would argue that this discrimination will always come be present as long as diversity schemes exist. Unless you\u2019re saying that diversity hires provides NO BENEFIT at all to hiring (which defeats the purpose) how can you then say you were hired based on merit ALONE when you clearly got an advantage over others in the same position?\n\nI\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have the skill to do your job because ultimately, I wouldn\u2019t say SWE is so difficult that it\u2019s impossible to learn for most qualified applicants.

            "This doesn\u2019t negate from the fact the the applicant pool is cut from the very beginning. You said it yourself when they receive 1,000+ applicants.

I think we can all agree that if you put in the work you deserve the credit. \n\nBut from what I've seen 'diversity hires' would be people who never even studied for cs. Ex. in my last company they hired healthcare management and business majors. The closest major to cs that a 'diversity hire' had was IT, which in my college was 10x easier than comp sci. So as much as I would like to believe that diversity hires are given the same level of scrutiny, from my experience, they're not. And that's not to say that all companies don't test 'diversity hires' hard, it's just the ones I have seen don't.\n\nWhile I knew people struggling to find internships and jobs out of college as comp sci majors, I knew 'diversity hires' who have never done a leetcode in their life. People who have never had to work nearly as hard in their major. Granted this was a few years ago so maybe with the market being oversaturated companies may have ramped up the difficulty. \n\nThe truth is it's a complex situation.

And much to my surprise, it looks like at aggregate, they are doing amazing and there's no real changes in the job market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html)\n\n2023 was a rough year for many CS graduates. It was a rougher market than usual.\n\nBut then when you check out CMU CS career outcome for Bachelor's, it looks like the job market was booming.\n\n* 13 people to Jane Street. Such an insane outcome here.\n* Median salary is $135k and average salary is $150k. This implies the median graduate is getting into top tech firms because top tech firms have median salaries around this range (salary ignores bonus and RSUs).\n* 16 to Amazon (13 Amazon + 3 AWS), 13 Jane Street, 9 Microsoft, 7 Google, 7 Meta, 4 Netflix, etc. All insane numbers. And this was in 2023.\n\n[2023 BS in CS at CMU](https://preview.redd.it/c419p4rnz4mc1.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f30d2247fdcafc38c22c2eaaeb34b1cd1526514)\n\nAnd the numbers only get better for those with Master's and Doctor's at CMU. It looks like Jane Street loves CMU graduates (both undergrad and grad).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cornell](https://sonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#)\n\n2023 again was a rough year for CS. But again, the results seem similar to CMU CS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hiugjfpo05mc1.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32d02cad1dbe1f01651e2c59eb52690716fbd0b\n\n[Princeton](https://tableaupublic.princeton.edu/t/CareerServices/views/First-destinationData/Employment?%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y)\n\n2023 again was a rough year for CS.\n\nBut again, great outcomes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2eb0c0pg15mc1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2ebe0e1b291268e6fd6453c17e9b94973fe0dc2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdeally, I wanted to track all Stanford, MIT, UCB EECS, CMU and many more. But most schools don't seem to have data for 2023. However, I think the 3 schools I listed is more of an indicator of career outcomes for CS graduates at the top schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to post this for one reason only.\n\nIf you are a high school student who is serious about Computer Science and have the academics to get into top schools, then please seriously consider attending the elite schools. The job market for those who are graduating from schools like CMU for CS is still booming and honestly seem to be doing better than pre-pandemic.

Since coding is a logic process to put text and language in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome...Everyone's work will come back as highly plagiarized.\n\nBut if the students aren't idiots they can have chatGPT write code, verify that it works, check to make sure there isn't anything that wasn't taught in class in the code, swap out some code for less effective code, change some variable names, and add a ton of their own comments. Nobody would be able to prove for sure that chatGPT was used. \n\nChaptgpt is a language model. In its current form an instructor should be able to create any significant coding project in a manger that chatGPT can't create code that will work without the student going through and doing some major debugging effort. If they can do that they know the coding process enough they should pass. If the assignments are so simple chatGPT can solve them without that it's the professors issue.",

The goal is not to detect students who use very similar methods because in most cases the students will be completing the same assignment and therefore the methods will be almost identical.\n\nThe real use is to detect groups of students who all submit identical code, with zero changes except their name. Yes, there are only a few ways to define a function. But if your function, which does several data cleaning steps before outputting a dataframe is identical to three others students' function, I'm going to assume you cheated.\n\nStyle differences, variable naming, and all sorts of individual aspects will cause your code to look different. I only want to identify exact submissions so I know whether people have cheated.\n\nThe ChatGPT angle is a new one. I'm not sure if ChatGPT generates identical code to identical prompts or not, but it could absolutely be used in a similar way.",

        "selftext": "**Preface**\n\nI keep most of the specifics ambiguous so that I don't get doxxed but I try to give as accurate of a reading of my position as possible so that you have an idea of what's capable/likely.\n\n\n\n**Why listen to me?**\n\nI'm a senior graduating this semester (Spring 2021) at a low/non-ranked university. My school is somewhere between ranks 75 and 150 on [this list](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities) and also between ranks 75 and 150 on [this list](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings). I've interviewed at and gotten offers from 2 of (Google, FB, Apple, MSFT) and am going to be working at one of them when I graduate, and have gotten an offer from a unicorn that is one of (Airbnb, Doordash, Roblox, Tiktok, Square, Robinhood, Coinbase, Dropbox), I've done many big tech interviews so I'm familiar with the process, and I've been in positions where I've struggled to get interviews like many of you.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/aMIDAwB.png) is a Sankey diagram of my Fall 2020-Spring 2021 application season. Note that I have 26 OAs and only 11 next rounds. I don't think it was like this in the past (but maybe someone can testify for/against it) but some companies have started to resume screen *after* the OA instead of before. My leetcode count is 84/214/56 (easy/med/hard), my leetcode contest rating is >1800, and my codesignal is >845 so I'm pretty confident about how my performance on most of these coding challenges go and am familiar with the level of difficulty of the problems I see on these OAs. Despite this, I've only received 42% callback even though I'm confident I've optimally solved all problems in my OAs for 24 out of 26 of them (this is a pretty bold claim but if you take into consideration that the majority of the OAs are *significantly* less difficult than leetcode contests then it no longer seems so farfetched. I mean, seriously, most of these OAs are a joke. Citadel and Tiktok had notably difficult ones, most of the codesignal ones are pretty standardized and the hardest questions you'll get on these are harder meds or easier hards.)\n\n\n\nNon-doxxable (at least I hope so) background\n\nI went to a normal public school and did a lot of math competitions and some coding competitions. Didn't really do very much coding at all until my freshman/sophomore year of college though and any of you could probably be better at coding than high-school-me within 3 months.\nHad good success at math competitions and many interviewers have actually asked me about these competitions during the behavioral portion of interviews, in addition to them being very very good precursors for developing problem-solving ability prior to digging into CS.\n\n\n\n**Note that this isn't a guide you should follow year-to-year, but instead a general outline of progression. If you get lucky enough landing interviews and can manage to skip a year (for example, getting a SWE internship at big N your sophomore year) then you're probably familiar enough with the process to no longer need to follow a strict guide, or you can just follow the advice as a step-by-step process instead of strictly year-to-year.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Freshman Year**\n\nThis is when you have to be the most resourceful. Leverage any on-campus opportunities you have (other departments, IT offices, friends, family, etc.) to get any internship you can that lets you apply well-known technologies (Java, C/C++, Python, SQL, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, etc.). Mine paid <$10/hr and I wasn't doing it for the compensation; it was a great learning experience and I had supportive and helpful mentors/managers that just wanted to see me learn. Most of these interviews will only be behavioral. Just don't be a dick and you're good.\n\n\nMake friends, party a lot, and have fun. You're still in college after all. Grades do matter though, so try to keep them up. You just don't necessarily need a 4.0 to get interviews.\n\n\n**Sophomore Year**\n\nGetting some internship experience and working on personal projects can get your foot into the door for a lot of companies that like to interview *a lot* of people, and most of these can be very helpful as \"feeder companies\" to top companies (name-recognizable so that recruiters have some sort of indication of your capabilities and potential - similar to how companies love to hire from HYPMS + Berkeley/CMU because the average competency of those students is high). Amazon is the most accessible resource I'd recommend since they weigh OA very highly (if not entirely) for receiving interviews and I've been able to get OAs from them with next to nothing on my resume.\n\nLeverage sophomore and diversity internships (**especially** if you actually fit the target demographic). Many top companies have sophomore internships that have lower bars (both resume-screening and interviewing wise) and often lead to an automatic interview for the junior SWE positions. Some of these are, but not limited to: Google STEP, Microsoft Explore, Facebook University, Twitter University/Academy (?), etc.\n\n\n\n**Junior Year/Senior Year**\n\nGoing to combine these two since they're very similar processes, but instead of applying to SWE internships junior year you're just going to be applying to \"SWE New Grad\" postings senior year.\n\nThis is where it starts mattering a lot, and where I started taking the process a lot more seriously. As a student from a low ranked school you're going to have to make every interview count. Hopefully the previous internships you have will help you get interviews for more selective companies. It's hard to fully identify whether my previous internships helped due to confounding variables (covid recruiting season) but I think they did help a lot, since my callback from top companies was much better than in the past, despite the generality of recruiting being much worse this year, especially for new grads.\n\nMake a plan to leetcode regularly, keep track of applications via excel/spreadsheets or notion, and practice behavioral questions. The behaviorals aren't difficult to pass but you should make sure there aren't any common questions that could catch you off-guard; they're just a sanity check. Don't act like an arrogant prick and you should be fine. One of the best resources I've found that is uncommonly used is leetcode contests. They function as a time-sensitive environment (similar to interviews) that doesn't give you a hint at the topic of the problem beforehand. Often times doing random problems or doing problems off a list of topics gives you an idea of how to solve it before you even start, which eliminates some of the skill necessary to identify the approach. Grokking also saves you a ton of time by categorizing common topics and a providing built-in IDE to work with. $80 for a year subscription of it and $35/month for leetcode premium both go a long way.\n\n\nResources I've used for preparing for interviews:\n\n* CTCI (everyone's heard of this, it's a bit outdated especially in terms of difficulty of problems, but it's a great start)\n* Leetcode (duh)\n* Leetcode contests (underrated resource)\n* Grokking the coding interview (underused and also underrated resource)\n\n\n\n**Miscellaneous Advice**\n\n\n\n*Take every hint from your interviewer very seriously*\n\nOften times if you're going down a completely incorrect path, your interviewer will try to help you out with cleverly masked hints. Make sure you're listening to everything your interviewer is saying and don't lose track of anything. It's fine to ask them to repeat what they've said or to just ask for a moment to think. I often do this and while it's extremely important to vocalize your thoughts, I'll take 15 seconds of silence brainstorming every possible relevant approach over spouting nonsense that signals to the interviewer that you have no clue what you're talking about. \"Rubberducking\" is a very useful skill when practicing problems and can help you identify painpoints and obstacles. I wish I was better at simultaneously speaking and processing everything/running through all the possibilities, but I'm not. And that's fine. (As far as I know). Just don't take it too far and have 10 minutes of complete silence between you and your interviewer; pass ideas through them if you need more time to think. You get additional time to think while they're giving their thoughts on your brainstorms.\n\n\n\n*Quant/HFT*\n\n\nThis is a topic that everyone seems to be discussing about nowadays since these firms have very high bars and pay a lot. I know a lot of people that now work at these firms from high school competitions (they even start recruiting (maybe not recruiting for positions *right now* per se, but familiarizing talented kids with their names so they know to apply later once they start college) as early as high school, many of these firms came to math competitions and gave out swag/held presentations) and if your goal is big tech then I wouldn't recommend pursuing these opportunities (as a trader) unless you already have previous math competition experience or have already taken probability/stats courses. The interviews are only tangentially related to big tech interviews and you may not have time to prepare for both; they often ask leetcode but also supplement it with probability/stats brain teasers and much more. Some common topics you should be familiar with are bayes theorem, markov chains, general statistics knowledge, etc. They're also a lot more flexible with what your major is; you can major in physics, math, statistics, computer science, whatever as long as you're from a good school and demonstrate competency.\n\n\n\n*Learn how to filter information from the Internet*\n\nThere's a lot of useful information on this subreddit and /r/cscareerquestions but I've seem some pretty egregious advice being upvoted. Some people will have their linkedin or name attached to their reddit profiles too and I've seen the same people give advice about trading firms or top tech companies while having absolutely zero experience working at or passing interviews for these companies. It's like the blind leading the blind... Learn how to filter this out. If you're hearing something for the first time then do what's in your power to find other sources that verify this information. If it's hard to find anything, it's unlikely that person is giving helpful advice.\n\n\n\n*Don't cheat yourself*\n\nWhen I'm tired or frustrated I'll peek at the solution/discuss page for leetcode problems I'm working on, but it's generally not a great thing to do unless you're completely stuck. I'd recommend spending at least 45 mins on a problem before giving up and reading the solution, and sometimes you can make a lot more progress reading the solution instead of wasting another 2 hours staring at a problem until something pops into your mind.\n\n\n*Mediums are the best \"bang for your buck\"*\n\nI realized pretty early on (maybe ~40 or so problems) that easies didn't teach much, but they're a good precursor if you're uncomfortable with mediums. Easies are probably enough for most sophomore programs/internships. Mediums and easier-hards are generally what you'll face for big tech. Hards can be more common for very selective unicorns.",

            "Hey man, thank for posting this \u2014 I am also heading into a state uni, and I think this is extremely helpful as an upcoming freshman. \n\nDo you have any more advices as to what I can do the summer before I head for the fall semester ? Also how many courses should I load myself up with and how to balance that with job, exercising, clubs, sleep and friends ?",

            "Interesting post. As background, I graduated in CS/Math many moons ago (from a currently ranked top 30 CS program - public U).  I have hired in tech/CS and my spouse currently also does so for an east coast based fortune 500 software company as a tech VP (also a public U grad).  AND one of our kids is currently doing CS at a top 15 program on the linked list (not a private - chosen because it was a debt free economically sound choice).  \n\nThis is going to sound like rhetoric, but it's MUCH more about you and what you do your college years and how you show initiative, tech skills, leadership, people skills, etc.   Heck, some schools that rank high get reps as certain companies as putting out less technically competent grads.  Every company is different.  Everyone hiring is different.  Don't take it personally if you don't get an interview.  My kid is at a top 15.  Plenty of grads out of that program flounder too.  Employers aren't lining up - everyone has to create their own experience and make their own case for hiring.  That doesn't mean their isn't nepotism but there isn't a lot of point to fighting that battle. \n\nThe big companies get so much hoopla and press.  Both my spouse and I actually job hopped several times as young professionals.  I learned and was given so much more responsibility at the smaller quirkier start ups.  Your first job doesn't need to be your last job.  Find something in the direction you are hoping to go, give it 18-24 months and start putting out feelers.  My public U spouse manages MIT grads regularly.   I know plenty of people that went from obscure company A to fancy company B with the right experience and references. And I also know plenty of people who weren't super impressed working for fancy company B anyway.  As you move through your career to change jobs, it becomes as much as finding a fit for a place you would find pleasant to work and not trying to mold yourself exactly to what you'd imagine some fantasy company might want.\n\nGood luck new grads and congrats!",
