If you are about to be a senior this upcoming fall do your future self a favor by working your ass off this summer and the following school year to get that job lined up. You will thank me for saying this because I was able to have a job lined up and it feels good knowing you have something to look forward to. I hear countless people becoming depressed being unemployed or underemployed after graduating because they did not do internships or waited to find ft jobs after graduating. Trust me. You don\u2019t want to \u201cwait after you graduate\u201d to apply for jobs. You will slowly lose your new grad title the longer you become unemployed and it typically takes more than 4 months for companies to get back to you for interviews. It\u2019s a tough market out there. Prioritize job search over school if your classes aren\u2019t that hard and this is coming from a new grad",

After 6 months, it starts to look bad to potential employers that you haven't secured a job yet.

At that point your only hope is to hit the reset button and go to grad school for another shot at internships/new grad status.   \n\nDon't let this be you.

        "selftext": "I will start bragging about my failures now. Even if I get many downvotes, hopefully the mods won't remove this because I want this to be a reminder to myself in the future.\n\nI did a 9-month co-op at a tiny tiny company starting 2020. First 3 months I did very well and they loved me and gave me my own customer project as an intern, but then I fucked up big time on a customer project and they held that as a grudge and did not give me a full-time offer in August 2021. I was too embarrassed about not getting an offer, so I told everyone I know that this company is actually giving me an offer, but it is too low and I want to take a risk and apply for better offers.\n\nI knew nothing about Leetcode in Aug 2021 and fell into deep depression, and succumbed to my ADHD until October 2021. I started applying in October for full time SWE positions.\n\nMy first OA was Twitter, which every applicant got one automatically. I did not get a single testcase correctly. I started leetcoding like once per week since my best friend was doing it.\n\nThe plan was to graduate in Dec 2021, but I was failing my classes so I had to extend my visa (I'm international std) and plan to grad in Spring 2022. \n\nFrom October to December 2021: failed Roblox OA, failed IMC OA, Twilio said I did great and kept sending me emails until now, but no interview. I got Goldman Sachs Hireview interview, which I prepared for so much but failed miserably nonetheless. I got Amazon OA, which had 2 questions, I got 1 and only passed one testcase for question 2. I did good on TikTok, Palantir, and SambaNova OAs.\n\nJamuary 2022: I got interviews for TikTok, Palantir, and SambaNova Systems. Sambanova actually passed me to the final round, but then the second interviewer asked what is a cache, and I had no idea what that is. He then asked how are local variables stored in C, I had no idea either. Failed my first final interview, felt pretty shit, and I was burnt out. I did well on Palantir's interview, but they rejected me anyway. I had an awful interview experience with TikTok and expected nothing, but they just gave me a second interview last week and I bombed it.\n\nFebruary 2022: somehow Amazon gave me final round with 3x45. I leetcoded for 5 days straight before the interview. First interviewer gave me a directory and asked me to write \"maintainable production code\" on a short question. I was confused AF and wrote some class and she said this is not maintainable. I had to pretend that my wifi connection is becoming weak and I could not hear her, but in reality, I did not know how tf to write \"maintainable production code\". At the end, I admitted I did terribly, and coasted through the next 2 interviews.\n\nMeta recruiter reached out and gave me a LC interview. Auto rejected next day. At this point, I have made peace with the fact that I am going back home after graduation with no jobs. I was sad, but I had to convince myself that it is okay. I am too burnt out to keep applying. I made peace  with the fact that I didn't get into Ivy League in 2017, so why would why I get into FAANG now? My soul is tired. I probably need to go home and rest. Bc of the pandemic, I have not met my parents since 2019. \n\nI got an offer last week for FAANG. If you actually read my rant, you will know which one. It felt great, but I have a deep understanding for those who are still on the grind, especially those with ADHD. It is such a soul crushing process, and I was a lucky one. I sincerely hope those who are burnt out to find the strength to keep going. If you choose to give up, I hope you find peace and accept that it is okay, even though it is so hard to do so. \n\nIn Vietnamese, there is a saying: Thua keo n\u00e0y, b\u00e0y keo kh\u00e1c. It means if you lose this round, start planning for a different round, or something like that. Idk. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, just wrapped up the 2022 New Grad recruiting process and thought I would share my experience with you all. I learned a lot from this sub throughout the past few years, so I wanted to give back a little.\n\n### Stats\n\nLet me start by sharing my stats to ground the discussion:\n\nUniversity: UC Berkeley (Senior)\n\nGPA: 3.92/4.00\n\nPast Experience:\n\n* Sophomore year: Household name non-tech company (think big bank, retail store, etc.) \n* Junior year: Local Series-B no-name startup\n\nAlongside the above information, I had a year of TAing at Berkeley (1 semester for our DS class and another for the Discrete Math + Prob class) and a year of research. \n\n### Application Numbers\n\nHere is how the 2022 job search panned out: \n\n* Applied: 121\n* OA received: 42\n* Phone screens: 19\n* Onsites: 8\n* Offers: 7 (5 new from onsites, 2 conversions from internships)\n* Withdrew: 17 (stopped moving forward through the recruiting process because I already had offers which I knew I would take over the company I was withdrawing from)\n\n### New Offers\n\n**Google (Accepted)**\n\nCompensation: \n\n* Base: $131k\n* RSU: $170k (negotiated up from $125k using FB, L3 standard is $100k) (33/33/22/12)\n* Bonus: $30k (negotiated up from $25k using FB, L3 standard is $15k)\n* Relocation: $8.4k\n* TC Year 1: $217k\n* 4 Years Total: $724k\n\n\nRecruiting Process:\n\n* Initial Application: End of August (with referral)\n* OA: Received the OA end of Sep\n * Got 1 question completely correct (they have hidden tests but I felt pretty confident in it)\n * Couldn't figure out how to solve the other question so gave brute force solution\n* Onsite: Had onsite scheduled for mid Oct\n * Had 5 interviews (1x30min behavioral and 4x45min technical) in one day\n * 2 of the technicals had 2 questions each (with followups) (all mediums), got optimal for all\n * The remaining two had 1 question each (with followup), got optimal for one (medium difficulty)\n * For the other, it was really hard in my mind since it tested combinatorial logic. Needed a *lot* of help from the interviewer to get the 'trick', after that the actual code was trivial since it was just a math problem.\n * Except for that outlier, a lot of graph/tree based questions\n* Offer: \n * After the onsite, was moved on to the hiring team 1 day later (asked them to hurry since had FB deadline pending)\n * One week later, was asked to fill form for product matching\n * One week later, received the offer, took a few days to negotiate using FB\n\n**Facebook**\n\nCompensation: \n\n* Base: $124k\n* RSU: $150k (25/25/25/25)\n* Bonus: $75k\n* Relocation: $8k\n* TC Year 1: $237k\n* 4 Years Total: $721k\n\n\nRecruiting Process:\n\n* Initial Application: Mid August (with referral)\n* Phone Screen: Had phone screen early Sep \n * Got 2 med questions (with follow ups) within 45 min, got all optimal\n* Onsite: Had onsite scheduled next week (mid Sep)\n * Had 5 interviews (1x45min behavioral and 4x45min technical) split in 2 days (typical for FB is 3 technicals, mine was 1 extra)\n * All technicals had 2 questions (with follow ups), got all optimal except for one question (needed some hints from interviewer)\n * Lots of array questions and graph/tree questions\n* Offer: \n * After the onsite, received an offer one week later (end of Sep)\n * According to recruiter, FB stopped negotiating this year (before they would at least negotiate sign-on bonus) and no matter how hard I tried, they did not budge. It could just be a negotiation tactic but even after presenting my Google offer, they still did not move (or maybe I'm just shit at negotiations lol)\n\n**Amazon**\n\nCompensation:\n\n* Base: $120k\n* RSU: $88k (5/15/40/40) \n* Bonus: $47.5k (year 1) / $23k (year 2)\n* Relocation: $7k\n* TC Year 1: $172k\n* 4 Years Total: $639k\n\n\nRecruiting Process:\n\n* Initial Application: End of August (with referral)\n* OA 1: Start of Sep (one week after applying)\n * Got all test cases for the first question, timed out on the last 2 tests for the second question so overall was something like 10/12 or 11/13 (forgot exact num of tests)\n* OA 2: 2 days after OA 1\n * Focused on LPs and answered best as I could according to which option was closest to the relevant LP\n* Onsite: Received a response 1 day after OA 2 for 1x30min interview\n * The onsite was really chill, spent first 5-10min talking about possible optimizations on OA1 solution and the remaining time just discussing Amazon culture + growth opportunities, etc.\n* Offer: \n * Received official offer 1 week after onsite, was told that they do not negotiate and didn't bother trying to so no clue if it's a negotiation tactic or not\n\nFor the remaining offers, I'll just briefly go over them since this has already gone too long and I've covered the ones most people will probably have questions about. \n\n**The Voleon Group**\n\nCompensation:\n\n* Base: $150k\n* Bonus: $80k\n* TC Year 1: $230k\n* 4 Years Total: $680k\n\nRecruiting Process:\n\n* Applied early Aug (no referral), received phone screen invite end of Aug, received onsite invite early Sep, received offer end of Sep\n\n**Series D AI Start Up**\n\nCompensation:\n\n* Base: $140k\n* RSU: $150k (25/25/25/25)\n* Bonus: $25k\n* TC Year 1: $203k\n* 4 Years Total: $735k\n\nRecruiting Process:\n\n* Applied mid Oct, received OA 3 days later, phone screen invite a week after, the onsite invite 2 days later and offer a week after that\n\n### Leetcode\n\nIn terms of Leetcode prep, here is my distribution of questions practiced: \n\n* Easy: 50\n* Medium: 104\n* Hard: 11\n* Unique Total Questions: 165\n* Overall Total Questions: 231 (since did some common questions multiple times)\n\nIn terms of practice, I started with the Blind 75, did some of the most frequent ones from the Top 100 list by LC itself, and then the remaining ones were when I grinded for specific companies using their tagged questions (using LC Premium).\n\nWith regards to the interview process, I specifically grinded for Google and FB only. For FB, LC was king: I had 2 questions in my phone screen and 2x4 questions for my onsite for a total of 10 questions (and each had a follow up verbal question). Out of these 10, 9 of them were *directly* from the most frequent FB questions on LC (somewhere in the ~ top 30-40). Hence, grinding these questions out before the interviews was immensely helpful. \n\nIn comparison, for Google, the tagged list was absolutely useless. None of them were related to the most frequently listed ones, and not a single question I was asked in any of my Google interviews (OA or onsite) was something I had seen before (either in Blind, top 100, or anywhere else).\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\nNow that I've described everything, here are some lessons I learned during this interview process:\n\n* I know some people say that referrals don't really matter, but in my personal experience, referrals were extremely helpful. I only asked for referrals from 6 companies from my friends and ended up getting to at least the phone screen stage for all 6 of them. \n* In terms of LC, here's something I learned throughout the past few months: the process is *insanely* daunting in the beginning. Throughout college, every year I would tell myself that I need to grind LC to get the good internships, but every time I would start, I would struggle so hard with just the 'easy' questions and it felt absolutely soul-crashing + demoralizing. This continued until last summer where a switch just flipped in my head and I realized I needed to do something or I would graduate without a good job and so I just started with Blind 75. I didn't think what was 'optimal' or if there was a 'better' resource etc because according to my past experience, I would research and find all these amazing LC resources but never really stick to doing the actual questions, making them moot. This time, I did a single question every day, no matter what else I had to do, no matter how busy I was (if I was really busy, I just did a quick easy question I had already done before in 15-20 min). I did it first thing in the morning right after breakfast so that I could get it done early on and stop worrying about it. After a month or two, I slowly internalized the patterns and it was insane how I started figuring out what I needed to do for specific types of questions. Hence, for anyone struggling with LC, my advice is to give something similar to what I did above a try and see if that might help :)\n* Sites like AngelList and TripleByte are really helpful if you're applying for smaller scale start ups. Considering how fast the process to apply is on these sites (sometimes literally one click), I found out that I received a surprisingly high percentage of responses. They allow you to set your preferences (such as really early stage - 5-10 people - startups or established ones etc) so you can tailor it to what you're looking for. In the end, quite a few of them reached out to me through Email/LinkedIn etc to schedule phone screens and onsites.\n* See if your university has a policy regarding offer deadlines: Berkeley CS has a policy of recommending companies to allow up to Nov 1st for offer deadlines. I found out that if a company gives an offer deadline earlier than that, you can let them know about the policy and they will typically respect it. I was able to use it to get an extension for Amazon and my friends used it to get extensions for some other firms as well (be aware though that some companies straight up don't give a fuck though e.g. Microsoft told my friend to confirm their decision by mid Sep or fuck off)\n* In terms of negotiations, I would highly recommend reading some of the popular posts out there ([this](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) one is quite commonly cited) since I was not aware of a lot of the subtle things recruiters due to swing the conversation in their favor. While both FB and Amazon stone-walled me with their no-negotiation policy, the lessons learned reading these posts were quite helpful when negotiating my Google offer (although I assume having a competing FB offer to match played the largest role)\n* One thing I realized throughout the interview process was that your interviewer makes a world of difference. A good interviewer can literally be the deciding factor between acing an interview and completely bombing it. There were some interviews where the interviewer was so articulate, so clear in their explanation, and knew exactly the right amount of nudges to give when I got stuck that interviewing with them was a breeze. On the other hand, I also had interviews where I could clearly see that the interviewer had difficulty even understanding what I was trying to tell them, seemed completely disinterested, was extremely dogmatic by focusing on one single solution and constantly fishing for it, rejecting everything else. The worst were interviewers who were completely unresponsive, where I would try to engage with them and discuss my thought processes and feel as if I was talking to a brick wall: they would either stay silent the entire time or give one syllable answers. These interviews were really hard to get through - even when I knew the correct answer, I would second guess myself, I would be unclear about the requirements of the questions/the constraints imposed, I would be unsure of what they wanted me to return, all because we simply weren't on the same wavelength in terms of communication. \n\n### Mentality\n\nMentality is everything: one thing I realized throughout this recruiting process was that the way you mentally approach it is immensely influential. I'll share my personal experience in the hope that it might help some of you out. In my group of friends, I'm the 'dumb' one. I've never been bothered by embracing that label since I realized all the way back in high school that there is always someone smarter/better. However, it is a fact that all of my friends are much more accomplished career-wise: I remember sitting with three of my friends in our dorms in freshman year at the end of the Fall semester and each of them had an upcoming internship next semester at Facebook, Google, and Amazon respectively (literally, I'm not making it up, straight up those 3 lol). In one way this is good because it encourages you to be better yourself and enables you to struggle more to overcome your past self. However, if any of you are in this position, I would urge you caution since - at least in my case - it ended up being a hindrance as it made me believe that you needed to be an absolutely insane person to get offers from these popular companies. Hell, maybe that even is true, but the result of that mentality was that I *had already given up before I had started*. Throughout sophomore year and junior year, I didn't bother applying to these places when there applications came out since I thought there was no point and only applied really late (think March/April) since then I could delude myself into the argument that I only got rejected because I had applied so late. If any of you have caught yourself doing these kind of mental gymnastics, I would highly urge you to take a deep breath, embrace that *really* uncomfortable feeling of putting yourself out there and risking rejection, and still apply. This year, I kept track of when applications got released for popular firms and applied as soon as they came out, resulting in a response rate that is night and day from my previous one (obviously, considering how late I was previously applying). Anyways, sorry for rambling, but at the end I just wanted to share my personal experience in case someone can relate to some of it and if so, can seek encouragement from it :) \n\nSince we're on the topic of mentality, another factor that I think was really important and extremely helpful during the recruiting process was exercise: I suffer quite heavily from depression and anxiety (have been clinically diagnosed since freshman year) and I remember going through my FB interview. I went in extremely anxious since it was my first time doing an onsite for a company of FBs level and it ended up being this 3hr long slug fest that drained the life out of me. By the end of it, I was shaking from the adrenaline rush and just in really weird state. I decided to go out for a run and ended up just running and running until I had vented out all the anxiety and pressure and gotten back to normal. Hence, for those of you who can relate to such experiences, I would highly advise having something similar, a kind of 'vent' that you can use to release this build up of emotions during this highly stressful time, regardless of what it is. For me it was exercise, for you it could be reading a book, playing an instrument, losing yourself in a video game, whatever, have something where you can sink into the mindlessness of the activity and calm yourself down again, it helps a lot. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nAnyways, I hope this insanely long post has helped some of you out. I don't really know if all of it will be relevant to everybody, but hopefully you will find some parts of it resonate with your own experiences, and you'll be able to take those parts and make something out of them. In the end, I personally tied off my 2022 new grad search by accepting my Google offer a few days ago. It boiled down to FB vs Google in my case and I found it to be quite a hard decision since working at either company was a dream come true for last year me. I went with Google because after all the constant struggles I've been through in college, I'm hoping to take it a bit easier after graduation and I heard Google has a slightly better work life balance. However, for those of you who are interested in working on really cool stuff and climbing through the promotions ladder fast, most people I've talked to recommend FB as the ideal place for that. \n\nAnother reason why I chose Google was because I'm an international student, and I've read on Blind that FB is having some immigration issues with some law case of theirs stuck in limbo, so for international students, I would recommend doing your due diligence and making sure to pick the company that aligns with your future plans. \n\nHope the post helped, please feel free to ask questions in the comments :)",

            "\\>  what really did it was NETWORKING.  \n\nI've posted this many times and I'm always downvoted. Congratulations on your position and congratulations on getting out and meeting humans.",
            "Hey congratulations!!! I\u2019m happy to see some positivity in the CS environment right now and I can happily tell you worked very hard for this :D",
            "Quick add in for those asking about Networking:\n\nI used LinkedIn primarily to network. First I found people who graduated from my university and were Security Engineers (obviously target those who are working in what you want to do) - using that commonality between us I\u2019d say something like \u201chey my name is xxxx I\u2019m attending xxxx and saw you also attended and are doing what I want to do\u201d and lead the conversation from there. Next is network in person at internships, my first internship was a result of a LinkedIn conversation. My second was a result of people I met at the first. The third was the same and using that huge network of people I wiggled myself into this position. \n\nMake the connections meaningful learn about the person you\u2019re talking to, perhaps even meet them in the city or something :)\n\nObviously use correct grammar and present yourself nicely. Don\u2019t talk like you talk on Reddit \ud83d\ude02",

            "I had similiar situation. Worked in a local grocery store for 3 years and did not have the luck to get an internship after applying constantly. I started my junior year and I now have 4 offers. GE Aviation, Cisco, Kroger and JP Morgan. I\u2019m currently working with kroger and accepted GE and Cisco. Never ever give up. In additional to that I did not apply non of these jobs. Your time will came and remember everyone has a different journey. Pray and be grateful. My package offer contains a pay thats more than what most of my friends got working for FAANG. Believe that you can and you\u2019re halfway there.\n\nBtw Congrats!\n\nAll the best to everyone that\u2019s looking for an opportunity.",

Come junior year, I interviewed for JPMorgan and was so sure I messed up the behavioral interview, and I could not believe it when they have me an offer. Capital One and Mathworks soon followed.
