So I am a 6th grader in middle school and one day want to work at the big company Google. I know it is very hard but I can work very hard. I want to get an internship this summer so I can be ready when I am in college and have experience. Do you guys think I should do leetcode now or wait till high school? Thank you!",

            "You\u2019re fucked dude. Too little, too late. Maybe work on some side projects, leetcode, and get internships before grade school in your next life. \n\nI guess you might still have a shot at going to amazon if you start now, but going there is career suicide compared to staying unemployed.",

            "I can\u2019t tell if this is a joke post or not. But in the event that it isn\u2019t I\u2019d suggest doing a coding summer camp or a summer class at a local college. You can also participate in Google\u2019s Summer of Code. I did coding camps over the summer as a 7th and 8th grader and took a class over the summer after my freshman year of high school. I didn\u2019t have my first cs internship until after my sophomore year of college and I\u2019m interning at a big company this upcoming summer. Bottom line: do something that will allow you to learn coding but is also really fun. You only have one childhood don\u2019t stress too much about the future. You will be plenty stressed when hit adulthood.",
            "Awesome....so you should probably go play with your friends, get a dog, do sports, and eat snacks! Have fun!",
            "I would be very surprised if someone offered an internship at any point in middle school (not only because you probably don\u2019t have enough experience yet, but minor labor laws are complicated in some places, if you are even old enough). \n\nThat being said, keep working on all kinds of little and maybe medium sized projects, they\u2019ll be very valuable to you as you learn and you can show them off as independent experience from a young age. Companies want someone who is highly motivated and thinking about internships now is a very good sign. \n\nLeetcode may be a bit much for you right now, but no one is stopping you, so just try your hand at it. Finding any activities outside of school that deal in computer science and programming like Robotics is also a good place to get started on real world programming and application of your ideas. Good luck in your school career!",

Think about it: would you rather hire a college kid or a 6th grader?\n\nTo be honest with you: just enjoy your life, dude. Everything is still ahead of you. If you really want to get experience, try to build your own product (mobile app, website, whatever). My cousin built an app in 9th grade that earned him more than $100K, which is much better than any internship. Also, try to explore other interesting things like math and physics.",

            "sorry but, you should have started coding in the womb. if you can\u2019t do operating systems by now, u should probably just switch to business. just my advice tho!",
            "Ok ,other than a lot of smart people who have been giving you very smart advice I have had 4 internships before I finish college. I graduate this semester as an engineer. Now I really like your ambition but here are some facts that are going to make this impossible:\n1. You can do as much leetcode as you want, however there are some topics like data structures and algorithms, dynamic programming, intro to ML etc etc that are asked in coding interviews. For you to be able to understand the theory behind these concepts you need base of higher calc, higher linear algebra and discrete math. End of story, you need it. CS is applied math in some colleges. \n2. Forget Amazon. I am probably equally as ambitious as you are, just to let you know that, I was invited by the US govt in my 9th grade to visit and take courses at NASA, Huntsville Alabama. Talking about internships, companies see you as a FT employee. They would NEVER spend 4-7k a month in someone, for who it will take 10 years to graduate. They rather hire an UG for the same role. Pay him 4-7k, and then hire him after he graduates. Rather than waiting for you. \n3. The computers won\u2019t let you in, the screening algorithms will pull you out of line the moment you apply. Why? Because ALL the application in tech companies require you to be atleast masters, even the contract positions. \n4. Say you get internship after covid, in Seattle. Will you be willing to move there ? Will you drive to work? \nI am not saying it\u2019s impossible, it is not. But understand over here you are not fighting for the one requisition. You are fighting against the way professional world works. For you to gain attention, go to a hackathon organized by google, Amazon , IBM and get ranked 1. That\u2019s what would matter. Your brain needs to be developed to understand all the CS math. So start when you get in high school. \nI am not trying to push you down here, I am so happy students like you exists. I am just trying to show you the reality. Also ignore these idiots who are being sarcastic. Probably doing museum  sciences at some college.",

They will learn sooner about openings or they will just tell you things that are needed in their jobs in normal conversations. Go to events, talk to more people. Don't push, just keep human relations. Keeping your family and those people appart is the opposite from what you should do. Specially your family.\n\nThird, there is usually a lot of options to keep learning for free these days, so do it. It is not just about applying daily but applying smartly.

            "Hey let me tell you that when I was in undergrad, it was incredibly hard to get an internship even in the US (2016). I obtained my internship opportunity through networking heavily. I failed many interviews as well but I never gave up on practicing coding questions. Back then leetcode was only a startup. There were very little resources. Girl, you gotta keep on practicing coding questions and keep talking to people in your class and people more senior than you. I would have missed the Amazon mass OA if not for my friends in college. That gave me a job lasted 5 years and 6 figure straight out of college.",

It\u2019s just the market and not you. \n\nPractical advice: \n\nI would work on open source. Either your own projects or  existing ones. It can supplement a cv. Think of it as your time for freedom to create what interests you. When you have a job, that goes away unless you\u2019re lucky. \n\nFind non-programming office jobs that could benefit from automation, like places that churn out a lot of manual spreadsheets. Your boss will love you and you can also build experience.",

I just secured my accounting internship at a big 4 and had only like ~6 applications sent out and got 3 interviews, and accepted my first offer before even having to attend the other 2.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m well aware many of you guys will go off to companies that make a big 4 look like peanuts (and make hell of a lot more). \n\nBut fuck me, 13 interviews sounds like hell. Let alone the guys that go through that gauntlet and then don\u2019t even get an offer.",
