        "selftext": "Hello fellow CS Majors. This is just going to be a vent post because I'm feeling really depressed right now, and I don't really know what else to do. I guess I just want to speak to my CS colleagues anonymously, because I don't feel comfortable saying this in my IRL environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am \"undocumented\" in the United States by way of visa overstay. Throughout high school and up til now, I was never able to work anywhere that required work authorization (so, basically everywhere). My father still has work authorization through some convoluted process before our visas expires, so he's basically been the sole provider for our family. My mother has a chronic illness and is in need of an organ transplant, which we can't get because of our shitty state provided poverty insurance and we need another to supplement it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, yeah. I did not have the most privileged childhood. Our utilities would get disconnected every now and then. My school had exactly zero STEM opportunities, and I had to learn coding on this atrocious laptop from the late 90s (in the late 2000s). It was bad. There was no way we could afford college, but I grinded in high school, got a perfect ACT, and got a full ride based on merit to a T5 CS school. That was wonderful. A weight off our shoulders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, my parents were getting older by that point. I didn't see how my dad was going to keep working. Every year I would ask about our legal status, and every year he'd say \"you'll get it next year.\" I should have responded to his temerity with doubt, but of course as a naive teenager I held out some foolish sense of hope that it would actually come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNewsflash, it's now my final year in university and it never did. By all means, I believe I did make the most of what I have. I maintained a 3.9 major GPA. I could not do any internships in my years at college, despite FAANG recruiters reaching out to me, which was quite sad. The only things I could do were unpaid, so I found a research position at my school and grinded away in that like I did in high school. I produced a few papers that were accepted in the likes of AAAI and ICML.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, last summer, a glimmer of hope appeared. DACA had been reinstated! I quickly filed an application with the help of my school's undocumented center (to which I owe a great deal of commendation to, as they guided me through navigating university with my status). It was the first time my family felt hope in a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did my biometrics, and everything was looking good. Then, a week later\u2026the ruling on Texas\u2019 challenge to DACA. All applications stopped. Silence. Nothing to say, really. Just silence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was our last hope as our immigration petition filed at the beginning of the last decade will be adjudicated in 2025, far too long, and my father will be far too old by then to work. This was a huge blow. It was such a strange feeling, going back for my fourth and final year of my undergraduate experience, and trying to make the best of it and have fun after the isolation of the pandemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith every party I go to, or every friend I get boba with, this eventuality hangs over my head, like a dark cumulonimbus: I have no viable path after graduation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so, in the thick of recruiting season, I still apply to jobs. Foolishly, of course. I have to indicate that I am not authorized, and that I will need sponsorship. Which is technically the case, except I can't really be sponsored since I'm out of status. Nonetheless, I do it because I don't know what else to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI pass Microsoft's resume screen for their new grad SWE. Then their phone screen. Then they invite me to their final rounds. I grind Leetcode for two weeks straight. In the back of my head, a constant resound: \"Why?\" I know nothing will result from this process. But yet, I do it. Again, foolish hope that \\*somehow\\* they'll be able to hire me. I know it's not going to end well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter many sleep deprived nights grinding Leetcode, I do well in the final round interviews. Maybe more than \"well\", as you'll see in the email I got from the recruiter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"From: <[verynicerecruiter@microsoft.com](mailto:verynicerecruiter@microsoft.com)\\>\n\nSubject: Microsoft Interview Results\n\nTo: You should've known it was going to end like this, idiot <[idiot@t5csschool.edu](mailto:idiot@t5csschool.edu)\\>\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello \\[me\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to follow up with you as I've been able to confirm results from your interviews with us - unfortunately Microsoft will not be moving forward with an offer at this time due to your current out of status status while living in the United States. I realize this final outcome may be disappointing but know that you reached a stage of the campus recruiting process that an extremely small portion of applicants achieve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstandably, we are often asked to provide guidance from interviews, but unfortunately, we are unable to share specific feedback. However, we can tell you that we received exemplary feedback from all your interviewers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to interview with us. We really appreciate your interest in Microsoft and if that interest continues, we welcome you to re-apply within a year. If you have any questions about next steps with Microsoft otherwise, please reach out to your designated recruiter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a pleasure hosting you at Microsoft and I hope that you enjoyed your time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to you moving forward!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery Nice Recruiter\n\nMicrosoft University Recruiting\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess it's cool that I basically passed the final round? I guess I did pass the resume screen, phone screen, and final round at one of the most prestigious tech companies in the world. And I knew there was no way I was getting an offer. But still, I feel\u2026empty? Not necessarily sad, or disappointed. Just empty. Knowing that I did do all of that, and it's just this fucking thing that is out of my control. I didn't ask to be brought here before I could form sentences and be subjected to these conditions. But now, I'm dealing with the consequences of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also looked at PhD programs. Same deal. Research assistantships or Teaching assistantships require work authorization, which is part of the funding for the degree. This was the same answer from all T20 CS PhD programs. The undoc center and I spent a good three days talking to all of them and confirming this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess it's just that it was abstract before. Like, oh, I \\*know\\* I can't get a job. But now, it's real. Material. I got through all the rounds, and my status stopped me from going further. I \\*see\\* I can't get a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friends have asked me to hang out with them, but I don't feel like being social at all right now. I've told them as much. It feels like all the things I knew were going to be issues from the past few years are coming to a head. Oh well. That bottle of Ciroc in the fridge is tempting.",

            "It is possible to be passionate about information technology and understand that a career in software development is ultimately just a job and a way to earn a living.\n\nFor example, I got started in the '80s when almost nobody had a home computer of any kind. I learned to program because I love building stuff, and delivering new tools to users who get real value from what I made. That passion had kept me going through childhood, university, and now over 20 years of professional career.\n\nAll that said, I have a life and other interests. I do not practice leet code. I do not believe side projects should be required or even considered a part of a healthy balanced life. I believe side projects are something you do when you have an idea that's so awesome you can't help yourself, work sucks, or during periods of mania (which I think we all experience to some extent). I do not believe in tying my identity to being a programmer, and I especially do not believe in tying my identity to a specific programming language or toolkit or environment. (I think that attitude puts one at risk of obsolescence.)\n\nI have a family, and friends, and I regularly practice and improve at music.\n\nI do not claim to have all the answers or even necessarily know what's best. I've been looking for work for over 9 months. The current market is brutal. There does seem to be a preference for the obsessive leet coder types, which obviously I'm not, although I rarely have much trouble solving the technical problems thrown at me during an interview.\n\nI'm also very interested in software entrepreneurship, and finding like-minded people to invent a product together with, and make it happen together. I hope one day somebody will read what I'm saying here and chat me up. Most software is too big and complex to work on it alone.\n\nSorry for so completely jumping the shark.",

He could tolerate the patients most of the time, but all his nurses, front desk, and billing staff were women and he couldn't stand them. Didn't like men much either, but didn't hate them as much as women. He didn't last long enough to pay off his student loans- maybe lasted 5 years max in private practice?  Some people will be so miserable in some jobs that no amount of money is worth it.\n\nSo, yeah. Only the tiniest portion of devs would keep dev-ing if they won a $100 million lottery- we're all here in large part for the money.

Real savants who are just completely enamored with their subject matter are legitimately few and far between, and even then, the nature of employment will likely be the most soul-sucking application and elements of that skillset.",

I grew up programming, loved it, then went through a phase in late high school/freshman year of college where I was only in it for the money. The idea of going into CS sounded terrible to me as I was much more passionate about music at the time, fully convinced I could make it as a musician.\n\nNonetheless, I still went into CS out of fear of employability and hated myself for it. Now, I'm happy I made the choice. After starting at my current company I realized I actually love doing this as a job (even if it's not as glamorous as being a musician). It's like solving puzzles everyday to me. Not to mention I get paid good money, and still have time to practice my guitar and jam with my friends.

I understand that I definitely don\u2019t have the proficiency/passion to take me as far as the people who\u2019ve been coding since they were 10, so I just focus on the more people-oriented jobs in the industry. Tech sales internships were the easiest to find imo, and in jobs like that you kind of control your own destiny. \n\nI ended up going with a different job for my internship this summer in a tech-adjacent role, and so far it\u2019s been great.

Someone who is passionate will retake classes and learn on their own and do their own projects and be leaders if they wish, will basically drag themselves through the mud for it even when they take L's in some subjects or are somewhat garbo at using math the traditional math (like me) or even being a minority in the field (also like me) and that is very valuable.\n\nSo yes, while you can totally be in it for the money, the insane among us are the ones who probably won't give up even when the money dries out and the uphill battle becomes stupider and stupider, while many who are in it for the money burn out or end up hating the very subject they chose\n\ni've always mentioned, it really takes a special kind of crazy to really stick through it, thick and thin, and passion is one of the things that keeps a motivation like money alive as well\n\nwhen the money runs out, those who were passionate and became passionate are the ones who will find value in it\n\nIn the end, hellscape capitalism makes everyone seek anything for money, such is the profit motive, but i think its worth re-examining the paths you take because hell, trades make money too, a business degree is like almost guaranteed carpet to money in one way or another, anyone can also make good money in cs by not even going to college, got a whole industry out of being anti-college in the tech sector too.\n\nSo maybe, the question really becomes, at the risk of sound elitist, who should get a degree? and why should one get a degree? Passion and Academics are great answers and an under/graduate program should be reserved (and for way less fucking expensive) for those who truly want to strive up to the challenge because they're good at it or passionately insane \n\n\ntl;dr:  in an ideal world without capitalism, we wouldn't be getting degrees for the money, we would get our degrees because we're crazy and want to dedicate ourselves to the field THAT much",
