        "selftext": "I just went through my Microsoft onsite for new grad and literally just had the worst interview experience of my life. Interviewer showed up with his camera turned off and wanted to go straight to coding. He gave me a question and I explained my approach and then he wanted me to solve it using a stack DFS instead of recursion, which I had never done before so I struggled a bit. I usually have some scratch paper in hand so I can visualize things, but he told me that I wasn't allowed to do that  and to use the Codepair scratchpad. Later as I looked to the side to think for a second, he asked me \"why the fuck are you looking to the side\" (verbatim) and to focus on the screen, to which I apologized and kept going. He wasn't really angry, in fact he was laughing when he said it but at this point I was extremely uncomfortable and it was impossible to think through the problem. I was explaining my thought process and when I said something about popping a node from the stack he deadass replied \"Ayee pop it like it's hot\".\n\nHe then started getting impatient when I couldn't solve the problem and he started throwing out a lot of curse words in his hints (that weren't ever helpful) and then said \"C'mon you're a \\[T10 uni\\] student, show me some code\", which is probably one of the most demoralizing things I've been told. He ended it and asked me if I had any questions. I asked him how he liked Microsoft and he said you learn a lot but \"the pay is shit and the work is boring.\" I thanked him for his time and he said yeah and dc'ed (this was the first interview of the loop). Got rejected the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGG",

It is hard to believe he underwent any proper training to become an interviewer. You should totally mail the recruiter how unprofessional the interviewer was and tell them everything you posted here. Letting this guy to interview candidates is just a disaster waiting to happen.",
            "Okay kids, listen to me, and old dude who's been working in tech for decades...\n\nIT'S OKAY TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELVES! My first \"big boy\" job had a CEO who was a former military officer and used to get two feet from our face and curse at us for what felt like hours. You don't EVER have to put up with someone treating you like shit, or cursing at you.\n\nThis is a candidate's job market, and if you're all graduating with these great degrees from great schools, you'll find that first job that'll treat you like a human being like you deserve. And maybe it's not with something like a FAANG company right away, but maybe a smaller place that would kill to have a new employee with skills like yours would be infinitely better to grow you for a couple of years at the start.\n\nSo the next time someone curses at you during an interview, or asks \"how'd you even make it to this round?\", do me a favor. Look them dead in their self-righteous, beady lil eyes and tell them, \"I'm sorry, I won't be spoken to in such a manner. I'll be withdrawing my candidacy, ending this interview now, and I'll be emailing everyone I know at your company about your behavior.\"",

But nope, she said that my approach was wrong and didn't even explain why). \n\nUnfortunately, I know 4-5 other people who had similar experiences (especially being accused of cheating) so you're not alone. My interview experience with Microsoft was actually so bad that the moment it ended, I immediately signed one of the other 7 offers I had already without waiting to hear back (although I got a rejection from Msft as expected)",

            "Interviewer was a moron, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get another chance with a non-jerk. \n\nBut while you're in the interview prep mode, memorize this general pattern:\n\n    def dfs(root, item):\n        if root is None:\n            return False\n\n        stack = []\n        visited = set()\n\n        while stack:\n            x = stack.pop()\n            if x in visited:\n                continue\n            if x.value == item:\n                return True\n            set.update({x})\n            stack.push(x.left)\n            stack.push(x.right)\n        \n        return False\n\nThat's python, so wrangle it into your language of choice. It works for any graph, but the above assumes a tree-like data structure. Add the neighbor nodes to the stack in the appropriate way for whatever question you get. Backtracking and keeping track of the path adds complexity, think both of those cases through. Walk through that step by step until you get why it works. \n\nThe part I like the best is that you can change this into a BFS by changing the stack to a queue. Maybe even better, you can use a priority queue to change it into A*. \n\nAnyhow, memorize it and write it several times. Solve mazes, count islands, search trees, determine if some data structure is a tree, find an optimal path, level print a tree, etc and so forth. Really get it in your head solid so you can focus on the question you're asked and not the details of how to implement the DFS.",

        "selftext": "In lieu of the 'stop sexism in cs against men' post from last night, I wanted to provide some context to the other side. I'm not denying the existence of positive discrimination for women, I'm just saying thet it isn't as prevalent as a lot of yall like to make it out to be (20% of cs majors are women vs btwn 20-25% of swe's are women) and the crap women have to deal with is equally, if not more, important. It's very easy to 1. assume women only get jobs in this industry because they're women and 2. act like being a woman in this industry makes our lives easier when that is easily not the case.\n\nI could sit here and give anecdotal evidence on what it's like to be a woman in cs and I'm sure a lot of other women on this sub can, but I won't. Some people accused me of making baseless claims so I decided let's look at some stats\n\nAccording to [this article](https://www.cio.com/article/3516012/women-in-tech-statistics-the-hard-truths-of-an-uphill-battle.html) the amount of women who get cs degrees has dropped from 27% of total cs degrees to 18% in over 20 years. I want everyone to ask themselves: did women wake up one day and decide that they no longer wanted anything to do with computers? In fact, here we have a [NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html?auth=login-google) that explains in depth the history of women in computing and how it started off predominantly female, as a lot of you know.\n\nI also saw someone say that the amount of jobs given to women in tech is disproportionate to the amount of degrees that women get which is also false as the retention rate for women is 38% versus 53% for men. [Here](https://www.isemag.com/2020/10/telecom-the-latest-stats-on-women-in-tech/) we can see that that the rate of women seen in higher level positions decreases as well.\n\nSo why is this? One could argue that it's purely women's problem that we as a whole often choose to not enter male dominated work spaces.\n\n/u/ilovechee3e pointed out very well in that previous post that [60% of women face unwanted sexual advances](https://www.elephantinthevalley.com/) when working in this industry. Maybe, as much as we attack positive discrimination, we should be holding our colleagues and classmates more accountable for how they treat women. It's also frustrating, as a woman who regularly frequents this sub, to see SOME of you act like being a URM (in this case being a woman), is the only reason we get anywhere. When I got my first offer last fall (after applying to 100+ positions and practicing JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU) I was told by my recruiter that I was one of the top candidates they interviewed.\n\nMore reports:\n\n[3/4 women report discrimination in computing industry vs 3/20 men](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/9/16870120/women-discrimination-pew-research-computer-job-workplace-harassment-stem)\n\n[78% of female start up founders have been sexually harrassed](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/tech-careers/the-numbers-of-women-in-tech-rise-and-fall-but-sexual-harassment-is-ever-present)\n\nA lot of interesting stats by [pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/01/09/women-in-stem-see-more-gender-disparities-at-work-especially-those-in-computer-jobs-majority-male-workplaces/) includiing 50% of women in stem report some kind of gender based discrimination, 1/5 being sexual harrassment (that's TWENTY PERCENT OF WOMEN). This number goes up to 30% for women in cs\n\nTL;DR:\n\nYes positive discrimination for women exists. Context is required. To paint it as just 'sexism' without ever addressing the amount and level of misogyny women face is wrong. To act like it severely hinders the ability of men to get jobs in this field is also just blatantly wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso wanted to clear something up before some inevitable comments I get:\n\nThis is mostly about the US. I can't comment on practices in other countries as I've seen a lot of people complain about India.\n\nI'm not a man hater. I literally love men.\n\n&#x200B;",

Also, I\u2019m not very sociable, and I know CS got a lot of awk guys who prefer to keep with their own friends, and a newcomer\u2019s perceived social isolation can also make the environment feel hostile.

I feel that deep in a corner, some companies might be looking to hire more women to increase their gender diversity but I\u2019ve not seen any so far. \n\nI\u2019ve seen some of my female friends who are very attractive struggling to land jobs after interviews. By the logic of these guys, they should be landing jobs left and right. Also, the hiring process is pretty standard across most companies in the industry these days and it\u2019s hard to slip a candidate based on looks through over other better performers.",
            "Girl here - degree in engineering, and now getting a higher degree in CS. \n\nNormally stay quiet on these things... but I just hate all this arguing. Why do we have such a problem with the idea that maybe, just maybe, more men are interested in CS than women? Scandinavian countries that have done everything to \"even the playing field\" between sexes have only seen the divide between what men and women want to pursue grow. While I've been lucky to never have been mistreated as a female in the field (yes there have been sexual advances, but that's not a STEM issue, it's a general issue that's related to a very very tiny fraction of men who can't respect our space), and I acknowledge that unfortunately, other women have certainly encountered sexism, given today's political climate I would argue that people are even more supportive and enthusiastic about cheering us on (look at the female-only bootcamps that exist, or support groups for women) than ever before. I don't see people freaking out about the fact that men outnumber women in manual labor jobs, or that we need to get women interested in more dangerous jobs (because hey, most work-related deaths are dominated by men).\n\nI don't agree with a lot of modern feminist narratives nowadays. Women have more freedoms and opportunities now than ever (here in the West at least), to decide what they want to do with their lives. I actually think the most UNempowering thing we can do to ourselves is to say that we are victims of discrimination, and that we are being pushed out unwillingly, and therefore need special programs or diversity-hiring to \"even things out\". I think it's empowering to think hey, sure, maybe there are fewer women in CS but lots of them want to pursue biology, or psychology, or go into teaching or nursing because that's what they WANT to do. I have no problems with exposing young girls AND boys to CS, to try and foster interest. But the fact is, women are graduating at higher rates than men, and have all the freedom in the world to pursue what they want. \n\nPersonally, I would argue that opportunities are dependent much more on your socioeconomic standing rather than your gender. And absolutely nobody \"wins\" when we start trying to tally which gender has it worse, which is what I see a lot of in the younger generations.\n\nEdit/side note - I appreciate that you aren't just attacking the boys btw.",
            "Tbh I\u2019m not surprised considering how big the gender  ratio between men and women. Hopefully we do better bois",
            "Everything you say here is 100% true. Don't get me wrong I dislike affirmative action, I don't think it's fair to anyone and I think that thread is a pretty good example of why. You shouldn't have to worry that you didn't deserve a job you earned and no one else should either, you got your position because you were the best candidate for the role. I also think it's masking a much bigger problem.\n\nI'm a firm believer that the reason we don't have more women and other minorities in tech is because of pipeline issues. Either people aren't being offered the same opportunities, or blockers are getting in the way. And 100% guys being sexist is some of those blockers. The number of times I've had to call out classmates for being sexist or creepy towards women is just unreal. Like bro, ask her out and if she says no fuck off ok? Don't whine about it, don't bitch her out, and don't fucking complain about women in your field. The last thing she needs is you making her life more difficult.\n\nSome of women not getting promotions is women being less assertive, some of women getting paid less is them not asking for raises, but I guarantee you that at least some of it is sexism too. And people saying it's not are either sexist themselves and lying, or are completely unaware of how common sexism really is. Discrimination in all of it's forms hurts all of us.",

            "Something I notice a lot when people are referencing fair hiring initiatives. People always says \"why don't they just hire the best person for the job?\" 1. The best person for a job might never make it to the top of the stack without diversity hiring initiatives due to HR biases. 2. Are you assuming the best person for the job cannot be the diverse hire? And 3. Companies aren't trying to hire 100% women, just *more* women. If you still can't make it in that's kind of on you, I guess you just weren't the best candidate for the job \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "Thank you so much for putting this post together. I have personally seen my fellow male classmates, whining about 'All the jobs are for women now' and honestly it doesn't just create a sense of bias but is also impacting young women in Tech who are made to feel like, 'They're not worth it or They didn't deserve it'. It's cruel. \nNow although im all about closing the discrimination and all the heinous things women have to face. But we all have to agree on one thing, that is There is no more, the segregation between men and women but a segregation between \"people who have access to resources and who doesn't\" If you think harder about what i just said, it rightly sums up discriminated women, sexually assaulted women, and also men. There are women who have enough resources to clear out interviews without quota and there are women who doesn't have resources for which these quotas should be working towards. This is where I guess the anger of populous is.",
            ">According to [this article](https://www.cio.com/article/3516012/women-in-tech-statistics-the-hard-truths-of-an-uphill-battle.html) the amount of women who get cs degrees has dropped from 27% of total cs degrees to 18% in over 20 years.\n\nAs we push towards equity, we minimize the environmental factor so that the genetic factor maximizes its expression. If women are genetically predisposed to find things less interesting than people, and the opposite for men, then that means that equity will push women away from cs. It is not by luck that before years (less equity) there were more women in cs than now (more equity). It is not by chance that there is a higher percentage (compared to the women in western nations) of women in cs is in an African underdeveloped country (almost zero equity). It is not by chance that equity has increased the differences between man and women in Sweden. If you ever find a country in which there are more women in cs than men, then that means that women are miserable, and are there because they had no other choice.\n\nI suggest you to take look at [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54) (29M views by the way) if you are more interested in the equity means wider gap between women an man choices.\n\nIt will also answer to you why this:\n\n>[Here](https://www.isemag.com/2020/10/telecom-the-latest-stats-on-women-in-tech/) we can see that that the rate of women seen in higher level positions decreases as well.\n\nis happening.\n\nIn a nutshell some of the statistic you provide, under proper analysis of the problem, show exactly the opposite of what you are trying to frame. They show push towards everyone having more free choice than before, which leads to differences in women and man being increased.\n\nAnd yes oppression due to gender , skin color, or whatever else, exists. But the real question is how much of a role it plays on the multivariate problem you have posed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>URM\n\nwhat is this?",

            "Comlpletely wrong conclusion. These issues aren't mutually exclusive. Women shouldn't be disadvantaged because they are women, I agree. But conversely,  they shouldn't be favored because they are women. We're not playing tug of war here. The solution is to remove the bias, not counter-weight it.\n\n>Yes positive discrimination for women exists. Context is required. To paint it as just 'sexism' without ever addressing the amount and level of misogyny women face is wrong. To act like it severely hinders the ability of men to get jobs in this field is also just blatantly wrong.\n\nIt helps women precisely as much as it hurts men. It cant be any other way.",
            "The harrassment situation for women in tech is not surprising. If you are a male, and most of your team is male except for one female and you interact with them often it would not be a surprise if a woman gets unwanted attention. Especially CS males, who have a tendency to misunderstand social queues, and when you find a woman with similar career interests and intelligence, a man may develop feelings for their female coworkers. It is unfortunate to here that women are getting all this unwanted attention, maybe being a part of a women in tech support group may help. \n\nMost relationships start in the workplace so at the same time it is difficult to simply let go anybody just because they gave someone unwanted attention. As far as women in leadership roles go, thats a biology thing. If you hand 1000 random pairs of men and women, most of the time the man will be stronger and will sound more certain about choices, and women in return like being around strong men. No I am not saying women make bad leaders. But when you are in a field that is mostly men, and men have that biological advantage of strength and confidence with their words it would make sense if 90-95% of tech leaders are men. \n\nPlus who wants to work those longer hours and will speak out about those promotions. Men do, and women choose to have a much better WLB. This usually happens when a person is in their early thirties. Prior to their thirties, you can look up the data and see women do just as great in their careers as men do, but once those thirties hit, women are stopped by that biological clock. If a woman wants a family they will make one and work less to be at home more and thus hinders their career. Where as men choose to work more and be seen as providers to no longer just take care of themselves but their partners and children. Career driven women who dont want kids usually do much better in their careers then the average man or a woman who has kids. \n\nIf you ask me, you should question why men are willing to shorten their lifespan and WLB for a couple of extra bucks when they hit their 30s. Wereas women made a smart choice of a not intense career with plenty of time to have a family or hobbies.",

Do you have good projects, or are you good at leetcode? \n\nI know this may sound embarrassing, but if I were in your shoes I would be humble and ask, (maybe beg) for that offer back.",

It is what it is, so best to look to the future now and not regret the past. \n\nI hope some people read this and take it as a lesson though. You have many here in the sub who go to great schools, have connections within family and friends, or otherwise simply have opportunities that your average student won't have access to. The success of these individuals may push us average guys into the mindset that anything less than a really high salary at a prestigious company is a failure and that we should aim for more. \n\nHard work is the bare minimum and there's plenty who put in the work. It's the opportunities you have access to that determine the return on investment. If it's looking like you lack the luck (which you need to make sure you're 'creating your own luck' or at least preparing yourself to take advantage of any that comes your way), the privilege, or both, then be realistic and know you can always work your way up to that point.",
            "Wow. This is the best post I've seen in a while. This was a very humbling experience for me honestly. I'm going to be grateful for whatever offer I get. Potentially being unemployed for months by declining an offer because I don't want to renege just doesn't make sense. Even if I took the offer, I could always leave after a year and avoid a situation like this.  \n\nThis post is making me reconsider my reluctance to renege. Thanks for sharing this as I think it's important for us not to get too ahead of ourselves. I know that after interning at a big tech company, you sometimes \"start feeling you're the shit\". Although, once you realize your leetcode skills are \"shit\", reality kicks in and that nice offer in a LCOL area in a small company sounds like a dream.

        "selftext": "I did everything I could. This past month I graduated uni with a 3.7. I held myself to a higher standard and took the most involved classes in CS, math and stats our program offered. I did cybersecurity research with one of my professors last semester, graded for data structures and algo, and did some peer tutoring on the side. I have my own website and a laundry list of meaningful projects in different languages all on github. I\u2019ve done hackathons by myself, with a couple friends, with 16 year olds from Gibraltar who pronounce deque with three syllables. I\u2019ve done about 300 leetcode questions but most of them were medium or hard, and that was after I switched from C to Python and had to start over. I let my resume undergo cycle after cycle of metamorphosis along with my very being. I even networked my introverted ass off at meaningless lunches if it meant a chance at an endorsement in HTML on LinkedIn. I can only truthfully say I gave it my everything because I know there isn\u2019t an English word that means more than that.\n\nOver the past year I have applied to over 1100 different positions at over 500 different companies. FAANG, hedge funds, startups that make you do CTF, even the made up word salad job descriptions that keep escaping containment in South Carolina. Those numbers easily would\u2019ve quadrupled if I let myself apply to jobs I was even remotely underqualified for. But I hold my head high, knowing I can succeed once I take my first step into the real world, and I cling onto my confidence and its cousin, naivet\u00e9.\n\nAll this time I\u2019ve kept a color-coded spreadsheet with a list of companies, job titles, locations and apply dates. Red is an auto rejection, yellow means I got an OA. I\u2019ve long forgotten what the other colors were going to be because I haven\u2019t had to use any of them. The last two weeks of rejection emails have grinded my career to halt and my hopes down to a fine dust. The world seems to have decided I\u2019m not fit to live the dream I\u2019ve been working towards for the last five years and it\u2019s tearing my mind and body apart. I\u2019ve conditioned myself to have chronic migraines every time I wake up in preparation for the emails I\u2019m about to read. I\u2019ve lost so much weight from the stress that I can say good morning to each bone in my ribcage before stumbling over my computer desk. \u201cUnfortunately\u201d, \u201cno close match\u201d, \u201cnot retained\u201d. I let the memory of what these words once meant to me guide my descent further into the abyss. \u201cWe regret\u201d, \u201cnot the right fit\u201d, \u201crole has been closed\u201d. If anyone was truly sorry for saying no, would they hide behind the facade of the same words of rejection time after time?\n\nHome has been hell on earth. My mother has become unbearable, constantly berating me for hibernating in my room as I scrounge the internet for any morsel of a job offer I haven\u2019t yet discovered. When I finally heed her advice to join at the dinner table, she asks me which video games I\u2019ve been playing all day and compares me to my psych major of an older brother until I crawl back into my real home to resume my fruitless search. My grandparents came out to visit this weekend and were absolutely livid that I was still at home without a job. My grandmother asked why I don\u2019t just walk down to Best Buy and work on the computers there, threatening to bring me there on a leash. It would take more years off my life explaining to her what a software is than she has left on this dying earth, so I remain zen through their outrage as I let the anger caramelize into fortitude. But it was different when my father watched my struggle from the bedroom door without saying a word last night. When I turned around from my bloodstained spreadsheet and saw him, he didn\u2019t need to say anything to shatter my existence into a thousand little splinters, the look on his face was painful enough to do that much alone. I\u2019ve had some enemies over the years, but I wouldn\u2019t wish upon any of them the profound sadness of watching your number one supporter lose faith in your efforts and turn their back to you without even saying goodbye.\n\nThe world has humbled me enough to ask if it even cares at this point. Was I wrong to keep trying after all this time? Would I have felt better had I given everything up earlier? Every day I think I\u2019ve reached a new low the threat of tomorrow creeps under me like a quicksand. I\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to think I deserve the food on my plate or the air I breathe in. I would beg for someone to tell me everything\u2019s okay, but I think it would be more comforting to know when it will all end. When the pain finally goes away, does it really vanish from your life, or do you just grow hardened enough to not feel it anymore?",

Start fresh and probably make a list of roles and companies you want to work at. Do research on what kind of work they actually do in the company. Make a good portfolio and extensively list down all the projects you have done in it. And most importantly, talk with recruiters and managers through LinkedIn. Meanwhile, do something which gives you some sort of calmness (not everything in this world revolves around money). It can be anything from cleaning your room, going on a bike ride to maintaining your lawn. And just remember that you are not at all alone in this. We are with you and we will definitely live through this.\n\nOf course, there is a lot of luck involved. But the only way you can maximize your chance is through hard work.

A year of job experience is worth more than an entire college education. For advanced positions employers aren\u2019t looking for people they need to train in their systems, they want people with actual industry experience.\n\nNo matter how good you think you are the workplace is vastly different than schooling or extracurricular CS.

The reality is that you are underqualified for every role (assuming the jobs you're talking about not applying for are in tech and not retail hourly or something), because school and industry are vastly different beasts. \n\nYes it seems like you should have earned the right to prove yourself, without more data it's hard to make more of an assessment, but I will say this: take something you think is beneath you at a large company and prove yourself. Or at least do that job better than anyone else around you while looking for the one you want. \n\nFinal point, having hired many fresh grads and in the last couple of years having a mandate to hire only from the top technical school in my country, a great student does not always make a great employee. In fact some of the biggest flameouts had the best resumes and pedigree, but didn't know how to think outside the box, work with others, recover quickly from mistakes etc, and generally had lower EQ. \n\nGood luck!",

I understand that things are not working out for you as you hoped, however, the \" It would take more years off my life explaining to her what a software is than she has left on this dying earth\" attitude is honestly taxing. Bro you are JOBLESS. You are in a position where any job would be better than where you are. Get out of the house, go get a job anywhere. You are keeping yourself in this position because you think you are above those sorts of positions, as well as the \"16 year olds who pronounce queue with 3 syllables\". It is time to face the music, get a part time/full time job in something that is \"below\" you, use that as an opportunity to develop your soft skills; It seems like one you really need to work on is seeing things from someone else's perspective.",
            "I also just graduated OP. It\u2019s pretty rough out there. You are doing every right. The job market is really bad right now. We are in similar fields and I suggest you start looking at internship positions. You could be lucky if it turns into fulltime position. \n\nI also relate to your parents. My parents grilled me and made me do the coking cry after my graduation. I feel you OP. I was about to have an anxiety attack while I was crying and my parents yelled at me even more. I\u2019m also under a lot of stress and to see them treat me that way was so paralyzing and shocking. I couldn\u2019t believe my parents show an ounce of sympathy for their own child who just graduated and was emotionally suffering. \n\nI just finished a job interview and I never ever wanted to crawl into a hole so badly. I felt ashamed and stupid. I would say there is an end of the tunnel OP. I heard jobs are being added in a few months. Hang in there. Market is rough but you\u2019ll get there",

I sent my resume for internship to a company I found my interest in, they accepted me after an interview and then I finished my studies and stayed there as a full-time employee, cause the managers had a good opinion about me. For the reference, that was about two years ago. In total, I sent only two applications.\n\nSo, unless you are completely delusional about your own skills, there must be something else at play here. I don't know much about working in USA. Maybe the job market for entry-level programmers is significantly worse there. In this case the solution might be to look for a job in another country. I've also heard that it's much harder to get a job there if you are not a US citizen, but I doubt that applies to you. Same with felonies and criminal records. Maybe you have poor social skills. In that case maybe that's something that needs improvement. Or maybe your resume sucks. Try rewriting it then and consulting others.\n\nRegardless of what it is, your CS skills are not an issue. I can't offer much advice besides just \"Take a break, rest for a while, then try to identify the actual problem and possible solutions.\". But I can offer my own experience to juxtapose against yours. Yours is not normal by the measure of anything I or my friends have experienced. It's either you are doing something completely wrong at some point, fucking up your otherwise good applications, or it's the part of the job market you are trying to get into that's wrong - then look somewhere else.

I made this mistake when I was a fresh graduate and couldn't land a anything anywhere. Apply everywhere where your major might be of use, and a position is open. I worked as a Lab Assistant at $10 p/has my first \"real job\". I had a PhD.\n\n-Accept any job offer that seems reasonable and continue applying to other places. Having a source of income is better than not having one, plus you will gain experience while you work. My second job was a Research Assistant, and the previous experience helped me land it. I also landed it within the same company that offered me the first one. I was earning $35 p/h then. After that I worked as a Primary Researcher and Associate Professor. The experience I gained as a Research Assistant, again, helped me land this position.\n\nTL/DR;\nAccept whatever offer you get and keep searching while gaining experience. You will likely find what you are looking for down the line.",

I'm an international student studying CS in the US, but I have not been able to make a single cent back from my major. All my work experience has been in research labs where I obviously don't get paid. I am in my Junior year and was not able to find an internship last year, nor do I have anything coming up in the summer.\n\nDespite multiple personal projects, research experience, doing over 250+ LC questions (even getting LC premium and getting a 200 day streak), I have not seen any return from my major. This cycle I sent in about 1000 applications, but did not get ANY interviews. I attended career fairs, networking events, coffee chats, everything as well.\n\nNow my family has run out of savings and there is no way I can afford to pay tuition anymore. I will take out a loan and graduate early (next semester), but after that I am going back to my country. I don't see any way I can use my knowledge and passion in CS to make any sort of financial gain, so I had to make the hard decision to give up. I am probably going to end up working as a blue-collar worker. I feel awful because I was \"gifted\" in school and extremely \"smart\", at least according to my parents who made a lot of sacrifices to pay for my tuition. Even now, I won 2 hackathons last year. But alas, no money made there either.\n\nIt is probably going to take me at least 10 years to just make back the money I spent on my education. So I am giving up on CS for now. I don't see any way to make this a career for me at this point. Perhaps in the future I will get another chance because it really is something I am extremely passionate about.\n\nOne piece of advice for students who are considering CS is that you should really have a backup plan if you're not able to find a career. My mistake was coming in and just assuming that I would find a job after I graduate. That is not the case anymore. You need to have the financial freedom to try at it for a couple of years. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury :/  \n\n\nEdit: People have been asking me to share my resum\u00e9, but I just don't feel comfortable sharing it publicly since a lot of my friends and family also follow this subreddit.

            "Unfortunately, merit means nothing. The number of internships, hackathons, research, and side projects absolute do nothing. You can have 6 internships at FAANG companies and still not have a job lined up. For post undergrad jobs what matters is networking. So join that professional frat, CS club, or go to a school with good alumni community. Cuz i guarantee you that after post grad it\u2019s the ones who were involved on campus, not the ones in research labs, that will get jobs. It\u2019s not your resume, it\u2019s the referrals that gives you a chance at the interview.\n\nTheres a reason what \u201cTop University\u201d(What ever this means lol) CS majors with no internship experience are still getting hired. It\u2019s literally cuz they know a guy(aka the recruiter). \n\nMy mentor/friend at a FAANG company and went to the best CS school in the country told me \u201ceveryone in CS is a personality hire until they are 28\u201d. They are 26 years old working in one of the lucrative teams at the company. Genuinely your resume does not matter. Its literally can you talk your way into that job. Obviously with a good resume it makes talking easier, but you cant let ur resume talk for you.\n\nHope this inspires someone to try another way of getting a SWE job cuz leetcoding isn\u2019t gunna get you there. If it wasn\u2019t evident by the OG post. \n\nI have a SWE job and only did 4 leet code questions in my life before my job(Excluding the technical interviews). I was apart of a professional frat and half of people who got hired with me were also part of various/the same frat(s). FYI i hate frats but did it for my job and surprisingly made a couple of good friends too.\n\nIf anyone wants advice, happy to help.",
            "I helped run a startup for 2 years and still cannot even get an internship for this summer. It\u2019s my 5th year and I was hoping by delaying my graduation, I could intern at a bigger company but have not even been able to get one internship for this summer even with years of experience working in the field. I\u2019m getting hopeless too but I\u2019m too close to graduating and in too much debt to back out now.

It\u2019s insane how much it has turned around in the last few years. And the places that are hiring are not going to go for the fresh grads when thousands of people are applying. \n \nI hope you find something that you like.

            " CS jobs pay well in India as well. If you join a multinational company like microsoft or amazon or google and put in 5+ years of solid performance, with some luck and favorable job market in the future you might be able to get back into USA as L1. If not the pay in India should be really competitive that you\u2019ll be able to pay back your student debts in those 5 years. \n\nIt\u2019s not the result you were hoping for. But this is not the end. Don\u2019t give up on CS especially if you have a knack for it. All the best. \n\nLastly the key to getting a job in current market is contacts more than knowledge.

            "Hi. I feel you. I'm also an international student studying CS in the US. I'm a year behind you, a sophomore. I've applied to 350+ jobs for this recruiting cycle and still have nothing. Definitely not to your level, but I still know exactly how you feel. It really, really, sucks. I want to give up on CS as well. But, I want to share some things I've learned from other people during my process too. I've talked to many friends about this, and some things stuck with me and make the process a little less scary.\n\nFirstly,  you've applied to 1000+ jobs, done 250+ LC questions, gotten a 200-day streak, attended career fairs, coffee chats, and every single possible thing that I can think of, you have probably done. You are the most RESPECTABLE person I know (and there are some real hustlers at my school. But still, no one at your level). Your grind, hustle, and ability to just lock the fuck in to recruiting is insanely impressive. You got that fucking DOG in you and that goes an insanely long way. An uncomfortably large portion of recruiting is pure luck, and I'm sorry but I think you got unlucky this time. So many factors are out of your control, but simply the fact that you've come this far is so insanely impressive. People don't understand how much work, mental strain, and energy it takes to get to this point. You literally have so much ambition and motivation and everyone respects you so much for it. This is a testament to your character and how if you put your mind to something, you will put your 110% -- an extremely respectable trait. I know this might mean nothing, especially considering you're not getting internships, but I have faith in your future. I truly do. Internships are also way more competitive than full-time jobs, so be nice to yourself. Please!\n\nSecondly, the tech sector has gone to shit this year. Every big company is laying off huge percentages of their workforce. That comes with removing internship programs and cutting recruitment cycles. This year is truly a shitty year for tech recruiting and I'm really sorry it fell on your shoulders. I feel you, seriously. I tried so far to recruit for this summer too and I have nothing. But if you're blaming it all on yourself right now, please don't. There are more things we can't control than things we can. Be kind to yourself.\n\nI don't know how set you are on giving up. I'm not going to try and convince you to not, because it never helps. But, I just want you to know that I'm sorry you're going through this. We're young and we have a whole life ahead of us. I think we can be a little kinder to ourselves and realize that we are not fucked for life. We have a **whole entire life** ahead of us. It's okay if it takes a little longer to accomplish our goals. Hang in there.",
