            "A Zillow summer intern here. Here's some tea: as far as I know, no dev interns were extended a return offer this summer. Management brought up the news to our intern managers today. I talked with a bunch of interns in a group chat, and none of 'em have heard a \"congrats\" (including me and another guy who got exceeded expectation assessment). During my 12 weeks there, my team added 2 senior devs from Mexico.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdt this trend will continue since most companies are pushing for RTO policies nowadays, and collaboration + morale are never the best in half-remote, half in-person teams. Zillow is one of the rare ones that remain completely remote after the pandemic, so that justifies their decision. I doubt if it's going to be beneficial in the long run though bc collaborating remotely is really hard, not to mention different work cultures/values.",
            "Good luck to them if so.   \n\n\nI've hired people from other countries. It is *hard*. Even contractors, knowing the cost to drop them is lower, it is hard to find someone even reasonable, let alone good, if there is any real cost savings to be had. And if you want fulltime (and the presumed loyalty and ownership that implies) the risk is higher all around. And even if they speak English pretty well, if they're not fluent, there is a disconnect there. There usually is a cultural difference too that plays out in various ways.  \n\n\nBut all of that implies the thing; if someone is good enough to compete with US devs, they...move to the US. Even with all the layoffs here, there are still massive pushes for H1Bs (for a similar reason; that visa sponsorship is worth a lot, and companies can offer below market wages), because of people who want to move here to work. There are more good devs in the US than any country you can hire more cheaply, and the culture tends to lead to better outcomes for companies (for both good reasons and bad).",

Even though countries like South Korea are advanced economically, and socially, culturally many things are out of date. \n\nOne thing I've noticed is front end coder here still code websites like they looked 20 years ago. I kid you not. Outside of major conglomerate companies like Samsung, all medium to small companies here have websites that look like they stepped out of 2003. \n\nAnd they charge 10s of thousands of dollars for these websites. And Koreans pay it because it's normal. \n\nThere are so many apps and services I use here that are still coded using outdated technology that Westerners are abandoned long ago. But Korea is very slow to catch up because they can still make money but not updating anything. \n\nI know Japan is also like this. \n\nSo I can only imagine how bad it will be at less developed countries than Korea and Japan. Americans don't realize how many countires value image over actual ability. \n\nKoreans, for example, value the appearance of being competent over actual competency. So you regularly encounter people that have no business doing certain kinds of work because they are incompetent in it. Despite possessing some paperwork that says they are qualified. And if they are older than everyone else, no one is allowed to say anything. \n\nSo you literally have incompetent doctors with outdated skills sets still practicing medicine and patients are responsible to find someone more competent. \n\nSo I wish them luck in less developed countries. They will find a lot of yes men but not alot of people that can actually deliver the end result. Because these countries, to some end, think you should be understanding to their disorganization and incompetence to some degree because it's culturally acceptable where they come from. And rules and standards are flexible in their minds. \n\nWhich is *not* the American way. \n\nI also read somewhere that these companies end up having to have US developers fix their code because peopke from other countries will follow zero coding conventions making the code unreadable. \n\nAnd I wasn't surprised.",

Then\u2026 the pendulum swings back.",
            "HAHA.  I've seen this movie first hand AT LEAST twice over the past 20 years. When a major company tries to offshore their entire development team their thinking is always \"hey, they speak English, so everything will work out fine.\".\n\n Every time I've seen it happen projects collapse and eventually the company, if it survives, comes to its senses and brings at least some of their development onshore.\n\nZillow is fundamentally a software / technology company that has outsourced their software development.  Their only chance is to hope that they have enough market share to survive and no new competitor comes along to eat their lunch and innovate faster than them. Because make no mistake, the speed at which they can execute on innovation will dramatically slow down.",
            "They're going to learn reeeal quick WHY we hire US engineers. When you have non-tech people outsourcing tech people from outside the country, the code quality becomes absolutely trash, just absolute negligence, and the money they think they saved on cheap developers ends up down a well when they're taking 4x the hours to complete their work because of absolute negligence. Also makes customers unhappy when they experience tech issues and have to talk to people from outside their culture who have no stakes to solve their problems.\n\nI'm not saying there aren't quality developers in other countries, but I am saying you aren't going to find them.",
            "Well the US government really needs to do something if this starts to become a trend. Especially due to Covid, companies have gotten a taste of the remote work, and they can do this for many other jobs too. I\u2019m a US Citizen, so I need some priority over others.",

US devs should be worried about this. These devs also have no need to move here either, they just adjust their work hours and the time difference hasn't been much of an issue. At this point, the government needs to put limitations on hiring outside the US. It's not fair to American citizens that we lose jobs because it's cheaper to pay laborers outside of the country.",
            "This isn\u2019t happening they are just setting up a pretense in Mexico City. Most big tech companies will do this. Offshoring has been talked about but decades now and it has still not been an issue for a reason",

I have been working on distributed teams for years and many of the best devs I have worked with are from outside the US.

            "I think companies underestimate the advantages that people in the US have over the majority of countries, in my home country something like having a computer was a luxury, and using platforms like AWS (besides impossible for political reasons) would be very risky, because at the minor fail you are in the hands of Amazon support team. But I think Americans also overestimate themselves,they should invest a little more in pre-college education, because education is kind of too easy compared to more academic focused countries, in other words I think that the US is not producing enough brainpower, is just exporting it,and long-term this can cause that more companies start outsourcing to other countries.",
            "So many people in this thread are throwing mud on non US developers, and are so wrong.\n\nThere are many good software engineers outside the US. I would agree the US has the majority of experienced and staff+ talent, but at the senior and below level places like Mexico and Argentina have very capable and good developers.\n\nHow do I know? I've been hiring and working with amazing people all over the world for the last 15 years. Notably, two companies I worked for were SF bay series C/D unicorns. One had engineers on four continents. I currently work with a significant amount of South American engineers. Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay. Great talent and people. They are building distributed backends handling significant scale. Not trivial work and requires a lot of deep technical knowledge. One person I'm working with is also a computer science professor at a local university in their home country. There are very smart and talented people outside the US.\n\nThere are downsides, but its similar to any distributed remote team environment. People need to be great communicators, particularly in an asynchronous way. The two specific downsides to international developers I've seen is 1) bridging work culture differences and 2) US market knowledge. As an example of 2, I saw a startup in a specific domain (say, US tax software) locate their development team in Europe, and then faff the product itself.",
            "Overestimating your talent is never a good thing. US has the highest concentration of talent in the world but other countries are not far behind. More often than not, SWE is just grunt work which can be easily done by any competent engineer around the world.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft and other big tech companies have been hiring outside the US for a long time. What makes you think it won't work for Zillow?\n\nAcknowledging this is the first step in ensuring you think about how you can upskill yourself and avoid this situation.\n\nFor example, if you're a normal backend SWE working with python, postgres, Redis and some message queue, try to think how you can upskill yourself, possibly dive into cloud ops etc. \n\nIf you're a frontend engineer, try to get yourself more into developing cross native platform development.\n\nBeing confident is one thing but being delusional is another thing.

Even in bumf*ck nowhere, could you live in idk ... Albuquerque, or Tulsa (is that a city in the US?) for 30k?\n\nCould you rent a nice apartment in a decent part of the city for $500? Or buy a luxury apartment in the nice part of the city for 420k?\n\nCould you commute daily for $5 or for as little as 60\u00a2?

That's not my intended tone, but English is not my first language, I'm sorry, I wish I could earn double my current salary flipping burgers, and I'm sure you would love to pay a third of what you do for rent, but we can't, and I think if we were angry we should be angry not at each other, but at the system that oppresses all of us.",

If Zillow faces a real competitor it can spin back up again, but it gets more profit just by releasing SWEs and cosating.\n\nThis is what happens to companies that aren't *really* tech companies. Zillow is real estate and it kinda won. Exactly who is it competing with and why do they need top tier talent to beat them? Redfin? Hiliarious.\n\nI don't think this is a tech trend so much as it is an end-stage capitalism trend.\n\nCompanies that were built 10 years ago to 'disrupt' the market succeed, gobble up all competition and go into rent seeking mode. The end game of companies like Zillow and Uber are not to develop software, but to fuck over last-generation competitors and slam down monopolies Google/Facebook style. As companies move onto the 'raise prices and strangle' stage, they'll ditch their tech corps as a cost center. After all when you own the market, do you really profit by improving your software?\n\nTech is tech.
