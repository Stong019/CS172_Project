        "selftext": "A few weeks left of my internship.  I got to try on many different hats from SWE,  application engineer, business analyst, product owner.  I discovered I don\u2019t like coding all day and not speaking to people.  I kind of liked going into the field and configuring practical applications in the retail space as an application engineer but can\u2019t see myself doing it long term.  I like working with data (sql and PowerBI), improving processes, finding out ways how to create business value using technology as a business analyst.\n\nI loved working in the product owner role where I\u2019m collaborating with different teams both internally (engineering, merchandising, finance, operations) and externally( stakeholders and business partners) to move things along and bring the vision to reality.  Loved working with our business partners Samsung and Apple leveraging their technology to influence and change customer behavior,  streamline operations to run frictionless and more efficient.  \n\nWhat I especially loved was seeing the technology in action in the end and how it made an impact on customers, stakeholders and bottom line.\n\nSo product owner it is.  I want to build my domain knowledge in the tech retail spacd.  It\u2019s nice to finally have a focused career goal.  \n\nTLDR; ending internship\u2026I came in thinking I was going to be an SWE but now want to be a product owner.\n\nAnyone else discover they didn\u2019t want to be SWE and wanted to do something else?",

            "Yes! I\u2019m the same way. I enjoy coding, but I particularly enjoy getting feedback from users and implementing it onsite into the system so that it works as they\u2019re wanting it to work. It feels great!",
            "Congratulations. This internship was a success. It taught you what you want to be. It might taken a few years to become a product owner, but now you can work on that path to get to your destination.",
            "Funny though, I used to be a product owner intern who also wear the hat of software engineer. Absolutely hated it, so I\u2019m never gonna go into engineering again. However product owner/manager is not an entry level position, so finding a new grad job is pretty tough even with experience. You could try BA, but BA gets a lot of competition because basically every major can apply.",
            "You can be a technical PM. You get to work (and talk to) with and solve problems with stakeholders from both sides of the spectrum from technical to non-technical. A lot of companies treat/interview newgrad technical PMs like software engineers so you still got to leetcode but you dont have to do the engineering work.",
            "I got a year into a therapist masters internship before I realized I hate talking to people all day and would much rather just code",
            "(I am not a CS major\u2014I have many years of experience\u2014but Reddit recommended this post to me.)\n\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, and I\u2019m not suggesting you slog through years of SWE work if you really, truly hate it, but I will say that in the current market, business analysts tend to make many tens of thousands of dollars less per year than engineers. At my company, the pay is literally half for senior positions. The work environment is also not as flexible. The benefits aren\u2019t as good. It\u2019s harder to find a business analytics job, because so many more people from different backgrounds qualify\u2014so there\u2019s less job stability.\n\nProduct managers are about on-par with software engineers, but project managers _also_ make significantly less. \u201cProduct Owner\u201d could mean either of those things or some blend of them depending on the company, which means your salary would probably be somewhere in the middle. \u201cProduct Owner\u201d and \u201cProduct Manager\u201d are not typically entry-level roles, though, so you will probably have to do something else until you get there. And \u201cBusiness Analyst\u201d, at least at all of the companies I\u2019ve worked at, was not a role that would qualify for a Product Manager role. So, you would probably be slotting yourself into a career-long lower salary range by starting out as a business analyst.\n\nHave you considered being an analytics engineer instead of a business analyst? Analytics engineers typically design the data warehouse, help define business definitions for the data, work to get business stakeholders the data they need to make decisions, and manage basic ingestion of data\u2014more complicated coding and infrastructure work belongs to data engineers, who report through the Engineering department. Analytics engineers do code, but it\u2019s mostly SQL and the Python data stack, not applications, and they report through the Data department vs. Engineering. Because they code less, for better or worse, analytics engineering doesn\u2019t pay as well as software engineering, but the pay is still better than what business analysts make, and you get to work with stakeholders across the business. If you do analytics engineering longer-term, you could also try to go into data team management, supervising data analysts, as well. You could go back and get a master\u2019s, then become a data scientist. You could go back and get an MBA, then become a product manager. You could teach yourself a little more code and get the higher salary as a data engineer. It\u2019s a much more flexible role.\n\nI mention all of this because, when I was fresh out of school, I wanted to go into technical writing, because that\u2019s the role I found most interesting. Then, I was offered a job\u2014and the hiring manager actually called me from his personal phone to tell me not to take it. He said that technical writers make WAY less than software engineers and convinced me to go into software, instead. So I did\u2014and it was a fine job, but I didn\u2019t love it. So, five years in, I went into technical product management (which is similar to a \u201cproduct owner\u201d job) and then engineering management (supervising software engineers). I went back to school to get my MBA, and now, I can get a job doing almost any role I want. That would have almost NEVER been possible if I\u2019d gone into something like technical writing, business analysis, etc. outside of Engineering.",

Now I have a great offer that ultimately was because I had the experience last summer. \n\nFirst off keep searching and use this as a backup until it gets too late for anyplace to hire you.\n\nSo here\u2019s the idea: If you don\u2019t have anything for the summer reach out to a small business honor and offer to work for them for free. Offer build them a website or overhaul the one they have. Offer to make them a in-house program that solves a problem they have. Find a inefficiency they have and solve it.

They won\u2019t care what hours you work or how fast your making progress since you\u2019re doing it for free. Ultimately the cost of doing this is low compared the the return you will be able to get by having a internship on your resume with these skills.

Are we talking junior web dev spots here ? Do you have an hackerrank score and do you know your DS & algos ? I'm near New York and I've seen some success stories out of my uni at financial, insurance, and accounting firms that are going after CS majors. But here's the thing, if you went to the 200 ranked CS school in the nation do really think you can land a Magnificent 7 internship ? \n\nI have a job that pays a decent wage, I went back to finish my CS degree, I really want to start hearing good news on this reddit. I know the majority were international undergrads, but this post isn't good especially if you went to a T100 school. I love tech so I'm in it for long haul, but come on, you have realize and understand that AI will kill things like web dev, UI experts, and will be able to auto spit out code of many simple technologies that used to be skills for a full stack web dev. \n\nI think if you really want to get that offer, the barrier for entry just went way up. You need to have the skills that can't be automated by a language model. \n\nMaybe the people landing jobs are just not posting because they are busy working ? Jeez, bad news every week....",

But why just choose one machine, when you can run them in a virtual container that can run on any kind of machine with very consistent behavior, no matter the actual machine they are running on! And you can duplicate them as much as you want, as traffic scales up and down, in different locations around the world, so that it minimizes latency and maximizes throughout for everyone! Plus, when you push new code, or need to restart everything for various reasons, wouldn\u2019t it be great just to create new containers before destroying the old ones, and have them automatically route traffic to the right containers, so there is never any downtime?

            "I didn\u2019t ask for kubernetes in my life. But here we are. And I make a shit ton of money knowing what it can do.",
            "It\u2019s a container orchestration system.\n\nYou had your traditional bare metal systems running, aka how most people run their OS on your desktop or laptop in most cases. Then came VMs. Now my hardware AND OS kernel is virtualized or simulated and I can run another OS on that virtual hardware. I can even do some cool stuff like shift VMs around hypervisor hosts, copy VMs, scale horizontally. And I can have multiple VMs on top of my hypervisor.\n\nBut then now I have my next issue. I\u2019m running my three tier web app across multiple VMs. My load requires the front and middle tier to scale out. But now I\u2019m taking a long time for the VM to come online. It\u2019s online now, but now I need to run my config scripts and whatever else to actually make my instance ready to accept requests and process them appropriately\u2026 all this time so I can run an app that is much smaller than the size of the OS and hardware I am running the VM\u2026 not to mention just like the old bare metal problem, I\u2019m wasting precious money, data center space, and licensing costs and not getting as much juice as I can out of the underlying hardware because most of it is going to handling hardware and OS\n\nIn comes containers. Now I add containers on top of my VM (I can do this directly bare metal too). And the container SHARES the same kernel as the OS. Also I can prepackage all of my configs and processes that run with my component of my web app.\n\nBut now I have yet another problem: I\u2019ve now deployed my front end containers, middle tier containers, and maybe backend containers. How do they talk? Do I need to do this for EVERY container?! Ok my VM that had the containers crashed. I need to provision it all again?! What about networking. I already network my VMs, now I need to network my containers? What about ports for communication? Now I need to take down one of my hypervisors or VMs for maintenance, how will I move all of my containers? I now need to keep track of a container lifecycle and write the automation myself to do it.\n\nIn comes kubernetes. Now you just tell Kubernetes what containers you want to run and how you want them grouped up. Now comes along kubernetes, the container orchestrator. I install the kube utilities on to three VMs. Together they become a \u201ccluster\u201d. Now I give kubernetes a YAML file, that says I want x front end containers, y middle containers, z back end containers. And kubernetes will distribute it across your 3 hosts. Kubernetes can also handle DNS load balancing across your pods and the networking so all you need to worry about is setting the rules about what GROUPS of containers can talk to which GROUPS and it takes care of the rest. \n\nLast, reliability and reprovisioning. Let\u2019s say the third VM dies suddenly. Well, a third of your containers were on there. Normally you\u2019d need to apply your deployment scripts to get more containers up\u2026 but instead you defined it in Kubernetes. Kubernetes knows you said you wanted xyz containers across your cluster. So kubernetes will see that your third VM in the cluster is down, and automatically begin reprovisioning your containers on the remaining two VMs to get back to the specified number of containers. Third VM comes back up. Kubernetes will repopulate on the third VM automatically, then kill containers on the other two to bring the number back down.\n\nIt can get complex real freaking quick but this is the gist. I\u2019d watch videos by mumshad on udemy or tech world by nana on youtube. This honestly only scratches the surface. K8s is valuable though in industry, learn it and rake in the dough",

I promise it will be educational. Best case scenario, you'll invent a Kubernetes competitor.",
            "Kubernetes (k8s) is Docker Swarm + Docker Compose on steroid, but that description minimizes the usefulness and impacts of k8s, k8s is much more than those 2 technologies combined. \n\nManaging k8s alone is very annoying, hence Helm Charts was invented to simplify lives",
            "Something to do with providing computing resources to whatever is running inside of a docker container. So I write a program and put the program in a docker container. But then the actual CPU and memory is provided by \u201ckubernetes\u201d",

            "Kubernetes is not an inside joke; it's a widely adopted and essential technology in the world of cloud-native and containerized applications. It serves a crucial role in simplifying the deployment, management, scaling, and orchestration of containerized applications across various environments. Kubernetes addresses the challenges posed by the complexity of modern application architectures and the need to efficiently manage distributed systems. It provides features for automating tasks, ensuring high availability, managing networking, and scaling applications based on demand. Kubernetes is backed by a large and active open-source community and is used by organizations of all sizes to streamline their application development and operations.\n\nSimilarly, KubeMQ is a vital component in modern cloud-native architectures, specializing in efficient communication and event streaming within environments like Kubernetes. It provides essential messaging patterns such as publish-subscribe and request-reply, facilitating event-driven communication between different parts of an application. KubeMQ supports real-time event streaming, ensuring that applications can seamlessly interact and react to events. With features like scalability, message persistence, and integration with Kubernetes, KubeMQ helps developers simplify the complexities of communication in distributed systems. Just as Kubernetes revolutionizes application deployment and management, KubeMQ enhances how events and messages are handled, contributing to the overall efficiency and resilience of modern applications.",
