        "selftext": " \n\nYesterday at an extended family dinner I had a long discussion with my younger cousin about the tech industry and his career path. He is a 2023 new grad and still hasn\u2019t secured an offer he is happy with, and the stress of the current job market has really been eating at him. I don\u2019t know if I was able to help much but he suggested I post what we talked about on this subreddit (I\u2019m not really a redditor) as our talk seemed to give him some clarity/comfort.\n\nMy cousin is a classic overachiever who has done everything \u201cright\u201d when it comes to tech recruitment. He secured multiple internships, grinded leetcode, kept his grades up, and did extensive networking. But in this competitive environment its easy to downplay your achievements when you compare yourself to others, and for new grads in tech it is especially easy to become demotivated when one is surrounded by peers who seem to be securing record compensation packages and cushy jobs in FAANG/ FANG-adjacent companies. It is also important that hard work and determination is not always rewarded with stellar or even equivalent results.\n\nMy cousin has secured jobs but he doesn\u2019t want to \u201csettle\u201d. The offers are as you might expect, a handful of local companies and startups. A few with titles that don\u2019t quite align with \u201cmaximizing\u201d his future job prospects, a few whose core products aren\u2019t even technology at all. It was evident to me that he was really waiting for those \u201ctrue\u201d new grad in tech offers, an offer that can be easily be found adorning the avalanche of flex posts across social media around graduation season. In his mind this offer would snowball him to the pinnacle of tech greatness and without it he would be sabotaging, perhaps irrevocably, his career path. As someone with a few YOE under my belt and a senior engineer at a unicorn, he was hoping to emulate my career path.\n\nThe thing is, I \u201csettled\u201d. In fact, when I left for my new grad job I was painfully embarrassed at my job results that I almost kept my workplace a secret from all my university friends.\n\nI am a below-average developer. This isn\u2019t even imposter syndrome talking, as I couldn\u2019t even secure a return offer to the one middling internship I managed to secure in my junior year of college due to bad performance. My job prep was also mediocre, mostly I used a infamous book called cracking the coding interview and barely practiced any of my interview skills until graduation had passed. Long months of unemployment followed, and this being 2016, the new grad job market wasn\u2019t even particularly bad at this time.\n\nEventually at the beginning of the fall of 2016 I secured employment at a small startup in the SF bay area earning 48k a year. This place was truly terrible, and if any of you have experienced working at predatory startups you also know how awful it is to work at one of these places. Terrible processes, founder ego, nepotism abound, work life balance that resembles indentured servitude, etc. Every day was a miserable loop of stressful days in the office getting yelled at by upper management and unhappy nights at home in a small apartment I could barely afford with unpleasant roommates. But I knew that this wouldn\u2019t be for long.\n\nAfter a year at that place I did what nearly every other new grad has done after they signed an offer at this \u201cstartup\u201d. Leverage their newly found skills and jump ship. My next destination after some needed rest was a media company in NYC, owed largely to a connection I made at the startup. This time I was making just shy of 90k in the Big Apple, working and living in much better conditions than before. At this point I felt proud enough to share my achievements with my friends and family, but at the end of the day a job is a job after all. And just like those celebratory posts on linkedin, the importance of the job offer faded into obscurity. I was loving my work, my team, the culture and I thought I would stay at that media company forever. But it was not to be, barely half a year into the role my organization was re-orged and I was one of the unlucky employees to be last stranded.\n\nAt the time I was convinced that a job at a \u201ctrue\u201d tech company would prevent such a future catastrophe. I subscribed to the belief that since the engineer wasn\u2019t king at that media company, this was the reason for the layoffs. A truly naive point of view but nonetheless one I held as I was forced back into the job search. Eventually, I secured a position at a large FinTech company in NYC, finally breaching that six figure floor and making 134k a year, somehow upleveling myself even with my disastrous previous experiences. All cash as the company was and still is privately held, though it has notoriously good benefits. This was July 2018.\n\nThe next two years I grew at the company, survived through another re-organization and steadily grew my compensation. But as part of a slower moving team I was feeling my skills plateau and truthfully I didn\u2019t find life as a developer in NYC to my taste. As 2020 hit I took the start of the pandemic as a sign to take a break to prevent burnout and return back to the west coast to spend time with family.\n\nOf course, one can only stay out of the workforce for so long. Luckily after an initial hit to hiring from the pandemic, experienced engineers were in demand again at the end of 2020 and I was able to secure employment starting the beginning of 2021 at a large tech company in the Bay Area, a company I remain at to this day. Here the numbers get a little fuzzy because of not only the frequent equity shocks through the prevailing years, but also due to some promotions and a job function switch I made. I reckon that my compensation was about \\~360k in 2021 due to the small bull run, dropping to \\~290k in 2022. And finally this year I\u2019m probably in the 400-480k range depending on how our stock performs.\n\nSo why share such a flex-like career trajectory? Because to a new grad like my cousin my \u201ccareer path\u201d seems straightforward and illustrative of the compensation maximizing, leetcode grinding, job hopping, up leveling mindset that seems a core ethos in the minds of today\u2019s computer science students.\n\n48k -> 90k -> 134k -> \\~300k -> \\~400k\n\nBut mine on path and that of my colleagues I increasingly find is the opposite of straightforward. The vast majority of my coworkers didn\u2019t \u201cplan\u201d and \u201cexecute\u201d a career so rigidly determined in their college years. Many of them are like me, average people with average performance; stumbling and bumbling their way in their own mediocrity through layoffs and triumphs until one day you wake up with strangers, relatives, and your friends\u2019 kids asking you how did you \u201cwin\u201d in the tech rat race.\n\nAnd the truth of it is, I just \u201csettled\u201d and let life sort itself out.\n\nTruly I have no idea if this collection of thoughts would be helpful, but it was a fine enough distraction for me to put to words during my lunch break. Safe travels all.\n\nTLDR: accepting a job below your expectations does not jeopardize your \u201ccareer path\u201d",

            "Great post. This is refreshing, considering many think if you dont get into FAANG or very high paying position RIGHT out of school, you will never get there. I suppose people think taking a low paying position early will pigeonhole you early on? We are very fortunate to work in a field where simply SWITCHING jobs can garner a 10-25% pay increase, which honestly goes for most fields.\n\nTo me at least, its a marathon, not a race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a older returning student and I don't think many young people understand how much \"time\" you have. Its like all things today, everybody needs  it NOW. Instant gratification... Everybody needs the highest paying possible job right out of school. nearly every field is like this(even the high paying ones) don't make a lot in the beginning.\n\nlawyers, business majors, surgeons(I'm talking about residency), start out making pennies but the end result or earning potential is tremendous. Med residents make \\~50k/year but in 5-10 years are clearing 500k. I know CS and medicine is apple and oranges, but the \"earning potential\" premise is still there.",

            "Good post! I\u2019m in a fairly low-paying tech job with a \u201cfancy\u201d title because I HATED my previous career in marketing. At 40, I decided to change everything and flip my world around, ditching my extremely hectic career choice and utilizing my CS degree for the first time in 20 years. \n\nI doubled my salary in two years, even at the low pay, and have received much more value in my life. I don\u2019t care that I started at the bottom with 20-year-olds. I love those little nerds. And now I\u2019m getting recognized for something I actually enjoy doing \u2014 even if I\u2019m not the smartest or the \u201cbest\u201d at my job, I keep chugging. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to start at the top. You don\u2019t have to turn down something that doesn\u2019t exactly meet your vision. My entire goal was just \u201ctech\u201d and \u201cchange.\u201d Hell, I was the designated cabinet crawler and cable plugger for a full year because I was the only one small enough to fit in some places. Now I\u2019m building environments and testing things out in the backend for a LARGE corporation (not a tech company) and love it. All from dusty cabinets.",
            "Thanks for writing this post, I had a very similar experience working in this industry. I graduated in 2013 with a degree outside of CS and had no idea how to get a job in software. I was extremely lucky that my first company took a chance on me. I've switched jobs 5 times since then working at companies of varying reputation, and I didn't really reach my true earning potential before I landed at a FAANG subsidiary in 2020. \n\nI'm not terrible at interviewing but I'm not a leetcode god either. I'm not the most senior or technically specialized engineer. Honestly the things that helped me the most were making good connections, taking advantage of opportunities when they come, and not giving up. But even then landing an offer was mostly due to luck.\n\nMy advice to new grads and juniors: take care of yourselves and don't put unreasonable expectations on yourselves. There's no shame in taking a \"worse\" job and putting in your time. And when the boom times come again, you can interview again for better opportunities. You'll get there eventually, it just takes patience.",
            "Gold. I have 15 credits left for my cs degree with tons of real world experience from military,  to food industry, and bartending, to supply chain manufacturing in the bay, and brutal labor giga pouring concrete for several summers. As a new grad I intended on only applying to organizations that intend on drastically changing the course of  history. \n\nBut the truth is anywhere you end up presents a golden opportunity to improve some part of a process or system. Working for an awful boss might teach you what not to do when it\u2019s your turn to swap with their position. Working for an excellent boss or advanced peers may accelerate your skills farther than what you thought possible. \n\nI\u2019d rather jump up in a company then jump ship into a better position at another company. I want to be apart of the team and make a long lasting difference at an organization I think is changing the course of our combined history. \n\nLoved the post well worth the read",
