            "I always felt like passion is just a gatekeeping buzzword or an excuse to overwork employees. \n\nI remember an engineering manager at a reputable company in my country gloating about how he expects juniors to be passionate and occupied with work and CS related stuff for 16 hours a day to have a future in the industry. I don\u2019t even think I consistently pulled half of that yet I am doing much better than that clown or the employees in his company would ever do.",
            "Didn\u2019t care much for programming and despised math. Dropped from CS to a Computer Information Systems degree. Ended up working at a multitude of FAANG companies in SWE/PM roles. Eventually left tech and moved on to something else. \n\nWill agree 100% with the OP. Even though I didn\u2019t have a passion for coding, I put in the work and then took a lot of pride in being good at it. I think that many people try to become passionate about something too early on in the process.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never coded before, how are you supposed to have a passion for it?\n\nI think a better thing to be passionate about is your own improvement in all aspects of your life. \n\nI wasn\u2019t passionate about cooking, until I became great at cooking and got to cook myself a ton of tasty meals. I wasn\u2019t passionate about fitness, until I became fit and saw all the benefits that come along with it. I wasn\u2019t passionate about gaming, until I found out that I\u2019m a pretty badass tank in WoW. \n\nEven in the professional world, I\u2019m not PASSIONATE about my job. But I do love the things that I can get from being great at my job. \n\nI have an awesome salary. Work with awesome people. Get to travel. Get to buy the toys I want and indulge in the hobbies I care about. I\u2019m on track to retiring before I am 50. \n\nThe list goes on and on. \n\nSo find what you are good at and develop those strengths. Eventually, you\u2019ll take pride in those skills and might even spark a bit of passion.",

Some already graduated and have jobs within top F100 companies, others have internships at amazing companies (FAANG, faang adjacent, etc).\n\nI settled for less as of now, still top F100 (30 ish) but will prob pursue FAANG at some point just for fun.

Probably not.\n\nIf they took the same hard work and passion towards something they love they not only would be happier but also would probably accomplish more.\n\nThose are my personal thoughts, I am now thinking about life after graduation.

I was always a competitive student, so I tried in my classes and got good internships a job, but I never really went out of my way to learn about the field, do projects, etc.\n\nI started putting in a lot more effort when I started working fulltime - partially because I felt I was really raw and was \"underperforming my level of talent\" (if that makes sense), partially because some of my coworkers were incredible, and largely because I wanted to get promoted quickly (both because of money and because I'm competitive.)\n\nNow I still put in a lot of effort, and while the money/promos is definitely part of it, I've come to realize I enjoy being good at what I do, at building things that aren't complete shit, and at solving somewhat interesting problems. I would've never considered myself passionate about CS, but I guess what I just described is passion.",
            "I would go even further and say the people who are extremely passionate about CS are less successful than those who just want a high paying job. The people who are incredibly passionate about CS to the point were they hyper fixate on it often times go for a PhD and often make less money over the lifespan of their career compared to someone who is motivated by money instead of passion for an academic discipline.",

So mentioning it seems counter to your point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe third, i.e. money, tends to produce work that is the bare minimum in quality if not accompanied with *some* degree of interest. Granted not every piece of sw in every sector needs to be 10/10 high-quality but then again those are not the areas that challenge you and make you a good engineer either. They just accept whatever passable work you produce- sometimes even subpar work, since those in charge sometimes lack experience in SW to know when work is subpar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPoint is- pay-scale is still coupled to quality of work and quality of work is still coupled to interest in said work. There's some space to be paid ok-ish and do mediocre work in this field, but can we please stop trying to fully decouple the notion of quality from the notion of interest/enjoyment? It's just not true, not for SWE, not for anything. That's just dissident from how humans work.",

            " \n\nPassion to me is just someone who likes their job, and shows pride in their work.  Not the one who sleeps under the desk or responds to a slack over the weekend.  Those are done out of fear or not knowing better.",
            "I feel like more than that you need to have a tolerance for challenge, and in some ways, be thrilled by it. I am in cs/data science because I love how much I get to use my brain and how you can never know enough. It\u2019s fun. If you are not passionate about problem solving, you will burn out.",
            "I feel like people say you should be passionate because being passionate about CS means you naturally have more drive. If you don\u2019t have that \u201cpassion\u201d it\u2019s obviously possible but just more difficult and less enjoyable",

To have grit to me means you never ever stop, but at the same time you are not arrogant or ignorant to not bend. Sometimes after the 25th fail, it calls for a perspective shift, it doesn\u2019t mean give up. Read the book."

It\u2019s on a text editor, like 0 help. It just stated Runtime Error. I was using Python as the interviewer requested.

            "Honestly, you getting so many interviews is a really good sign that you are a strongly desirable candidate and you\u2019re hitting all the right marks to get noticed by recruiters. Like many people here are saying, it\u2019s a remarkably terrible market right now. I just went thru 6 good interviews with a great referral, got told to expect the offer in the next email, then got rejected without explanation (later found out it was bc unexpected layoffs)\u2014truly, the market is affecting things A LOT. Also, the field is always more competitive for international students in US markets bc more limited sponsorship spots, so props to you for standing out so much! \n\nIf you can, I think sticking out your Masters is for the best bc a completed degree is worth a lot more than half a degree and it also gives you time to keep applying to internships/jobs and hopefully for the market to recover. \n\nAlso, you may already be doing this, but you might need to lower expectations for which company you work for and compensation. It sounds like you\u2019re heavily targeting the tech companies, but the advice I\u2019m hearing is to go after the tech jobs at non-tech companies (food companies, airlines, etc) bc there\u2019s a rising need for those jobs and they\u2019re generally don\u2019t get as many applicants as the tech companies/startups. You can always switch later, but the mindset I\u2019m hearing about from even established engineers is to hunker down with whatever you\u2019ve got until the market is better and then you can grow your career. Like it\u2019s gonna be damage reduction for a few years, then you can focus on growth.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having such a tough time.

I would suggest you ask for feedback on why they rejected you. If your technical rounds were good i would suggest you look into the behavior round of the interview. Most companies will almost guarantee reject you if you don\u2019t pass that that round because the behavior round is test to see if you will fit into the team. Which is important to.

It might feel like you\u2019re truly unhirable, but trust me if you\u2019re even getting interviews (and being told you\u2019re doing well) then you\u2019re doing something right! Just a matter of time before you get lucky and find the right fit or if it finds you.\n\nIt could be a lot worse, hell I\u2019m 26 about to graduate and I couldnt even get an internship and I\u2019m struggling to even land interviews as I\u2019m starting to apply to ft jobs. \n\nI hate being this guy too but try and take this in the best way possible. I know it sucks to pour your heart out in a post and tell us all about what you\u2019re going through and to have some rando come in and tell you well hey I have it worse; it feels really cheap. But you kinda gotta look things differently if you\u2019re gonna land a job let alone thrive in a workplace for your own well being. \n\nJust like there are some that have it much better than you, there\u2019s alot (sometimes even more people) that have it alot worse off. Don\u2019t let your mind trick you into feeling this way. Try and take a step back, assess your situation. You\u2019re doing well in interviews, awesome; keep doing that! Maybe something isn\u2019t landing in terms of your soft skills, maybe that could use some work. Maybe you\u2019re putting too much stock into the extremely coveted jobs and you\u2019re not a good fit for some reasons outside of your control. \n\nPoint being it\u2019s never as bad as you think, from the little knowledge I\u2019ve gathered from your post you seem to have really good technical skills if you\u2019re landing and excelling at interviews, but maybe your soft skills are lacking, or you\u2019re not networking enough. I know that parts stressful and feels like a dead end, but it\u2019s how the idiots you went to school with land jobs, so try and put yourself out there in whatever capacity, whether that be connecting with people from your uni, or communities online. \n\nEither way man just keep your head up, you\u2019re doing something right. try and control what\u2019s in the box you live in before you go outside of that box!",
            "Go on pramp or interviewing.io and pay for the expert interview and get the feedback from that person if you're really doing well in the interview. 0/14 indicates some problem. You should expect to convert 1/5 interviews. \n\nThere's also mentoring-club.com which you might try first. \n\nAlso, it seems silly to do sponsorship for visa at bachelor's level. At least with a master's you can say your skills are more specialized. Even then I don't think it's genuine need but rather the employer taking advantage of your status to keep you at entry pay longer and in your lower role longer. So in light of this exploitation to simply avoid more expensive domestic candidates, I'd think visa sponsorship is best reserved for PhD, as in people with truly rare skills.",

            "Don\u2019t fret/worry too much. \n\nI\u2019m a dev with nearly 20 yoe and I\u2019ve been through the interview grind a couple of times.  I also have interviewed potential new hires several times, so I know what it\u2019s like on both sides.  \n\nThe last time I was job searching, about 7-8 years ago, the market wasn\u2019t as bad as it is now.  But I was interviewing with over 10 yoe and it still took me several months to land something, and I had about the same number of interviews as you 14-20.  I even got flown out a few times.\n\nAnyway, my point is that, getting on offer is very subjective.   You can have all of the skills and knowledge, and be a great fit, and still not get an offer.  This is because the hiring manager will likely narrow down the candidates to about 3-5 candidates per position.  And they only get so many hiring tickets (or positions to fill).   And they may get 3-5 perfect candidates and can only pick one.  At that point \u2026. It\u2019s just up to them \u201cclicking\u201d with you.  And there is little you can do to make them more likely to choose you.  I find it\u2019s kind of like speed dating.  Sometimes for whatever reason, a particular person just clicks with them. So don\u2019t take it too personally.  Because what clicks with one hiring manager may not make you clock with another.  There really is no way to know what clicks for them. \n\nJust keep up with the applications and don\u2019t fret about passes too much.  If you\u2019re getting feedback that you\u2019re a good fit, you have valuable and desirable skills.  You\u2019ll get a hit eventually.  It suck\u2019s but ya got to just keep going.",

            "My two cents: If you still like the subject matter and have the option, keep at the masters while looking for a good job and interviewing occasionally. If you get an offer you can hit pause on the masters. Work on mental health during this period as well with daily exercise and sunshine, social hobbies and if possible a romantic relationship (perhaps someone you meet via the social hobbies), maybe even some therapy. Things will get much, much better for you. TIME is the only non-renewable resource, and you are young, so it's on your side. Keep swimming.",

The last interview that I had, they asked me how to look at just the top few lines of a file (using the head command was correct and apparently no one else got that right).

They were good for me since I knew the answers and could explain them rather thoroughly but I\u2019m not sure how good that is.\n\nI\u2019m no interviewer but I think that the best thing would be to ask about how someone worked on a personal project because that can tell you a lot more about what someone\u2019s actual coding process is.\n\nWho knows, clearly no one since no one agrees.",

I was by myself (IDGAF about eating by myself because I'm not some normie) and this woman started bragging about how much money she made as a realtor last year. A few minutes later, she put down her phone and started glancing at the menu.\n\nWithout skipping a beat, I decided to pull my phone out and pretended I was having a conversation. I said how I was sitting next to this realtor who didn't know know her job was going to be replaced by an iPhone app within the decade, and how people could by houses from their smartphones pretty soon. Honestly, I hate people who brag about money. It fucking pisses me off. It made me think about the people in California who struggle to buy houses because of the real estate market. She kinda looked over with a puzzled expression on her face. Her husband came back from the restroom and she explained what happened and he confronted me.\n\nWe kinda got into it because I said his wife is more than capable of standing up for herself. He kind of embarassed himself because he was raising his voice while I was stoic and calm. Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThey ended up moving to another part of the restaurant. Before I left, I went to the maitre d and told her I wanted to pay for his wife's food to establish dominance over him. I even told the maitre d to buy her a glass of the most expensive champagne they had. Their total bill was only a fraction of what I made in my summer internship.\n\nAnyways, the next week I had my last rounds of interviews at the Goog. Guess who it was. We went through the interview normally and he gave me the hardest fucking leetcode question. He asked me to program in front of him instead of writing down my solution on the whiteboard and I used the name of the restaurant as one of the temp variables lol. I did it in less than five minutes and provided the optimal solution. I even loudly yawned while doing it. Before I left I said \"I know freshman dropouts from the local community college who had this problem as their first lab assignment in their introductory programming class. Give harder problems unless you want that caliber of programmer to work here.\" His upper lipped twitched.\n\nToday, they told me I didn't get the position. Gee, I wonder why?\n\nI have reason to believe he didn't hire me because of our previous altercation. Can I hire a lawyer for discrimination? When he saw me, he immediately should have gotten another interviewer because he's inherently biased.\n\nAnyways, I'm not to worried about it. I had an internship at another FANG and when I get that I'll be making 150k easily there.",

            "The people getting jobs aren\u2019t coming here to tell you.\n\nI assure you, places are hiring and people are being hired. I know quite a few people who just graduated that got jobs. I only have a couple of years of experience and regularly get interview requests from recruiters.  \n\nBut everyone doesn\u2019t get a first job starting at 200k that is fully remote and requires 1 hour of work per week. You may have went to a great school and did everything right but that doesn\u2019t make you special in tech. You may have to settle and continue working toward your dream job. It happens to most.\n\nAlso, a shit ton of the people I am seeing here complaining are not US Citizens and are either here on visa or trying to get in/back into the US. And companies almost always have a preference for hiring citizens over foreigners.",

            "Well everyone and his/her mom wants to major in CS.\n\nIt's just normal supply and demand.\n\nImagine tomorrow a good chunk of the next generation worldwide (this isn't even just 1 country but pretty much a global phenomena) decided to major in accounting. And working professionals too tried to switch to accounting.\n\nAs important as accounting is for instance, it doesn't have anywhere near the number of jobs to satisfy that much supply. \n\nIt's just normal supply and demand. I wouldn't be surprised if it takes almost a decade until markets settle. It does take some time for people to become aware of the current job market (and that it might not be as temporary of a phenomena as they would have liked to believe) so the trickling down effect would take some time.\n\nWhile it might get a bit better in the near future than the current state of the market, the longer term trend is clear. There's just more supply of aspiring candidates than the number of entry jobs available. And you are going to be competing globally. I would expect job markets to become even more fierce due to this simply supply vs demand nature.\n\nI don't understand why people are in denial and presume the job market cannot get worse. It's all just supply and demand. With the entire generation and the next told to code, do you really think entry markets wouldn't get more and more saturated than it is today? Seriously, this is like the fools past two years in which I was trying to advise none of this was sustainable but the majority of redditors didn't listen.",

A lot of devs claiming laid off with 5 yoe with 200+ applications and no offer. It's scary stuff, hard work and determination is fine and dandy but people have kids to feed. \n\nIf you get laid off, which can happen to anyone, and then you can't find a job after investing 8+ years of your life into a career, that's something worthy of negativity. If I were 18 I'm not sure if I would choose CS at this point. AI isnt even really in the picture yet, and that's coming in some form or another.",

Not as much capital expenditure tied to each job, which is why pay was higher, and SW companies are so dang lucrative. Y\u2019all are the factory! \n\n\nI hope this breeds a new generation of self starters, we need a new twitter so bad.",
            "CS was never an easy path to a six figure salary.  I was majoring in it back in the 90s and while some people were getting six figure salaries, it was not because it was easy.  CS was never an easy degree to obtain.\n\nThe only people that CS may be easy for are individuals that are good at math.  Because calculus, and analytical algebra, and statistics is easy for them.  And even then, some of those people are not necessarily good with programming without some effort.\n\nYou don't learn anything anyway.  You learn at home doing stuff on your own time, outside of the classroom.  You learn by setting up configurations of equipment you bought with your own hard earned money, taking risks, breaking stuff, figuring it out the hard way.  How many people are actually putting in effort, on their own they aren't getting college credit for and they aren't getting paid for, with no reward other than the fact that they solved a problem?  And how many of them can prove this or demonstrate this on an interview.\n\nWhat you are seeing is disillusionment because people complain that there are not enough POC in tech, or there are not enough STEM, or people want to work directly in the industry, instead of just doing the work wherever they can.  So they were finessed into taking up CS and actually got the degree but the truth of the matter it is not in them they were never built for it and do not really care about tech outside of the classroom.\n\nWould you hire that person?",
            "Because it's rough right now",
            "I feel like there's been this level of anxiety for a decade now in the CS field. It happened when I was applying for jobs and it never seemed to have gone away.\n\nI won't lie, CS entry level jobs are difficult to apply for. It's a skill-based process that people graduating with a CS degree aren't very well equipped with. My university had a special class to teach people majoring in tech how to apply for jobs. It's also not going to necessarily be a good money guarantee thing. My first developer job was well below what I was expecting to get, and it seemed to be the case for anyone who wasn't a 10X type coder.\n\nI got a job with higher pay later on, but that took time and specialization efforts towards something I wanted to do. I had friends who went into it simply because they wanted the money, and they got burnt out very quickly in the job application process. If I was going to get a job simply because I wanted to get a lot of money, I would've picked a different field all together.",
            "A lot of people have had it the worst because they didn\u2019t really try hard in uni. Gaining experience, trying to make connections, doing projects, and just overall expanding their technical capabilities were not on their agenda other than just going to school and \u201clearn\u201d. CS is an opportunity to apply your skills and enter the industry for a median 90-100k entry level job. People just think they earn their degree at a T50 school and not have any internships or connections. Rather it would be more wise to gain experience from a lower ranked university if you\u2019re a more competent individual. It really is a grind, but you have to grind the right way. It has been getting a bit annoying. All this on top of the over saturated entry level market for CS. It\u2019s only gonna get harder from here.",

            "No, the job market won\u2019t improve. There is no reason for it to improve.

The days of 150k+ out of college aren\u2019t the norm, they are the exception, and now the demand has gone down people will have to accept that.\n\nYou can still get a great job, people here are just mad entitled thinking they deserve 100k for doing what is essentially jack shit.\n\nTalk to people in the healthcare industry, or other industries that make a difference, and you\u2019ll feel better about your hours/job/pay. \n\nAlso finding a lot of cs majors that straight up can\u2019t code in a development environment.

            "> Did ya'll really think CS is some easy path to a six figure salary?\n\nA lot of us did, yeah. Because the universities we attended sold us on that expectation.

There\u2019s of course some talks but there isn\u2019t this big consensus in regards to certain companies and instead a ton of the talk directly involves the lessons itself.

You can argue that this isn't rational, but it doesn't matter what your opinion is, society's decision on what is acceptable or not is already set.\n\nAnd frankly, usually the sort of people who want to argue in favor of being able to use these words that society has deemed unacceptable - it's often a certain type of person.
