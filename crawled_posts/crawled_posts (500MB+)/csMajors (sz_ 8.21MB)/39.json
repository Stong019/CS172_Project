It took 3 weeks and I asked my team lead for help a lot, couldn't have done it without him.\n\nIn the meeting my manager says he doesn't expect less from me than anyone else. I'm an intern bro.

If your not having check ins on whatever cadence you don\u2019t have a forum to ask for assistance how do they expect you to succeed? Sprint  goals aside your boss just has a poor use of their time or they have the startup syndrome where everything is high priority and nothing gets done because of that.

You are doing well enough but they want to squeeze maximum out of you and then get another intern and pay him intern salary instead of hiring you fulltime and paying you a decent salary.\n\nEitherway the place seems like a shithole without processes, decent documentation and without guidance.

Start looking for another internship and leave or if you need the money and experience, stay but make sure you don\u2019t plan/expect to come back because even if you do get an offer and come back, they will probably have higher expectations and micromanage you for any chances of another pip.",
