            "Idk when this whole idea started that LLMs are going to just replace programmers. As someone who actually works with these, I am telling you companies still don't trust them. You still need a \"operator\" of sorts. Copilots and soras only help as tools the same way ur linter helps. You still need to tweak whatever it spits out. We are reaching a new paradigm of databases and query languages for sure though. We still wouldn't use LLMs and be like write me the zstd protocol dtos for this new Linux kernel. You still have to write it and understand the mechanism. It will just help you along the way. I think even a decade from now, there would still be a need for actual engineering creativity.",
            "I wouldn't worry too much about that. If AI ever does get to the point where it can fully replace programmers, it likely means most other jobs have already been taken over too. When massive unemployment on that scale occurs, governments will inevitably work to intervene.\n\nPlus, for those without coding skills, even giving them GPT-4 and GitHub Copilot isn't enough. How will they debug code provided by AI? Ensure it's secure without vulnerabilities? That's where human programmers will still play a important role. AI will make mistakes and have blind spots, you need domain expertise to judge if its answers can be trusted.\n\nInstead of stressing over hypotheticals, I'd focus your energy on practical things within your control, like grinding LeetCode problems. That directly increases your job prospects now versus worrying about uncertainties far in the future.",

If I were a front end engineer then I would be worried, though.   \n\nThe issue isn't that AI can do everything a front end engineer can do... the rub is that AI can enable a single front end engineer to manage the tasks it currently takes 2 or 3 junior engineers to do.     That increased efficiency alone will reduce the demand for that particular skill set...which will push the front end types into other roles which increases competition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe one silver lining with AI is that I haven't heard of many outfits trying to outright sell the capability in a one-and-done transaction.    Smart companies will license access to the technology for stable income.   My guess is that it will follow the specialized software model (think Wonderware, or Solidworks).   Eventually it will get expensive enough to reach an equilibrium with having staff on hand.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are AI proof jobs out there inside and outside of pure coding jobs.

            "CS is not only software engineering. CS is not only coding. CS is not only AI.\n\nAI is an incredibly useful booster tool, however it is still quite unreliable if you want to develop something very complex, in a fully automated and unsupervised way. There is promising progress with models like AlphaDev, where the AI \"invents\" new sorting algorithms faster than any human algorithm, by gamifying the process of adding specific assembly instructions to compose the sorting program. However, a human being would never \"invent\" something this way, by trying millions of combinations with a tutor telling them how good each of their trials are. It is very ineffective and it's definitely not \"smart\". A game changing paradigm shift in how we train AI models hasn't happened yet, and the possibility of hitting a technical hard wall (like physical limitations for processors or networking systems), is still quite high. So, unless a sudden groundbreaking milestone in either computing/networking/model training is achieved, I don't think \"AGI/ASI will come in 10 years\" comments have much foundation. I'm not saying it won't happen, I'm just saying that it won't happen for the reasons AGI/ASI-hypers believe it is going to happen right now, it'll just be a coincidence. SORA/ChatGPT are not the ancestors of AGI/ASI, AGI/ASI will probably be a completely different digital species.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that saying \"CS is ruined/screwed/done\" is exaggeration, at least for now. You'll have no trouble finding a job if you build up the skill set that differentiates you from other candidates. Sure, it is harder to find a CS-related job compared to 2010, because it is so much more competitive. You simply have to be better at what you are doing.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Until machines can think, good CS grads will be fine.",

EE is vast and has some pretty amazing topics to explore. I'm heavily considering EE myself but I'm not sure I could handle the extra math load so I'm still thinking about it.",

            "It\u2019s going to be fine. Complete your CS degree. Unless you\u2019re going to a top 10 college, don\u2019t put everything on some big tech job as your first one out of college. There are plenty of CS roles in manufacturing, finance, retail that pay much more than the average household income. With a couple years of experience and a degree, then aim for whatever you want. A lot of this sub\u2019s pain is self-inflicted; a narrow scope of what CS degree holders can do coupled with the expectation of a FAANG offer right out of school.",
            "**tl;dr - I suspect the pairing of CS + <some other field> will be valuable for at least the next 15 years, but who knows?**\n\n\nWe know AI will augment+empower software engineer in the short term and eventually replace most/all software engineers in the long term. However, there's a lot of work that needs to happen both in computer science and in the physical world, and we need people for it.\n\n\nWe don't just want smart chatbots or bots that can write code. We want AI *everywhere* doing *everything* we want it to. We want a world where everyone can eat healthy, adequately exercise, participate in communities, etc.\n\n\nWe need autonomous farms, we need smart resilient supply chains, we need AI that does chores for parents so that parents can spend more time with their kids, we need 24/7 physical therapists, we need automated truck drivers or better means of transporting goods, we need prejudice-free justice systems, etc. - truly many many things that need to be automated. And it won't be easy (e.g. just look at how much time + $ has been spent building robots to \"just\" lay bricks, and they're *still* seldom used).\n\n\nWe also need a tremendous amount of cheap, sustainable energy and skilled folks with the right resources to make it all happen. There is a tremendous amount of work necessary to make it all happen. \n\n\nComing back to your question: if you're concerned about AI affecting your job security then think about what you want your role to be in the coming revolution. Is it \"solving\" policy, is it \"solving\" supply chain, is it \"solving\" farms, is it \"solving\" energy, etc. For this reason, I believe a pairing of CS + [medicine/energy/agriculture/hardware/mechanical/etc.] will be valuable.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I don't have a pairing in CS + <some other field>. I'm a CS graduate. I personally think human centered software engineering is here to stay for at least another 10 years. I wouldn't consider myself an individual qualified to discuss this topic. I also think most people here in r/csmajors aren't qualified by virtue of being in the subreddit :P but my thoughts differ from what's been shared in this thread so the above are my thoughts and you should take it with a bucket of salt.",

            "To be honest having AI replaces us is the last of my worries. If AI manages to replace us then that means it will literally replace most (if not all) of the professions out there, translators, photographers, video editors, designers, authors, architectures, traditional jobs of course, and the list goes on and on, even the medical field would certainly get affected by it, so as I said if it is fucked for us, it would be fucked for all of the other professions.",

That's not the case because you have to be able to know what to google, how to interpret the results and apply them.  The same thing is true for AI/LLM.  It might make engineers more efficient, so maybe less jobs, but we're not anywhere close to replacing software engineers.",
            "I\u2019m not worried at all tbh, if you actually do some coding you realize that ai is a great tool that makes the job easier but it can\u2019t just code everything by itself or come up with creative ideas. I think the bubble burst tho, which means you gotta be a better student, do lots of co-op and side projects. You gotta network to get a junior position.

Last year, we received around 150 applications for 5 internship positions, \n\nI interviewed 27% of applicants (40).\n3.3% of applicants were hired.\n\nWhen filtering applications, you need to be reasonably harsh, I have my regular assignments alongside hiring, so I only want to take 15 minutes to chat to the stand-out candidates. \n\nEveryone mentions their college grades and gives some info about a college project. This makes it pretty useless aside from being a general gauge. The majority of people talk about interesting projects and have decent grades. Without talking to each of the maybe 100+ candidates who have an interesting \"college\" section, I can't use this because I have no idea who worked on what, and what your knowledge of the project really is. \n\nMaybe 45% of candidates include their GitHub. (Probably a generous percentage) \n\nThe vast majority of these only have college assignments. Quite frequently, group projects are on their repo in one commit, which is useless because I've no idea who worked on what.\n\nMaybe 5% have professional quality side projects. \n\nLast year, no candidate had contributed to an open source project - big plus because it shows you can follow a release process and get some code deployed\n\n\nIn my opinion, having open source contributions or having a high-quality project available on your GitHub (that isn't very old or else is being actively worked on) are two things that will pretty much guarantee an interview.\n\nI advise making your Github the focus of your application.  Make sure it's included at the top of your resume, in your cover letter, and ideally have a section of your resume where you talk about your interesting \"professional\" standard projects and include the links to the repo.

            "I work as a CS tutor for freshmen & sophomores. From what I've seen I'd say the most visible sign is just giving up on an assignment after they run into 1-2 initial bugs, and expect someone else (such as the tutor) to do it for them and/or cheating online. Do not expect to be spoonfed, and be comfortable with working hard if you want to make it through a CS curriculum! \n\nI had a guy come to me for CS III (a programming class but with mid-level data structures like linked lists) asking me how to read text from a file (which is CS II stuff btw). When I asked him to write a loop until a given condition he was deadass BLANK. This guy did not know the syntax for a for-loop. He couldn't declare arrays without being told character for character what to write. It's embarassing and a waste of $$ if you aren't putting in the effort to learn in your classes and it *will* catch up to you.

Students always underestimate the time it takes to complete an assignment and the next thing you know, you\u2019re stuck with a bunch of run time errors which you\u2019re too panicky to solve last minute.\nBut those students who actually push themselves to sit with their code ans debug it, make it out strong!!!",

I work in the cs help centre and I see a lot of students really struggling, but instead of working through the problems to learn, they lean on each other (friends who are also struggling) and copy code, sometimes don\u2019t complete assignments ect. To succeed in cs you will encounter extremely hard concepts and you need to dive in fully. E.g. You won\u2019t learn linked lists in c++ without drawing a lot of pictures and trying really hard to wrap your brain around it. When students expect me to spell it out for them, or they abruptly leave the help centre after I give them \u201cstep 1: learn about x\u201d suggestion, I always get a sinking feeling. Cs classes are not topics you can skate by in without understanding (or by cheating) and hope to start fresh next semester. You will fall more and more behind if you don\u2019t go through the pain of that early learning. Some people are unable to do this hard work, for many reasons. I think fear and shame with struggling is a big part of it. If they start to fall behind, they will try to hide it and only make it worse.",

Being confused, feeling dumb, and overwhelmed are all reasonable and fairly expected. But not having even a vague idea of what\u2019s going on in class, like not knowing the current week\u2019s lectures are  about object oriented programming, is probably a sign that you\u2019ll end up failing if you continue with that pattern. People always say start early start often, but there are still people that start late and put in the same amount of hours or more to get the job done. They can still make it. Not putting in the hours, whether it\u2019s a few a day or all at once, is a pretty good indicator.",

You don\u2019t need to be any sort of prodigy to make it through a CS bachelors, at least not at my college. The people who gave up on pursuing CS were the people who couldn\u2019t be patient when solving a problem. Instead of seeking help or taking time to troubleshoot or think through the assignment, they would just panic. As a SWE, it is normal to have to learn new things that may be difficult to understand at first.

Don't be that guy, work on your projects as soon as you get them.\n* Cheating - I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with using services like Quizlet, Chegg, Stackoverflow. However, you should always use these resources with the intent to learn from them. You should use them to understand problems. Don't just copy and paste solutions. You're paying for your classes, so you should take advantage of them and truly absorb the fundamentals.\n* No interest - You absolutely NEED to be at least moderately interested in programming and CS to get through the curriculum. If you're not then you're going to find this experience insufferable and you probably won't do well. There are a lot of people who go into this major solely because of the money, and these people get weeded out pretty quick.\n\nIf you avoid these three things, then you'll probably pass. However, if you want to do well then you need to go further than this then you have to proactive. You should ask questions whenever you don't understand something, you should feel comfortable collaborating with others, you should be able to do research on your own, you should do projects in your spare time, you should try to get full marks in all your classes and all your assignments. If you're on top of things then you'll have nothing to worry about, it'll be a fun experience for you.",

In fact the guy in your story sounds like he had shite social skills and bad grades so the boys were right again i s'pose...\n\nBut my point is don't let studying hard or grinding be an acceptable reason to not polish social skills. They're important and you can have it all baby.\n\nSincerely, jeff Bezos",

            "Well there are people like this everywhere. I am from Greece and I am a postgraduate student in a theoretical computer science master programme. I was full of hope for my master! Finally I was going to meet people who care about science and want to learn new things! Well, I meat this kind of people, but I meat another kind as well. There are groups of people trading projects and assignment sollutions, asking you of solutions for excersises with no same at all! Why did they even signed for a master's programme?\n\nHere in Greece there is also a great moral issue as well. You must sympathize to people not going well to their studies and help them, but no one cares for the guy or gal who studies hard and archives his or hers goals! On the contrary, if you getting well, you masr be modest about it!\n\nI say fuck those people! Hard work is a good think, and those who work hard will find a way in the end! Fuck that guy you mention as well, no one should feel sorry for douchebags!",
            "there were so many assholes that acted superior to me and also leeched off my work in a way that they didn't have to do anything, I can't remember them all!!!!",
            "Little 18 year old me always felt like something was wrong with me in situations like this.\n22 year old me knows that the way that I act is different than the way they act. If I act in a way that is genuine to myself and genuinely respects others, then it must be an issue with the other person. Disliking someone for their poor character takes a lot more energy than feeling empathy for them because they are stuck with a such a poor character that is formed by [not my business]. \n\nYa get out of this world exactly what ya put into it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
