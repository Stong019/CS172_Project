        "selftext": "Hello again r/csMajors! Some of you may remember me from my [incorrectly titled post last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/jgt7ce/i_got_7_internship_offers_a_long_summary_of_my/) where I received \"7\" (eventually 9) internship offers. After that whirlwind of a recruiting season, I was expecting to have a more laid-back time this year, especially with a return offer from my internship under my belt.\n\nI submitted 41 applications (most of them as a joke) vs my 120+ from last year, sat back, and was immediately overwhelmed by the number of responses I got, so I decided to make another Reddit post.\n\n**About Me:**\n\n* Senior @ large state school (can tell which one by my post history, again)\n* Double majoring in CS & Business Analytics\n* 3.3 GPA (higher than last year thanks to open notes exams...)\n* Two internships, a part time tech support job, 2 leadership positions (VP of one club, director of another) at school, 2 projects\n* US Citizen\n\nI tried to do a Sankey, but that quickly got confusing because this time around, a few of my interview processes were through the CodePath career fair & my prior recruiting contacts (I attended Grace Hopper but it only barely helped this time around, mostly because I was being selective with the number of interviews I was doing). So here's some quick facts instead.\n\n**Quick Stats From This Year:**\n\n* **Applications Submitted: 41**\n* **Offers Received: 7 (JPMorgan return offer, IBM, VMWare, Asana, Capital One, Deutsche Bank, NBCUniversal)**\n* **# of Resume Rejects: only one** (thanks Duolingo)\n* **# of Total Rejections: 15** (mostly after OAs & interviews)\n* **Interviews Done: 20** (including first rounds & finals)\n\n**Notable Moments:**\n\n* **Rejected from Hubspot after final** because it was my first ever System Design interview and I hadn't studied, oops...\n* **Rejected from Microsoft after final** because one of my interviewers insisted my answer was wrong... when it was right... and the code ran with the correct output... whatever. No hard feelings!\n* **Visa did 4 technical interviews, and then asked for a FIFTH one** so I finally turned them down.\n* **Rejected from Facebook after first phone** because it was my first interview of the season and I hadn't interviewed anywhere in a year.\n* **During my VMWare final interviews, one round was entirely systems/OS/networking questions. I'd never taken a systems class in my entire college career.** Even though I answered \"I don't know\" to every question, and had to explain why I didn't take Systems/OS to the interviewer, I still got the offer somehow?\n* **Got sent the Google snapshot. I didn't do it. Recruiter reached out to me asking me to do it. I ghosted the recruiter.** I was absolutely exhausted after interviewing so much & Google's process is known to take FOREVER. Freshman me would probably slap current me if she knew though.\n* **Asana's final round was the longest I'd ever done, at 5 hours & 15 minutes, and because of time zones it ended at 9 PM my time** but it was also the most enjoyable interview process I've ever done, even when it was so long & ended relatively late.\n\nIf anyone's interested I can add a list of every single company I interviewed with this fall in an edit, but since I only applied to 40 places the list would be kind of short. I also don't want to ramble on like I did in my post last year!\n\n**Tips for recruiting?**\n\n* For full time (or even 2nd/3rd internships), **\"warm\" email any recruiters you talked to in the past.** Especially if you got far in their process last time, they'll probably be willing to take a chance on you again (make sure to re-introduce yourself if it's been a while). With Facebook I failed the first phone for their internship last year, but I emailed my recruiter this year and his response was \"I was meaning to reach out to you again, just apply and I'll send you the first phone scheduling right after\" so you literally never know.\n* **Programs like CodePath and Facebook's ABCS really helped me.** Why? Because I study better with concrete goals/homework and other people, in a class-like setting. Facebook's ABCS is very well suited for sophomores & juniors seeking internships. CodePath's advanced technical interview prep class is suited towards full time since they cover a bit of system design. CodePath is especially great because their homework is directly assigned from Leetcode, and if you don't do it you get kicked from the program. Finish it all, and you get access to their invite-only career fair with 50+ companies. Pretty good incentive to Leetcode if you ask me.\n* **Get your application in front of human eyes as quickly as possible.** Even if its not your actual application, visit the company at a career fair or something, and if you get the chance to talk with a recruiter, tell them you applied and are interested in their opportunities -- they're more likely to go and check at your application after. This is how I got \"un-ghosted\" -- talking to recruiters at GHC and the CodePath career fair.\n* **SOFT SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT.** If you know how to solve a problem but can't explain your reasoning clearly to the interviewer, they WILL be confused. I think that's what cost me the Microsoft interview this year -- see above, I probably didn't explain my correct solution well enough. On the other hand, though, I can't count how many times I was absolutely clueless during an interview, but my communication & honesty saved me -- see VMWare above.\n* **If you're job searching for the first time, get your resume reviewed & PUT IT THROUGH A PARSER.** Human feedback is definitely the first step, but after you quantify your descriptions and find a good layout, put your resume through a site like [jobscan.co](https://jobscan.co), VMock (offered by some schools' career centers), or even the few student-made parsers I've seen on this subreddit to see if it accurately determines your major/experience etc from your resume.\n* **Studying for System Design? Use the** [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)**.** I didn't pay for Grokking, the primer had everything I needed to pass Asana's system design portion. If only I'd studied it for Hubspot...\n* **Remember, you only need one offer.** It was definitely discouraging to me as an underclassman when I saw people picking between every FAANG and Citadel, but remember if you're starting out, all you need is that first company to give you a chance. Having choices is great (and sometimes scary) but even a single offer & nothing else can open a LOT of doors moving forward, so once you get that first offer letter, pat yourself on the back! You made it through a bunch of filtering to get there, and now the only direction you can go is even higher :)\n\nIf you've made it this far, you may be wondering **which offer I accepted** \\-- I'm not gonna take up any more space on this post, so **check out my flair on this subreddit for your answer ;)**\n\nBesides that, if anyone has questions about anything related to internship or full time recruiting/handling offers/my experiences/etc, **feel free to ask in the comments and I'll be answering as many as I can!** Since I've gotten 17 offers total in my time at college, I've pretty much done it all at this point so I want to give back and help all of you out too :D thanks for reading!\n\n\\--\n\nBrief Edit: After signing my offer this morning I accidentally walked straight into a trash can on the way to class; the comments about trash cans are all my friends hahah\n\nEdit 2: I've been told that the CEO & founder of CodePath reposted this Reddit post on his LinkedIn, which is so unexpected but also very cool.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019m Dr. Josh Bastean, and I teach web development and education courses at Coker University. With all the recent insanity, all our courses have moved online. I am in the process of recording the entire content of my Modern Web Development course, and decided to go ahead and post the videos on YouTube, hoping to help more people learn the joys of web development.\n\nI posted about this a few months ago and had lots of great feedback, so I wanted to reach out again to hopefully help anyone who hasn't already seen it.\n\n[Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOmsPg4YcdQLREdVWi1Fb04esgmMzarL2Dcux6v27n8/edit) for a brief overview (aka \"syllabus\").\n\n[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQSmIhc0GVPPhpBAC3y6xChtOz3RJ8abN) for a link to the YouTube playlist.\n\nI have already uploaded about 2/3 of the total course videos, and will continue to upload new ones as I complete them. As of right now, I\u2019ve covered all of the front-end and started on back-end with Node.js, Express, EJS, and APIs. I'm currently working on the videos that start the final project (which we build over the last several weeks of the course): a \"Yelp Clone\" website focused on the topic of your choice. I'm doing Comic Books, but pick something you enjoy. We'll be adding MongoDB, Passport, EJS-Flash, pushing our code to Github, and deploying to Heroku.\n\nI hope this helps a few people learn to love programming as much as I do. I started by watching these types of videos, and I wanted to pay it forward to the next generation.\n\n[Here's the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/fxxvyl/free_fullstack_htmlcssjs_nodeexpressmongodb_web/) for anyone interested.",

The way you simplify things is just amazing. I've been meaning to learn Web dev for a long time but I can't start till Feb of next year. But this is for sure that I'm going to use this course to learn Web dev. Also, I've downloaded the whole course from youtube so that I can get a reminder next year. Thank you so much sir \n\nP.S.
