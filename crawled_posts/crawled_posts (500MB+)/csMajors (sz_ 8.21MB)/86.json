Doesn't matter as long as it feels good and reminds you why you want to keep going :)\n\nAlso: a lot of people are absolutely tanking their mental health with an all-or-nothing approach to COVID.

        "selftext": "I messed up a lot as a Meta intern, here's what i learned... Here is my humble attempt to distill 10+ years of tech experience into tactical tips that separate good and bad interns.\n\nMy experience ranges from a 3-person startup to 400 people at Pinterest to 25K people at Meta. This advice is designed for full-time software engineering interns working at a company with a well-defined intern program (i.e. at the bare minimum, you have a dedicated Intern Manager).\n\nI'm breaking my advice into 4 sections: (1) onboarding efficiently, (2) working with your manager, (3) writing the code, and (4) working on a team.\n\n# Onboarding efficiently\n\n* Act with urgency to get onboarded. Internships are very short, and you need to ramp up quickly to justify your return offer.\n* **Don't be afraid of \"over-asking\"**: if you're polite and include context, you will be fine no matter how many questions you ask. Prefer real-time modes of help (like chat) over email.\n* Don't rabbit hole trying to explore every part of a codebase or environment. There will be lots of things you don't understand when you enter a massive codebase, and that's ok.\n* Aim to merge your first Pull Request (PR) or code change by the end of week 1.\n\n# Working with your manager\n\n* Your intern manager (IM) will play a critical role in your internship experience. **You should have a recurring 1:1 meeting with them**, ideally at a weekly cadence.\n* **Make clear that you want feedback**. Tell your manager (and others) that you treat feedback as a gift, and you act on it quickly.\n* Instead of asking \"*How am I doing?*\", ask questions that give you more signal like \"*Relative to your expectations of progress at this point, how far along am I?*\" You don't want to be surprised with negative feedback at your mid-cycle or terminal meeting.\n\n# Writing the code\n\n* As an engineering intern, **your raw coding output is, by far, the most important metric**.\n* **Keep your code changes focused**. The size of the change will depend on context, but 25-250 LoC is a decent target.\n* Make sure that every code change has an explanation. Add a \"context\" section explaining your higher-level goal, e.g. the goal of your intern project.\n* **Attach a test plan to show that your code works**. A detailed test plan helps reviewers trust your change and also turns the PR into a high-value artifact. Bonus points if you add a screenshot or video.\n* Respond to code review comments quickly (within 30 minutes) and gracefully. Keep an eye on code review notifications.\n\n# Working on a team\n\n* **Broadcast updates to the team regularly**, especially as you hit major milestones. Include a clear description of the problem you're tackling, your progress so far, and your request for feedback.\n* **There should be at least one written update that has a permalink**. Imagine putting a portfolio together of your work -- you want to link to something. A standup update is not enough!\n* Schedule at least a few 1:1s with the key people involved in the project. Talk to them about your project, but also their broader career. The network you develop at an internship can be one of the key assets.\n\nI added a bit more detail to these points in [this blog post](https://www.jointaro.com/blog/the-ultimate-software-engineer-internship-survival-guide/) if you're interested :) Good luck to all summer 2023 interns!",

I think if you perform half as well as this guide suggests (and you're learning stuff and things), you're doing great.\n\n1-on-1s is great advice, talk to lots of folks.  If you're interested in grad school / academia, see if your fte mentor or SDM can find you some folks with ms/PhD to talk to.  They can give you valuable insight into later education decisions.",

            "Great tips, just like to add one thing that I notice lots of interns (and even new hires) not doing - asking why a certain task needs to be done. When given a task, try your best to understand why it needs to be done and what's the problem you're trying to solve. If you can't answer that, then you should ask why until you can. Only when you understand the why, can you find the best solution. Too many interns just do what they're told at face level without understanding and give solutions that are totally off.",

            "Lol what? My first week was setting up my mac, accounts, messing with bash, and starting to install arch Linux...",
            "This is bullshit",
            "Definitely ask tons of question, but realize that your intern manager is not your personal search engine / debugging tool. Give them context which shows you\u2019ve put effort into solving the problem yourself and helps them better understand where you\u2019re getting blocked. For example\n\nBad question: I\u2019m trying to add a new dependency on a library, but it\u2019s not working. Do you know what\u2019s going wrong?\n\nBetter question: I\u2019m trying to add a new dependency to library XYZ, but am getting an error. Looking at the logs it says there is a conflicting version number. I looked up the error message on stackoverflow and tried the solution suggested in this post (link), but am running into the same error code and am stuck. Any ideas on how to move forward?\n\nNot only does this make it easier for your teammate to understand and help solve the issue, but it also shows you value their time and will make for a good future teammate.",
            "I feel like these \"hyper-practical\" tips are based on your experience at Meta, and hence are hyper-specific for Meta internships. I have a friend who was an intern there, and holy heck was he under constant pressure to deliver merge requests and hit whatever metrics necessary to earn a good feedback. If you're a Meta intern, these might be good advices, but if you're not, don't read too much into this.",
            "I\u2019m an L4 at Amazon, I honestly think this is all great advice. Merging code in the first week is a good goal to shoot for. Don\u2019t kill yourself working if you can\u2019t, but it would surely wow your teammates and boss if you did.",
            "A lot of this is unrealistic and quite honestly, unnecessary. \nYour expectations should be what your manager wants you to do, and if you as an intern think it's unrealistic you should tell them as it's also probably their first time mentoring an intern. \n\nTalk with people, make connections, communicate with your mentor and the rest of your team while asking for stuff like advice and if there's anything else you can do. \nThat's really all you need. Don't try to rush anything or feel as if you should finish projects within your *first week*,  none of that is required and absolutely ridiculous to do.",
            "Thank you!",
            "> As an engineering intern, your raw coding output is, by far, the most important metric.\n\nI feel this heavily varies by company. I'm not sure this was even tracked at any of my internships, aside from maybe at Google. I know this is very important at Meta though.",

        "selftext": "Hello! I am currently 18 in community college finishing my internship. Near the end of the internship the company gave me an offer of 120K USD salary for a full time software engineering role. I thought that it would be after I finish college, but the company said I can start January of 2023. I am conflicted because I wanted to transfer to a college to get into software engineering, but the job offer I received is similar to starting pay out of college. I wanted another opinion as I am not sure if I should continue to work at the company or go to college. Also, the company is a top software company internationally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nHello everyone, I read all the comments and chatted with some people that gave me some solid advice and I saw that a lot of people are thinking about how I am bragging about the situation. First I want to make it clear, YES I am excited to receive this offer, I know it is crazy for a person at 18 to receive this and we are in a recession, but my whole plan had been shifted as I wanted to go to community college for two years, transfer and get a degree. I also have strict asian parents, that dont understand the idea of studying while having a job. I also really had no idea.\n\nI haven't responded yet to anyone down in the comments. I had honestly only been looking for a second opinion on this matter and did not even know the option for full time working with studying (Thank you). I know a lot of people are expecting me to be some genius, or someone who prepared super early, but the truth is nothing like that. For the internship, I had experience in working at a local company for front end development, won some awards in High School, taken AP CS A, IB CS 2, and created some personal projects that meant something to me. I did whatever I saw on youtube, making my resume better, leetcode, and reading cracking the coding interview. By complete luck through the use of mass applying, a company had been willing to take a chance on me. By the end of the internship, the company stated to me that we are extending offers, and they were opening a new department that needed more .NET developers. I know a lot of people are disappointed right now thinking I am something that I am not. I did not have a great resume with many experiences, sure I might have been above average for a person who started CS at my age, but compared to a 4 year graduate, it definitely not that good. I am sure many people are dissatisfied or disappointed and that is why I have not responded until now. I feel like it had been being at the right place at the right time as I feel like I have similar experiences to a lot of people getting internships. If anyone is interested about the specifics in my stats I will state them below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongressional Award Winner for CS\n\nGold Excellence in CS (High school) basically the department chair picks students that have a proven ability in CS\n\nTaken 4 years of CS at my High School  (Exploring CS, AP CSP, AP CSA, IB CS 2)\n\nCS Instructor then promoted to head CS Instructor then to front end developer. (1 year)\n\nCS Instructor again for a data science learning company\n\n**Personal Projects**\n\nasp.net, c#, html, css (what got me the internship because it had direct correlation to the projects they wanted their interns to work on)\n\njava xml - saw this really cool video about a simulated virtual ecosystem online and decided to create it in java, then make it into an app using android studio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will also start responding to people in the comments or people who pm me, so let me know your questions down below.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Hi, I'm a person who was in a similar spot spot and ended up making 110k at 17 remotely while working on my college degree at the same time. I also had considered full-time for 140k in-person in SF but I realized the opportunity cost compared to getting a college degree was poor (I was confident I could get over 140k out of college).\n\nNot having a college degree for life will tremendously hold you back in terms of security and job hopping (hence leveling). Your career will last you over 50 years, and the security and growth provided by the degree is invaluable. You also have to consider the company - what's the chance of you getting laid off or the company losing runway and going belly up? If you get fired, are you confident you can find more interviews at other companies without a degree? In my case it was a startup, and while it had runway, I knew if I got laid off it would be very hard for me.\n\nThe remote option was also best for me because college is by far the easiest way into FAANG and big tech. Internships are OP, and I ended up getting first-year internships at Apple and Stripe at 17 and 18 respectively. The optimal decision here in my opinion would be where you could somehow do both at once. If that isn't possible, I would still go towards the college degree since FAANG out of college pays more and gives you life-long security. That's a bit more subjective though and you have to be confident you can land a better job out of college.\n\nI'm happy to DM if you have more questions.",

That\u2019s more than if you work at this company for the next 4 years, all in one year only. \n\n\nThe bottom line is that this is not some crazy opportunity, it\u2019s a dime a dozen in this world.

            "These days faang hiring is a lot slower than it was in 2021. Competition is intense and companies don\u2019t want new grads but prefer experienced folks as new grad market is flooded. I am very worried about future CS grads as supply of graduates is increasing  at a crazy rate while the demand for them is dropping a lot more. AI is also making workers a lot more productive. A 100 engineer project can be done with lot fewer engineers with help of AI to generate code for you. AI specialization should still be valuable for next 5-10 years but generic SWe demand is going to be low lower at faang. Apple and Google are not growing much and are pretty stagnant. Netflix is not a big employer to begin with. Only meta is still going well now and hiring. Amazon is the least desirable faang and they may also not hire like in the past",
            "Honestly, a top school is much harder these days since most top schools like Michigan, Berkeley, UIUC, etc. cap admissions for CS so it isn't enough to just get into the school but you also have to be really good to get into the CS program at these schools. And unfortunately, I don't think it'll become any easier getting into a top school. A job at FAANG realistically requires you to grind for maybe a year wherase a top school is most of high school and also when the market gets better getting a job at FAANG will become easier.",

            "It takes 4 years of high school and like a 2 years before high school to have a chance for a top undergrad school (especially the T20 privates in US News).\n\nIt takes me a few hours at most to prep for a tech company. Let alone the fact you can apply every 6 months to a bunch of places and have a redo. \n\nFAANG+ is a joke to crack. Getting into a top school is extremely difficult to crack (and you only get one chance). Let alone for the latter, you have to sell your childhood (when you aren't even mature) to all sorts of extra curriculars.\n\nAttended Columbia Univ (when US News ranked it regularly T4) and also passed bars for Amazon 2x/Apple/Google (for FAANG) and many other tech firms.\n\nFAANG+ out of college is hard to get in mostly because you don't get the interviews. That's not on you. Just on luck. Since the pandemic, companies have been more liberal with online assessments but overall, the difficulty is really the part out of your control (getting into the loop). The actual interview questions for new grads are absolute jokes that an elementary kid can do.\n\nThe real pain is the politics working at FAANG+. Each day a small piece of you dies. That's the price you pay. And the constant stress of another layoff or offshoring. At some point, it just isn't worth it.",

            "I think the question should be what provides the better R\u1ed2I in terms of effort and time invested? I will say it\u2019s FAANG both in the long term and short term apart from few edge case scenarios where other people in the world choose top school candidates due to halo effect. A strong peer group is a big advantage in these schools which can play out big if you do take advantage of it",

            "These are two very different cases. Comparing apples to oranges really.\n\nThe concept of \u201cwhats harder\u201d applied to colleges and FAANG+ is, in my opinion, inapplicable. You see a bunch of cases of kids going to feeder schools that cost $30,000 a year for highschools that churn out a ton of students that go to top schools every year. These are all around the country. I\u2019d say it\u2019s almost expected that these students go to top schools because, since they have more wealth, it\u2019s easier for them to have access to more resources to get into these institutions. \n\nThere are many stories of people having books ghostwritten for their college apps and I have seen consultants getting paid upwards to $20,000 for application reviews and 1:1 help for common apps. College apps have become nothing but a matter of \u201chow much money do you have\u201d.\n\nSo, when it comes down to it, I do think getting a top job within CS is harder. You (usually) can\u2019t rely on your family\u2019s wealth to get you through many of the challenging interview processes that are given by FAANG companies. I\u2019ve seen a ton of students from top CS schools not get a single offer for the summer this season- why? Well, this could be a few reasons. Lack of understanding the material, lack of actual personable skills, not able to network, etc. its very easy to, in a market where higher education is a bare from entry, say that your school name could carry you through. I\u2019m sure it has for many people. But I think people in this thread are severely underestimating the amount of people who apply to these high profile opportunities.\n\n[A googler\u2019s experience](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-really-like-to-be-a-google-intern-2013-5) from 2013 said that they had 40,000 people apply and only 1,500 people were accepted- which is an acceptance rate of 4%.

            "I dropped out of a public state-funded university and work at FAANG. Never in my wildest dreams could I have fathomed attending a top CS school (depending on your definition). That being said, I meet plenty of people from those schools that are absolute dingbats and tried for years to crack FAANG. Focus on getting into the best school for what your long-term interests are, or at least what school gives you the best options in case you aren\u2019t sure. Focus on figuring out what you want to focus on and you\u2019ll be fine. Prestige only gets you a good party conversation at a certain point.",
