        "selftext": "Howdy,\n\n**TLDR:** Don't give up! *The grind pays off*\n\n3 years, 600 rejections later, just got an internship from the place ***that shall not be named***.\n\nWhat I think made the difference in getting responses:In the last 4 months, I added 2 new projects, that made my response rate go from 0 for 400 applications to about 7 for my last 200 application push. Not amazing, but after no responses from all my prior, I felt like I cured COVID.\n\nMy major focus for these projects were to make them either flashy/cool or useful to solve a real life problem I had and that anyone could use. For both, I had a genuine narrative of why I did the project, what it solved for me, and me going from dumb to competent in my journey of learning how to make it.One was a web-scraping project that has a discord bot to tell me when NVIDIA 30XX is in stock and runs on AWS.Other was a computer vision project that tracks social distance violations.Funnily enough, didn't know how to do either, both ended up being less than 500 lines of code. My tip, lean *heavily* on libraries, apis, and code from others. A lot of my learning (and positive interviewer comments) came from learning to connect things together, not innovating from the ground up. Not ragging on the latter; however, it's dramatically easier to make\n\nWhat didn't make a difference:Any classes I took, GPA, not having internships. Actually removed a prior internship I had on my resume because I only used Excel and always got negative comments from career fair people about it.\n\nAdvice to anyone in my shoes as of 6 months ago, use awesome premade tools to make awesome products.\n\n**Most importantly**, what I've learned and saw in myself, applicable to everyone working their heart out...  \nYou're not an idiot.  \nYou're not gonna work at the coffee shop forever.  \nYou're not a failure.  \nAnd yes, yes, you're good enough to be a software developer.\n\nEDIT: ***that shall not be named*** *=* ~~^(amazon)~~, I'm just a boy trying to meme  \nEDIT2: I'm a senior going to be a super senior.",

That\u2019s so ridiculous. Who tf cares? The quality of an internship shouldn\u2019t be measured by how hard it is to get into but by what you come out with.

            "Unless you are going for a MAANG company doing daily LC exercises probably isn't as important as you think.  I went through the interview process twice now, once after college and again now a few years later.  The few LC problems I have gotten have been laughably easy.  Most companies are moving towards more realistic coding exercises to see if you can write clean code, unit tests, etc...  For example, I recently got a technical exercise that was to create a simple REST API and then expand on it.  My first job out of college had me write a math library in Python and unit test it.\n\nIf you are concerned about LC I would suggest focusing primarily on knowing the implementation of certain algorithms and the time/space complexity of your data structures.  There is a finite number of data structures and algorithms out there.  Instead of trying to memorize every LC problem, know your DS and Algo's and then apply the appropriate one to the LC problem.  i.e.  \"Oh a look-ahead algorithm with a hashmap would be good here\"  It seems so many people are grinding LC like they trying to memorize every possible solution and that doesn't seem like it would be effective to me.\n\n*Edit:  One thing I should add is that every other part of the interview process is just as important as the technical.  Reddit acts like the technical challenge is the lynchpin of the interview process.  It really isn't.  I've interviewed potential hires in my last role and I watched us choose people who were mediocre on the technical over people who were great technically primarily because of their soft skills and their culture fit.  It won't matter how well you crush the technical if you flop during the informational and/or panel portion of the interview process.*",

Last year I was applying and interviewing up until a month before internships started, this year I already have an offer for summer 2023.
