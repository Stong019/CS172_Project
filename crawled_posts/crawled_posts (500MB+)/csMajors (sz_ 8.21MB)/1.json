Now it's flooded by mediocre normies.\n3. Grinding. You have to grind CS for a thousand hours and then you'll just be average.\n4. Cheating. So many people cheat so it's extremely unfair.\n\nSo that's why the new Counter Strike game is pretty much dead already. It has some neat smoke physics but otherwise it is inferior to other games.

            "Just a few remarks:\n\n* It is far less competitive than other fields and only like 2-3 years ever 10 years or so when there a crisis. The rest of the time, just puting your CV online get you a job withing a week.\n* It was always flooded by mediocre people because like everywhere else, elite people are elite, that is a small minority.\n* Like most jobs, yes you are bad when you are just out of university and you need to get some XP to become decent. I'd say at least 5. But outside of very basic job that's kind of always the case everywhere.\n* I don't know what you imply with cheating, but once you are working, you have to be sure your boss and coworker have a good opinion. If you were stupid enough to cheat and not learn, for sure things become complex.\n\nOverall it is isn't for everybody by far, but it is being on easy mode. This isn't like other field with high pay are so much easier like health care or law or even sales. \n\nI think computer science is easy and pay well.

Its reliance on the United States (especially on foreign aid) is not good for America economically, nor for our public image.

In tech hubs, women can find high paying dudes easily. If you\u2019re hot without being charming, women will be down to hookup and will make moves but refuse to do anything long term. I had a few women that straight up told me they\u2019d like to make out and hookup but not interested in relationship. \n\nI also typically don\u2019t have too much issue with women making first move on me and most of my successful interactions have been when they make first move. I usually don\u2019t do as well when I make the first move.\n\nIn terms of what lessons this has for the original post, the message is that personality matters and money and looks can\u2019t compensate for a cs personality.",

Factory workers have little impact on, say, how good the new Ford model is. Meanwhile 95% of what makes Google's products good is their engineers (especially senior and above).\n\nI highly doubt Google will be able to maintain their company culture and standards for engineering excellence when you have all these teams split across poor countries with completely different culture and work environment than the US. I think there's a reason why almost all of the important/innovative/profitable tech companies came from the US, even though the US is only 4% of the world's population. Somehow I doubt Google's next big product, or any big tech breakthrough for that matter, is going to come out of Mexico City or Mumbai.\n\nOffshoring is something companies do when they're desperately chasing short-term profits, not growing and innovating.\n\nWe also don't need to look far to see how offshoring has made other companies deteriorate. Boeing, anyone? And all of the dying automotive and hardware engineering companies? Google's situation seems awfully similar: slowing growth so they start cutting corners to maintain facade of good profits for shareholders.",
