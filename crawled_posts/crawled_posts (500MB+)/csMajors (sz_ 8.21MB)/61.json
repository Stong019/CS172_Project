        "selftext": " I asked 7 levels of engineers (Entry-Level to Distinguished Engineer) to share the most important skill for their level. As you keep getting promoted, you become less technology-focused and more team and business-focused at the higher levels of the engineering ladder.\n\nI'm in the Bay Area, so everyone I talked to works at a large company in California. Wanted to call this out as a potential bias, but I think the takeaways apply across company size or geography. \n\n**New Grad Engineer (L3 at Slack)**: \n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Skill: Learn from existing patterns to solve common problems. \n* \ud83e\udd89 Advice: Leverage engineers on other teams who may help unblock you. \n\n**Mid-level Engineer (L4 at Qualcomm)**: \n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Skill: Efficient log analysis to identify and debug issues. \n* \ud83e\udd89 Advice: Keep notes on your work so you become increasingly self-sufficient. \n\n**Senior Engineer (L5 at Meta)**: \n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Skill: Align project expectations and ensure projects benefit both the company and your growth. \n* \ud83e\udd89 Advice: Build strong relationships with people you work with, helping them where possible. \n\n**Staff Engineer (L6 at Gusto)**: \n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Skill: Level up your team and ensure they internalize feedback to become independent. \n* \ud83e\udd89 Advice: Learn the problems in the org by talking to many people. **Senior** \n\n**Staff Engineer (L7 at Instacart)**: \n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Skill: Instead of just doing eng work, spend time identifying, executing, and measuring impact. \n* \ud83e\udd89 Advice: Talk to different stakeholders (business, customer support, PM) to identify areas where the company struggles. \n\n**Principal Engineer (L8 at Pinterest)**: \n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Skill: Effective technical communication to delegate tasks effectively and collaborate with others. \n* \ud83e\udd89 Advice: Principal engineers are role models for an entire org and therefore determine the culture. \n\n**Distinguished Engineer (L9 at Pinterest)**: \n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Skill: Combine strong business acumen with technical expertise to lead large, impactful projects. \n* \ud83e\udd89 Advice: Pursue the most impactful projects and navigate the company to make them happen.\n\n# Reflections\n\n* **Sufficient tenure is required to reach the highest levels**. The Senior Staff Engineer at Instacart was at the company for 8 years, while the Distinguished Engineer at Pinterest worked there for more than 9 years. Constant job hopping is a recipe to stay at the Senior level (or lower) forever. \n* The companies represented in the senior-most levels experienced **hypergrowth** while the engineer worked there. The number of customers, revenue, and employees all increased by orders of magnitude. This meant there were ample opportunities for impact and growth.\n\nI put the [full interview](https://youtu.be/R1pg5kI0VI4) with each engineer on YouTube if you're interested.",

Job hopping can be good, but at a certain point, especially after the initial junior -> mid and mid -> senior jumps, it could be good to consider carefully whether or not short-term financial gains are more beneficial than potential career growth you would be hurting by doing the hops.",

            "I disagree. Tech companies have for a long time operated with a hyper fast growth mentality. For a long time they\u2019ve had easy access to capital with low rates to make quick growth possible. For example, Uber, Snap, Zillow, Pinterest, etc. operate at just break even level or lower. In fact, Amazon didn\u2019t actually make its first profit until a few years ago. \n\nWith the Fed hiking rates pretty regularly for the last year and a half or so those companies have lost easy access to money and had to work to be profitable to weather that downtime. Now we\u2019ve pretty much avoided a recession and so rates will be going back down again giving high growth tech companies their normal access to capital again. \n\nNow you could argue that this will teach tech companies to start valuing profitability more over growth. But personally I doubt that, cause at the end of the day, capitalist institutions would layoff employees again no sweat if we come under threat of recession again. \n\nIt\u2019ll be a slow growth, but no this isn\u2019t the new normal.",

        "selftext": "I don't hear a lot of stories about failing nearly two years' worth of college and somehow making it back. So here's my story.\n\nI suffer from severe depression. I barely graduated from high school but the extra credits of my AP classes pushed me over. I only applied to one college and I somehow got in 2015. I thought I was doing alright for around two years into college. I got some internships as a sophomore, got into clubs, and did the whole computer science grind life.\n\nBut my issues were never actually solved. With depression, people frequently get episodes. They do fine for a bit and then they regress heavily back to a bad place. For the next 2 years, I was in a cycle of almost killing myself, then taking a break, going back to classes, and then falling apart again. I would go to a therapist, take different medications, and nothing would change. At some point, I didn't believe I could change. Ironically, thinking so make it impossible to change.\n\nThe scariest part of depression is losing all passion for everything I used to love. For the entire time, I never changed my major from CS because I knew that's what I wanted to do. But when I fell into depression, I just lost all interest in doing anything. I didn't read about CS anymore and just coasted in my apartment watching the world and my friends move on.\n\nI watched people who entered college after I get internships at Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. I saw my friends building careers at these companies. I remember going to the library seeing my friend study and just hanging out. Now I don't recognize anyone in the clubs or the library. I broke down in tears at the library realizing all the time I wasted and all the friends I can't see anymore. With covid, it upended everything and now no one can go to the library.\n\nBut the course for me changed. At the beginning of last year, I started to take meditation more seriously. I figured that if nothing could help me, maybe doing this would help. At the start, it didn't do anything. But as I got better at meditation, I realized that its true power lies in examining and reflecting on the thoughts that happen in my head. I had CBT done with me but wasn't helpful since I wasn't taking in the lessons. However, meditation was like taking a microscope to these thoughts and critically examining their sources and their effects. The dark cloud that robbed me of my happiness wasn't random or impenetrable. That mood was fueled by \"clinging.\" (This is a Buddhist term). If I just let go of these thoughts, often they don't come back.\n\nThis process didn't lift me out of depression entirely. Meditation and reflection were more like cleaning a dirty lens so I can see more clearly. The lens of my mind gets dirty very often and frequently, so I just clean it repeatedly. Often I forget to do so and start to slide into a depression again but I catch myself and reel back from those thoughts. Meditation allowed me to handle the pressure of classes and submit assignments as opposed to withdrawing. I still struggle greatly with time management, anxiety, and feeling tired all the time but I am crawling as opposed to collapsing. \n\nI lost all of my financial aid since my grades tanked. I know that the only reason why I didn't drop out of college is that my parents were willing to pay for the tuition and fees. I couldn't have gotten here if I just dropped out of college.\n\nAs for how I got my internship with a god awful GPA. I applied to over 150 places, got a handful of responses, and failed most of them. I failed a Zillow interview. I failed a fairly easy JP Morgan coding question. But I wised up and practiced more leetcode, answering behavioral, and cleaning up my resume. I passed a Microsoft phone screen but I have to wait next year to get to the next round.\n\nAnother place gave me an interview. I looked up all the interview questions on glassdoor and studied them. I reviewed all the leetcode questions I have done since I write down notes in Google Keep. In the interview, they asked me leetcode question I seen before and the questions they asked were on glassdoor. The second part was a behavioral one where they asked me a set of standard questions that I studied beforehand as well. Don't underestimate these behavioral questions, they can be as important as the technical parts. It turns out in real life people don't care about GPA beyond the resume. They care about having a passion for CS and what you did.\n\nI used this list to get much better at leetcode.\nhttps://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU\n\nIf you want to understand behavior, Don Georgevich is the guy to watch. His videos helped me to understand what people are asking questions in these interviews.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gugc6hbOP-g\n\nThis is a wonderful meditation guide from a Buddhist stand viewpoint.\nhttps://www.dhammatalks.org/books/WithEachAndEveryBreath/Contents.html",

(I'm not diagnosed or anything) I graduated high school in 2013 and went straight to college. \n\n\nThe first 2 years I spent in community college and did fairly well. I tried to make friends and break out of my socially awkwardness state but that never happens. My grades took a hit and I somehow ended up transering at a university.\n\n\nSince then, I was at a new school. I tried to reinvent myself, take my studies seriously but again, that failed. Things got worse, I somehow developed this habit where every time i would get extremely overwhelmed, instead of seeking for help, I just stopped going or dropped the class. I never manage make any friends, network, get an internship. Its was just me constantly in a state of anxiety and distress and wanting to off myself.\n\n\n Eventually I exceeded my drop rate, and instead started failing classes. I currently have like 10 Fs in my transcript. I never went to a doctor because I just hate talking about my issue. \n\n\nAt the moment, I'm doing ok-ish. I just need 2 more classes to graduate. COVID, in a way, helped me do better since I'm no longer surrounded by people and its easy to talk online. I just hate that I wasted most of my 20s trying to get a degree knowing that I wouldve taken normal amount of time if I wasnt like this.",

Yes your friend is correct, but please remember that OpenAI is cutting edge. If it\u2019s competitive for your friend in Masters, he\u2019s not in the same league as OpenAI. That\u2019s just the difference between industry leading cutting edge and some dude trying to get in on it for the money.\n\n\nAgain, Sam did not build this company.

            "I believe he was at Stanford for CS for a few yrs? Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard how did he start Microsoft? I don't know Atlman's tech prowess but unarguably Gates was a brilliant programmer and wrote the original code the company was based on (a BASIC interpreter).\n\nAlso, Altman was a partner at Y Combinator and a protoge of Paul Graham.. meaning he would be super connected in the tech world to say the least.\n\nYou do not need a PhD and some of the greatest achievers in tech are dropouts. The answer to you question though is \"they just build it\". No creds means you have to prove yourself in a BIG way. In a lot of cases I imagine, once you've done this you'd just figure on keeping the ball rolling. Why beg for a job now when I have investors begging to fund my killer project? Or maybe people who go this route are the types who just know they'll start a company or die trying. As soon as you care about education you are caring what others think of you.. The true entrepreneurs don't give a shit so it makes sense they see 4-yrs in a degree (nevermind more for postgrad) as a waste.\n\nIn an interview Gates says \"I knew the industry wasn't going to wait for me if I finished my degree at Harvard\" (that's in \"Triumph of the Nerds\"--a must watch)",

Not like it\u2019s a bad thing, the CEO is supposed to manage the direction of the company. But people often conflate these two, and that\u2019s how you end up with the impression that Steve Jobs or Elon Musk were/are excellent engineers.

That\u2019s not how machine learning research works, and they\u2019re also not something you can build without laboratory-grade compute power. That all but guarantees you have to have some kind of formal higher education to actually be able to join those research labs. Undergrads interested in machine learning go onto graduate school for that reason, especially back when Altman was in school. Like others have mentioned, being the \u201cface\u201d of a technology company does not equate to being the inventor of its product(s).
