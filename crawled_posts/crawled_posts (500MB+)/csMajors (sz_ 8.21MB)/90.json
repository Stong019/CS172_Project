I mean since I had an internship, I had stopped doing leetcode, and I was focusing on improving my other skills and this came as a bad surprise. The Job market isn't the same that it used to be. In the fall semester, I used to get OAs like anything, but now, I am not getting anything. Is it a regular thing that this happens in the spring? Or is there hope left for me? I know that I should keep applying, but I am not sure if there is the usual thing in the spring semester. What are some of the tips that some experienced csMajors folks would recommend me to do, so that I can get more callbacks? For now, I am applying to companies blindly, how should I change my strategy?\n\nEdit: Thanks a lot for your support, folks. Lots of love!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks, and have a nice day!",

I was so happy to take time off LC and focus on school, but now I regret not doing interview prep over the last three months. \n\nDefinitely reach out to your school network if you have one. My classmates have been supportive and it helps to talk about it with people who understand the amount of work we have to put in to get these offers. They may also have opportunities to share. Take care of yourself and good luck!",

        "selftext": "I was a Stripe winter intern who initially received an offer, which was later rescinded in July. Last week all interns received a follow-up from their recruiters and many winter interns who originally had offers were told that they were now on a new grad \"waitlist\" (essentially rescinded). I heard that overall, less than half of the intern class (including summer interns) received a full-time offer.\n\nFor context, we were told whether we got return offers at the end of our internships in April. This came in the form of a letter of intent, which we could activate any time before October, and the moment we activate it, we had 2 weeks to decide whether to accept the offer letter. Most of us had summer internships lined up, so we waited to open the letter until after our summer internships to decide. In July, I was reached out to by my recruiter telling me that my offer letter would not be valid (rescinded) and they would be doing \"recalibration\" to see which winter interns would get a new offer with new offer terms (including adjusted compensation). We were also told that we would be recalibrated against the summer interns, inherently giving them an advantage, as they knew new grad headcount was lowered and could spend more time working on their project to receive a higher intern rating. Other recruiters didn\u2019t even tell their interns that rescinding was a possibility, they were just told that offers could not be opened until the fall. It was only confirmed last week that many interns would be on the new grad waitlist.\n\nThe recruiters were also very untransparent throughout this whole process, not giving any (or conflicting) information regarding the return offers, even when multiple interns had other offers and was waiting to hear back on Stripe. When Facebook, Coinbase rescinded their new grad offers, they got a lot of flak for it, however I have not seen any posts talking about Stripe rescinding their offers. As unfortunate as Facebook barely giving out new grad intern return offers is, they were at least up front about it earlier this summer --- allowing interns time to re-recruit. It feels like we were blindsided by Stripe. Many interns I knew personally were not planning on re-recruiting as their recruiters made it seem like we would only get our offers \"adjusted\" (lower comp) rather than rescinded. Part of that was our fault for being na\u00efve for trusting them, and I understand that it\u2019s a tough situation for everyone in tech right now, but the whole process just felt very untransparent.\n\nTLDR: Stripe just rescinded many of their winter intern offers and gave very few summer interns offers.",

            "Hi, I interned in FB in Winter and Stripe in Summer, and I totally understand how you feel.\n\nWinter FB interns were told at the end of our internship that we had offers, but they needed 2 weeks to finalize the official compensation numbers.\n\n\n2 weeks later, we were told that they would give us an update at the end of summer.\n\nFrom that point (early May?) to now, I didn\u2019t hear back at all, and I know only 1 person who got their offer honoured.\n\nI think for all companies that had financial issues, Winter interns this year just got screwed more than Summer interns.\n\nImo the way Stripe handled summer return offers was far more transparent than how Meta handled winter return offers. My FB recruiter never officially told me anything about the GE only return situation.",

Those things benefit everyone, from the users to the employees themselves. \n\nWe should be striving to seek out more of those people with a unique background and experiences & making sure that company products and workplaces are more welcoming for everyone, not just white cis men (and Indian men, who I find complain about this a lot).  \n\nAnd for people who keep saying that maybe they hired solely for diversity, the hiring processes at most of these companies will do their jobs of cutting anyone who isn't at their hiring bar, and at the end of it, anyone who got an offer was given it for having most or all of the company's requirements to start with. Even minorities get cut for not being able to pass technical interviews, and a lot of them do.  \n\nI find a lot of people who preach about how \"diversity hires are undeserving\" couldn't even get through those interviews in the first place, so many of them don't even have room to talk imo...maybe take some pointers from people who did pass the interviews without caring about if they're a minority or not.",

I put in a lot of applications to get the job I have, but I got one and I'm proud. And I got it because of my experience, my personal skills, and my tech skills. \n\n The real conversation needs to be how hard it is for diverse candidates to fit in after they get to the job. Diverse hiring is important. I'm the only woman and only visibly queer person in my team and it shows. Right now we're contracting out with Microsoft and every time the Microsoft people address my team they start with \"good day gentlemen\".

            "Alright. Let me start out by saying this opinion will probably get thrashed and I'm fine with that. You are totally welcome to disagree with anything I say here. I will also mention I am a white guy, so keep that in mind as obviously it will affect my views.       \n\n[Here are facebook's diversity stats](https://diversity.fb.com/read-report/). If you scroll down a bit, you can see the US (and US only) race statistics of the company. Notice how every single racial demographic is rising in representation except for white people. The USA is 60% white, yet white SWE's only make up 37% of US technical roles at FB. Whites are over represented in leadership by 3% and underrepresented in every single other category of the company. I acknowledge that other minorities are also not represented at appropriate levels and will be the first to argue for more representation for them. But isn't the point of diversity programs to balance things out, not to over or under represent any one demographic?          \n\nOne other issue I had major problems with was first and second year programs this year. As a sophomore, I could not find a single one which wasn't targeted at minorities. Before you tell me they say everyone is welcome to apply, two of my mentors are extremely high level technical leads at Google and FB. After talking to recruiting, both told me not to bother applying to FBU and STEP and said I didn't stand a chance. And you know what? They were right. I was interviewed at more BigN companies for normal SWE internships than I was second year programs. Now, let me make something extremely clear: **I am all for outreach programs and representation in tech.** However, I can't help but get a bit angry when companies lump those programs together with their first/second year programs instead of leaving them separate. Now, before some wise-ass tries to imply I wasn't qualified for these positions, I will go ahead and say you may be right. But, I doubt it, as I cleared the interviews and signed a \"normal\" SWE internship at a BigN with a hiring bar that is just as high as Google's and FB's, if not higher. I am not saying I am entitled to an interview at any of these second year programs, just saying I do think I was qualified. Regardless, the main reason I bring this up is because I have many friends in CS at my school, but not a single white guy I know was interviewed for STEP, Explore, FBU, UberSTAR, TwitterU, etc. I know many URM's who were (and most were more than qualified!), but I still think it is a shame (and extremely ironic) that my white friends (esp the more qualified ones) were filtered out because they weren't diverse enough...         \n\nEdit: fixed grammar mistakes and removed a cringe section that in retrospect could have easily been interpreted as humble bragging lol",

Not officially and not on paper, but there are a lot of single IT guys in their late 30s who will grill the living crap out of an Asian/Indian dude but suddenly kick the brakes when a cute girl comes in to interview. Not against it, just see a lot of naivete on this thread"

He held is phone underneath the table and googled the solution. He typed it and called the interviewer to check. It was the right solution. Then the interviewer asked him another question, my friend cheated again. This happened for a whole hour. \n\nAt the end the interviewer asks my friend if he has any questions of his own that he'd like answered. He said how did I do?\n\n\"Make sure the next time you use your own head.\" \n\nAll of us flatmates went crazy lmao. That was very cool.\n\nMoral of the story, when you cheat you're always on the mercy of the interviewer. The next interviewer may not be so careless and at that point only the knowledgeable person will succeed. Or else you can live everyday of your life fearing you might get fired if they find out how incompetent you are lol.\n\n Btw this guy landed a job by cheating before this interview and got thrown out after a month.

Do not recommend).

On this chart \"OA\" includes both OAs & first round recruiter screens, \"2nd round+\" includes technical screens and final rounds. I did end up canceling interviews & ignoring OAs after getting a couple of offers so that's reflected in my Sankey too.\n\n**All of the positions were SWE internships except for one or two PM ones.**\n\n**Companies I made it to the 2nd/final round with, in no particular order:**\n\n* **AT&T, Vanguard, Toyota Connected, Cigna**\n   * I canceled all these final rounds! Vanguard was a referral, Cigna was through GHC\n   * Toyota final was sent to most people (Hirevue)\n* **Dropbox**\n   * Applied online, got all test cases on OA\n   * My very first technical of the season. Failed it hard.\n   * *Result: rejected after technical phone screen*\n* **Google**\n   * Applied with a referral, went directly to interviews (most likely because I'd taken a Snapshot in December 2019)\n   * God I wish I hadn't messed this one up :c\n   * *Result: rejected after back-to-back interview round*\n* **iCims**\n   * Applied online, iCims does their recruiter screen first and OA as the second round\n   * For some reason the OA was a lot harder than last year & I got a 60% on it\n   * *Result: rejected after OA even though last year I made it to the final round*\n* **Facebook**\n   * Applied with a referral & my resume was presumably given to my school's recruiter, who reached out to me\n   * Thought I did alright on the technical but I guess my explanations weren't good enough\n   * *Result: rejected after phone screen*\n* **Salesforce**\n   * Got reached out to via GHC\n   * Did their final round over a month ago, and reached out every week since asking for an update -- when I said I had upcoming offer deadlines they opened the email and did not reply...\n   * *Result: ghosted after final & I look forward to telling them I took another offer because they left me hanging for over a month when they initially promised a week*\n* **Oracle**\n   * Recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn\n   * Got through initial technical & final rounds\n   * One of the teams I interviewed already rejected me & the other is still thinking about it\n   * *Result:* *~~half-rejected after final~~* ***offer from the other team I interviewed with***\n* **Lockheed Martin**\n   * Reached out to via GHC\n   * They actually interviewed me for full-time because the position they wanted me for required a security clearance that'd take a year to obtain\n   * Was told during the final interview that my GPA would be a disadvantage during the decision process\n   * *Result: rejected after final (this is the 1 rejection after final on the Sankey lol)*\n* **Goldman Sachs**\n   * Applied via referral but talked to a recruiter at GHC who took a look at my HireVue (I got all test cases on the OA & did the HireVue) and invited me to a Superday\n   * I was entirely out of practice because this was the last interview I did, I couldn't implement merge sort LMAOOO\n   * *Result:* *~~have not heard back, oh well~~* ***offer*** *(TBD team in NYC)*\n* **Wells Fargo**\n   * Applied regularly, interviewed through GHC\n   * Interview was objectively good but I did not click with the interviewers imo\n   * ***Result: offer*** *(treasury technologies team in Charlotte, NC)*\n* **JPMorgan Chase**\n   * Applied regularly, got all test cases on the CodeVue, freaked out because I never got a Code for Good invite\n   * They invited me to a traditional final round instead.

Mine was originally scheduled for mid-September and I had to push it back twice because of scheduling conflicts lol\n   * Case interview was fun!

All the NYC offers I got paid pretty much the same thing (including overtime) which I thought was pretty neat, but ultimately after talking to many former interns at all these places, **I decided to go with JPMorgan Chase.**\n\nSince I interned at a financial company this past summer, I was somewhat looking forward to trying out a tech company, but I really did enjoy the more well-rounded experience I got during the internship -- I got to learn more about finance & management too besides coding, and since my long-term career goal is management and not really SWE, I knew that having a ton of banks to pick from wasn't really a downside. I had a very long discussion about the mentorship and professional development opportunities at JPMC with my behavioral recruiter, and they pretty much outdid my last internship in that aspect which I initially thought was impossible, lol.\n\nI feel like this post is long enough so I'll answer questions in the comments & I can give tips in the comments too I guess. Thanks for reading all the way down here if you made it!\n\nEDIT: added that my school is not a target & that I am a US citizen\n\nEDIT 2: totally forgot that Goldman Sachs was via referral oop\n\nEDIT 3: I got another OA that I'm not gonna do, so mentally add one to the \"I didn't do OA\" count on the Sankey rip",

            "You probably hear this a lot but networking is huge in college. Many people see tons of success attending hackathons",
            "do you have internships",
            "The first but is my backstory for context, if you don't wanna read that skip to \"------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"\n\nI am 29 years old, have a Bachelor's and Masters in ECE.  I want on one internship at an oil company which is completely useless to me now.  I worked as as Electrical/Hardware Engineer at a startup last year for 9 months then was laid off due to funding issues. \n\nAfter I finished my masters it took me 2 years to get that job.  For the first year I got maybe 4 interviews, 2 I got through networking, but I didn't have any relevant experience so I didn't get past the first round.  Also, during that time (for reasons I won't go into) my confidence was at an all time due to dealing with depression for the last few years which resulted in me nearly failing out of grad school, and I was having a bit of an identity crisis at the time so I was going after every kind of tech job; electrical, embedded, software, ML, Data Science etc.\n\nAfter the first year I did some soul searching for a week, realized I wanted something a job that involved circuit design, interfacing with sensors and actuators, and microcontroller programming.  Basically a Hardware/Embedded/Electrical stack.\n\n\nI'm sure you already know this, but employers these days want assurance that you can hit the ground running when you get hired.  So I decided to work on projects that would showcase the necessary skillset.\n\nI first built an Arduino based Robot car that could be controlled over Bluetooth with a phone app.  It involved object oriented programming, microcontroller programming, interfacing with sensors, implementing a control system etc.. Aside from Digital communication protocols, I wrote all the code from scratch, didn't use any libraries.  Thing is the project as a whole is something that any hobbyist can do (with extensive use of libraries) so when I put it on my resume it didn't really help.  So I had to make sure my next project was something that required something with an engineering degree to complete.  Mind you, I was really low on money at the time so I felt like I was in a do or die situation.  At this point I was about a year and 2 months out of grad school\n\nThe next project was basically an analog spectrometer.  I design all of the circuitry using a tool called LTspice, the design the printed Circuit Board in Kicad.  I wasn't even halfway done when I added the project to my resume, a this point 1 year and 4 months out of grad school.  But less then I week after I did I got my first interview in like 6 months made it to the final round, a 1-on-1 with the CEO. Didnt get the job but it was a major boost my confidence.  I was now averaging an interview with a new company once every 2-3 weeks, getting to at least to 2nd round each time.  Finally got employed about 6 months later.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter I got laid off from my job I thought I would get new one in under 2 months because the main issue most interviewers had with me was my lack of relevant job experience.  For this one company in the valley I made it to the 5th round, where I had to give a half hour presentation on a project I worked on to a label of 7 people followed by three 1-hour interviews with 2 people each, just to be told a week later they are going with someone who had 3 years of experience... This was marketed as an entry level job \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c.  If we were in a \"normal\" job market this would be true, but we are in a horrible one right now.  People would often say to me \"don't worry about whether or not you meet all the requirements, just apply.\". Maybe that was a time when they was true, it isn't anymore.  From my own personal analysis, I won't even get a phone screen unless I meet at least 75% of the basic requirements and half of the preferred ones. I've been out of a job for a little over six months.  For the first 4 I was averaging 1 interview a month and I never made it past the phone screening.  Believe me when I say the bar is SSSOOOO much higher now that it was before the first quarter of 2023.  Also recruiters were telling me, and in my own experience this is true, me that \"big companies want someone with at least 6 years of experience, they are willing to go down to 3, but you don't even have 3 so it doesn't matter, you're best bet is getting a job at a startup that needs to hire quickly\".\n\nI've some very key changes to my resume, made my portfolio easier to read, am very selective about which jobs I apply to know, am taking a course to bridge my knowledge gaps, and am working on a project that will prove I know how to use certain technologies as skills.  I am having much better luck now. Still don't have a job but for the first time I am optimistic.\n\n\nHere's my advice to you:\n1) Choose one type of Software Development to focus on (front end, back end, web, Date analysist, cloud, embedded etc.) focus only learning skills relavent to you chosen stream and build projects that show you have aptitude in that area.  When you eventually do get interviews each one will help you prepare for the next one\n\n2) Accept the fact that it is going to take a while probably at least 4 months.  Believe me I understand how demoralizing being unemployed for a long period of time can be; you feel like a failures loved ones look at you differently, everyone wants to give you advice but most of the time it is at best not helpful or self-sabotaging.  My mom's friend who (claims) she used to work at HR said I should put \"Hard worker\" and \"Detail oriented\" on my resume \ud83d\ude02.  Thing is you need to thoroughly think through every decision you make so that you don't miss important details, and you need to have deep knowledge of everything you claim to know when you go into interviews because the interviewers nowadays will check you on pretty much everything.  If you let the pressure get to you and act without doing your due diligence you're just gonna waste your own time, energy etc.\n\nThe job market is absolutely horrible right now and has been for the past year.  But things are getting a bit better.  There are things you can do to make yourself a more attractive candidate than just tailoring your resume.  Once you suceeed in getting a job, you will realize that you can handle pretty much anything life throws at you.",

It doesn't mean you're less competent, but it does mean you need to have perspective on your prospects. It's like buying bulk masks after Covid.   \n2. You have to consider alternative avenues like entreprenuership and be willing to at least fail at those.   \n3. Projects are cool, but what you really want is work that can have other people vouching for you that increases networking. Interships are also shrinking because of the market, but you can do things like Code for America in the meantime.",

You\u2019ve positioned yourself to enjoy a great living doing something fun. Right now, there are definitely obstacles in your way. The market isn\u2019t great, we\u2019ve had a number of layoffs in big tech, and companies are scaling back hiring. Don\u2019t let any of that stop you. \n\nOne thing you could consider is looking into a paid internship. You\u2019re just out of school, so starting with an internship doesn\u2019t look weird, it\u2019s easier to land than a full time role, and it\u2019s a great back door into a company if you can prove yourself. So, I recommend looking for internships, in addition to what you\u2019re looking for now. \n\nIn between applications and interviews (they will come), get solid with data structures, algorithms, and design. Stay sharp. While it\u2019s a sad truth, and rarely aligns with anything you do at work, LeetCode is a great way to increase your chances of securing the job if you secure the interview. \n\nDon\u2019t give up. You have one of the best degrees out there, and a very bright future. You simply hit your first bump in the road at the very start. The stars haven\u2019t aligned\u2026make them.",

Maybe you could try taking actuarial exams.",

Now starting as an entry level network engineer at a different company making salary on par with entry level software engineers with a lot less competition in my opinion. A CS degree can definitely land you an entry level job in networking, databases, cyber etc. Not sure if you were already looking into these areas but a lot of CS majors are way too fixated on being a software engineer.",
            "Yep riding the boat with what others are saying. Networking. Hackathons could be huge but also using resources like LinkedIn and connecting your portfolio and setting yourself to open to work. Applications through online are terrible as they go through an ATS so you have to play the game of getting through the ATS and even then it might not matter, they could just toss the application anyways. There are also a lot of \"ghost positions\" which is essentially companies making it look like they're trying to hire but can't fill roles.\n\nTry to get on with internships etc I also highly recommend doing a lot of LeetCode if you haven't already so you can also be prepared for the game that is interviewing.\n\nEverything you've done hasn't been a waste I assure you. The whole job process is just a big game you have to figure out and CS is far from the only field affected by this",

            "Adding a +1 to networking!! If you\u2019re having this much trouble focus on networking and personal projects (or hackathons)  \nGo to meetups and build personal projects rather than just applying. Meet professionals in your area and just talk to them as people and talk about the trouble you\u2019re having and your personal projects.

People network and get references. Join summits, go to career fairs, join talent networks. In that there are at-least 20 guaranteed interviews.\n\nEdit2: Most people in CS fail to realize that just because they are smart or high GPA means job/internship. Half the time the people taking your jobs are morons or on your same level but just better social skills. I dont mean behavioral interview social skills but in general. The average CS student is a fucking nerd with social anxiety and doesnt go and talk. Thats why this shit sub is filled with nerds crying about \"500\" applications.

            "That\u2019s actually on the low end. I pretty regularly see some that hit 3000 applicants in less than 8 hours.",
            "800 of them are garbage applicants, plus this is most likely a remote job. stop looking for remote fresh out of sc hool. most people with experience get them and there is thousands of applicants, go into an office for a year, on-site jobs have way less applicants.",
            "I realize how lucky I got with getting an offer seeing how bad the market is",
            "Don't forget: \"entry level role: minimum 2 years of professional experience required\"",
            "800 of which are absolute rubbish",
            "How bad is it in the US",
            "Rotational programs seem less competitive",
            "How do you even know if it\u2019s a real job? Do employers really use EasyApply to look for candidates?"
