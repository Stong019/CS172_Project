I like writing, performing, creating stuff with people -- but keeping it professional as well. After years of playing I barely even touch my instrument at all, except when I have to rehearse or play live. \n\nI see CS the same way. \"passion\" doesn't really matter, nor does it matter what kind of fancy tricks you can do -- just play the damn set and be good at it. This \"it MUST be your LiFE DREAM to become a HARDCORE coder 24/7 with SIDE PROJECTs in your unpaid FREE TIME\" can get fucking bent. \n\nIt's a job making computers do beep boop for money, just the same as my job as a musician is making instruments do pling plong for money.",

Back then, having a portfolio with designs and links to functional UIs, websites, and perhaps even applications you had built was non-negotiable for consideration in the industry.\n\nWhile there might have been a brief period during the pandemic where recent graduates were hired without extensive scrutiny, back in the day, whether you specialized in frontend, backend, were a designer who codes, or embodied the versatility of a full-stack developer, showcasing your skills to secure an interview and prove yourself during it has always been paramount.\n\nI recall a friend who studied mechanical engineering, he struggled for a considerable amount of time before securing a decent job. The notion that a computer science degree guarantees immediate employment is simply a fallacy.\n\nPeople who secured good tech jobs rights after school, were just an anomoly, thanks to irresponsible goverment spending, goverments sent the world markets in a frenzy with all that artificial wealth.\n\nDon't like it?

I don\u2019t have a degree, but have never had a problem getting a job\u2026 and in fact many jobs I\u2019ve gotten are from people that found me for skills demonstrated in personal projects. Not having a degree, I just assumed I had to do this to prove I could do what I was claiming to do. I\u2019ve never once been able to sit on my degree laurels and be networked into or assumed into a position.   \n\nIn the past, when I\u2019ve suggested this strategy on this subreddit, I\u2019ve been downvoted to oblivion\u2026 as though people should just be entitled to a job after a degree. And all I have to say to that is that it\u2019s a competitive market, you have to compete.

            "As a former hiring manager who reviewed 1000s of resumes and hired >100 engineers over 20 years, I agree with Garry. One of my favorite interview questions was always \"What project did you work on that you were/are excited by and proud of?\" This is how I usually found out what the potential engineer was actually capable of.

Between your parents, school, and the rest of your society and institutions, there's a failure to connect people with the job path that works for them, and to leave them empowered to be employed with the skills that best suit them.

Doing so will differentiate you from the legion of students who are just spoon-fed assignments to finish. \n\nSource: I was that student who was spoon-fed assignments. My first job as a junior dev, I was pretty much spoon-fed everything.  Only after I quit being a developer and came back to it a few years later, did I realize what I missed about it so much, and found the passion to create something from start to finish and release it.

            "a lot of peeps are jacking off here.\n\n1.  truth is there is now a huge supple surplus of IT personnel, as illustrated by every position getting hundreds if not thousands of applications, which simply means IT companies get to pick and choose at will, and all the other shit that comes with that privilege. The scale has tipped on the employers' side for a while now.\n\n2. Building shit yourself won't matter IN THIS SPECIFIC MARKET, the conditions of which i explained very briefly above (except for the few intern positions left). There are so many IT people with ample experience who lost their job, to the point that it becomes unnecessary for companies to consider anything besides job experience these days.\n\n3. Corps don't lie to you. You act as if a corporation or a company is a person. It is always a PERSON that's lying to you. It's always always always a person. For example it could be that your team leader never gives you credit, your manager releasing their frustration with his manager on you, your co worker talking behind your back with your boss, your junior messing up your work, the guy that left the company left you with a mess that's impossible to fix.\n\n4. Expanding on the interpersonal thing. Because people are complex interpersonal relationship is also complex and who knows what the fuck could have been going on when you get fired or miss the promotion or get moved to another department. Sometimes it is true that someone is after you for sure, but more often than not it isn't really. You know it could be the guy is so busy or forgetful or has undiagnosed early onset dementia, the CEO fucked up the company financially, your boss's family member passed away etc etc. Love it or hate it, it's just the truth about the complexity of it all.",

He owns his own company (part-time) and works for a tech company full time. He _loves_ what he does and he\u2019s _always_ building something.\n\nWhen I read the threads here, I rarely see that kind of passion & work ethic, I see delusional expectations. The days of $200k salaries right out of undergrad are gone and have been gone for over a decade. \n\nIf you\u2019re not making it happen for yourself everyday, and in anyway possible, you\u2019re doing it wrong - because that\u2019s what it takes today.",

CS is by a long shot still the best shot for best WLB and salary. And even if CS didn't pay 200K+ at the very least you get a cozy air conditioned office job where you realistically work like 20-30 hours a day compared to how brutal going into med is, how LONG the hours in investment banking and law are. Your hour to work ratio will be by far the best in a dev job. Not to mention the extra amount of schooling and debt you take from lawschool or medschool lmfao\n\nDon't take my word for it either, do your research before you listen to gatekeepers or people saying \"you work 30 minutes a day and just eat food all day!!!\", it's obviously both extreme ends of exaggeration but this doom and gloom is nothing but people on the bad end of a boom and bust cycle who aren't being objective.",

            "CS majors come down to the individual, and the fact that you need to figure out where you want to specialize in. Theres really no hope for a lot of front-end web development for the most part. Go to a coding camp for web dev, and you'd be in with the sea of people who've done just that. There's too many of them doing it now. CS is probably one of the hardest programs up there with med school  and engineering disciplines. IMO. It can be dry as hell, and not everyone may know why their learning the math or other subjects. My professor said \"you need to know how to use it in your discipline\".  I believe the school systems now are complete trash when compared to the working world.\n\nThe major challenge is that true CS isn't for everyone one, because it's not just about being a code jockey and you only build fractions of softwares. Software engineering is for that. There's an expectation that you should be working on side projects and other frameworks that make it even harder. \n\nI personally don't get the point of doing shit tons of leetcode because it's mostly problems of various difficulties  (I've only skimmed leet code.) of things you probably should know from the degree. Practice is good, but work on frame works that can be used in modern technologies or learn that super niche language.  \n\nI finished my first degree in Business and a minor in computer science because I didn't know if I wanted to put the time in.
