            "I don't think people on this post understand what snitching is. \n\nImagine, someone does something they shouldn't do, but it is unrelated to you and does not affect you. Now you go snooping around, find out, get yourself involved, and tell on them. That's snitching.\n\nNow imagine, someone is in your group. You have agreed to work together on a project worth 50% of your grade. Now you find out that your partner is not actually working and on top of that is cheating (according to the school's policies). Your groupmate is now acting selfishly and is willing to screw you over. And at best, you get a zero on a project worth 50% of your grade or at worst you get some kind of academic punishment that may have made your entire time in school worthless.   \n\n\nAnd.... I know people won't agree, but your groupmate already disrespected your group when she decided to not only, not do her work but put the group in jeopardy by cheating. It's not snitching when you protect yourself from some selfish jerk that is willing to screw you over, but hey if you protect yourself by saying something, now you're the bad guy somehow.\n\nThis snitch mentality is for people that are too cowardly to do what's right, you don't owe her anything. She already has shown how little she cares about other people in the group, willing to risk getting them in trouble. Speak up, and let your professor decide what is right and wrong, that is their job, not yours.\n\nDo you really think your groupmate would cover for you if the roles were reversed? I'm a little older and I can say most of the times I have given other's in a work environment the benefit of the doubt, they pretty much never deserved it.\n\nGood luck, and for future reference. Protecting yourself in a situation you did not create is not snitching. Throwing yourself into a situation that doesn't involve you is. You ain't a snitch, you're just trying to work hard and get the grade you deserve.",

That includes lecture materials, textbooks, online forums, and yes - chat bots.\n\nThe issue here is not the method by which the code was generated. It's that your group member is being lazy and giving you non functional code. In other words, they're not putting in the effort they ought to on a collaborative project.\n\nThis sort of thing happens ALL THE TIME. As a former TA, the best possible thing you can do in this situation is just talk to your prof or TA. They can handle it, including deciding whether the error was genuine, or malicious.\n\nIf you don't say anything, or keep it to yourself, your teachers can't help you. If you wait until after, there's nothing they can do. If you give them forewarning, they might be able to gently talk to your colleague, and make things RIGHT.

            "The whole field is filled with this. I remember when I was in college I constantly felt like I was behind everyone. I hadn\u2019t coded since I was 12, I didn\u2019t know anything other than what was learned in class, and I couldn\u2019t tell you what the fuck the kernel was\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting! \n\nI applied for a bunch of internships and got into one. I ran tests on some network cards\u2026 no clue what I was doing even to this day. The idea of working for Google or Microsoft wasn\u2019t even on my radar.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because comparing myself now to those that I graduated with, I think my resume is probably in the top 5%. It\u2019s almost like my insecurity pushed me to keep trying to prove myself while those that were dick measuring stopped trying.\n\nThere always seems to be someone in the top 1% making everything look easy. They have been coding since they were 6, they created their own company that\u2019s making them $70k/year of passive income and they just got an offer for staff engineer at Google, but they are debating about being engineering manager at Facebook instead since they are offering a $500k sign on bonus. \n\nGood for them, they don\u2019t represent the majority",
            "These people don't represent the majority of compsci majors. Most of us are middle of the curve who struggle with the stupid required theoretical classes just like anyone else and will likely settle for some average paying job which is ~70k entry level. Sure, that's higher than most other majors but that's just an average for the industry and has more to do with the nature of the work. \n\nI was fortunate enough to score an internship this past summer that paid extremely well but trust me, it wasn't anything glamorous. I was just messing with some code I didn't understand, wore my grown-up business outfit, and did a 40 hour work week like most normal adults that work at an office job. No ping pong, no free food, or any of that other poster crap you see in other software companies. \n\nYou gotta understand that compsci is one of the most popular majors and it draws many people in due to its high demand. But, the people you see waving their software engineer gigs are usually the minority with this field just as diverse as any other. You're just not gonna see us normies brag about our regular ass office roles. \n\nTrust me, you're not missing out on anything. I'm not talking smack on those who end up in these high tech firms, but just understand there's more to it than what meets the eye. While people worked really hard for those cushy salaries, it often comes at the cost of long hours behind a computer screen and tedious, boring work. \n\nSo don't feel dumb, it's certainly a small subgroup of a larger portion of the population.",

        "selftext": " (Cross posted from r/InternationalStudents )  \n\n UPDATE (04/16): thank you everyone for your kind words and stories i really appreciate them all more than i can say. I told my school\u2019s CS department about it and they are pursuing action against the recruiter (and maybe the company im not sure). I don\u2019t know what sort of action yet, but they made me feel really validated and cared for so it was helpful already. So as not to interfere with that I won\u2019t name the company like yall have been asking (for now). Also, to address some things: I am female (I don\u2019t mind all the king comments and messages though lol i still really appreciate the kindness), I told the recruiter and others at the company about my status about 6 separate times and they said nothing, and no the recruiter has still not apologised at all or done anything to help my situation. Thanks once again for all the encouragement! \n\n\u2014 \n\nHi everyone, this is really just for me to vent but words of advice and/or encouragement would be appreciated.   \n\nI am an undergraduate senior in college in the US, and I graduate in  a month. I've been applying to jobs, going to career fairs, and  reaching out to people on LinkedIn since September with no luck in  securing a position for post grad. As some of you might know it's been a  really draining time. About 2 months ago I met a recruiter for a tech  company at a career fair at my school, we had really good conversation  and he was impressed with my resume so we connected on LinkedIn. A few  weeks ago, he reached out with a position that opened at the company  that suited my skills. I applied and guys I prepped soooo hard. Day and  night I studied. I reached out to old professors and current employees  at the company. I prepared harder than I ever have because this was  genuinely my dream role, location and pay. After all my studying I aced  all three rounds of interviews with different managers at the company  and I got the call 3 days ago that I got the job. I was over the moon, I  don't think I've ever cried so many tears in one night before. Any  international student can imagine the relief I felt. Only for me to get  my offer rescinded tonight because the recruiter wasn't familiar with  their policy on international students. Apparently they don't hire  internationals for entry level positions, only senior roles. I told him  several times I was an F1 student and he assured me it was fine. I  disclosed it in my application and even told my interviewers and nobody  told me it would be an issue. I told them plainly at least 4 times over  the course of the recruitment process and still. I am so hurt and I  honestly just feel lost, I can't believe this has happened to me. I did  everything right and in the end it didn't matter. I'm embarrassed  because I told my friends and family and they were all so proud of me  only for it to fall apart. The last three days have been the lightest  I've felt for the past year of my life and now I just look back on that  and feel embarrassed. I feel angry at the recruiter who didn't even  express any remorse or even apologise for putting me in this situation.  And I feel stupid for hoping that hard work would be enough to get me  by.

Being an international student was the only thing that screwed you here. Don\u2019t let it get you down so much though. If anybody questions you again just tell them it didn\u2019t work out and you\u2019re going to look for something better. \nI\u2019m going to tell you about a guy I went to school with. His name is Lavin Amarnani. You can find his website or his LinkedIn. He is 24. He is also international and from India. He had the same thing happen to him as well. Insanely talented guy and couldn\u2019t find a job for 2 years. Well, a few months ago he finally got sponsorship for his first job\u2026a senior position\u2026at Verizon. All of the independent study and contract work he did for the last 2 years counted as experience. He had nothing for 2 years and now he\u2019s making like 200k at 24 years old. Keep it up.

Keep looking and trying.\n\nMake sure you are flexible and don't get stuck thinking of only one type of job. \n\nAlso, if you have to go back to your country, then go back with your head held high. Its a rough time in the world economy right now. There are a lot of people looking for work and struggling. Think of all of the experiences you have gained by going to another country to study. That will probably be considered valuable in your country, that you have broadened your horizons.\n\nStay positive. Being negative doesn't give you points or help in any other way. In fact, it can hurt if you show that attitude. People normally do not hire for pity. So keep feeling positive.\n\nPlans don't always work the way we want, and sometimes, good things come from bad.  You never know, so don't feel defeated. Just realize you need to go in a different direction.\n\nGood luck to you!",
            "Ok I will say it is unfortunate that happen. This does not reflect on you and what they did to you sounds like an oversight on their part dont think they meant it maliciously they might of heard you but did not compute what it entailed. With that being said unfortunately its a difficult market in the US for international students there is a high \"tax\" on tech companies for hiring outside the US so they usually dont take changes to fill the entry level roles with international students and until that changes youre on a uphill battle. I mean I understand the \"we gotta take care of our own\" mentality that entails.

        "selftext": "**It's harming the entire job market**\n\nFirst off, it's against the entire industry's best interest to take an unpaid internship. Have you noticed how entry level jobs are decreasing? And even more so entry level jobs with reasonable requirements? Have you also noticed how unpaid internships are also rising? I wonder why! Unpaid internships and its rise in popularity will make it the next entry-level job. Before internships used to be purely optional and you can still land a decent paying entry level job. Now you need them to have a shot and landing any decent roles.\n\nBy working unpaid you are devaluing the work of everyone in the industry, companies will go \"why should I pay my interns when I can just not pay them?\" they already are doing in plenty of other industries. By taking unpaid internships you are making it the new entry level job. With this mentality soon unpaid internships are a must have to get your foot in the door for this career. Unpaid internships are creating a \"race to the bottom\" market harming the employees.\n\nThe narrative of \"young people are so entitled  in that they want good money\" is already shifting towards \"young people are so entitled in that they want to get paid for their work period\"\n\nalbiet this is almost exclusively from old people and a vocal minority the presence of this narrative at all is scary.\n\n**They're illegal most of the time if it's a for-profit company and unethical**\n\nMost countries have laws against unpaid internships if it **displaces the work of a paid employee**. The [FLSA in the USA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships) says so. In Canada it depends on the provinces but most of them will only allow it if it's for school, in Ontario it's the same as well as similar standards as set in the [Employment Standards Act](https://www.svlaw.ca/blog/details/item/unpaid-internships-what-does-the-employment-standards-act-say-) like it is in the USA. As you can guess, most fail at that part.\n\nIt's also unethical because the argument of \"it's for educational and training purposes so you shouldn't be paid\" holds no merit. Most jobs out there will still pay you during training, do you think it's ethical to not be paid for that? The other issue like I said before it's more than training, you are more likely than not going to be doing the work of a paid employee. So the argument that unpaid internships are purely educational is wrong period.\n\n**Most of the time it's a waste of time**\n\nSaying that \"this job pays in experience\" is like beverage companies saying \"this drink keeps you hydrated\". If the best the unpaid internship has to offer is experience is the bare minimum for EVERY job out there is it really that valuable? If the experience really is that valuable why don't they pay you for it?\n\n**The whole \"no internship is worse than unpaid internship\" is wrong, statistics show unpaid internships actually don't improve your career prospects**\n\nAccording to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) those who did an unpaid internship had more or less the same career prospect compared to those who did no internship at all.\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/do-unpaid-internships-lead-to-jobs-not-for-college-students/276959/)\n\n>This year, NACE queried more than 9,200 seniors from February through the end of April.\u00a0[They found](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx)\u00a0that  63.1 percent of students with a paid internship under their belt had  received at least one job offer. But only 37 percent of former unpaid  interns could say the same -- a negligible 1.8 percentage points more  than students who had never interned. \u00a0  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The results were even worse when it came to salary. Among students who found jobs**, former unpaid interns were actually offered** ***less*** **money than those with no internship experience**.\n\nLet's assume that unpaid internships are much more likely to land jobs. Do we want to live in a society like that? Do we want a society where you have to work for free while having sky high rent, inflation, and student loans?\n\n**There are better options**\n\nThere are better options that are ethical and legal while being more valuable than an unpaid internship and even actually creating a positive impact to society some of them include\n\n\\- Doing a side project yourself\n\n\\- Contributing to open source\n\n\\- Doing it for a non-profit organization you support in",

For most people who would consider an unpaid internship (low-skilled, just need a foot in the door) these are not better options although they are better than nothing.\n\nIt's the network and verifiable experience that makes internships most useful to a college student.",

I got to work with niche technologies that made my resume way more interesting.\n\nIt got me interview offers from multiple unicorns and good publics for a sophomore year internship. I signed an offer that paid more than I spent on the first 2 years of my college education.\n\nI leveraged my research and my upcoming internship to apply for top CS schools. Even though my grades were mediocre, I credit that internship and an LoR I got from it for getting me into several T20s.

Payment 4 placements (P4P) is trying to change this by pushing universities to make systemic changes. Please look into this, support the movement, start a chapter, do whatever you can. Myself and a group of students started a chapter at my university and we are already turning heads.

I feel like in this case unpaid/low paid is acceptable, but I will say I do it as a hobby and next to my (frankly, well paid) internship so I am coming from a place of privilege.

Those exist in other parts of the world. \n\nI've had many jobs in tech and although they are all relate, I use complete new skill sets in each position. This is part of the reason why I have stopped learning new things by myself. Because when I self-study, 99% of the time it will never get used in a practical way and I forget it. The best way to learn is to first get a position, and then learn what you need to compete the job. Therefore, internships won't help your next position if you don't get hired by the same company.\n\nCompanies are always bottom line driven. You as an individual should be too. It's not about what's morally right or wrong, it's about getting paid at the end of the day. Or just go get a hobby.\n\nIt's also an opportunity cost. The biggest argument is that an unpaid internship will get your foot into the door. But we are talking about entry level positions here. Luck is a huge component. Some people land the perfect job after months of non stop searching. If they took an internship, they probably focus on that internship and won't have the energy to continue searching.",

The uni credit thing some people mentioned for the US is a null point here as, for my uni, we have a list of approved companies we can intern at and can't intern elsewhere (internship isn't mandatory).

Paid employment is better and use transferable skills. The reason : you need to have credit and pay taxes sometimes if you have no credit history you can\u2019t get housing or it possibly could show in the background check. Employers want to see stability, a 3 month internship vs a job you held for two years could speak louder\u2026 in some cases interning is required but it actually leads to a job. Not all do."
