            "Hey everyone, wow this post blew up! Thanks for all the well wishes. As I have gotten a lot of dms, here's some additional info about me without identifying myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stats**\n\n* 3.9 GPA(might drop with this semester haha) but GPA as most of you know, doesn't really matter for internships\n* 2 FAANG Internships(same company)\n* Built a VR experience for my college(campus job)\n* Leadership experience in some clubs\n* Go to a small school so not super popular\n* TA for a cs and a stats class\n* Other non major-related jobs\n* Research experience in an unrelated field(my second major)\n* Building an app that I hope to launch next semester. Talked about this a lot in my interviews\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Resume screen**\n\nI would say I was very blessed in this regard. I passed the screening for most companies I applied to and either got rejected from some because a. international student(roblox, southwest etc) or skills(janestreet, Meta(as I have not heard back), Lyft, Discord(haven't heard back). So I had a really good screening rate, and I think it's due to GOD and ofc, the name brand on my resume.\n\nI failed several, several OAs and still struggle with OAs, but fortunately I passed some. The companies I went to the final round were Google, Msft, Twitch, Netflix, Linkedin.\n\n**Rejections from final round**\n\nGoogle, Linkedin\n\n**Offers from final round**\n\nTwitch, Netflix\n\n**Pending**\n\nMSFT\n\nSo I am definitely not a leetcode king or whatever. But I have definitely improved since I started my recruiting in august. Here's how: \n\nMy study strategy was not specific to Netflix. But after cramming and forgetting solutions, I took a different approach. I started solving lc by algorithms used, checkout grokking the coding interview: 16 algo patterns.\n\nThen I have an iPad and use notability. So I have a Leetcode book. For every question, I will write down the constraints I put, output and anything that\u2019s helpful to solve the problem. Then I will write down my approach for solving this problem. Once I do both, I come up with a complexity analysis. Then I code it up on Leetcode.\n\nEvery weekend, I look at all the questions I solved for the week. Write what I learned from them, how I solved them and quickly resolve it.\n\nThis might be a tedious process but it\u2019s what has helped me improve with lc. I\u2019m still not great at it, but I\u2019ve definitely gotten better\n\n**Technical Interview**\n\nI have done several mocks on pramp, [interview.io](https://interview.io) and karat. The most important thing is communicating with your interviewer during the whole process. It's ok to be silent once In a while to think, but don't keep mum all through the interview. It's also ok if you don't know how to solve a problem, even If I didn't get the offer it was nice just discussing with the interviewer my thought process. Be very mindful of hints, interviewers drop them a lot and they want to see how you use them. This is where U struggle a lot and ofc sometimes, understanding the problem itself. My practice for interviews is leetcode, CTCI, and grokking the coding interviews. I think that is enough. If you want to get better at OAs, then practice on hackerrank and codesignal\n\n**Behavioral Interview**\n\nThis is the part where I shine. I find it easy to talk about myself so I don't prep so hard for this besides reading up on the company. I maintain eye contact, smile, and just engage with the interviewer. Your body language matters a lot. Ironically, for the two offers I got, I spoke about the app I was building instead of my internships and they really liked it. Initially, I felt it was a gamble to speak about an app that doesn't even exist but it's something I am passionate about. And I guess looking back, the interviewers could tell.\n\nThis is the part where I shine. I find it easy to talk about myself so I don't prep so hard for this besides reading up on the company.

And I guess looking back, the interviewers could tell.\n\n**Reflection**\n\nReflection done with recruiting and hope I don't have to experience this next year. I think in total, I applied to around 60 places. I got a return offer from the previous internship so I was a bit picky in where I applied. I don't consider myself good at leetcode but my approach above has helped me improve. All this to say, I won't be hear without God and favor and luck. There really isn't anything exceptional mentioned here, but I hope someone finds this helpful. \n\n***Please post questions here and I'll answer, I won't be monitoring my inbox. Also, the questions might be helpful for others.***",

You see posts like that all the time -- \"I just finished middle school, should I start grinding LeetCode?\" or \"The interviewer did not say \"You too have a great day\", how fucked am I?\"\n\nLike, seriously, who the fuck would decline an offer from Amazon or Microsoft when they have no other offers? Nobody. Nobody would do that because they would not have interviewed with them in the first place. These college kids who grind LeetCode 24/7 are fucking desperate for an offer from a top company.

It's definitely not stupid to reject FAANG to do what you want to do, and I don't feel this post touches upon that aspect.\n\nOP is assuming that everyone views working Google as the ultimate form of self actualization, and doesn't mention the context in which those people rejected those offers.",

Took this without guidance and never in it for the money I just thought it could be useful for me to use. Turns out it bores me to hell and burned me out I think my brain is fried at this point I even genuinely forgot how to do \u201cHello world\u201d. \n\nI learned too late that I have no interest in this thing I tried so hard to like it but nothing at all works, the more I code the more I tried making stuff the more furious I become, I don't find enjoyment in solving any coding problems and when my code works all I feel is I wanna smash my computer to pieces. My only hope is that I can pass this last semester with straight C so I can get the hell out of here which at this point is more of a wishful thinking since I can't get myself to do any of these assignment, the environment also sucks ass all these people ever talk about is keyboard, money, and whatever tech bullshit I don't give a crap about and when I talk about the outdoors they replied to me \"Have you tried coding outdoors? Maybe you'll like it\". \n\nI think it\u2019s just a me problem, what\u2019s clear is I wasted 4 years of my life and a huge sum of my parents money to pay for my college so far to be miserable for 1460 days all I gotta do is to just stay alive for another 150 days and hope I got all C or they pity me and bump up my grades to C (wishful thinking) I can't do this shit anymore. \n\nIn short I am fucked and I don\u2019t know what to do next since my resume looks so pathetic I don\u2019t even want to hire myself anywhere if I see this resume. On the bright side I found my true interests lies in nature and animals, got me thinking to start over taking maybe agriculture or earth science but I can\u2019t afford to spend another 4 years doing bachelor\u2019s degree all over due to time, financial, and personal reason. I'm not entirely lost just ran out of gas, I  can't go to trade since they pay you with literal cigarettes and rice for that in my country and the military only accepts supermodel with perfect vision and teeth. My goal is to go back to US (I'm from Indonesia) since I used to live there before and I like the state due to the nature and its weather I lived in but it seems fading away at this point looking at my situation. Maybe I should've tried harder but the more I tried the sicker I become it's like a disease. I can see how this thing is useful and I can see how people find enjoyment out of it, it's just not for me. Should've pick another major, I am an idiot don't be like me.",

I\u2019ve also worked with Graduates for a long time so I know the feeling.\n\nYou\u2019re just passing through shit, we all do. Life is about surpassing it. CS is never a bad choice, you can easily work in Business or Tech when you graduate. It\u2019s up to you. \n\nCS knowledge will give you a different point of view that none of your friends will have if you are working in a sales team, for example. What if you become a good sales man exactly because your company sells software and you know more about the stuff you are selling than your colleagues? This is just the most basic example, there are so many options.\n\nIf I can give my 2 cents, finish CS. In the meantime, try to understand the job market and what you\u2019d like to do. \n\nAs soon as you decide, more time you will have to slowly transit to this field by doing extracurricular activities, courses, networking, applying for jobs, etc.\n\nDon\u2019t worry in \u201cdeciding my whole life and career feeling\u201d. Reality is most of us will eventually switch again at some point after 5-8 years if we feel bored which is completely normal and should be considered as it\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019m doing a career transition myself at this exact moment and I thought for years I would retire doing recruitment.

If you get your foot in the door at most companies you can move to an adjacent role that will be more to your liking (hopefully).\n\nSo don't beat yourself up too bad.\n\nAlso any degree can get you into some jobs. So don't think you HAVE to go into technology or computers, especially entry level jobs on something like gov jobs (if you go back to the US) just having a degree will get you in the door, and you can build up experience in a field you might enjoy more. \n\nGood luck",

AI makes it worse.\n\nMoreover, computer science is proving to be challenging when it comes to job searches and interview processes; there seems to be a lack of standardization. Many senior developers are realizing the new difficulties in the field, changing their earlier perceptions about job security and how 'great' this shitty major they thought it was.",

To move into any job worth a damn, you're also going to need a master's degree at minimum.

            "Here\u2019s my take - if you still want to be in STEM, something where you\u2019re going to make a lot of money like in some kind of medical program will be harder, but at least you will have a community of people in your field. Friendships will dissipate some of these depressed feelings. There is not any sense of in-person community (discord doesn\u2019t count) in this major. Before someone says that\u2019s just my experience, I've seen all my professors try their hardest to match make their students with each other - ice breaker over ice breaker, and not much comes from it.\n\nThere are no fun late night study groups because there\u2019s not much to \u201cstudy\u201d, no camaraderie, no building each other up or career help, yet you don\u2019t have time to talk to people outside of school because the projects take up so much time.

For right now, try to focus on the things that make you happy. You probably feel like your life is fucked and doing anything else is just distracting yourself. Allow yourself to be distracted. Spend some time doing something you love. Are there hiking options nearby? Does your college have a vet clinic that needs volunteers? An animal shelter that will let you go play with a dog or cat? As ridiculous as it sounds, is there a petting zoo nearby? Just go be happy first.\n\nWhen you have a clearer mind, you can approach this again in a gentler manner. Finishing your degree will at least be proof that you have intelligence, diligence, and problem solving skills. If you don\u2019t want to work in tech at all, you\u2019ll need to be a bit more convincing in interviews for other jobs but this is not hopeless at all. If you do end up in a job you hate, it won\u2019t kill you but it will make you hate yourself and then others. In that situation, use the job to live but try to give yourself an end goal or date to get out.

Though I won\u2019t lie, I am also at that point in my academics where I\u2019m questioning if I should stay in the program or drop/switch out. 99% of it comes from lack of skills to apply. I realized I\u2019m slacking off a lot and not fully spending my time digesting the information. I also have used AI before to do my homework cause I was too lazy to even try for myself (or just didn\u2019t even know in the first place because of this domino effect leading to this chain reaction of cheating). I also noticed that my peers in my CS course are always doing some sort of coding, even if it\u2019s not for the class. This one guy in my maths course takes notes in LaTeX which impressed me. I just never do stuff like that. Kinda mad at myself for not doing it tho. I think I would like to do stuff like that though (I\u2019m just lazy). I noticed that in my maths courses I spend more time there than my CS and I actually try to learn stuff. Funny enough I\u2019ve had thoughts of becoming a teacher for maths or just a tutor. I think I would like to help people in that regard. But I also like tech, so I don\u2019t know what job would be good for me. I like tech in the role of the consumer. I was never fully like my dad, wanting to know how everything worked (the engineer mind). Yes, some things I think would be cool to know, but not in a way so much that I would become a mechanical engineering major or something. Today the majority of people do CS for the financial aspect. I mean I am too in that sense. Who wouldn\u2019t want the choice to work from home (specific jobs)? Recently, one of my teachers told me that in my years of college, I would know what I would want to do by the end of it. That\u2019s true. I think I do belong in an academic setting in the STEM field. I chose CS for an interest in tech, but also because I need the money as anyone else does too. I mean sure I have hobbies outside of stem. For example, I like to play piano, but I couldn\u2019t make a career out of it if I wanted to. I had to be realistic.",

The degree is like a tutorial to your CS related job, i realised i know NOTHING about anything when i started my internships.   \n2. There's no such thing as a bad coder, but only someone that doesn't want to learn.  Sometimes all it takes is a different mindset, easier said than done. This point will definitely trigger the OP. \n\n3. I HATED backend development, trying to grind leetcode and i just can't solve shit. There are so many different fields in CS, management, scrum master, forntend, security, UX/UI design, Mobile, AI. Why not switch around these different fields to give yourself some hope? I was fortunately enough to realise that though i'm not that good at coding, i really like doing frontend.   \n4. I am also a very young person, but what's wrong with taking a few years off to find what you like? If nothing anyone says about how to fix your career in CS is getting to your head, try a different profession! My sister just graduated her second degree and she's about 29. Getting her first job and all. But everyone's circumstances are different. \n\n  \nAnyways don't think too lightly of yourself, i would say majority of people doing CS is in your shoes, and comparatively no one can reach those that get nearly 100 WAM in CS. But what can the rest of us do? All that matters is to capitalise on your 4years worth of effort, and try to pivot to things you are interested once you have a foot path. No one is successful off the start, there's no telling if you will eventually hate agriculture and science once you start your degree in it. Keep hobbies as hobbies, imagine if you started hating the only thing you are interested in... \n\nAgain, capitalise on your effort, and then try to pivot out!

You don\u2019t need to pay AI, nor pay their health insurance, and plus it can work 24 hours a day. \n\nThe reason why companies haven\u2019t fully adopted it yet is because humans are currently better still. However, horses were replaced by cars within a few short years, and then no one ever went back to horses. \n\nIf AI progresses to the point it is better than a human, it will be game over. Currently there are several companies that have dedicated their life\u2019s mission into making that a reality.

Up until ChatGPT came out, I feel like I was on a pretty good trajectory. For my first semester, I was self-motivated and I was able to pick up and retain information. I began using ChatGPT in the spring of my Freshman year as a crutch whenever I ran into some tough problems or errors in my code, but this snowballed into me not being able to even start an assignment without putting it into ChatGPT and copying its output. Fast forward to today, near the end of my Sophomore year, and I realize that I have no real coding skills. All of my projects were either written by ChatGPT or copied from a YouTube tutorial. I struggle to even write a program that determines whether or not a number is prime. I can\u2019t solve Two Sum. I have no one to blame but myself.\n\nAs I approach my Junior year with no significant coding ability to speak of, and no internships under my belt, my anxiety levels are through the roof. I want to utilize the time I have this summer to reset and build the skills I need to be an independent and knowledgeable student/developer. I need to hear some harsh truths and some advice regarding the following:\n\n1. Building Coding and DSA Knowledge from Scratch: I want to rebuild my foundations in coding, data structures, and algorithms, ensuring I understand the concepts and can apply them without immediately turning to ChatGPT for answers. What are the most effective and efficient strategies for achieving this?\n\n2. Escaping Tutorial Hell: After building a solid coding foundation, how can I transition from following tutorials to building projects on my own?\n\nAny advice, resources, personal anecdotes, or strategies you could share would be immensely appreciated. How did you develop your skills, and what made the biggest difference for you in becoming an independent coder?\n\nThanks in advance for your help and guidance!",

After that is done go and solve a similiar problem.\n\n2. Look up specific things rather than general things.

            "I might be a little biased but here goes.. I'm a professional software developer of 22 years. My latest job has me working on a prototype and I've been using [Codebuddy](https://codebuddy.ca) to code. I'd say at least 80% of the web app so far has been written by Codebuddy (this is a Java+React application). I used to be afraid to learn new technologies because I never had that technological curiosity my peers always seemed to have, so learning something new was always really hard for me. However AI has completely changed that. At this same job there was this Sketchup plugin that was written in Ruby and I had never seen sketchup NOR had I ever seen a line of code of Ruby. Emboldened by my experience with AI I offered to take it over. Within 2 days I had far surpassed what they had originally written and I still hadn't written a single line of code, it was all done through AI.\n\nI'm telling you this because, when used properly, AI can actually really accelerate your learning and productivity. I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of Ruby now and I've even started writing code myself from time to time. For anything but the simple stuff, you can't just rely on AI to do it for you, you have to read what it has proposed to do and follow the code to make sure it hasn't screwed it up. AI is also notoriously bad at debugging code. Even if it's able to write the code you still need to be following along enough so you can work through the bugs that come about once things start getting complicated.\n\nI say go ahead and use AI, just make sure you read what it's doing and try to understand it. Talk to it about why it did one thing over another. Just doing that every day will allow you to learn while also being productive. I've never had something explained to me so concisely and thoughtfully as when AI does it - learn from it and keep doing what you're doing.\n\nGood luck!",

So we actually grilled that. But today, and this is a real anecdote I am sharing...whenever a group project comes up..the first natural instinct is to copy paste the entire thing into gpt 4 as if its a superpower...and I also sense a kind of consensus among us that \"what is the use of doing all these modules if gpt is going to replace us in the future\"..it seems that these LLMs are magical blackboxes that are self sustaining  \nHaving got some reality checks over this semester while applying for various internships..I have begun grinding leetcode and self learning ML/DL courses online as I want to specialise there...as for gpt use I confess I still use it but I am trying my best to try googling more unless its a totally clerical work...its like an addiction I must overcome somehow and I believe I will  \nAlso for projects right, one really good realisation (I dont know how relatable but still) i had was this semester I did a project for a hackathon using Gemini api and chatgpt could not answer a single question about its usage as its not updated w that info..(i have never tried any other official coding assistant and i m only talking abt gpt here)...so my teammate and I had to figure everything about that ourselves by skimming through docs and stackoverflow and modifying programs everything hands on ourselves..and trust me I am not lying this felt so wholesome..this one project was equal to 10 other so-called projects chatgpt wrote for me...so nowadays I have started teaming up with some friends to do more of such projects and try to come up with more innovative stuff and deliberately try reading docs instead of getting a narrow answer from gpt",

(I exaggerate, but I sell it as \"I can learn anything\" and not \"I am only truly versed in a version of Java that was popular during my undergrad education\".) The difference between a promising future dev and a student who may not convincingly outperform Devin (the upcoming LLM dev who will probably be a great AI junior dev) will be how well you can go beyond what ChatGPT offers by default.\n\nTo get there:\n\n1. Don't just copy paste answers, tinker with them. Break them, see if you can improve them, try to understand why and how they work, down to the data structures. You can ask GPT for these answers, so long as you learn from GPT.\n\n2. Work on being the future developer that leverages GPT to work faster. Try to build a project GPT can't and won't build for you. It will build parts as you ask for them, but it will struggle to help you assemble the parts, and it (at least currently) does pretty horribly at debugging or extending the code after generation. You can build really cool, big things that a dev without AI wouldn't, and in a fraction of the time!\n\nThat, in my opinion, is how to bounce back. Don't bounce back, double down!\n\nFor reference, I know lots of good programmers who don't know a lick of math or data structures. They're great at (1) knowing when to ask questions, and (2) what questions to ask. So you're not as boned as school might make you feel.",
            "The most important class I ever took, with regard to Computer Science, was a class called Structured Program Design, where we never wrote a single line of executable code. It was about three weeks of extremely terse pseudocode, followed by thirteen weeks of flowcharting. This class basically taught us most of what was covered in the DSA course, and it had the weirdest class-materials requirement I\u2019ve ever seen: Two decks of playing cards with different colored backs.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about DSA: Most of what you learn can be simulated with playing cards. If you can simulate it with one deck, great, but if you need more than 52 elements, you add a second deck, and the different backs makes it easy to separate them from each other. Also, you can simulate duplicated data, because what do you do if you\u2019re sorting a list (or whatever container), and you get identical values? Do you sort it before the previous one? After? Does the prompt tell you to discard the duplicate data? If you\u2019re sorting a deck of cards, are aces high or low? Are you sorting the cards in ascending or descending order? Are the cards being sorted by value then suit or suit then value? In one case, the four aces would be array locations 0, 1, 2, 3, but in the other case, they would be 0, 13, 26, and 39. \n\nAnd, that\u2019s how you structure a program. A really simple program, but it\u2019s illustrative of how you can come up with things to practice. I have a printout in my office wall (yay two-bedroom apartment) of a flowchart for a prime-number generator, which I take down and use whenever I have to learn a new language, because it takes input, performs output, does calculations with a couple of data types, deals with reading from and writing to data structures, and then there\u2019s the question of if the language lets me terminate a for loop with a value that\u2019s not known until runtime or if the language permits resizing arrays. And yet the flowchart is this simplistic thing that just pumps a number through a loop and determines if it\u2019s prime or not. You could do it with a pencil and paper and time.\n\nMy Yoda was this wizened old man who had been programming since a five-megabyte hard drive was the size of a dishwasher. For several years, he worked at either AT&T and/or Lucent thirty feet from Dennis Ritchie. I actually squealed when he told us this. I was the only one in class who knew who Dennis Ritchie was. One thing he hated was the word \u201ccoding,\u201d because we weren\u2019t learning to write code; we were learning to program, and he felt (as I do, because he was my Yoda) that writing code is secondary to coming up with the answer. Who\u2019s the genius: The composer who hears the music in his head or the person who transcribes what the composer is humming on to a piece of paper? I believe languages are basically immaterial, because when did I write the program: When I drew the flowchart or when I write it as code in a given language? If I write it in C, C++, C#, Java, Python, or Swift, did I write it six times or only once?\n\nI have this tendency to wax philosophical about programming, because it\u2019s my opinion that you have to have a philosophy about it. And, like all philosophies, none are right and none are wrong, but I have mine. But I\u2019ll say this: If your immediate response to a prompt is to immediately start typing, I will materialize a ruler out of thin air and whap your knuckles with it and yell, \u201cStop it!\u201d Part of my philosophy is that programming is like getting to the center of a hedge maze: If you start typing immediately, that\u2019s like walking into the maze and just taking your chances. Eventually, that will work, but every hedge maze I\u2019ve ever encountered (and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve been to so many) has a map right next to the entrance. So, you can either solve it from the inside and waste a bunch of time backtracking, or you can plan it out and then go, \u201cOh,\u201d and then walk straight to the center. \n\nMost programmers seem to find what works for them; some never do, but most do. But I highly recommend considering not thinking about code until you have to; until you\u2019ve figured out how to solve the problem. And if you can\u2019t solve the problem, reduce it into smaller problems and integrate them. That\u2019s why god invented functions, and functions that execute other functions. And, once you do that, you watch your code execute and sigh, having created something downright elegant.",
            "I'd suggest start slow. Jetbrains has a plug-in for their IDEs called JetBrain Academy ranging from easy to hard projects and you walk through them step by step. All the coding is your own, and each step there is check where it'll run unit tests to see if you got the right solution. There are hints if you get stuck. This seems like a nice solution until you get back on your feet, reorienting to code as it's not copying and pasting, but it does give you ideas of how to think about a problem.

            "honestly this might sound like weird advice but i don\u2019t think you need to stop using chatgpt, i think you need to learn how to use chatgpt **correctly**. \n\ni was the opposite - my first couple of years in undergrad for mechE i was down so bad when it came to matlab/python etc because it wasn\u2019t a huge focus in mech. which sucks because it\u2019s really useful in the industry so i wanted to get better at it. when i discovered how much chatgpt could help me with programming i was floored.\n\nin a few months, i skyrocketed in my most basic abilities to the point where eventually i was able to write an entire program that ran face recognition on an autonomous scale robot car to emulate a self driving uber for students at my school for a project. i used chatgpt to coach me thru the entire thing, but i also deeply and thoroughly learned wtf was going on each step of the way.\n\nyou have to treat your resources like a genuine tutor or teacher. don\u2019t make chatgpt write the whole code, ask it how you start, or the basic layout, and then basically run the program and watch it fail a million times, checking the error output, fixing the little mistakes one by one. when you get a failed program ask chatgpt what the error message means, don\u2019t ask it to write you a new code. ask the gpt what the possible **reasons** are that the code took a sh*t and then try to debug based on each possibility. for example i would ask the gpt to give me step by step explanations on how certain nodes worked in ROS2, and then i\u2019d try it myself with the skeleton code, and just turn back to the gpt when something failed again that i couldn\u2019t fix myself.\n\nand then once you get a running program, open a blank slate and try to write it again. really take the time to just follow it line by line and see what everything means. tbh i feel like chatgpt is the best resource to ever happen to me but that\u2019s just because of the *way* i use it. does it have the potential to completely fck me over? yeah, if i treat it like an answer key instead of an interactive personal pocket professor. \n\nbut seriously, in my opinion, turning to chatgpt for advice was the best thing that ever happened to my coding abilities.

I want you to explain each concept, give a corresponding example, and practice questions to help me apply the \nconcept. I need you to act as computer science professor with over 10 years of experience teaching the subject to students like me. Ask me how I feel about a concept to gauge my understanding and correct me if wrong to excel my learning. After teaching me the basics give me a small project to apply what I\u2019ve learned for my portfolio.\u201d\n\nJust swap out programming language Java for Data Structures and Algorithm and probably just go to LeetCode to practice. \n\nUse YouTube tutorials that explain concepts of programming languages instead of project tutorials.

TL;DR write code.\n\nSince there are a lot of people in this thread talking up ChatGPT's coding abilities, a word of caution for you all. ChatGPT is pretty good at providing small, self-contained code snippets for simple tasks and common problems that come up during an undergrad CS degree. It's a lot less useful in real day-to-day programming. Don't get me wrong, I use it every day and I like it, but real programming often involves solving weird problems in large codebases that you don't fully control. None of the AI tools are good at this. \n\nIn real programming jobs, you aren't going to be creating a new text file from scratch that just contains the solution to a leetcode problem. You're going to be figuring out what functions you need to call to accomplish your task inside of a large codebase whose source code is proprietary, so you can't search for it on the internet or ask ChatGPT. You're going to be writing temporary workarounds while your colleagues fix bugs that prevent you from directly doing things you need to do. You're going to be reading Jira tickets with vague descriptions of problems and trying to figure out what the hell they mean.
