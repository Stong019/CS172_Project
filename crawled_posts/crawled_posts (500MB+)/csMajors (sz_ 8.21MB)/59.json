Then the technical assessment was a coding test where you had max 8 hours. Those that completed it in 4 hours were \u201cfeasible\u201d candidates. After that it was an interview about talking about your resume and answering some questions with a technical manager. The interview was actually quite tough he was grilling me on my projects and internship and asking a lot of technical questions. I actually thought i totally failed the interview, but I guess I did fine. Remember this is for an INTERNSHIP so they might\u2019ve been more lenient than for a full time swe job \n\nI just graduated last month and over school I immersed myself in technology (docker, kubernetes, Kafka, AWS, microservices, APIs, React, multiple backend frameworks, learning multiple languages and how they work, etc) that is used widely in the industry. Even today I\u2019m still building projects and apps. Something that really would impress and employer. \n\nI think I just impressed them with what I did and the apps I\u2019ve built. I GAVE UP DOING LEETCODE because I think it\u2019s pointless and BORING. I would rather build a cool app. Fuck your standards. I do what I want",

OP likely can\u2019t even apply for unemployment because of a lack of work history. \n\nThis type of behavior deserves to be shamed.

(And He felt the need to pull up all my past grades/test scores from previous CS classes.) \nHe brought them up as if my grades reflect me. Meanwhile I was battling through depression, i was barely alive those four years of college. I knew other people who copied and pasted code from GitHub, I wouldn\u2019t do that. \nThis because I was asking for another chance to take his class because the pandemic screwed me and I failed the first time. \n\nMind you, it is the schools policy to allow you to retake one class as a CS major. He just decided to evaluate me to retake his class as if it was a high honor. \nIt felt like such a invasion of privacy He made the semester so rough for me, I was currently dealing with PTSD. I have major anxiety, this presented itself in exams.  That\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t do well on exams. I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to disclose my person life  to my college professor so I didn\u2019t. Also reminder to everyone, there is more than one way to identify ones skills.  \n\nJust venting because I wish more men (and women too) supported women. didn\u2019t have the best experience interviewing with a man recently. \n\nEspecially as I\u2019m fighting HARD to be 2% of Latina in tech, I wish I felt more supported. \n\nI\u2019ve gone through so much shit in my life and I\u2019m confident in my abilities.

Just try hard to understand the concepts and take good notes so you can use them in the future (I wish I did this because preparing for interviews sucks)\n* Also don\u2019t worry if you fail a quiz, lab, or class, it\u2019s not the end of the world.
