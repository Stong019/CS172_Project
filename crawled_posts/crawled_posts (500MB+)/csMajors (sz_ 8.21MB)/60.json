        "selftext": " \n\nInterview of Jensen Huang - Nvidia CEO has some interesting insights.\n\nQUOTE - \"It's going to sound completely opposite of what people feel. You probably recall over the course of the last 10-15 years, almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science. Everybody should learn how to program. In fact, it's almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human. Everybody in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of artificial intelligence. For the very first time, we have closed the gap; the technology divide has been completely closed.\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUOrH2FJKfo&t=1090s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUOrH2FJKfo&t=1090s)\n\nRegarding, he's literally an AI company CEO who will be biased to say good things for AI. Still, I think the fact that he encourages studying something other than computer science (for him, he said he'd choose biology if he went back to school, interview timeline 21:10) says something about the future of computer science. I know he's not the person to predict the future, but as the CEO of a company at the frontier leading this AI boom where Nvidia's goals are headed, their money and energy will be focused on closing this technology gap. Therefore, the future of computer science majors seems to be changing dramatically. I think CS will become like general education classes and not considered a major in the future because it will be so easy to program or learn CS with the small gap in technology.\n\nI don't know \u2013 as a computer science major, I've recently had lots of thoughts on the future of software engineering and CS in general, and now, listening to Nvidia's CEO and where all the money is leading, I feel like I should be prepared to start studying different interests, maybe not just CS. I wonder what you guys think?",

Is education more important? Should I do online part-time education or would that stain my resume?\n\nWhat would you choose, school or internship? I\u2019m so confused.\n\n\nEdit: since a bunch of people are PMing about it, I'll just add it here. No, there isn't anything special I did to get this internship. I applied, I was selected to interview, and I got an offer. No referrals or connections. I did have a lot of tech stuff on my resume, but very basic work (open source, simple projects). The main advice I can give is to tailor your resume to the job description as much as possible - at least for NVIDIA, each internship has a specific description; try to talk about your relevant experiences as much as possible. Its all about prep + luck, and I won't lie about me getting lucky.",

            "Internship experience will teach you more than any degree will. Which makes sense because you usually work 40+ hours a week compared to the usual 10 or so you do in school, therefore creating a gap very quickly that school can\u2019t fill. Nevertheless, Nvidia can have massive layoffs tomorrow and there can be a year long recession, if you don\u2019t have that degree, you will be screwed. You can always go look for a job, but starting and finishing a degree program is a lot harder, requires more of a time dedication, and be comes harder to finish the older you get.\n\nI would determine wether to extend your school or not based on the pay. If you can graduate on time and make $175k or more (~$80/hr)vs getting paid like 80k now (~$38/hr). Just hurry up and finish your degree and get the full time. Your time will be valued a lot more. No point extending your earning potential and working for less longer. If anything just ask for the internship for next summer and stay on track to graduate. You already got 1 under your belt (at a really respected company), having a second one won\u2019t make or break your future prospects.",

You could become very specialized and imo there is a big benefit to specializing as early in your career as possible. Getting in with a solid company and learning how they do everything is huge especially early on.\n\nI don't think you can guarantee one choice will be better than the other. The degree is probably safer long term, but this also seems like a great opportunity",

One of my buddies did 4 internship at 4 FAANG companies in 1 year and did part time school. \n\ni also did part time school and part time internship, but make sure to communicate it and set days/hours with the company.\n\nif you are not confident about doing both, you can ask if they can delay your internship to the summer. its very common to do this. \n\nAlso without the degree you cant get the full time so what the point of continuously doing internship work fulltime if you never get hired. you are doing fulltime work with half the benefits. The faster you get your degree the faster they can onboard you to full time. one of my other buddies graduated a semester early and got to start full time earlier by talking to hr. \n\nnever delay the degree, you will lose out on maxing out on the most money you could make and are putting your full time opportunities at risk. feel free to dm me if you want me to elaborate or want me to elaborate my experience doing part time internship/school.",

            "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the situation you're facing. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **FAANG Offers:** Not receiving offers from FAANG companies doesn't necessarily reflect on your passion or skills in computer science. These companies have highly competitive recruitment processes, and many factors beyond passion, such as technical skills, experience, and networking, come into play. It's essential to keep applying, honing your skills, and seeking out opportunities to improve your chances.\n2. **Professor Feedback:** If you're receiving failing grades despite expressing your passion for the subject, there could be several reasons for this. It's possible that your professors are assessing you based on criteria other than passion, such as understanding of the material, application of concepts, and meeting assignment requirements. It's crucial to take their feedback seriously and consider areas where you can improve.\n3. **Email Communication:** While expressing your passion for the subject in emails to your professors is commendable, it's essential to ensure that your communication is respectful and focused on addressing any concerns or seeking help. Sending another email could be appropriate if you have specific questions or need clarification on the feedback you've received. However, it's essential to approach it professionally and be open to constructive criticism.\n\nIn summary, keep pursuing your passion for computer science, continue to improve your skills, and seek feedback from your professors to understand how you can perform better academically. Additionally, explore a variety of opportunities beyond FAANG companies to find the right fit for your career goals.",

        "selftext": "AI isn't the cause of the tech hiring slow down! There was a law that went into effect in 2022 that updated Section 174 of the tax code.\n\nHere are two scenarios to illustrate this:\n\n\\- In 2021, you could found a startup and hire an engineer and pay them $100,000. Say your company did $100,000 in revenue too. In this case, the $100,000 in cost cancels out the $100,000 in revenue, and your business owes zero dollars in taxes. This makes a lot of sense.\n\n\\- In 2022, you could found a startup and hire an engineer and pay them $100,000. Say your company did $100,000 in revenue too. Instead of being able to deduct the $100k salary in the first year, you have to amortize the $100k salary over 5 years.  \nSo in this case, you'd have a taxable income of $80k for the first year. This means you'll have a $24k tax bill with no money to pay it!\n\nMany companies were caught off guard in 2022 and 2023 during tax season and had to take out loans to pay their tax bills!\n\nSo nowadays, when hiring a software engineer companies have to think, \"will this hire pay off in 5 years?\" and the answer when hiring junior engineers is, \"maybe, maybe not.\"\n\nIn the old world, it didn't matter because 100% of the junior engineers salary could be deducted from a businesses taxes!\n\nIf you're struggling to get a job in tech, please call your senator and demand that they repeal the update to section 174 of the tax code! This would immediately solve about 50% of the tech hiring slow down we've seen in the last 2 years!\n\nSource: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eczachly\\_softwareengineering-activity-7179241199537377281-ebo5?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eczachly_softwareengineering-activity-7179241199537377281-ebo5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)",

            "There's a bill in congress to fix this. It passed the house with a huge majority (357 to 70) back in January. But now Republicans in the senate are trying to block it. And they may very well succeed. \n\nIf you care about this at all, you really should call your senators. It literally takes two minutes. You can easily look up their phone numbers on the Small Software Business Alliance website ([https://ssballiance.org/contact-legislator](https://ssballiance.org/contact-legislator)), call the numbers, and simply say, \"Hi. I'm a voter in your state, and I want you to pass the tax bill, HR 7024. Thank you!\"",
            "Along with interest rates, this adds a lot of great insight to the current state of the tech industry. Thanks for this!",

            "Thank Donald Trump who introduced this bill, to pay for tax cuts for billionaires",
            "It\u2019s no one thing, and a US tax clauses with narrow scope (R&D) is not what is driving the global cooldown in tech hiring. I\u2019d argue that most CFOs do not consider it a major contributor either.\n\nA few significant contributing factors  \n\nGeopolitical uncertainty: war in Ukraine and the Middle East, increased geopolitical tension with Iran and China, and a bumper year for elections. Businesses and lenders are more risk averse, therefore investment and attitude towards growth is lower than it might normally be.  \n\nCovid disruption: we are still responding to the changes invoked by the pandemic. The virus itself may not be having an impact, but the changes caused in the supply chain, ways of working, and macro economic trends are still being responded to.  \n\nPoor macroeconomic outlook: even with recent growth in some markets, analysts are not confident in significant growth at a global scale.  \n\nHigh interest rate environment: financing growth is challenging for those without health cash reserves or margins, and with the conditions above, those with cash may be conservative in the or expenditure.  \n\nHype, over hiring in 2022: there has been a correction in response to the aggressive hiring post-pandemic where many of the firms that over indexed are now having rounds of layoffs.  \n\nSignificant volumes of grads or others who want a career in tech diluting the applicant pool.  IMO",
            "So, how does this explain that the same market conditions exist in UK and Europe?",
            "Shit gets reposted every couple weeks, the tax was just redefining points that made no sense in Tech like what Research and Development qualifies as.\n\nInterest rates are still high, every sector is getting hit with these layoffs especially finance like banking, so no this isn't a \"taxes are bad\" type thing, this is a companies aren't going to want to hire when everything costs more thing.",
            "Comorbid",
            "While I agree with the other commenters here that this is a factor but not the only factor, I still think this is a significant factor. You have to understand that U.S. is de-facto the tech market maker. If US slows down hiring, everyone else is going to follow suite. \n\nSalaries are the highest expenses in most tech companies, and a significant change like causes companies\u2019 bottom line to change. In a sane world, this change makes no sense. I hope everyone no matter their political affiliation can look into repealing this change. This impacts all of us.",
            "It\u2019s honestly not a bad law since it is for R&D purposes specifically. If a new company spends $1,000,000 to develop a new product, instead of incurring that cost all in the first year and then taxing on 500k in profit / year the following 5 years (if product successful). They can amortize the initial investment and only tax 300k in profit the following 5 years. Rather than a $1,000,000 loss in the first year. \n\nA lot of CS tbh isn\u2019t R&D but maintenance and internal tools and wouldn\u2019t be impacted.",
            "Of course it\u2019s not! Everyone in here is just eating up the AI talk from people who\u2019s job it is to sell AI products. Of course openAI is going to put out news that AI will take over SWE it\u2019s literally how they sell their product. Stop being afraid of sales tactics. Y\u2019all should be smarter than this.",
            "This is not a very good analysis of the broader forces at work here. One of the replies to that post shared someone else's thoughts that are much more accurate however:\n\n>1) Massive collusion of tech redundancies from all companies based on very flimsy claims about a tech recession which are not substantiated by the bottom line of most companies, and are if anything, self-caused.\n\n>2) Create a huge buyers market in tech recruitment, with 50% of people out of work, and many families struggling to put food on the table.\n\n(50% maybe too high, replace that word with \"more\" and it's still fine)\n\n>3) Rehire very selectively at lower salaries and enforce hybrid or full-time work from the office contracts.\n\n>4) Make those you rehired work extra hard to make up for the multiple people they're replacing.\n\n>5) Stock market rewards tech companies for 'cutting the fat'.\n\n>Do you realise how much we need unions yet??",
            "Looks like a consequence of moving too fast and not checking enough details before writing the law. Very much a Trump like bull in a China shop behavior. This is why Trump came up with a description of being a \"stable genius\" (when reports called him \"an unstable idiot\" / not my words) in a search of who caleed him impulsive or stupid you get: https://www.bing.com/search?q=Who%20first%20called%20Trump%20and%20%22unstable%20idiot%22&PC=XMBA&form=LWS001&ssp=1&cc=US&setlang=en&safesearch=moderate",

            "So companies are taxed for revenues and not for profits? \nThat doesn\u2019t make much sense . But laws can be weird .",
            "There is no magic bullet answer. And if there is one, it\u2019s not this. Large software companies got bloated and have more engineers than real work, small software companies don\u2019t have easy access to cash. That\u2019s the actual, core reason.",
            "Let's be real, this may be bad for CS majors but it's good for society. You shouldn't be able to cancel out your tax burden by hiring an intern.",
            "So it\u2019s either AI, immigrants, resume, or tax code but definitely not the supply and demand forces of a free market. Got it.",
            "Welcome to the way the rest of the world handles it, and we're still dealing with shortage of jobs in tech sector, so it's definately AI's fault"
