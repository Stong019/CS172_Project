        "selftext": "Leetcode is famous for being a perfect platform for practicing coding problems and to master coding interviews, unlike others, it is not for competitive programming, this guide will help you to get started with Leetcode without losing hope too early.\n\n[A Guide to grinding Leetcode](https://theabbie.github.io/blog/leetcode-grinding-guide)\n\n## Follow a list\n\nBiggest reason why people don't find DSA interesting is because they are unable to discover good problems which are easier to solve, simply solving popular questions with no track of questions will bore you very quick. Even worse, you might try solving a really hard problem and lose motivation when it wasn't that hard, you just had to get a grip on it. That's why it's absolutely necessary to follow a list of questions, that way you won't have issues discovering new questions.\n\n**Solving problems in right order is very important,**\n\nyou might see question marked easy which isn't actually easy, the solution will be small, but sometimes, it isn't easy to come up with that solution if you haven't done simpler version of it, thus, it will be demotivating,\n\n[Blind 75 Leetcode Questions](https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/)\n\nThis is an awesome list which is asked in interviews and is ordered by actual level of difficulty with prerequisites coming before harder questions, if you follow this, you'll feel interested, once you have done most of this, do problems in \u201csimilar questions\" section below each problem till you master that category.\n\nOnce you feel confident, you can use this,\n\n[Leetcode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)\n\nand solve problems by category, this will help you master a data structure or some algorithm.\n\ndon't get afraid by \u201chard\" questions, there is no hard problem which can't be broken up, try to break it, you might not be able to solve it but you'll convert it to much shorter set of problems which can be solved with some practice.\n\nThinking abstract and looking at bigger picture is very important, try to convert it to a standard problem. Leetcode is addictive if you improve gradually, try it.\n\n## Avoid looking at solutions easily\n\nIt's not bad to look at solutions, afterall, you can't know everything and learning is necessary, however, looking at solution just after few minutes of brainstorming is bad, you have to give your absolute best and try every possible \"inefficient\" solutions you could come up with.\n\nFirst phase is to figure out what Algorithm and data structure will be used, if you are able to determine what data structure will be used, you can check the **Related Topics** section to verify if your assumption was correct, and if after few minutes you can't figure it out, you should still check the data structure that will be used and then try to figure out how and where it will be used in given problem.\n\nIf you are able to come up with a solution which works correctly, just isn't the best one, that's still a success, coming up with a brute force solution is a bare minimum in an interview.\n\nYou can try improving the brute force solution by using some optimizations, that might not lead you to the optimal solution, but improving a solution is a great skill. After spending an hour, if you can't solve the problem, you should usnderstand that you just aren't well versed with the given algorithm and should try solving related problems with that data structure and understand how it works.\n\nYou should avoid looking at solution, a solution you made yourself will help you much more, you should abandon the question and maybe revisit in future when you have some experience with that data strucure. That way you can also track if you made some progress with that technique and if you could solve a new problem given to you in an interview,\n\n## Interview Questions don't come with hints\n\nOne thing to remember is that Interview questions won't tell you what data structure will be used for the problem. That's something you can only master with practice, the patterns and requirements of problems determine what's going to be used.\n\nThere is no substitute for practice, reading about algorithms will sure improve your range of thinking, but practice is what will help you master it.\n\n## Be Consistent\n\nThis goes without saying that practice needs consistency, simply overdoing once and abandoning for months will be destructive, it doesn't take much to take out some time everyday for Leetcode, as far as discovering questions is a concern, you can use Daily Challenges to keep the consistency and maybe also earn Leetcode coins which might buy you a Leetcode T-Shirt one day.\n\n## Turn Demotivation into learning opportunity\n\nThere will be times when you can't solve a problem despite all efforts, that's very common and bound to happen, but some question being too hard is not something that should demotivate you, every question is a learning opportunity, you can always learn it. Demotivation should be avoided and that's only possible if you have confidence in yourself and will to learn as much as you can.\n\n## Participate in contests\n\nEventhough Leetcode isn't a competitive programming platform, there are contests which allow you to try out brand neew problems and even compete with others. They have categories of 1 easy, 2 Medium and 1 Hard, and solving 3 is more than enough. Once you have enough confidence on your problem solving ability, these contests will help you gain interview experience as they don't have any hints and solutions aren't available during contest. This is pretty close to a real interview experience where time is limited.\n\n## Keep Hustling\n\nLeetcode is an addiction and soon you'll fall in love with it, all you need to do is start, there is only one good time to start anything great, NOW, just do it and you'll sure be satisfied with your decision and be proud of yourself. That's all, It's never too early and never too late.",

            "Hi, thank you for the guide. Could you also add some tips on how to approach problems? Or point at any post that is relevant to that? \n\nI watched Professor Leonard's math videos where he explained \"An Approach to Problem-Solving,\" where he gave tips on how to solve word problems:\n\n1. Read the problem carefully\n2. Do not immediately make equations,\n3. Look for similar or exact formulas,\n4. Identify the variables/the unknown/the \"something,\"\n5. Identify where the \"equal\" sign is,\n6. Assign variable,\n7. Make **verbal model** => Here is something that really interests me, he began changing and rearranging the words into math equations after identifying each variable and constant.\n8. Solve the equation\n\nI found that this verbal model helps solve problems by rearranging words to follow standard equation writing, hence also helping in making logical reasoning followed by pseudocode writing.",

            "The interview process in most tech companies is broken but for a good reason. \n\nIt's not you. It's the companies. Their interest lies in being super selective. Especially, if it's a FAANG company, they have lot of people trying to work for them. They can afford to be super selective\n\nMost tech companies spend a lot of during onboarding. Also, a SDE can do a lot of good but can also do a lot of harm. FAANG companies in particular give a lot of freedom to employees, to do great things.. but that also means that employees can do bad things.\n\nAlso, the interview process is inherently an error prone process. For both interviewer and interviewee. There is no way they can know you as a person in 6 hours of talking to you. There is always a risk that they are making a mistake.\n\nSo, from the company's perspective there is always a risk that they are making a mistake. This could be that they reject the person they should have hired, or they hire the person they shouldn't have hired. The cost of  hiring the person they shouldn't hire is much much higher than the cost of rejecting they should have hired. Rejecting someone only costs them 6-8 hours of company time. Hiring the wrong person will cost them those 6-8 hours, plus about 6 months of salary, plus whatever damage the person does.\n\nIn a nutshell, the interview process is geared to err on side of rejection. If they reject you, it's very likely it's because they just didn't get to know you enough. Or maybe you just need a little more exposure to challenging problems.\n\n\nI've been in 30+ Amazon interviews, and there's been only 1 where the consensus was that this person should never work at Amazon. It's always been \"eh we didn't get enough evidence\" or \"meh this person needs to get a little more experience here\". Many times, we are on the fence, but Amazon tell us to reject if we are on the fence. Many times, we think the person meets the bar, but Amazon wants the candidate to raise the bar.",

I have been a developer in the automotive supplier space for the past 8 years, still at my first job out of university. I work for an auto supplier out of necessity because it is the only job I could find. The pay sustains me and my family in low COL area, but it's not great.\n\nWhile I would love to work at a big tech company, I'm not willing to move from Canada to the USA to do so, nor am I willing to move to a Canadian city where small houses cose over a million dollars. This has limited my job search to some degree, though I would take another job at a company where \"the software is the product,\" if I could find one that would hire me. I can't find such a company; my resumes are not responded to, hence why I've been in the same crappy place for 8 years and counting.\n\nI don't hop on this subreddit to look for help, I'm here to help others and to spread the word that it IS possible to get work and live a good life in spite of not receiving any internships. Because there is INTENSE survivorship bias. You see all of the \"which internship should I accept because I got 3 offers at top companies!\" posts, but the rest gets buried.",

Whenever I've seen situations like this, sometimes the work authorization is an issue. I think that's the only demographic info that companies can view and subsequently filter candidates on (but I may be totally wrong on this)\n\nAlso, do you only apply to big/well-known companies? Try applying to small, local places. At the very least you will have interviews that you can practice at! If you're an underclassman, even a generic no-name internship is better than nothing. And plenty of people do internships like that, but ofc no one is gonna be on here going \"ya i interned at Big Bobby's Tool Supply over my sophmore summer\"\n\nFinally, have you been writing cover letters for each company? It does take tons of time and effort but it might help especially if you're a competitive applicant. Try having your cover letters reviewed and see if that helps.\n\noh and a very small last thing!! if you've only been applying in the past few weeks, give it some time! The holidays just ended and with the corona going around, HR might be backed up at a lot of companies. you might hear back soon still :)\n\ngood luck, dont let this place get you down.

Take a deep breath and just know that this would work out \ud83e\udd7a a lot of startups and mid - small size companies are still recruiting, you can do this! And at the end of the day, you just need ONE internship, it really is a numbers game.",

            "I mean I go to a podunk university and half-assedly applied to <100 places and got like 10-12 interviews. My resume isn't that great, just one internship at a no name company and 3 web projects.",

            "Cornell may be top 5 in US news and a good school, but the reality is its name isn't going to help with getting interviews quite as much as HYPSM/CMU/Cal. So you need to have a strong resume to compensate. Still though, you should be able to get interviews almost anywhere with the experience you have, just need to highlight it better in your resume.",

            "Building your connections by uploading your resume and reaching out to recruiters and professionals in the field will improve your luck by 90%. Tech isn\u2019t different from any other field. Companies like hiring and helping people they know and like. Your school, experiences, skill level 8 times out of 10 mean nothing if you don\u2019t know someone who can get you in the door. I suggest attend your school\u2019s career fairs and put yourself out there more! Good luck you still have time.",
