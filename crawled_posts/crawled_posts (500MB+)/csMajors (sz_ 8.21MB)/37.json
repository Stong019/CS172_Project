Whenever the company flies you out to a new place (like L'Oreal flying you out to NYC or whatever), take a few pictures from the trip and make a linkedin post on it. \n\n2. When you go there, talk to everyone and add them on linkedin\n\n3.

Often times we use these as feeder programs into the internship program and then the new grad program. Every time my company has an externship, we knew we would be hiring at least one person from that cohort. It was a given. \n\nCompanies like seeing these externships or insight days on resumes. This shows leadership experience and helps you be above those that have absolutely no internship experience. I have even seen them referred to as fellowships depending on the company. Bottom line, they look amazing on a resume if you know how to tailor it. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to say what kind of work it was. All industries do these, even sales, marketing, etc. if you manage to get one, you can just say insight week - you don\u2019t have to say whether or not it was technical. \n\nApply apply apply if you can!

        "selftext": "2024 New Grad. This is my first post but thought I'd share some of my experiences. There was this one team at Meta that I really wanted to join, and they had been hiring since May of last year. At the time they only hired experienced candidates. But since their tech stack felt very similar to the one I worked on during my internship, I thought I'd give it a try. I applied in May and as expected, was ghosted.\n\nThen came the fall recruiting season and I wasn't about to give up. I reached out to an EM at Meta that I had previous connection with and asked her for a referral to these roles. She gave me the referral, but again I was rejected three days later, this time by an actual recruiter.\n\nWhen the Meta New Grad posting came out in November, I thought I'd give it one last try. I wasn't expecting much because like everyone else, I was cold-applying to a bunch of other places and didn't have much luck with getting interviews. Especially being from out of the country, I really thought I didn't have a chance. Surprisingly, the next day after I applied I got a recruiter reach out. I followed through the process, one OA and one VO, and was told right after the holidays that I got into team matching.\n\nInitially I was sent several teams, but none of them was the team I was hoping to join. Thinking that if I've come this far, I might as well give it another try, I reached out to the manager of that team directly on LinkedIn, and to my delight he quickly responded and said they were indeed looking to hire E3's! So we had a quick conversation and I was extended an offer yesterday to join this team.\n\nI feel so happy right now because it's like a dream coming true, but I know that so much of what contributed to this good outcome was luck. I guess I wanted to share that if you know what you want and have a clear goal, you just need to keep pushing for it and have faith in yourself, and if you do luck will be in your favor!\n\nThat's it! Happy Friday to everyone and I'm happy to answer any questions as well for those of you who might be in the same process with Meta!",

To a company like Meta, the ridiculousness of the leetcode grind is a feature, not a bug, because it separates out the people who are motivated to go through the stupid process. \n\nSo with that in mind: they are probably not expecting you to listen to this.
