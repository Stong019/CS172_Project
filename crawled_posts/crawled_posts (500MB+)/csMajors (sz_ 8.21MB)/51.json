Every event that has led to where I am now cannot be explained from something other than luck. I am on track to graduate with 4 SWE internships (though I'm planning for 5 if possible), including Amazon and Google.\n\nMy first internship was with IBM, and that happened the summer before my freshman year of college started. I was lucky enough for them to host a 5 week paid internship program for my high school with no OA or interview required.\n\nI'd say my second internship was fairly earned; I interviewed the best and they didn't pay that well, but at least I got a year's worth of experience from them.\n\nMy third internship was with Amazon. I only had about 30 LC questions done, but I was lucky enough to get an OA with terribly easy questions and even more lucky to only have a behavioral interview afterwards that got me the offer. I also got the offer weeks before the waitlist started, so even more lucky.\n\nFinally as a rising junior, I was stupid lucky to have a Google recruiter select me as a candidate for 2024 SWE internship. The OA was easy, though I came more prepared. The interview was 1 LC easy and 1 LC hard, but the interviewer was nice enough to pass me.\n\nI see so many people with a better resume, more experience, better at LC, and go to a better school than I do (I go to a T200), yet they struggle finding internships. Meanwhile easy OAs and interviews are spoonfed to me.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I need to see this from a perspective from the general population.\n\nEDIT: From people that are asking for resume, this is my anonymized resume: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/qzvvfggdxdnd](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qzvvfggdxdnd) For people who are asking for my ethnicity, I am Mexican American.  \n\n\nEDIT 2: Nice to be on the top of the subreddit.

            "This isn't really luck as much as it is momentum. Having a legitimate IBM internship before starting college is huge. You used that to launch yourself from role to role gaining more and more experience. But the experience only gets you an interview, you are the one that gets yourself the job.",
            "Did you get lucky? Probably, but at the very least clearly you were prepared to act on opportunities you got through that luck. I don't think it's *all* luck.\n\nIMO plenty of people with successful internships had a good part of it come from luck in one way or another, myself included. Whether they got lucky on a resume screen/interview, got lucky by having network connections via family friends, or got lucky by having supportive parents, lots of people are fortunate in one way or another. But like I mentioned before, for the most part, these people succeed due to a combination of hard work and luck.\n\nGoogle's interview process specifically is relatively rigid for interns, if you passed then you probably did something right even if you don't think you did. As for your IBM internship, was it just handed to anyone who requested it or were you given access for some sort of reason like academic performance? Luck might have played a factor but you still acted on it, that's more than most senior highschool students would do.\n\nI'd say the one exception is Amazon, which yeah people can just luck the entire way through... I know someone who applied with 0 internships or non-tutorial projects (no referral), moved past OA with 8/30 OA test cases, got asked 2sum during the interview and didn't know the optimal solution, didn't know LPs for the interview, and still got the offer. I know someone actually working at Amazon who did several intern interviews and she said she just passed them all, including downright mediocre candidates, because she didn't care and they kind of just shove those interviews onto random employees. Did you luck through it? Perhaps, but plenty of people did, and you passed Google later on so clearly you're doing *something* right.",

            "Ok I will give you the uncomfortable but hopefully more useful answer: If everyone in your class is literally like that but only with you, makes me think that maybe the problem is in your perception, and not in their behavior. You can try the next for a week: everytime you feel \"ignored and disrespected as a human\", annotate in a notebook what exactly happened, with details. At the end of the week, read everything and try to give a different meaning, try to be imaginative. My point is that you seems to focus only in \"why they are so bad with me\", and doesn't seems that even crossed your mind an alternative hypothesis. Have you wonder how they see you? Maybe you are not so friendly with them like you think you are. Maybe they wonder the same about you, why this girl is so awkward, I would like to be friend with her...Or maybe they never thought about it and never imagined that you feel like this. Or maybe you was really unlucky and ended in the most unsocial with females lab at university, it can be too. Why exactly do you think is because you are a female, and not because is just you? I mean, did you saw them interacting with other women? They also looks awkward and aggressive? I was in similar situation in a group once, not gender related though, until I saw myself from outside (literally, in a video record) and realized I was the reason of conflict, not the other way around. Was very shocking and difficult to swallow, as I was convinced they hated me. Is not the same situation but...just think about it",
            "I don't think I have enough information to make a judgement on this. But I have an especially bitter experience with the \"social awkward\" label, for which I want to share.\n\nGenerally, I am a pretty quiet and shy person. Usually with both genders, but with women, that effect is turned up a notch. When it comes to women I do not know, I rarely initiate, make eye contact, or look in their direction, unless they talk to me. If they talk to me, or ask me a question, then I pay attention, make eye contact (not too much though), and nod along. However, in my experience, many women do not initiate, do not ask questions, and rarely engage. As a result, between me and them, there is usually silence. Now what infuriates me a lot, is when these same women, who have not spoken a single word, or even attempted to start a conversation with me, complain to my male friends or family that I was somehow \"socially awkward\" with them. This really pisses me off, as I don't think they have any right to complain about my socially awkwardness when they haven't even tried to connect me. Like, if they tried to call me and I ignored them (which did not happen at all, they were on the phone the entire time!) then sure, they have a point, and I should learn to be more socially aware. But how can they call me socially awkward when I acted the same exact way as them??! I think it comes from this gendered expectation that the man is supposed to lead or whatever, be charming, be the initiator, which really pisses me off because these women would be the first to complain about gendered expectations. Especially the educated women who have a PhD in a technical field such as Computer Science!\n\nSo I am going to be honest with you, when I first saw the title, I was really pissed off. I wanted to say what is with you women, having this incredibly sexist expectation that men are supposed to be this charming, confident, handsome, funny, intelligent, swoon worthy, guy with a personality like Daniel Radcliffe who looks nerdy but still has that intellectual rizz to him. I am sorry those men aren't socially awkward if they aren't meeting your arbitrary sexist standards. Ask yourself, the standard on which you are judging these men, do you yourself also meet the same standard? Do you actively pursue and initiate conversations with these men? Do you make eye contact? Can you have a third party confirm that? Or do you just stand in the corner, hoping the \"male colleague\" uses some \"common social sense\" and treat you like a lady, that you supposedly are? If you are not applying the same standard, then in my opinion, you don't have the right to make those accusations or complaints. How can you accuse someone of being something when you yourself do the same? That has been my experience with a lot of women calling guys socially awkward. I am sorry, but you can not call someone \"socially awkward\" when you are just as awkward, when you just as much do not initiate, when you just as much use your phone, when you just as much wait for the guy to say hello, etc.\n\nNow, very important point to make here at the end. If a male colleague is doing something to you, purposefully to discredit you, or harm you in anyway, simply on the basis of being a woman, then I can agree that those male colleagues should behave better. If these guys are purposefully avoiding you, not because they are shy or scared, but they think you are beneath them or whatever, then I condemn those actions. But if they are shy, insecure, etc., those things are involuntary feelings, instead of making upsetting remarks about them, you should feel bad for them and find ways to improve the communication that upholds mutual respect. And we haven't even talked about the decidability factor of social awkwardness (on a mathematical logic or computer science level, this is your specialization right?). Is the label of social awkwardness decidable or computable? \n\nI don't feel like I have enough information to make a judgmental call.",

When I came to north America though everyone's been telling me things that I can't do or say to women. (Eg. Dont talk to first year girls, dont stare at them when you are talking, make sure you ask for their pronouns first...etc) I started getting nervous whenever I talk to girls in my class because I have to constantly think if I said or did anything wrong. (Also whenever I do that I look away as well. So I can think and also when you start thinking if u are staring people in the eyes you can't stop) Then because it is such a draining thing to do it I just stopped initiating conversations.\n\nAlso, I might be able to talk pretty well during a conversation if we are facing the same direction instead of face to face.

However, I'd argue that in today's age, most people are socially awkward regardless. I try to be proactive, patient and empathic. I don't judge them and I let them slowly \"let their guard down\" while not waiting for validation cues that they like and/or accept me. Some people will, some people won't.\n\nI hope I don't offend when I say that not being able to adapt to different social situations is considered \"socially awkward\".

I\u2019m a female as well. I also have Asperger\u2019s. If they are outright friendly to every male and only treat women and girls poorly, that is not a good environment to be in. \n\nI remember I couldn\u2019t understand if a man was socially strange or was misogynistic. That is until I observed his behavior with other women. The men didn\u2019t fire him when he crossed the line with women either but swiftly fired women even for disagreeing with them. This is not an issue of socializing. \n\nFrom childhood into adulthood I have always been around mostly males especially as a child being in advanced classes. \n\nMy partner now is pretty quiet. Even his family, friends, and colleagues say the same and they all know him to be kind just as I do. He is helpful, and a team player. \n\nI always have to remind people that just because more women have more options now, doesn\u2019t mean than all men suddenly changed their perspectives. Unless these men who are this way do the work to adapt and be better, others will always encounter them. \n\nWithin the US, women only received so many civil rights and \u201cprivileges\u201d to be aegay respected person, within the last 50-60 years. Think of the men who were alive then and the younger generations now. If their fathers and grandfathers, uncles, cousins, local store owners etc they encounter have always interacted with women in a less than healthy way, that didn\u2019t just go away. \n\nI was once in a quick meeting at a table of investors and VPs. I\u2019m a beautiful woman and was the only woman. When we first arrived this douche came my way with a smirk of lust (girlies know what I mean), leaned over and told me I had beautiful eyelashes, then handed me his business card. I felt it was inappropriate but because I struggle with social cues often, I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a bad as I thought it was\u2026UNTIL, the founder/principal of the private equity company that I was there with (I\u2019ll call him Mike) was at the head of the table, and made a point to introduce me to the others as one of their investors. I am not. The company has a multi-billion dollar portfolio and had leverage over the other company at the table. The look on the faces of some of the men was priceless including the previously mentioned douchebag. \n\nI will NEVER forget what Mike did. He made me big in a room where I was immediately made to feel small. \n\nI ramble all of this information to you to simply state that your environment is toxic. Although it is clear that this behavior is normal, normalcy does not equate to healthy and never will. Imagine fathers who do this in home with their daughters, mine did and no amount of financial status that he secured for our family or gifts can ever cover the way he treated me and disregarded me as a human being. I don\u2019t hold it over his head but I certainly don\u2019t turn a blind eye. \n\nSome might reply to say I\u2019m jaded or bitter, but really I just don\u2019t care to give slack to people who choose to stay content in having poor behavior rather than self-reflect and become better. \n\nIf you cannot produce effectively where you are, that is your work and is a direct impact on your livelihood. You\u2019ll need counseling that you\u2019ll pay for to recover from this so you can regain the confidence and freedom to excel in your next space. \n\nFind a solution to this, think it through but find a solution where you can thrive.",

(Regardless of quiz/midterm score).\n2. Attend lectures, do the midterm and final. Get graded like every other class.\n\nNeedless to say, he believed in the hands-on approach. The lab was ridiculously hard and during that time all I did was go to the lab to work on the project with friends, and eat/sleep/work, every other class was deprioritized. I've never put so much concentrated time and attention on anything for a single class before, and I've done my share of stupid shit as a student (like finishing one entire quarter's coursework over the course of 1 week).\n\nThen there were some kids in class that somehow... somehow knew everything. These guys would just hang out in the lab and play video games, and occasionally help other kids out with blockers when the TA was too busy. (Who the hell knew how to use an Assembly debugger? They did!) Ironically, some of my friends were given the opportunity to TA the next class instead of those super-geniuses - I assume that putting in the effort was what the professor thought would be best.\n\nSometimes, some people just don't have to sweat to get the work done. I had another friend who just absorbed almost all the material from many classes just by listening in. Finals prep week was the easiest for him because he was literally reviewing materials (like one watches John Wick 1 before watching John Wick 2).\n\nDon't stress it, just do what you can.",

I would ask myself \"what was the point of doing so much work outside of school to see your friends in much easier majors doing much better\". For me I thought I had to change majors in order to contend for a lot of these jobs however this is false. One thing a lot of CS majors don't understand is your problem solving skills aare UNIVERSAL a lot of the skills you learn throughout your degree can also be used in finance, and your coding knowledge will also give you an edge over many financial analysts. I think (and this goes for everyone) rather than mindlessly completing classes and regurgitating the same capstone project or same algo projects.  Learn skills that have nothing to do with CS and then find ways to apply CS to it. It is very difficult for a lot of people to find jobs because this field of study is PROBLEM SOLVING and the only way to thrive is by solving problems that haven't been solved. The market is bad yes, however it has been bad before! The ones who are able to not complain and get the work done will always be the ones with a job :)",

You're not affected by the market, and it constantly changes. Stop trying to find excuses. GPA and grades don't matter unless you plan on doing extra stuff at your school that requires a high GPA.

            "Here's my tip: learn to network. I got my internships and full-time offers mostly because I made friends with students who had great internships, and they were able to refer me to the companies. \n\nThe interviews for companies where I had referrals almost never required Leetcode, and that let me spend more time on projects, especially team projects that let me meet more students who could give me referrals and career advice.",

            "I pretty much refuse to do Leetcode for any company that tries to make me do it.  If my years of experience with verifiable references and a portfolio where I can sit down and talk shop with anybody who wants to verify my knowledge isn't good enough, then we're not a good fit.  There are still some places that haven't fallen into the FAANG \"monkey see, monkey do\" ways of doing interviews, but you'll have to dig deep to find them.

            "Here\u2019a my advice as a new grad who is about to start working as a software engineer. Leetcode is important, it prepares you for interviews and you should absolutely use it to maximaze your chances of landing a job out of college. \n\nThat being said, don\u2019t make Leetcode your life. Enjoy you\u2019re time at school and use it to learn as much as you can. Our field is so broad that it would be a shame if you don\u2019t use this valuable time to explore many interesting topics. This can be achieved through taking interesting electives, taking up research positions, doing well in your classes. It\u2019s all about balance!\n\nDon\u2019t end up as one if those people who can ace leetcode hards but can\u2019t remember how computers work at a fundamental level, or all the other essentials taught in school. Then again, that\u2019s just my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own :)",
            "1. You haven't even graduated yet. Not sure you're in a position to be giving sage advice, mate. Not trying to offend, just calling it as I see it.\n2. It's early February. Yes, some people will have jobs in hand for after graduating already, but not everyone will. My experience is, a very large number of people, if not even the majority, will not have a job in hand yet. Keep applying and interviewing, there's nothing to panic about. Believe me, it took until May for me to lock down a job before my graduation in June when I was graduating, and that's not uncommon. It gets frustrating, it's a lot of work, and most of it you might not even hear back on (outside of automated \"your application was received\" emails), but keep chipping away at it.",

I switched.\n\nNeither required leetcode, it was more about my personality and my history/experience.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that you shouldn't practice leetcode. I'm just saying that working on your soft skills, getting an internship, and keeping an up to date/interesting resume and LinkedIn are just as important, if not more.",
