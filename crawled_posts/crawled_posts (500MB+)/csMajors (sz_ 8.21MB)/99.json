        "selftext": "So I've seen a lot of posts recently asking how to get good at leetcode. I see countless posts from beginners who don't know how to start and panic at not being able to solve easies despite taking a ds&a course. I see posts from those who have done 200+ questions but still can't reliably solve mediums on their own. As someone who recently went through the journey of going from zero DS&A knowledge to interview-ready in 4 months. I figured I'd write a step-by-step guide of what I did to help everyone out. This post is not intended to be a philosophical discussion on whether leetcode is appropriate for interviews, this will be an actionable guide with concrete steps that you can follow.\n\n**Who am I and why you should listen to me:**\n\nI have to preface this guide with my background so you can trust that I know what I'm talking about. I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate from a Canadian university who self-studied computer science and web development and landed a software engineer role. Part of this self-study process involved learning DS&A and leetcode which took 4 months by studying 3-4 hours a day, 6 days a week. At the start of my journey, I couldn't even solve easies. After these 4 months, I'm now able to consistently (90% of problems) solve mediums in ~20 minutes and hards in ~35 minutes on my own. I also usually solve OAs (tiktok, SIG, IMC, blackrock, pure storage, c3 ai, cisco, tower research) with 100% test cases, and scored 822 on my one codesignal gca attempt (not the best, ran out of time debugging q3 lol). I've done 6 leetcode questions during onsite interviews and have optimally solved all of them. I'm not trying to flex, just trying to show that what I'm saying is credible.\n\n**My overall strategy:**\n\nAs a preface, the goal of this guide is to deeply understand the techniques needed to solve LC problems at an abstract level and implement your abstract solution quickly. My approach is based off how technical material is taught in university courses. What they do is teach a strategy/technique at an abstract level, walk through solving guided example problems using that strategy, have students practice through assignments and practice finals, then apply what you've learned on the actual exams. My overall approach to learning is breadth -> depth -> breadth. First learning what you\u2019ll be learning (breadth), learning those specific topics with a full and deep understanding (depth), then tying the specific topics back into the big picture and how they relate to each other (breadth). I also write summary notes after I read through a topic, I find this lets me take all the information and form a generalized abstraction of the topic along with critical specifics, and if I\u2019m able to write a page of well-structured notes using my own understanding of what I just learned then that means I understand the topic deeply. I also re-read these notes at the end of each of the 4 steps for spaced-repetition effects or when I need to jog my memory since re-reading my own written notes takes me back to the mental state I was in when I first wrote them.\n\n**Step 1: Learn Python (or Java or C++):**\n\nThe first step is to get familiar with your programming language of choice. I chose Python and recommend you do the same if you have time, but if you\u2019re in a rush then just use whatever you\u2019re familiar with as long as it\u2019s acceptable in coding interviews (Python, Java, C++). Python is the least verbose language and most similar to plain pseudo code, and in a timed test every minute counts. It lets you spend less time on implementation and more time on figuring out the abstract algorithm which is where the bottleneck is for coding interviews. You need to be familiar with a language before you can learn DS&A so you can concurrently learn the language implementations of data structures and algorithms. To learn Python I just went through the W3 Schools\u2019 guide on syntax and overall language specs (dynamic typing, garbage collection, etc.). The official docs are good as well but they have a lot of stuff that you don\u2019t need for coding interviews. I also took notes on the syntax (6 pages). This step took me 10 hours split across 3 days.\n\n**Step 2: Learn DS&A:**\n\nWith DS&A you need to learn how each data structure and algorithm works deeply at an abstract level. For me this meant visualizing a gif of the algorithm in my head, learning the time space complexities of operations the DS/A supports and why they are what they are, learning how the DS/A handles edge cases, and writing an implementation in Python. The resource I used was the interactive ebook PythonDS3 by Runestone Academy. It\u2019s full of word explanations, diagrams, and live code in an editor that you can play around with. It first explains each DS/A at an abstract level, then shows you the Python implementation. I would go through a page/sub-section, think about the concepts deeply and piece everything together in my head, then write a page of notes on that topic. As a preface, I used Tech Interview Handbook\u2019s study plan to figure out which topics are important and I need to take notes on, and which are not which I would only read. I also used Tech Interview Handbook\u2019s topic-by-topic cheatsheet to confirm time and space complexities and how the DS/A is used in problems. This step took me 6 weeks, and I tried to finish 1 subsection per day. Each subsection only takes 30 minutes to read, but I would reread, think deeply about what I read, google stuff I didn\u2019t understand, sometimes watch a youtube video if I still didn\u2019t understand it fully, and write my summary notes which all took about 3 hours per subsection.\n\n**Step 3: Learn Leetcode techniques/strategies (patterns):**\n\nSo here is the most important step that I see a lot of people get wrong. People tend to jump straight into practicing leetcode problems and end up having to do 300+ problems to get interview-ready. The issue with this is that LC problems are designed with particular established strategy in mind, and if you\u2019re trying to learn the strategy from particular problems then that\u2019s very inefficient. This would be like in calculus, trying to learn the chain rule, fundamental theorem, monotonic convergence by jumping into doing calculus practice finals, or in linear algebra, trying to learn matrix operations, finding eigenvalues, or SVD decomposition by jumping into doing linear algebra finals. You can clearly see how inefficient this approach is. Furthermore, many of these strategies came from breakthrough papers in computer science that took PhDs to come up with and have many pages of rigorous proof. Trying to come up with these strategies from scratch or induction from LC problems would require you to be a genius. Now you see why so many people get stuck at this step, they\u2019re doing it completely wrong. The resource I used for this is Grokking the Coding Interview and Grokking Dynamic Programming by Design Gurus and Educative.io (no affiliations). These courses are paid but the information is truly worth the money, as it\u2019s by far the best resource I\u2019ve found for this step and the time and energy you\u2019ll save compared to using other resources is well-worth it. If you really can\u2019t afford it then I\u2019ve heard good things about Leetcode Explore cards. There\u2019s also a Hackernoon article on coding interview patterns that summarizes the patterns taught in Grokking, but they\u2019re pretty succinct and don\u2019t offer the depth of information that I think you need. You could pair that with the CSES Competitive Programmer's Handbook to pick out and learn the specific strategies covered by Grokking. I basically used this the same way as with DS&A. For each pattern, I read the primer, read the solutions to the first few problems, tried to solve a few of the later problems in my head abstractly (5-10 minutes of thinking) using the strategy taught in the first few problems, then read the remaining problems (each pattern has 5-14 example problems). Once I finished a pattern, I would piece together the information into an abstract strategy, the situations in which that strategy can be used, what makes the strategy more/less efficient compared to other options, common characteristics in problems where I should consider this strategy, along with its edge cases and time/space complexity, and write down my page of notes. This is probably the most difficult step of the whole plan as you\u2019ll be flexing your brain for abstract thinking and logical reasoning. It'll likely be very difficult to think that hard but you\u2019ll develop a very strong foundation for solving LC problems later so it\u2019s well-worth the mental pain. I would try to aim for fully learning 1 strategy per day which took anywhere from 3-5 hours and there\u2019s around 24 strategies total (Grokking the Coding Interview + Grokking Dynamic Programming). For dynamic programming, there\u2019s a section in Grokking the Coding Interview but I found it confusing and it only contains 1 DP strategy, so I recommend skipping that one and once you\u2019re done GTCI start Grokking Dynamic Programming which explains that strategy better and also has 5 more strategies.\n\n**Step 4: Practice**\n\nAt this step, you should know your Python syntax, understand DS&A, understand the ins and outs of each strategy and should be able to come up with the solution in your head to most LC easy\u2019s in 5 minutes and mediums in 10 minutes. The point of this stage is to actually practice the full problem from prompt to code and practice talking out loud (or whisper if you need to be quiet) like you would in an interview. The resource I recommend is Grind 75 grouped by weeks with 70-100 questions total. Go through each question and try to solve it on leetcode. Don\u2019t look at the solution until you\u2019re stuck for 30 minutes, meaning you haven\u2019t made any progress in your logic for 30 minutes, making logical reasoning steps in your head doesn\u2019t count as being stuck. To actually solve a problem, read the prompt, visuals, examples, and input ranges. Start with a brute force and solve how you would do it intuitively, typically this means start on element 0 and perform steps until you reach a solution. Then make logical deductions based on what you\u2019ve been given in the prompt and how your brute force looks (careful, the brute force might be a red herring to the actual optimized solution). Use your logical deductions and match onto a few potential strategies that you think have a high chance of working and investigate how each of those strategies could be used to solve the problem. Sometimes you'll need to combine strategies in series or parallel. If you can\u2019t identify any, just try each of the 24 strategies one by one in your head, even if this fails it\u2019s all good practice for your logical reasoning skills. You can think of the problem solving process as a graph traversal, where you have your starting state as one node and your goal state as another node. You can add strategies as edges onto your starting node to transform the starting state into a new state. Check if the new state is your goal, if not then add another strategy either onto your new state or your original state and repeat until you reach the goal. Once you have the optimal solution in your head, write down your algorithm in comments above the function in 2-4 lines along with the time and space complexity. Writing the algorithm down takes me a minute, but it saves me 5-10 minutes during my implementation as it lets me focus purely on implementing my algorithm into code by referring to the text when I get confused without having to think \u201cwhat was my algorithm doing at this step again?\u201d. Initially, you\u2019ll probably be slow at implementing the algorithm in code and run into a bunch of Python syntax errors. I\u2019ve spent hours debugging my code in single questions at the start, it\u2019s normal and just use this to learn the quirks of Python. After implementing, I check over my code once for silly mistakes and then run through it with one of the example test cases line-by-line, keeping all the variables in my head (use comments if needed). Then I submit and fix my code if the submission failed. Once the submission passes I go look at the solution (either official or in the comments), try to find \u201ceasy-to-understand\u201d and ignore the one liners. If I still don\u2019t understand the algorithm I\u2019ll watch the Neetcode video for it then try to implement it. After around 20 easy\u2019s I started solving them (getting the first optimized code solution which may have syntax bugs) in 15 minutes. After the first 20 mediums I started solving them in 30 minutes. Hards are usually a combination of strategies and some (mostly greedy algorithms) you just need to memorize but there aren't too many and so I can usually solve them in 40 minutes right from my first hard unless I just don\u2019t know the trick. I did 2-4 problems a day (2-5 hours daily) until I hit 50 problems and that was when I felt confident I could solve 80% of the problems on my own in a reasonable time and the remaining problems if I was given a hint or two which is more than interview-ready.\n\n**Bonus step: Maintain your skills:**\n\nGiven how common switching jobs is in SWE due to either increasing TC or layoffs/pip/firing, and how interviews in SWE are bottlenecked by LC problems, it makes sense to try to retain your knowledge such that you only need a week or two to prep the next time you interview. I\u2019m planning on doing 1-2 LC problems per week on Sundays which I feel like after all this prep to build a strong foundation and deeply understand the material should be enough to retain my knowledge. My solving speed will probably drop, but I estimate next time I prep I\u2019ll only need to review my notes and do 30 LC questions to get me interview-ready. This will probably only take 2 weeks time instead of months. 1-2 questions per week will only take 1-2 hours per week which is nothing for the reward you get by staying near interview-ready. I\u2019ll have to try it out to see if this is enough, but it seems like it should be.\n\nAnd that's the end. If you made it this far, try implementing these steps and let me know how it goes. I hope you find similar success that I have found following these steps. If this guide has helped you in your journey and you want to support me, I'm always taking referrals (DM me).

            "It didn't, it's just the internet doing what it does best and magnifying a loud minority of people. In this case, all the nerds at top schools are playing games trying to get hired by big tech when in reality the prospects of the software industry are very good in pretty much any city or company. Seriously, if you \"grind\" leetcode all day just to get a chance at a big tech company, be careful what you wish for because it is not the promised land.\n\nThen of course we have more and more people getting into the field because they heard it was a gold rush. If you're doing CS just for the money that is risky. Meanwhile, regular companies fight over \"senior\" devs on LinkedIn. So I'd say it's both a new glut of devs while companies refuse to settle for the average dev. Anyway, as long as you don't browse CS subreddits and communities I believe your life will be much better because you won't be worried about keeping up with the Johnsons at Facebook (or Google, or MS, or whatever). It's just not worth the stress and most big tech companies are toxic anyway.",

            "I've never touched leetcode. I have applied for three jobs in my life, and got into two of them (both as a software engineer).\n\nBeing good at coding problems does not make you a good software engineer. Teamwork, organisation, knowing your tooling, and knowing how to keep a maintainable code base are also very important.\n\nMost people here seem to forget this and it is a small group of people that seem to obsess over this kind of stuff, or want to work in very specific places, who give this view to everyone else.\n\nJust know your stuff, be confident in making good decisions (not cocky), and show you have an ability to adapt and learn, and what will be will be. Every interview I did I went in with that mindset. It is about the job wanting what I can provide them, as much as it is what they can provide me. \n\nFor the rest of it, just ignore scaremongering from competitive behaviour. Just be the the best you can be and you will be fine.\n\nLet's face this. Anyone who disagrees with this either works in a niche role, one of the \"big tech\" companies that is competitive, or just doesn't know what the majority of businesses are looking for in developers.\n\nTL;DR don't let what others say spread FUD and make you nervous. Just concentrate on being a good well-rounded candidate and what will be will be. If anything, concentrating on stuff like Leetcode only just does you less favours if you don't show you have other skills that you can utilize your knowledge with.",

You went from failing out of college to graduating with a degree in your hand.

            "Before I say anything I just want to note that **everyone can handle different things** and I think as long as you're trying your best while also pushing yourself to improve then you're doing a good job.\n\nFor me (I'm a junior as well but I'm currently on a gap year to work), I feel like I can balance my life relatively well (AT MOST TIMES- there are times where I do give myself too much). During the school year I was able to TA, work part time doing CS stuff, train for sports, and study for my classes (I used to do research too but then I realized it was too much work, it was unpaid since it was for class credit, and I felt like my PI basically just viewed me as free labor). I don't have a perfect system for all the things that I do, but I do feel like each semester I can handle them better and better and have lots of time left to still relax using time management and laser focus (I disabled notifications on my phone except calls and text so I see nothing from Discord, Messenger, Reddit, etc... so I can focus on the work that I'm doing).  Part of it for me was a lot of trial and error to figure out what works for me, and I can recognize if something isn't working fast enough and I try to change it as soon as possible.\n\nTo get good grades, I take really good notes and study everyday. If I don't get a topic, I study a bit after class to make sure I do get it. I do not hold it off until closer to the exam. That way, when the exam comes around all I need to do is go over my quizlet/study guides.\n\nI DO NOT grind Leetcode to practice for coding interviews (though I will look at some problems from time to time if someone tells me about an interesting one- I'd say I've done \\~20 leetcode problems in the entirety of college).  I've been able to still get internships without grinding Leetcode, but just because I did not grind Leetcode doesn't mean I wasn't preparing in other ways. I feel like being a TA really helped with my problem solving and explanation skills and working a part-time CS internship helped me become a better programmer. Grinding Leetcode could work, but I highly suggest looking into alternatives that are a better use of your time and could make you a stronger problem solver\n\nApplying to internships and interviewing was something that I'm definitely still figuring out to balance but I have a much better hold of than before. During my sophomore year last year, I pushed myself too much and took every opportunity that I could find and ended up doing 11 interviews in the span of 2 days during a conference which I completely passed out from afterwards in the hallway of the conference building (leaning against a wall). This year though I have a much better handle of my time and scheduling interviews by spacing them out enough. I scheduled high priority interviews first so once I got the job from one of them I cancelled the rest of my interviews to not stress myself out (for some people, scheduling high priority interviews last works better for them because they want to use other interviews as practice/have more time to practice. Everyone has their own thing that works for them).\n\nAs for knowing what I want to do in CS, I'm still exploring :) and I think that's totally fine. In fact, I think I'll still be exploring even after I graduate.\n\nSorry for the really really long write up!

I sleep 6 hours instead 8. I aim for B+\u2019s in classes instead of A\u2019s at an already demanding school (from experience, i\u2019ve learned that GPA matters a lot less than actual experience in our field, unless you\u2019re going to grad school).

            "Everybody's different, but here's what worked for me:\n\nFirst, take a deep breath and remember that unless you're not going to be satisfied with anything but a FAANG/unicorn job, you don't need to be hyperfocused on making yourself as hireable as possible all the time.  That's not to say you shouldn't still try for those jobs, but there are plenty of places you can get a respectable, well-paying job if you haven't been leetcode grinding.  And remember that even though it certainly doesn't feel like it, there's a lot of time left to find opportunities before you graduate. \n\nFigure out what your priorities are and manage your time accordingly.  For me that was (in general) school > work > having a social life > a research project I was working on > a club I was active in > interview prep.  I felt comfortable not spending as much effort on interview prep because I was lucky enough to have a part time job that I felt fairly confident would give me an offer when I graduated and I had already decided that even though I was going to apply for FAANG, I was OK with not ending up there.  I really recommend making sure you do what you can to carve out at least some time each week to spend with friends and decompress, because it will make you a lot more productive the rest of the time.",
            "I\u2019m very much in the same boat, especially this semester. I\u2019m trying to finish my BS and masters in 4 years, so I\u2019ve continuously been taking more courses to finish earlier too.\n\n- I front loaded a lot of my harder courses earlier on in my degree. DS&A classes were done sophomore year, stuff like stats and numerical methods I finished off freshman year, this year I\u2019m finishing my BS requirements with just electives, so I can kinda pick the difficulty of my semester\n- My only extracurricular involvement this year is TAing an algorithms class for around 10 hours a week. In past years and semesters I tried research, I was in a club or two. My social involvement is mostly meeting other people in the same boat as me and collectively bitching about life \n- Applying for internships is honestly like another class. I take one day a week and spend all my time applying to as many places I can find, doing CTCI problems, etc. This summer, I was interning at a large post-IPO startup (~1500 employees), spent my evenings after dinner doing hackerrank and leetcode problems to the best of my ability. My interviewing skills aren\u2019t amazing but they also aren\u2019t horrible, I can solve most problems an interviewer puts in front of me given the time, and I can explain what I\u2019m doing when I\u2019m doing it, the question is will the stress get to me\n- No clue what I actually want to do, I\u2019ll probably end up applying for and getting a backend role because that\u2019s what I have experience in\n- I don\u2019t really have projects beyond what I did at internships or clubs, and that has been mostly fine (I have like 1-2 projects listed on my resume that are pretty small, maybe 1-2 weeks of work total)\n\nMost of all, it\u2019s time management. If you\u2019re trying to do all of this in the recruiting semester you\u2019ll get burned out, but if you plan around it (work on projects over winter and spring break, the summer, do leetcode over breaks, prep for classes over breaks) it makes life easier. \n\n\nI have ~5 technical rounds in the upcoming week and a half, I get 8 hours of sleep a night religiously, and work enough to pay my own rent (albeit in a relatively cheap university town). It\u2019s possible to do well even though the recruiting process is difficult, just gotta plan around it I guess",
            "Not great. I'm doing 18 credit hours, working 2 part time jobs on campus as a TA and research assistant and I'm the president of a club. Time management is extremely important but I don't think my current schedule is sustainable. Even though I'm getting a lot of experience and it's good resume, it's not good for my mental health. At some point being proactive and a diligent student turns into you stretching yourself too thin, which is what I've done. And I urge you to please take it easy unless you are prepared to go through the meat grinder of academia and life.",
            "It's a big lesson but time management. \n\nIf you have a chapter due by the end of the week, break it down into 7 sections with notes. \n\nIf you have a coding project for a class that's due in a week or two, work on it a little each day. \n\nAnd most importantly, don't overwhelm yourself. There will be days you need to push a bit more and you'll be tired at the end, but take some time for yourself too. Know your limits, push past them a little if you can, and then take a break. \n\nLao Tzu: \"Fill your bowl to the brim\nand it will spill.\nKeep sharpening your knife\nand it will blunt.\nChase after money and security\nand your heart will never unclench.\nCare about people's approval\nand you will be their prisoner. **Do your work, then step back.\nThe only path to serenity.** \u201d\n\n It's tough man, but take evaluation, push your limits (but not to exhaustion).",
            "I never did purely personal projects, which helped. Instead I did a little extra work on and refined class projects, ensuring I could talk intelligently and in depth about them in an interview. I also wasn't afraid to list and use the projects I did during my internship, where I was lucky enough to get \"real\" work instead of the typical (stupid) intern busywork.\n\n\nAlso, once I got an internship for the summer after junior year, that WAS my part time job, and it got extended pretty much indefinitely, which also helped. The internship really solidified my sense of what I want to ultimately do in CS (oddly enough, I want to be a product manager eventually, not a coder!).\n\n\nAnd even with all that, extracurriculars were a no-go for me, since it was either that stuff or spend time with my wife. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_\\/\u00af",

I paid for that for nearly a year and half with a mild generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nMy suggestion is that if you\u2019re young, hell even if you\u2019re older don\u2019t try to cram everything in, prioritize what you can and do the rest later. This in and of itself is great practice for the real world when you do get a job. \n\nAn additional note is that I would suggest learning how to articulate your problem solving process, this can really help to make or break your interviewing process as well.",

            "It might be better to explain your thoughts on these points and what you've been currently doing so far. What do you think is currently not working for you and why? You already recognize that everyone has their own tactics that work for them but might not work for you. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and hoping to find this magic secret which the thought itself can be very damaging to your approach to making it in this industry.\n\nWith that being said, here are my takes:\n\npoint 1: Ideally class should be review so having to attend class can be optional. I wouldn't focus on good grades solely just make sure you have time for things outside class (extracirriculars/internships/projects/whatever) like others have said get a timer and just run it and when its done mark it down and move on. Work with people who want to get their shit done they may not be your best friends but working with others can be very influential with regards to your own development.\n\npoint 2: I wouldn't focus on this too much, if it fits your schedule then do it otherwise this could be time spent on relaxing/hobbies\n\npoint 3: If you've been networking then this doesn't seem much of a drag. If you do know you're applying to a company that does coding interviews you better be practicing. \n\npoint 4: Since you're in undergrad what I've noticed is that most if not all job positions aren't that specific to your day to day activities, whats more important imo is that you focus on expanding on our skill set and not on fufilling the hard requirements. You can't really know this without actually being in the company but its something that was pretty shocking to me.\n\npoint 5: I mean this isn't that hard to discuss other than if you're budgeting is in the red then if anything you can learn how to budget and ensuring you have some rough number of your disposable income. Gives you lots of freedom to spend on whatever the hell you want.",

Had a bit more time to go to hackathons and try out different fields (mobile, web, etc). I didn't really do side projects after that. If a lecture wasn't mandatory, I stopped going after a while without fail before the halfway point, felt it was a better use of my time to figure things out by myself than half ass going to lecture not really gaining much from it. Junior/senior year I had return offers for internship/fulltime so I only really did leetcode august/september (helped with getting different internship junior year), september was a brutal month with classes and leetcode but it's the only one I was really powering through.

I connected with other CS students, alumni, and tech companies through SHPE and connected with Lyft in the spring of freshman year. During the summer after my freshman year, I worked on a personal website with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, nothing crazy. Used that and LC to get an offer from Lyft. I don't consider myself the best coder, I struggled at Lyft, but I have the connections and the ability to forge new connections that have helped me get to where I am. I ran for a board position for the club I was in and am now in my second term connecting with companies that want to partner with my club expanding my network into industries outside of tech.\n\nThe way I see it, you can get the experience necessary for internships through LC and your classes but having the right connections make things so much easier.

Exceptional people still don't have trouble finding jobs, the best thing you can do for yourself is to make sure you are exceptional as much as possible by attending a top school, building projects in your free time, landing internships, become as prepared as you mentally can handle.\n\nWhat you probably do not realize is everyone's situation is different and their frustrations while depressing to hear about constantly are valid. When most people's parents/grandparents could just work one job and provide for there family or graduate college and be more/less guaranteed a job, it's incredibly frustrating to put in the work and be asked to do even more just to have a *chance* to work.

So why consider life as a race and make ourselves miserable? (I hope I made sense with that analogy)\n\nI guess, keep doing whatever you have to do. Keep learning new things.

Some want a high income to sustain a comfortable lifestyle or to have children.
