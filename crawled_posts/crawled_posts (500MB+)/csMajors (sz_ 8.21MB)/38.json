While the job postings may be down, how many are actually qualified for the jobs out there, or even have realistic expectations? \nI know that when I started working towards IT I was way in over my head and was not going to get a job until I got realistic and did what I needed to ACTUALLY make myself qualified, which I did. Furthermore, i occasionally run into folks that mention to me that they wanna get into IT after I tell them that I work in IT now, and they also are super unqualified and have unrealistic expectations. Not trynna shame them, but they usually have no business in any field like this until they get realistic. I have a feeling that the numbers crowding up each job posting are made up mostly by these folks. \nUnfortunately, things like automation and resume filters are making it way harder for qualified folks to get their resumes in front of a hiring manager. So there\u2019s still an issue with getting a job in general, even for qualified individuals.

Writing code is the least interesting part of it (and if we're being honest, the part that will become more and more automated).\n\nThe real skill is design, and understanding why to do X over Y and in some cases, when. For example if storage is no issue but processing is, you can potentially take a lower complexity higher storage solution, or the inverse in other scenarios. It's determining which data structure to use, or how a tree needs to be traversed.\n\nWriting the code to do all that is only interesting the first time. Learn to love what's behind the curtain of syntax before it's no longer exciting. \n\nTHIS (in my opinion) is the leading cause of \"oops I hate programming\". Everyone is excited to use syntax, but not to write software. When the thrill of \"new\" wares off, you don't have the transferable skills to use later, and you're constantly learning \"new things\" without ever applying past knowledge.

            "Heck yeah, I just passed calc 2 as well, go us!",
            "Congrats!",
            "Yep I passed Calc 2 this semester in first try too and the difficulty is insane compared to Calc 1. There was too much info in Calc 2 that even my professor didn\u2019t have time to teach in steps. I had to look up how to do some of them. :( My friend failed so he had to retake it again sadly.\n\nEdit: My Calc 2 class had an average of 75% before the final exam lol so the professor gave us a little quiz for those who are probably close to failing.",
            "I barely passed Cal 1. Great job \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c",
            "As a math major, Calc 2 was third worst out of all my classes. Truly a massive accomplishment that you should be proud of.",

            "Fuck Calc 2,3 and 4",
            "I've said it before and I'll say it again, I would legit drop out of school if they told me I'd have to take calc 2 again. HELLLLLL no.",
            "I failed calc2, 3 times. Enjoy this fucking victory. That's fucking awesome!!! I almost nearly cried when I passed. Fuck calc 2. Theoretics are awesome but those exams fuck you like a donkey.",
            "Congrats!! I am happy for you! \ud83c\udf89 Will you be taking calc3 ?",
            "Me too!!! I feel the exact same way. I had problems remembering all the convergence tests and how to choose to use them correctly",
            "Congratulations! So happy for you",
            "It took me 2 tries to pass calc 2 with a C. Congrats bro",
            "2 years out of college and I still remember the nightmare that Calc 2 was. If you\u2019re passing your first time at it, double congrats! :)"
