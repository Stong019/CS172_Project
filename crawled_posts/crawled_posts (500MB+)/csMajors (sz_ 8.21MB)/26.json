            "Background / Stats / Demographics:Had no real prior internships (Barring research w/ a prof)\n\nHad  some pretty unique personal projects. (I did not follow any tutorials  and wrote open source software that some quantitative traders use)\n\nMiddling GPA: 3.3 | (But 3.6 / 3.7 average past two years (really bad first year))\n\nDouble Major: CS / Econ\n\nU.S. Citizen | White Man FGLI\n\nHow I did it:\n\nNetworked p aggressively with alumnus on LinkedIn, got referrals, and practiced mock interviews.Started  grinding Leetcode and DS&A in August. This is very unfortunate as I  had a decent chunk of OAs / Interviews at FAANG+ in August / September!  (Had no prior exposure, the discrete math / algos courses at my school  are all proof-based). Now: LC Questions 250+. Codesignal GCF score: 541.\n\nMy comments:\n\nThis  internship search was incredibly grueling. 4 hours spent searching a  day. I was NOT picky with where I interned this summer at all, I had  interviews with companies ranging from FAANG+ to companies paying 17/hr  for embedded systems devs in the middle of Ohio. I mainly targeted firms  that had a high tangible impact (Anduril, Palantir, Manufacturing  Companies, Automotive manufacturers), and Financial Firms that use  quantitative methods (Some HFs, big asset managers/banks).\n\nHowever, I have landed as a SWE / Quant Dev intern at a large asset management firm. (Think PIMCO, Fidelity, M.S., etc.)\n\nIf  I didn't love CS I would've given up and switched to S&T or Equity  Research. (School is a target for that and IB but too late for IB lol),  but I was in the interview for S&T at a major firm and I realized I  desperately did not want to do it.\n\nI  struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts during this process. I  gave myself wholly to studying, practicing leetcode, working on my  projects, and interviewing/applying. Funnily enough I found out I  actually love solving leetcode problems! I'm gonna keep doing it, Very  happy the internship process is done though :).\n\nI  think the trick to this process is to be resilient and truly love the  field. If you're in CS for the money I would recommend you switch to  finance / pre-med if you are able, many CS students at my school did so  (since we're a target) and they seem pretty happy with their internships  next summer.\n\nI was happy to  possibly take a 17/hr job in Ohio because I wanted to gain experience,  not because I craved the money. (And I don't have a cushion either, I  come from a poor family). If you internalize that and realize that the  world doesn't owe you anything, you'll be ok :).\n\nI hope you all get internships you're happy with, and never quit :).\n\nFeel free to DM for questions / specifics.",

I think there is already [a wonderful post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/mfx8oq/womens_experience_in_cs/) about all the facts pertaining this, I wanted to give a bit of a personal point of view.\n\nThe title is pure satire and as sarcastic as it can be. If you do read what I wrote, you will see my experience is rather: How I got in *despite* being a girl.\n\nI don't.. expect to post this to have my \"life\" deconstructed into arguments you can debunk. You can make whatever you want of what I'm about to say, but **please stay respectful.**\n\nIt's a \\[very\\] long post, but I hope it helps bring a new perspective to some. I guess I'll add some TLDR at the bottom for the normal people that won't read the freaking essay-length post I wrote. I got a bit carried away, sorry :v\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI started playing with computers when I was 3 or 4. Apparently, my parents were impressed with how quickly I understood how to get around user interfaces, but it might've just been something that any young kid fiddling around the computer at that age could figure out.\n\nY'all, you don't know how often I begged my parents for \"magnetix\" construction toys (but got [this](http://www.richardmanvillestudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ELLO_PLAYSET.jpg) instead), hot wheels (but got a barbie RC car), etc. Honorable mention to what my parents gave me when I asked for a skateboard bc [it's fucking hilarious](https://pixl.varagesale.com/http://s3.amazonaws.com/hopshop-image-store-production/28559490/aa7ed5364ab0f3b16be47c60cc8fe9ab.jpg?_ver=large_uploader_thumbnail&w=640&h=640&fit=crop&s=06af8d05bb404641b4c6042e3fb77816).\n\nDuring my teenage years, I started getting into things like animation with Flash Player (rip Flash) and generally became a lot more knowledgeable than my friends at knowing how computers work, but I learnt that sharing that passion with my female counterparts would often be met with \"meh\"s, as opposed to if I'd gotten into makeup art or drawing. For a while, my guy friends actually liked it when I told them about programming \"games\" in excel(!!), but that was until everyone started wanting to date each other, and suddenly my hobbies were seen as \"not feminine\" - wanting to fit in, I eventually just took to keeping these things to myself.\n\nMy parents occasionally praised that I was \"really good at computers\", but that was about it. Where I came to get really mad was when my cousin (who was my age) came to stay at our house for the summer, and my parents sent him to science camp while I was sent to art camp (I wasn't asked which I'd prefer).\n\nBy the time I was 16 and was looking for a summer job, I knew my way really, really well around computers and really enjoyed this, so when one of my friends told me that his work was looking for someone to work at the computer sales department, I was ecstatic and went to interview. I was asked veery general knowledge questions about computer parts/electronics, and I immediately answered correctly to every single one of them. I was immediately hired on the spot for that position.\n\nWorking there, I didn't really understand why people kept asking me \"*honey, how do you know all this stuff about computers?\",* \"*did your dad teach you all of this?*\", and, my favourite, \"*would you mind if I got a second opinion on this from your colleague over there?\".* Said colleague who often shared shifts with me, often came to work high and his knowledge was so limited about all the products and warranties, that his hesitance when he was called over for a \"second opinion\" made me lose a sale more than once. I asked my friend (who got me the job) if he often was asked for \"second opinions\" during a sale, and he looked pretty confused - he told me I must \"sound shy\" when doing a sales speech. I was super passionate about computers, and clients who didn't \"doubt\" me would often tell me that they adored my service.\n\nOh, yeah, also at that job, still 16, I was sent constant creepy texts about \"my boobs looking hot in my uniform\" by my 29 year old manager. I also found out that he did the same thing to a 15 year old cashier. We were all too scared to call him out, and I don't know what happened to him, but I doubt anyone called him out on it. \n\nThe best part about that job, is that despite me ranking first or second in sales, more than once the \"rumor had it\" that I was only hired because \"a girl hadn't worked there in a while\". Fun fact: out of everyone that worked with me, I'm the only one that pursued studies in CS or anything related, but hell it couldn't be possible that I did well in the interview.\n\nWhen I was graduating high school and told my dad and stepmom that I wanted to study engineering, my stepmom told me that \"I had too soft of a character for that field\", whatever that meant. That was not the only reason why I didn't go into it, but it certainly didn't help with doubting if I had what it took. So I studied something in humanities instead, and unsurprisingly was miserable and envious of the kids in my college who were studying STEM. During that time, I still worked at my college's computer lab, and of course I was the only girl there. I just got used to the fact that, probably for a big part of my life, I would be the only girl in things related to computers.\n\nI finally started studying in STEM, and was so freaking happy and got the best grades I'd ever gotten. But there were a few things in and outside of class that always left me a bit uncomfortable.\n\nMy math professor, who I really liked, during a class about 3D integration, explaining how \"girls in the class would probably not be as good at these, since everyone knew they were not naturally good at spacial awareness\". The irony being that we continue to give girls barbies and boys legoes, and wonder why things like this are said.\n\nMy hardware team, in which I was the only girl, joking about making me the \"secretary\" of the team. Eventually, when the captain of said team asked me out and I explained I was gay, he flat out stopped inviting me to the final reunions of the competition, and I didn't get to finalize the prototype. I did attend the competition, only to be extremely awkwarded out because the others thought that I had bailed out on the team in the last minute.\n\nAnother CS club (only girl there too), where we went out for drinks and I was the only one who was given a \"BJ shot\" in the table (it's an alcoholic drink that's made to make you look like you're giving... you get the point), paid for by the captain (not the same guy as the hardware club). I felt super awkwarded out by this, but being scared about what had happened in the other club, I just shut up and drank it. A comment was passed about how \"I looked like I knew what I was doing\". The whole night I was constantly asked about my personal sex life with my girlfriend, and the comments got more and more invasive as the night went on.\n\nI got a scholarship and did some research internships at the beginning of my bachelor's. My boss in one of my industrial internships was and is to this date the most supportive guy ever, and he set the standards on what treatment to expect from superiors. It's after working for him that I realized how over the years, my input on things were *not* given the same consideration as my male coworkers. \\]\n\nIn quite numerous occasions, and this still happens, I will have an idea I just gave \"reexplained\" to me by a male counterpart. If you're a guy: I very much understand you are trying to be nice, and you're not less my friend if you do [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/it-s-man-s-and-woman-s-world/201603/the-psychology-mansplaining), but it does get annoying overtime.\n\nLast year, I started looking for internships for this summer. Did my CV get read quicker because I'm a girl? Maybe. But my CV is so filled with tons of projects, internships, awards and scholarships, that 5 out of the 7 places I applied to (yes, I only applied to 7 places, including 3 FAANG and the rest being pretty much below FAANG), hit me up. (Fun fact: amazon did *not* get back to me!). I am pleased to say I will be an SWE intern for one of the two hardest FAANG's to get into.\n\nI dare you to tell me that I only got in there because I'm there to fill up a statistic.\n\nI end this by saying, I am aware some of the things I got that I sound like I'm complaining about, like the toys, the art camp, not doing the major I should've done right away, I'm still very privileged to have had. I am still extremely grateful to my loving parents, and I don't blame them for anything, I know this is more of a societal problem.\n\nIf I sound extremely frustrated despite where I ended up, it's because this journey was f\\*king frustrating when it shouldn't have been, simply from the attitude about women in those environments.  And as much as this is a personal story, and I probably went trough a particularly shit time because I got involved in a gazillion CS activities and clubs and jobs, talking with other female friends in my field, we *all* have *multiple* stories like these.\n\nSo if you're wondering why a company would need to put in extra measures to try to get women to apply, go read those statistics, think about stories like the one I just told you, and maybe all of that will help you understand why while women's participation in CS was going up in the first 20 years of the field (+1%/year from 1970 to 1985), the number of women crashed dramatically for the next 30 years after that (-0.5% year from 1985 to 2015).\n\nWe do not want to be treated \"better\" than men in the field, but we also do not want to be treated worse, and this has been the case until now, which is why you can't get that many women in the field. Nobody is saying that workplaces need to have a sharp 50/50 representation of women, but all we ask for is to be *treated* equally. Until then, companies can maybe try to encourage us a little bit by giving a second glance to our CV.\n\nThat was my story. Now, who wants a BJ shot??? :-)\n\nTLDR: considering the *shit* (understatement) I went through because I was a girl interested in compsci among a sea of men, the least companies and colleges can do to make me *stay* in computer science at all is give my resume a second look.\n\nEdit: I did not expect people this many people would respond!!! The amount of positive comments sending love AND the incredibly constructive and healthy conversation that is stemming from this post, gah it makes me so happy y'all don't understand. I don't expect everyone to agree with every word, but even those who are literally just acknowledging the shitty parts without being for AA, this is more than what I could ask for. \n\nIf you're one of those peeps with the negative comments, I didn't forget about you!! I got you a little gift to try to make up for all the wasted time you spent saying negative things on this post.

            "Reads like a horror story.",
            "Girl in CS here, and reading this post actually physically hurt because when I learned how to code as a middle schooler, a bunch of guys in my grade actually bullied me out of ever touching an IDE again until high school & by that point I was definitely behind the rest of my CS-inclined peers (my high school was extremely competitive and offered a lot of college level classes in-house). \n\nI still kick myself for not sticking with it, but when you're 13 and have a new interest, the thing that helps most with sticking with it is having other people in your life who also look like you & do the same thing, to look up to, and the lack of women in CS means that a lot of girls lose interest or get bullied out of it.\n\nBefore the pandemic I actually mentored at quite a few high school hackathons in my state, and more than once I had to step in when a team of guys would tease and taunt all-girl teams by telling them they'd never make a project in 24 hours. Once at one of these hackathons I spent a couple of hours with a particular team of girls who were extremely dejected after TWO teams of boys told them to \"just leave because they didn't belong there\". The kicker? Both of those teams ended up leaving early, and my group of girls who had never coded much before actually ended up with a working hack. \n\nI can't wait for the day when people start raising their little boys and girls without falling in line with gender stereotypes that carry on throughout a lifetime, when girls can be confident and outspoken without getting called bossy or bitchy or having their opinion doubted, and on the flip side, when boys can be told that sometimes their own attitudes are actually hurtful and not the confidence that they think it is.",
            "As a girl who grew up in a culture generally more accepting of female engineers, I know the things I dealt with are minuscule compared to most other girls but since we\u2019re here I might as well share them.\n\nWhenever I say I study cs, I get the \u201chuh. Have you considered _accounting?_ Not saying you\u2019re not smart, but that\u2019s what girls do right harharhar?\u201d I now just tell people I like computers, and they start asking me questions about graphic arts...\n\nIn high school my dad would sign me up for a bunch of competitions since he was good at those back in the day. Then he\u2019d spend the next month sending me links to past contest stats saying \u201chaha look girls are so bad at math/cs/physics, all the winners are guys\u201d. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a girl, why would you sign me up then? He\u2019d shrug and say don\u2019t get butthurt, you girls are so sensitive, I\u2019m just telling you to not get your hopes up. I slowly realized he only bothered with me because I didn\u2019t have a brother. \n\nIn high school I tried going to the cs club which claimed to be beginner friendly. I wasn\u2019t a complete beginner, I\u2019d already been programming for a year. But I was the only girl there, and the guys promptly ignored me. I would try to talk to the club executives and they\u2019d nod and walk around me. One asked if I was in the wrong room. By the end of the meeting the guys were huddled in a corner of the room excitedly chattering about FPS games, I felt so out of place I left. \n\nI grew up in a place generally considered to be eliminated of sexism, and I was lucky to have parents who support education for girls. Yet still, I feel like when I started trying to pursue cs, people constantly tried to remind me that I wouldn\u2019t succeed. I got friendly advice from peers, family, teachers, one therapist, and even a taxi driver, telling me to switch majors. Only I college did I realize the guys didn\u2019t meet quite as much resistance from those around them, and I met many other girls with experiences much worse than mine. This is why I don\u2019t quite believe the narrative that sexism has been solved 20 years ago. And unless all the sexist folk have somehow been concentrated solely around me, I don\u2019t think corporate hiring managers are gonna be magically exempt from this bias.",
            ">Since everyone knew [women] were not naturally good at spatial awareness\n\nGirl, I am SCREAMING with laughter. Okay sure homeboy, my natural lack of spatial awareness really held me back when I hurled my body around on the vault, floor, uneven bars, and beam in competitive gymnastics or when I wheel, snipe and celly on the ice. Holy unbelievable eyeroll, what a statement to make. \n\nMy experience has been very similar to yours. I\u2019m over a decade into my career and little has changed, despite corporate messaging for inclusivity. I\u2019m feeling your frustration loud and clear.\n\nSome of these comments are so disheartening, I really hope that those of you who support women in CS speak up against and educate those who believe this is a non-issue.",
            "I do feel like a lot of people miss the point of affirmative action which is:\n\n\"If we don't tell people to hire people of different races/genders they won't hire them at all\"\n\nAnd that attitude is very much in the tech field. In a workplace with \"bro\" culture why would you hire a woman when you can hire another guy?\n\nIt's pretty messy, but at the end of the day it's a response to people being unfairly looked over. Saying affirmative action is the only reason someone got a position is ludicrous--if anything it's just a foot in the door. I'm happy you scored your position!",
            "this was an extremely well written post about how sexism truly still exists even in 2021. thank you for writing about your experiences, as like you said, there are multiple stories like this.\n\nas a man, it can be hard to understand that generally speaking, we really do have a leg up in terms of STEM education. since our advantage is not really \u201cobvious\u201d, it can feel like special treatment that women receive just *because* they are a woman.\n\none last thing i might add. i\u2019m going to make a bunch of generalizations here, and this is all from personal experience, so please don\u2019t flame me \u2014 i realize this isn\u2019t the case for everyone. \n\nbut i grew up in an asian culture where engineering/medicine/lawyer was pushed very strongly. i can say many of my friends \u2014 male and female \u2014 grew up in the same types of households. generally speaking, i think many CS majors come from this type of household \u2014 at least in my experience. after comparisons with other female friends in this category, we did come up w the conclusion that generally speaking, it was easier to hire a girl than a boy.\n\nthat\u2019s why it could feel unfair \u2014 since there was no difference in what boys and girls value (generally) from where i grew up, it felt like they were getting special treatment. \n\nBUT!! my experience isn\u2019t a universal one!! same with my female friends experience!! like hearing the things you\u2019ve had to go through is crazy. 5 years ago i wouldn\u2019t believe what you\u2019ve said \u2014 but it\u2019s because many people have spoken up about shit like this that it seriously changed how i\u2019ve seen the world.\n\nthank u for sharing. it\u2019s super important n i hope u prosper.",

            "tbh, I just think it\u2019s sad that male candidates think female candidates always get easier interview questions... there are several times that my female peers have gotten difficult graph and DP problems while my male peers were lucky to get TwoSum or some easy string/array manipulation (and of course vise versa).",

            "<3 I've had similar experiences as a queer woman in CS/Big Tech - you're not alone! Though I honestly think affirmative action isn't the way to go. Even its suspected presence is enough to almost encourage the hostility/passive misogyny so deeply rooted in tech culture. But I imagine the culture of tech is a lot harder to change and takes a lot longer, while AA is just an easy bandaid to the issue for now.",
            "Thank you for sharing! I\u2019m sorry the journey has been so frustrating.\n\nI like to think I\u2019ve been lucky: my parents got me the hot wheels I wanted, and I also wanted a skateboard (I think I actually had that exact same one! I didn\u2019t mind it though I thought it was cute).\nI\u2019m a Math and CS major, and I started to love math in middle school. My parents and teachers were nothing but supportive. I didn\u2019t realize I liked computer science until my junior year, and then suddenly I was one of only two girls in the introductory class. Honestly, it never got to me too much: I was the smart^(TM) girl so people didn\u2019t mess with me, and I always got the grade which proved to myself that I could do this.\nFocusing on CS now, I still haven\u2019t faced a ton of struggle. I\u2019ve been super lucky, because I know so many who have horror stories. I think the worst that has happened is that in one class, this dude would fight me on every single thing I said. Nobody else, just me.\n\nIt\u2019s times like that where you realize that even if the struggle isn\u2019t as visible as others, it\u2019s always there. I actually was struggling: not with my grades, but with my sense of confidence. When you\u2019re one of the few girls in a program, the spotlight is on you all the time. When I share an answer, I\u2019m usually right... because I think it over so much in my head, and I\u2019ll only speak if I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m right. I don\u2019t risk being wrong out loud. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anxiety I would have anyway, but there\u2019s a good chance that this fear stems from years of being a girl in STEM.\n\nI have a few guy friends in CS who know that sexism is real, but they have trouble seeing it. I think a lot of it has to do with how girls are pushed out of STEM earlier. Girls are more likely to lose interest in the subjects in middle school, and at least a few years ago this meant a lot of them weren\u2019t even being introduced to computer science.\n\nEven if they do try to study computer science, there\u2019s less support when women struggle with the subject. In my experience, if a man is struggling with CS, it\u2019s simply a matter of needing some more time to grasp the material. If a woman is struggling with CS, it\u2019s taken as proof that women just aren\u2019t cut out for the field. \n\nA piece of anecdotal testimony: I was taking theory of computation, and there were maybe 4 women in this class of 50. Our professor listed the top 5 scores. I was tied for second with a 99, and someone got 100. She revealed to the class that the 100 was earned by a woman. So this means that at least 2 of the 4 women in the class were in the top 5. I can\u2019t help but think that the way we disproportionally outperformed the men in the class shows how, with the current state of things, you\u2019ve gotta work really hard to prove yourself as a woman in CS, and even though mediocre male computer sciencists continue with the field, you\u2019ll see far fewer mediocre female computer scientists.\n\nThe field is hostile, and I really hope hearing these kinds of stories help people realize that. The struggle is not always visible, but it\u2019s there.\n\nThank you OP, and thank you to anyone who read my little rant :)\n\ntl;dr: the struggle is always there. I\u2019m a high-performing female student, and while I haven\u2019t faced as many external sexist conflicts, there is certainly internalized struggle.",

            "I feel your pain. I know the specifics of our situations vary but yeah. Dealing with it all is tiring. I literally had to hide the fact that I was teaching myself how to code since I was 12 from my narcissistic parents so they wouldn't take it away from me. Not that they minded that I could miraculously work any tech in the house and even fix software issues. I've had to fight my entire life for the bare minimum. Food. Education. I ended up having to drop out of Highschool to do community college so I could go to a university. Last summer I missed out on a much better internship because I ran out of food (early covid) and wasn't able to do the mini project test thing because of it. I've always been able to impress my professors with anything practical (much less so exams and stuff) and know my stuff from a lifetime of struggling. I literally own a start-up company (not that it makes money or anything, just a hobby). I hate how hard I need to work to even be taken seriously and the fact that multiple other girls have called me inspiring for just taking them seriously in the field. I usually dismiss stuff as this being as good an industry as any and I don't doubt it's better than a lot but yeah. There's a reason I take it as an insult when someone tells me I *only* managed something by being me. I worked hard for this shit and it shows. Of my entire program only me and a few other students practically breathe CS with how much we work at it while most of the others can't even do their homework without copying it off of eachother. I won't say I don't academically struggle (I'm really bad at exams) but I'm one of the best at actually making stuff that we have. And even then most of the others have their own specific areas of interest. I don't even care about the corporate latter or anything, I ultimately just want to make games that people can connect to and give people what games gave me as a kid. Maybe help teach as a side thing if it helps improve peoples confidenceAs long as I can do that and make enough to afford to live I'm happy.\nRant over.\n\nAlso off topic but it's nice to see other lesbians in the field as well, gives me hope of actually meeting someone with my introverted ass.",

            "I\u2019m a guy in CS and I have definitely noticed this stuff going on. It frustrates me so much hearing the kinds of things that are said to or about women. Even just the culture of the kinds of jokes people make is pretty awful and can make me quite uncomfortable.\n\nCS is for everyone. We really need to be building each other up, not tearing each other down. CS is not something human brains were made for. As far as I can tell, there is no reason why women should have any different success than men. Yet we still act as if women have some wildly different skillset that makes them bad at STEM but amazing at arts, humanities, and \u201chomemaking\u201d. Some women are good at those but so are some men. Let people study what they want.\n\nMy mom wanted to go into CS but was told she couldn\u2019t because she is a women. She ended up going into exercise physiology which she liked but wasn\u2019t what she really wanted to do. She still got a PhD and taught at many universities. I was a research assistant last summer and the person who ran the lab is a woman who did her undergrad in mining engineering and her PhD in epigenetics. My favorite CS teacher at my uni is a woman and organizes a lot of events for women in CS. I even taught some of my friends who are not in CS at all a little bit of Python and they ended up loving it. One of them used Python as a major part of her final project for a class last year and another took an online Python class last summer! \n\nPoint is, anyone can be good at almost anything if they put enough time into it. I didn\u2019t get good at CS because of natural ability, I got good because I\u2019ve been playing with computers since I was a little kid. Because I learned Java with my mom when I was 8. Because I spent hours and hours reading huge CS textbooks that I got from my local bookstore\u2019s reference section. Because I have watched countless videos on YouTube, tinkered with software, wrote my own software, and so on.\n\nBut you are most motivated to put that amount of time into things you are the most interested in. So let\u2019s encourage people to do what they are the most interested in. If you\u2019re interested in CS then you should be encouraged and helped whether you\u2019re a man, woman, or non-binary.\n\nI\u2019ve just realized how long this post is but this is something really important to me. I guess I\u2019m now at the age where I can start to do something. I\u2019m not sure where to start but it\u2019s something that I need to think about",

            "I read your entire post. First of all, I would like to applaud your for all the effort and discipline that you\u2019ve put into this field, and how you manifested your passion into what is now pretty much a guaranteed upper middle class lifestyle doing what you love. \n\nNow, on to the major point, which is that you are frustrated that some might assign your getting into a top FAANG as a consequence of affirmative action ideologies as opposed to your stated merit. \n\nMaybe someone might believe that, but I\u2019m sure any rational person wouldn\u2019t, and the majority of people don\u2019t. \n\n  The claim is that FAANG has been shown to lower hiring standards for women, and consistently give women interview opportunities at a larger rate than men. I don\u2019t know if this is true as I haven\u2019t read the facts, but that\u2019s the premise that people have been arguing over. The issue is that The moment you do this, is the moment you establish a very atrocious level of discrimination that rewards applicants on a basis of identity rather than merit. Many people might not dive into the essence of the argument, and as a result might see this as an attack on women, when it is simply an advocation of equality. If the claim of what FAANG is doing is true, then that does a major disservice to both men and women, not in the light of their own specific genders, but in the light of individual people. \n\nIf it right to devalue a woman\u2019s ability to learn and grow by offering them a handicapped interview process? Is it right to place larger obstacles in front of men simply because they are men, and the industry needs more women? If you ask me, that\u2019s quite obviously the lazy approach. Nobody said that you got in because you are a woman, if what you said is all true, then you clearly deserved it.\n\nWhat is being said, is that if affirmative action ideologies are being implemented in order to bolster female representation. Then that is wrong. Men and women should go through the same exact evaluation based on knowledge, experience, effort, and overall merit, period.\n\nBeing a woman, is not the only reason woman achieve success in this industry. It doesn't seem like you're the kind of person who made into into FAANG just because you are a girl., and no rational person would dare say that. However I think that any rational person would agree that if those alleged hiring practices are true, then that does a great disservice to the men who tried just as hard as you did, only to miss out because of such discriminatory processes, and a major disservice to women who it will leave wondering, whether they got in because of their merit, or because they were simply a woman.",

I got a 2:1 from a prestigious university in computer science, did extra-curricular activities and was even an ambassador for my university.\n\nOf course saying I got rejected purely because of my sex is a stupid thing to say, but the fact that I knew because I was a white guy in his early 20's, companies could look at me worse, made those 3/4 months of job searching soul draining.\n\nAnd in the end I couldn't even get into a tech job from my job search.

            "I started a CS club at my school this semester and encouraged the club to make the number 1 conduct rule off the bat \u201cNo sexualized speech whatsoever and especially no harassment\u201d because that garbage pushes great women programmers away that we want to contribute to our org. It also makes good men uncomfortable. We also laid down no discrimination, no bullying/mockery of new programmers, and no politics but the likelihood of having sexual harassment issues seemed way higher than the other stuff, so we put it as the #1 rule.\n\nI really think zero tolerance for harassment is the only way to create a comfortable environment where everyone feels part of the team. Even sexualized speech that someone thinks is good natured or funny is just bad news. As a guy, I hated hearing crap about some stranger walking by when I worked construction and I would hate it even more if directed at a CS colleague or peer.

            "After 9 months of applications and interviews, I finally landed my dream job as a new grad in big tech!\n\nAlright, that\u2019s enough happy news. The job market is seriously in a nasty place right now. Despite this, there\u2019s a lot you can do to maximize your chances and I\u2019d like to share a few lessons that I wish I\u2019d learned earlier.\n\nEDIT: I don't intend to say I have a magical interview success formula. It's an account of the specificities behind what worked for me. Getting practice with LC is important, but I aim to emphasize that there is so much more to it than blindly applying to jobs and solving a ton of problems.\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE:**\n\nI started applying for new grad positions back in June 2023. I started early in the recruiting season, I\u2019ve had three internships where   I   D E L I V E R E D   V A L U E , and go to a great school \u2013 I thought I\u2019d have a decent advantage. Oh, how naive I was\u2026\n\nEven with a perfectly formatted resume with all the hot keywords, only 3 interviews came from 331 cold applications. That being said, to my surprise, I got my first interview in July from one of those companies. It was a behavioral screener with a recruiter. How bad could it be? Well, there\u2019s no other way to describe it than saying I ate shit. Never take an interview for granted and always keep your arsenal of war stories stocked. I learned that the hard way after a grueling 30 min of being a pure buffoon. It\u2019s not productive to obsess over an interview, but approach it with intent.\n\nTreat interviews like talking to girls. You give it your best shot, but deep down, you know you\u2019re just not that guy.\n\nIt took failing 4 interviews before I honed my \u2728*persona* \u2728, stories, technical communication, etc. Interviewing itself is a skill you need to develop and expect it to take a couple failures to get there.\n\nA few months later, I finally landed an interview where everything felt like it was locking into place. It was a prestigious big data analytics firm based in Denver (that narrows it down pretty well I think) where I could bridge my data engineering and entrepreneurship experiences. Most importantly, their interview process had NO LEETCODE.\n\nI had somehow managed to get to this point in my ***distinguished*** career pretty much without touching any LC. I could validate parentheses or perhaps invert a binary tree if I was feeling more adventurous, but that was pretty much it. So, with the opportunity to interview at a highly desirable company with no LC in their interview process, I had to ace it.\n\nWhen the morning of the interview finally came around, I was ready. I got in my early morning run, brewed a delicious cup of single-origin black coffee, and put on my Patagonia sweater. I felt like a winner. And in fact, I thought the interview went quite well. However, I was somehow terribly anxious for the following days and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the interview for a minute. It mercifully came to an end when I received my rejection the next Monday.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say I was devastated. I had pretty much done everything right in college but had nothing to show for it. It was beyond frustrating, but one day, I received what was probably my last shot (late in the recruiting season) \u2013 an OA for a big tech company. To my surprise, the OA didn\u2019t go perfectly, but it was enough to get me into the interview stage.\n\nAt this point, I knew there were only two ways this could play out. Goal: I could land this job, which honestly felt like a pipe dream. Contingency: pitch up a tent in SF.\n\nTo give the former any chance of becoming a reality, I had to leverage my 3 weeks of winter break to grind it out. For the first two weeks, I opened up a split window (which is delightful in Arc Browser) of Neetcode and LC at 8 AM and tore through about 9 problems a day until I finished Neetcode 150 (sans most hard problems). In the third and final week, in addition to creating short summaries of each problem, I covered an assortment of the top 100 problems for the company.\n\nGoing into my interview round, it strangely felt like any other day. Unlike the previous interview experience, I was completely calm and collected. Again, it wasn\u2019t a completely perfect interview, but I felt confident throughout. Perhaps most importantly, when I was stuck, I kept the interviewer engaged with my thought process so that there was never any dead air.\n\nWith the interview behind me, I didn\u2019t feel much anxiety. I went about the rest of the week without giving much further thought. Finally, one morning, I got the email that I was in!! I can\u2019t wait for what the future holds. It is now my mission to deliver value to my prestigious employer, one merge conflict at a time.\n\n**PREPARING FOR TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS:**\n\n1. Finish the Neetcode 150\n2. Write a \\~2 sentence summary of the high-level approach. Nearly every LC problem can be solved with the same toolbox of patterns and data structures.\n3. DO memorize general algos like binary search, DFS, BFS, etc. NEVER memorize solutions to specific problems.\n4. I found it most effective to watch a solution video, code along, and review the pattern in my head. Then, I\u2019d revisit it the next day and try to solve it without the video. I haven\u2019t seen anyone cover this approach; while it worked well for me, everyone learns differently. I already had a strong DSA/coding foundation through my internships and TA-ships, so I targeted pattern recognition more than coding ability.\n5. Learn how to be a strong technical communicator. Becoming a TA is what helped me in this aspect the most.\n6. The best resources for me were watching Neetcode and Cracking FAANG.\n\n**PREPARING FOR BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWS**\n\n1. People hate to hear it, but this is an EQUALLY important part of the process. Being memorable is all about your storytelling abilities.\n2. Find opportunities to interview the interviewer with questions specific to them. Everyone loves a chance to talk about themselves.\n3. Hiring managers can easily tell the depth of project experience you\u2019ve had. If you have an experience on your resume, you should be able to rant about it for \\~10 min at minimum (ofc, be concise in an actual interview). How do you manage this? Pursue projects that are truly challenging (not just YouTube tutorials) and document blockers/wins each day.\n4. Convey a sense of curiosity and tenacity. If you have to fake that, I think you may have larger issues to address\u2026\n5. Study how people you respect talk and interact (public figures, friends, family) and practice those qualities. You don\u2019t want to change who you are, you just want to amplify your personality.\n6. The best resources for me were watching ThePrimeTime, Clement Mihailescu, Rahul Pandey, A Life Engineered, and Dan Croitor.\n\n**GENERAL ADVICE:**\n\n1. Exercise consistently, eat nutritiously, meet/make friends, sleep well. Without this foundation, YOU WILL burn out.\n2. Learn how to interact with fellow humans. Can\u2019t count how many recruiters I\u2019ve seen at career fairs grimace while someone extols the virtues of their revolutionary task manager app. Learn how to sell yourself in natural conversation. I used to be quite dreadful at this, but the best way to learn is by putting yourself in social situations whenever possible.\n3. Stop being cool and make friends with geeks. Become a geek. Learn VIM. Cannot stress enough how important it is to find the right people to make connections and bounce ideas off of.\n4. Never hesitate at an opportunity to get to know someone new. My previous internships and current offer were all from referrals or networking.\n5. Everything difficult is accomplished with consistent effort over long periods of time.",
