        "selftext": "Having mentored 3 interns who successfully got their return offers, and seen many examples of successful interns at FAANG, here are some tips for your internships which should be useful regardless of company.\n\n1) Do what is expected of you. Firstly in order to do what is expected of you, you gotta know what is expected of you. If you're a SWE intern, most of the time you just need to finish your project by writing high quality code while not being a jerk. To write high quality code, look at how code is written in the code base and follow the conventions, directory structure, naming, use existing abstractions. Break your code into small PRs so that it's easy to review. Nobody likes reviewing PRs which are thousands of lines long. Write tests! At the end of the internship a good litmus test on whether your internship was successful is whether the team would hire you or take their chances with a new intern/fresh grad?\n\n2) Demonstrate independence. Your intern manager/mentor/host is also a busy employee and they have their own work to do. If you run into issues, try to unblock yourself first before asking someone. Look up internal documentation, look at existing parts of the code and see if you can follow similar approaches. If you're still stuck, then ask. Post in support groups/chats and share your high level goal, the approaches you've tried and why they didn't work. This helps people to help you. It's ok to ask more questions at the start but the frequency should go down over time.\n\n3) Take initiative and ownership of your project. Rather than waiting for tasks to be handed to you, look at the roadmap (or create one if it doesn't exist) and keep working on the next item. Break down the project and create tasks for yourself, closing them when completed. Be your own project manager and product manager. Keep a log of the work you've done. This will be super useful if you have to write a self evaluation at the end of your internship.\n\n4) Communicate well. You should be the best advocate of your work. In large companies, peer feedback is taken into account for the internship evaluation. Tell your team what you are doing, make occasional updates about your work, give others visibility into your work and demo your work during sprint meetings.\n\n5) Take feedback seriously. Your mentor should already be providing you feedback constantly, otherwise, you can always ask. Ask how you can improve and what you can do better. Since you'll be spending lots of time writing code, make sure you pay attention to the code review comments you receive and reviewers don't make the same comment twice.\n\n6) Overdeliver on your project. If you're delivering your milestones ahead of time, instead of chilling and sticking to the schedule, finish your project ahead of time. This gives you the opportunity to pursue other things. You can work on stretch goals of your project, think of new ways to improve your project and execute on them. Market your project and get people to use it. Iterate on user feedback.\n\n7) Do what is not expected of you. Of course this doesn't doing mean negative things. Do things which people don't expect interns to be doing. The rockstar interns I've seen, they completed their projects in half the allocated time, had time to help their fellow interns in their work (sometimes even helping full-timers in their work), were added to the team's oncall, helped to review the team's code, and helped to answer questions from external partners about the team's work. Not all of these will be applicable to your situation, but you get the idea. They were functioning and having impact as if they were a full-time team member.\n\n8) Assess the company. As much as an internship is a prolonged interview of your fit for the company, it is also a chance for you to interview the company. Do you enjoy the team's and company's working style? Do they overwork their employees and treat employees with respect? Sometimes interns can be too busy with their projects to pay attention to these things but ultimately these are important factors to take into consideration when deciding whether to sign the return offer. You might not be joining back the same team but the company culture affects the team's culture to some extent.",

            "~~Oh hey, your enumeration of this broke, but sometimes it be like that.~~ Nice \n\nI find some of this advice to not be comprehensive, even though it's high quality. You obviously have a lot more experience, but I'm somewhat surprised that we have some divergences.  \n\n1.Some teams don't actually have good code quality to start - so writing in line with what they do doesn't always seem like the best. Especially for very mature teams, it seems like they often are in the process of needing people to elevate the code quality, no?  \n2. Honestly, the internal docs suck if you're not doing mainstream stuff. I was told _not_ to wait forever, and to keep the questions my peers should be helping in the chat as a record that I wasn't supported and still pulled through. I was told velocity matters enough that if you spend 1-4 hours trying to find an answer, you should probably ask the people on the team in case there's an obvious solution.   \n3. Do interns at this company _not_ take initiative? My IM explained it to me explicitly, so I feel like not telling your intern that would be screwing them over.   \n4. Idk if your teams have higher standards, but for my 2 FAANG internships, I never got much feedback on the code I wrote. The main feedback I got in general was that I suck at communication (which was what I got leaving with a good offer)  \n5. Is doing extra _really_ required? My impression was that if you clear everything in the project, you'll get an offer, which is reflected by a friend who spent 10 weeks doing nothing. It also seems like there's only two return offers now, so if you aren't going for gold so to speak, that extra work is nil.  \n6. Doing the bonus work is what i was told makes you look great, but isn't it best to work with your IM to figure out what stuff would make you look best for the evaluation?  \n7. Isn't one of the big perks of working at such a large company that you can just join some other team to do other stuff?",

But there are a lot of problems with the money transfer and with getting visas (and thus relocation) from Russia to anywhere else.\n\nResult: they rejected you not because Google blames you for the war. They rejected you because it's going to be hard to relocate you from russia to Zurich and they don't think you are worth all the trouble.\n\nI'm really sorry that this happened to you, this is unfair.

            "Honestly, I want to give my salty old-man-shouts-at-cloud opinion after recently graduating from a public university...\n\nSophomore year, I took Software Engineering; this class involves working with a group of 4-5 other classmates (in my case, 5 classmates, 2 sophomores 3 juniors) in working on a software development project over the course of the semester as well as producing documentation and presenting it at the end. It was a simple Android note-taking app that I would think any competent CS student should be able to Google their way through within a couple weeks. What I saw was an utter disaster of 4 of the teammates unable to understand damn near anything. Unable to Google their way through iterating through an ArrayList type of disaster.\n\nFast forward to senior year and I am working with a team of 4 other (senior) students for a capstone project, a two-semester software development project commissioned by clients the class instructor has sourced for us. The first semester was all documentation, planning, and presenting. It went wonderfully. All my group mates were competent, timely, and hard-working. Then the second-semester, the coding period, came around. Only 1 teammate was capable of producing Java code (a language all of us had taken *as a required core class*) that even compiled. The other three contributed almost nothing to the codebase and despite attempt-after-attempt to throw easy bones to get them to contribute, I had to cram morning-midnight for the last several days to get the project in a submittable condition. An utter disaster, *but only with the coding*! Oh, and two of these people had industry jobs lined up. Even back in early 2023, one group got smited after the professor discovered 4/5 students were ChatGPT-ing their way through the class.\n\nMy conclusion from this capstone, as well as graduating, is that my university does not deserve accreditation for CS, lol. But on a serious note, I would say **the** **majority** of the people in my CS graduating class were incapable of producing code above an intro/high school level. Rampant cheating, absolute no doubt, big credit to COVID-19; I was in a dual undergrad/grad class for graphics programming, and had to deal with waiting after class to ask the professor, the department head, questions in line after 1-5 international/graduate students in front of me bickered back and forth about being given a zero grade for copying and pasting entire projects from the Internet, seemingly every other class. It's downright disturbing.",
            "Not really surprising. I\u2019m studying at a German uni and was working as a tutor for a programming module. This is a common first year module, so it is at least somewhat representative for the amount of new students. Basically the numbers went up from about 400 in 2017 to 1000 in 2023. We have weekly assignments and a lot of submissions were either straight up horrible or obviously ChatGPT. \nNaturally my perspective is pretty limited but it feels like only a small minority is really into coding.",

He had no real programming training, but worked his way from support/help desk to doing more dev tasks because he kept asking for it. We bumped up his salary slightly and started giving him tasks to do. He rarely completed anything without major help, which is totally fine.\n\nBut then he asked for a $30k raise because he \"did his research and that's what other web developers are making.\" We had to let him walk when he got another offer. He just wasn't worth it. In fact, he was kinda slowing us down to be honest. There were tasks that I could have knocked off in a day that he was taking days to figure out. Oh, and he was also that guy that spoke for 10 minutes during standup when the rest of us spoke for 1 or 2.\n\nI hope he's doing well at his new job but I can't imagine he's succeeding there unless they are very lax about everything.",

Nobody really bothers to look at your skills or projects, just your job history. It's insane and very very frustrating.",

            "Me: Software engineer, 8yrs of experience, knows about 30 languages, has worked in huge enterprise corporations with huge code bases and teams, had direct contact with clients and has tons of proven experience.\n\nRecruiter: You failed a quirky 30min code test with a 75%, you're horrible at coding!",

            "That's a bullshit post full of lies because tech recruiters don't conduct technical / coding interviews. They conduct phone screens where, if you don't state the proper sequence of buzzwords, they state \"we should hold off on this for now\".",
            "I had no problems passing onsite coding interviews on whiteboard, doing it online made it way harder \n\nAlso I had impression that most interviewers just focus on finding out if interviewee cheating - which was not applicable in on-sites \n\nTldr: online interviews were created to cut costs, in reality it's waste of interviewers time and much more likely to hire cheaters, but don't worry - there are layoffs, right?",
            "Not all faang interview are leetcode lol",
            "Just for reference from a current senior college student who is now a TA for my schools data structures class. Chat gpt first came out a semester after I took data structures. Everyone uses it. I use it for my classes, but my current classes are fairly advanced and I\u2019m only using it for busy work. However, the kids in data structures are using it passing with 100s on average whereas the averages when I took it were like 70-80s and the class was getting curved 8-10 points. These kids aren\u2019t actually learning how to code at all. It\u2019s a particularly serious issue in CS.",
            " The market is flooded with them because they are the ones that got laid off.",
            "I\u2019m going to get flamed for this, but\u2026. It\u2019s fucking true. I don\u2019t know how many interviews I\u2019ve done with CS graduates who can\u2019t even reverse a linked list. Before I moved to Google I couldn\u2019t stand doing interviews. At least now the quality of candidate is higher because everyone knows Google\u2019s standards. Making calls to other libs is not computer science and that\u2019s what a lot of people are really good at; but guess who else is good at that? AI. I can understand why a lot of people are worried. But if you learn the fundamentals of CS and continue to build from there, it doesn\u2019t matter what AI comes out, you\u2019ll be employable.",
