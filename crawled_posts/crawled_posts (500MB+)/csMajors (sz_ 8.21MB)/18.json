        "selftext": "Jesus Christ, what a fucking shitshow of a company. So I apply for their DevOps internship - I aced the Hackerrank OA and don't hear back for another 2 months. Then, I get an interview request. The recruiter for some reason wouldn't reply to my emails unless it was a brand new thread which I found really strange (had to follow up multiple times because of this) - and they were based in Hungary (classic IBM outsourcing) and would only reply in this specific 1 hour timeframe every day.\n\nThe time for the interview finally rolls around and let me just say this - fuck IBM for using Webex and not Zoom or Google Meet like any other normal company would. For some reason, Webex stopped recognizing my camera and it would just randomly shut off for several minutes at a time throughout the whole thing; the second interviewer showed up like 15 minutes late (mind you at this point the interview was like half over at this point) The interviewers seemed really uninterested (like they didn't even want to interview me) and when I asked them questions about IBM they seemed to trash talk the company at any chance they could.\n\nAlso, for those still considering this pathetic joke of a company, IBM is getting rid of their 401k plan for all employees. Don't bother.",

No one cared or said anything, until I got to IBMs booth.\n\nI stood in line for 20 minutes, got to the front, and was disrespected.  The woman took my resume and threw it in the trash in front of everyone and said she would never hire an unprofessional person (due to my dress).  2 other IBM recruiters there laughed when she said it, so I just left the fair.  Was humiliating.\n\nWould never work for them after that experience, but sounds like they didnt want me anyway.",

Both interviewers went on about how much they loved me and they can\u2019t wait to work with me. After my first interview I got a second HackerRank test from the recruiter. Told the recruiter I already took one. They responded back with incredibly broken English telling me that they didn\u2019t have it on file. Got the second interview after that without doing the second HackerRank. Like I said, that interview went well too. But I was never contacted again after that.

        "selftext": "Back when I was starting out, I used to think that grinding leetcode was tedious and that I was wasting my life doing boring problems. Not anymore. Now leetcode is the best part of my life and I have come to accept the fact that there is nothing in this life that is better than grinding leetcode, all day and everyday.\n\nLeetcode has endless interesting problems to offer me. I love occupying my brain with interesting things and solving interesting problems. Leetcode offers me exactly that. It has endless interesting problems which I would never have been able to experience had I not been a Leetcode addict. Because of Leetcode, I have been able to solve more problems than 99.99% of people who have ever lived on this earth. Isn't that worth something?\n\nI barely even feel human anymore. I feel like an omniscient, all-knowing AI that has matured and transcended beyond the human experience and lived a thousand lifetimes already.  I even dream in code now: Yesterday morning, I snoozed my alarm so I could finish the solution to the problem I was solving in my sleep. I know that there is so much more that Leetcode can offer me. I don't even want a job anymore. Google could offer me 500k a year for all I care, and I will still reject them, because Leetcode is all I want to do. I will not be satisfied ever, I exist only to read more interesting problems, to think through more creative solutions, to consume every problem Leetcode has to offer, through my blue light screen in the safety and comfort of my own room.\n\nAt this point, I have become Leetcode incarnate. I exist only to scroll through Leetcode, consuming every little piece of an interesting problem I can get my hands on. And as my blue-light stricken, blood-shot eyes flick over hundreds of thousands of characters of code, my dopamine receptors work overtime to keep up (and that's a good thing).\n\nWhy would I ever be interested in growing my own personal mundane, generic, stereotypical cliche life experiences? Boring! When I grind Leetcode, I am experiencing the best of the best the world has to offer, given to me on a silver platter for easy and limitless consumption. How could real life boring experiences and hobbies ever hold a candle to the the sheer dopamine surge I get from designing complex algorithms in a matter of minutes after reading a Leetcode problem?\n\nAnd vacation? Forget it. We all know that vacations always end eventually, and when you're back it feels as if you never went at all. I just want to grind Leetcode. That's all I want and that's all I need.\n\nI have read plenty of books (fiction and nonfiction) earlier in my life, but why would I read books now? It takes so much time, I'd rather just grind Leetcode. You see, reading books, though better for your attention span and less dopamine-frying, is actually just another form of consumption, that doesn't actually get you anywhere in the long run. It's less effective; for me, the opportunity cost of reading a book is consuming a vast variety of tons of different interesting problems on Leetcodet truly broaden my perspective. And the broader my perspective gets, the more I realize that there is nothing better than grinding Leetcode.",

I gave this CS degree all I had but evidently it wasn't enough. I just paid my enrollment deposit to business school and I'm not gonna look back.

Being international + no internships is a double whammy. It just means you would've had to go even farther to set yourself apart. I still wouldn't say its impossible.\n\nA big part of internships isn't just the work experience, its also the experience you gain in going through the job-hunting process, along with the network you build along the way. Having missed out on all that means you have to start from scratch in the worst job market in a generation.\n\nSo learn from your mistake and make sure you do an internship in business school, and hopefully things will be easier next time around.",

Entrepreneurs made so much money in the previous gold rushes that they wanted to participate in the next one, and hoarded smart kids who could code like lottery tickets.\n\nThat'll probably come back, but, much like the dotcom crash, there's a big market correction to work through first.\n\nYou're making the right bet here, by trying to be the entrepreneur that makes it big in the next wave, not someone who's looking to ride the rising tide.

The software world and the college world are only aligned in the fact that you know something about coding, but they require different levels of understanding of it. This is all to say that OP messed up not trying to get an internship, which connects you to so many people who can give you opportunities. OP placed too much emphasis on the schooling and not the practical elements of getting a real world job. Also, as a side note, many of the other interns that I have worked with were international, so it\u2019s not the only thing limiting OP.
