Hard. For a top college bc everyone acted like the end goal to everything. I thought that being a top school student would be my happy moment. To feel validated for my hard work and feeling smart. And now sure, I\u2019m at a top college. It\u2019s still hard. I\u2019m still not happy. I still don\u2019t feel smart or successful\u2014 tbh, I\u2019ve never felt dumber. Not to say I don\u2019t feel grateful and lucky to be at my college, but it was really not what it\u2019s cracked up to be.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m stressing out over winter break, trying to push through leetcode, finish side projects done, trying to keep up at my internship. All so when I graduate, I can achieve the \u201cdream\u201d of going to work at a FANG.\n\nI just spent fifteen minutes taking a good hard look at my life priorities and it honestly makes me want to laugh how dumb my self imposed pressure to go after these weird acronyms is. \n\nIs my goal really to live in a tiny apartment in California with a 3k/month rent to go work at a not-so-ethical mega company to devote my energy towards developing a tiny tiny not that impactful part of their code base. Just so I can have \u201csoftware engineer @ {FANG}\u201d on my LinkedIn headline and hypothetically feel successful and happy, but I\u2019m betting it\u2019ll not be what it\u2019s cracked up to be either. \n\nI know that this is all self imposed pressure, I don\u2019t need to be trying this hard, I just need to chill out. But that\u2019s much easier said than done. \n\nRealistically, I would be at the same level of happy living in a mid-sized city, making 80k as a software engineer in a no name company with a good work environment, reasonable work life balance, and friends and family. That\u2019s the reality and I\u2019m trying to convince myself it\u2019s true but that\u2019s not too easy. \n\nSorry for the long rant, rant over",

            "Thank you. I need people like you to keep me grounded. I have that second one: My job pays $88k as a software consultant with excellent work life balance. I can leave any time I want or stay and enjoy myself. Numbers wise, I would be saving about 33% more money for retirement each year if I worked at FAAMG and also have the name brand on my Resume. So it would be sour grapes to say I'd rather not work at FAAMG.\n\nBut if we look at just any graph or even my neighbors, I still make more working from home than about 85% of them. It is ungrateful to delay happiness just because I am in the top 15% instead of the top 1%.\n\nAlso, never buy what the recruiters are selling (their livelihood is never on the line, but yours is). And no matter where you land, never act like you're better than everyone (because if you're writing software for a living, there are overwhelming odds that you're not). Truly brilliant people (yes, including ex-FAAMGERs), won't think less of you for where you worked. They *will* think less of you if you even hint that you believe you are worth less because you never worked at FAAMG or think you're worth more because you have.\n\nLastly, being a Freshman and over this clout chasing is an excellent time. You know when a bad time is? When you're mentally unstable or emotionally broken at 40 and realize you wanted more out of life, or on your deathbed.",
            "don't worry about the company. instead picture where you want to live after graduation. do you want nature or big city life? do you want good food options? would you rather spend your free time indoors? this decides if you want to be in a high cost of living area or low cost of living area. I'm leaving out a lot of factors, but think about this and use it to guide you towards the right company. I personally want to live in the Bay Area for the weather and nature. I would take whatever job lets me live that lifestyle. in my case, FAANG lets me afford more in a high cost of living area. Saving up to buy a house is a different game in the bay than anywhere else, but that is where I wanna be. If I wanted to live in Jacksonville, there is no FAANG to worry about. But it's also easier to afford everything and you definitely don't need to make an insane salary. \n\nYa feel? Don't target a company. It'll be a let down. Find something else that interests you and then find the companies that let you live that life.",
            "I relate in many ways. I was worried about how successful I would be because I have no interest in chasing after a FAANG company. Not saying I wouldn\u2019t work for one. Just saying that it\u2019s not my priority. I\u2019m from the east coast and would like to stay here. I don\u2019t like California or bigger cities for personal reasons. \n\nI go to a pretty competitive CS school, and I see people who long to live in Cali working for some top company. I think that\u2019s fine for them. However, I don\u2019t see that in the future for me \n\nI just want to let you know that you\u2019re not alone, and just because we have different goals than others does not mean we can\u2019t be successful in this industry.",
            "Yeah I agree. When I was a freshman I never really felt like FAANG was the ultimate goal. I\u2019m now a junior and it\u2019s still not something I feel pressured about. A lot of Cs majors have egos and having \u201csoftware engineer @ FAANG\u201d on their LinkedIns helps add to those egos. When you\u2019re a freshman and sophomore, you\u2019re not really thinking about things like location, WLB, etc. You\u2019re really just thinking about achieving the best, which is FAANG in their minds. The cool thing about this major is that there are awesome opportunities in every part of the country. Enjoy the heat? Try texas, Georgia, Florida. Like the Midwest? Try Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin. Salaries won\u2019t be as flashy in certain areas, but COL is a thing. It\u2019s good to see as a freshman that you have your priorities straight.",
            "Oh it doesn't end there either, once you're at some of these companies, all anyone will talk about is your level and how to get promoted. You'll have people flexing that they're a Senior Engineer at Google while having their dates in our corporate cafeteria. People humble-brag that they move to a management position at L5/M0, etc.\n\nThe good thing is most people mellow out even in these hyper-pressurized environments as they get older. I'm getting there, and I don't see many people I personally know chase solely after prestige anymore. Nevertheless, it is definitely a toxic circlejerk that you'll have to endure for a few years before it gets better.\n\nThat said, to balance things out a bit, there are people who value the financial security and the head-start that a big-name college, company, and seniority could afford you. I've been able to build a nest egg far larger than I know what to do with by walking this path. I think at your stage-of-life, financial security is still a very top-of-mind topic to consider. That said, you don't need to make 200k a year to get by, and it's a good sign of maturity just understanding what your values are and how much you really need for financial security, and weigh that against the prestige-obsession. I'm fortunate to have been on relatively grounded teams here, and even then, there were many times where I had to stop myself from burning out.",
            "> I thought that being a top school student would be my happy moment.\n\nI thought this, too, and I consequently lived my life on fast forward. I feared missing out on my full potential, so I consistently exerted much effort without resting. I achieved goal after goal, but none made me happy. I avoided slowing down and chilling out because that sounded like complacency to me, and I thought that complacency was bad.\n\nThen, my latest job took me out of the city. I live in the Midwest now. It actually gets quiet at night. I have my whole apartment to myself. I've had chances to think. Now that I'm comfortably making six figures with minimal expenses (relatively low rent, no kids, and no student loans), I have to ask whether I really want to keep going or whether this is pretty good for now.\n\nI'm thinking about settling down for at least a while. I haven't allowed myself to have fun. I haven't seen many movies, including the classics. I haven't played video games. I haven't gone to social events (even before the pandemic). I feel like I should try some other stuff so that my life isn't just one big study session. I've constantly been preparing for the next thing. Well, now, it's time to lean on that preparation.",

Main reason why I accepted was because of financial reasons coming from a low income background. So I honestly see no reason to go for FAANG unless it's for the money honestly.

Intern interviews are harder than full time interviews, and it\u2019s much easier to go from FAANG to a \u201clower-level\u201d company than the opposite. I guess what motivates me is that it makes sense to work hard now so I have more flexibility later. That way, it should be easier to figure out the happiness aspect down the road.",

            "Well I don't think it's just for clout, it's for money. Making 6 figs out of college is quite appealing, especially if you don't come from money. My QoL has gone up substantially since starting work, and if I want to be able to take off to pursue my own projects / business in a couple years, gotta save up a lot of money. Easiest way to do that is to work for a big company that will pay you a lot of money \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You're not a failure if you don't do that, but idk why there's any question why people would want that, all a matter of what you deem is important and what you want",
            "Good you\u2019re thinking about this now. I\u2019ve been riding this train for 3 years now, and I\u2019ve just only recently realized this. All this clout is just recruiter marketing bullshit. \n\nGood for you. Good for you.",
            "I feel this. I\u2019m getting closer to graduation and really considering where I would like to live. After surviving undergrad engineering, I don\u2019t think I want jump back into a high stress environment. Luckily for us, the world & all its jobs are yours after graduation.",
            "I completely understand how you feel. Though for me personally I think the problem is that you're thinking of those as the destination or end goal, you're thinking it gets 10 times better when you reach it and it ends there.\nI tend to think getting into a top 20 university or tech company is a stepping stone, or a launch pad rather than the peak of the mountain I'm trying to climb. They're known as \"top\" for a reason since they offers me opportunities that I cannot get elsewhere. What matters most is what you take out of the journey/experience. \nIt is definitely still super hard and stressful, no matter where you study or work. But I often remind myself that I get so much opportunities being where I am compare to other less fortunate students.\nIt's not just to inflate my ego, rather to keep me optimistic and keep trying! \nIt's also a milestone to remind me of the results of my hard work for the last years/decade so I can continue building on top of that effort rather than just giving up when I'm depressed.\n\nKeep trying! Keep learning! We're humans and I can say for sure your education/job can't determine how \"good\" of a person you are! Just make the best of anything you have! Like trying to squeeze the last few optimizations out of your algorithm.",
            "This really hits the nail on the head. I know this may seem trivial, but there are so many movies that I haven't watched. Indiana Jones, Alice in wonderland, star wars, POTC, and like literally all of the classics. All for the sake of obtaining a big N / FAAMG internship. \n\nI'm honestly just gonna chill out and I suggest ya'll do the same. This shit really ain't worth it.\n\nThanks for your message. This was such a wake up call to get out of the 24/7 grind mentality. Shit man, I feel a bit more free and in control already.",
            "Damn straight.",
            "At this point I don\u2019t even care about FAANG anymore. I just want a good paying job that I could live comfortably(I said comfortably and not happiness since happiness doesn\u2019t come from money but rather being comfortable is what you get). Ps.I\u2019m only second year comp sci student.",
            "Huge pay lured me to CS but I never really enjoyed it. Always felt like I\u2019m a loser since I\u2019d open LinkedIn and see people accepting offers for Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and stuff. Right now, I am jobless staying at my friends apartment, using his car and miraculously waiting to be accepted somewhere out of the blues. There were consulting companies offering me 120k jobs if I were to fake my profile, show them that I have 5 years of experience at some top tier bank and shit. I didn\u2019t wanna sacrifice my identity and personality being fake happy around. \nConclusion? Nothing. Just spitting my inner feelings just so i feel good.",
            "Math and comp sci is like the most toxic girlfriend ever. For me it makes me feel like the smallest and dumbest person in the world when I\u2019m having trouble understanding a problem but when I get it I instantly fall in love with the subjects again. Don\u2019t get discouraged. The only way you\u2019ll ever achieve your goals is to keep playing the game and trudging through. When I started at a community college i literally did not know how to multiply and add fractions and had completely forgotten the fundamentals. I felt like I was born too stupid to ever graduate with a degree in computer science and now I\u2019m starting calc 1 and I love math. College is a huge decision with a lot of money tied up in it. You\u2019re still a freshman and have time to really decide what you want but you\u2019re not locked into working for some big tech conglomerate you can branch out and show off your entrepreneurial ability. You need some self reflection time but trust me anyone who says this shit is easy is either lying or egotistical. I feel like a lot of your peers feel similar to how you do.",

            "I've felt that way for the last 10 years.  That said, I'm from biomedical sciences, not CS.  (I was always stressed because of medical school applications, and not knowing what the schools want made it hard to start or finish anything.) I went to a really big engineering and cs school in Ontario though, so a lot of my friends were doing co-ops in San Fran and live there now.  \n\nI don't have the answers for you, but I so hear you.  It's exhausting to not only struggle to do an assignment, but to convince yourself that it's worth your mental exhaustion both now and in the future (in that you see no end result).  A lot of people do just play that game and never question it like you are.  I don't really have an answer for you, but I hope one day we both move toward one.  I'm just here to say that you are not crazy for feeling that way, and I don't think it's just the first year (freshman) exhaustion.  \n\nThe best advice I've been given is to make goals and achieve them (maybe just short-term goals for now, because it sounds like you're still deciding the long-term ones).\n\nBest of luck, my friend.  That you are questioning the status quo gives me such hope for goodness in your future.",

            "Yea dude the whole FAANG hype is silly to me. Every successful company needs developers, and the pay is MORE than comfortable \u2014 without forcing you to life and breath the \u201clifestyle\u201d.\n\nGranted, I didn\u2019t go to school for CS, just moved into the industry well after graduation, after realizing there\u2019s more options that the first 5 you think of in any industry.\n\nEdit: I did face the same with my major tho. I did engineering physics & was promised \u201c80k/year right after graduation!! Write your own ticket!!\u201d So I got 3.8 and deans list and awards and blah blah then ended up as a fry cook and truck driver after getting \u201claid off\u201d from my 40k/yr life-sucking boring engineer job.
