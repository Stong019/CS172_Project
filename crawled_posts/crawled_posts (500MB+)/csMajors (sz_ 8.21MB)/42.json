Wow!!!\n\nIf anyone has questions about how I did it /interview advice I\u2019d be more than happy to try my best to answer!  I know my few friends had quite a few for me \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit 2: please don\u2019t take my advice as law. Any advice I give is just coming from my experiences and asking a lot of questions recruiters and engineers. Your school probably has visiting recruiters or engineers too. Just bite the bullet and talk to them. Or your university alums via LinkedIn. They\u2019re just people. \n\nEdit: some questions are repetitive! Here\u2019s some repeated answers:\n\n- I didn\u2019t do a metric ton of leetcodes. I did a couple to refresh concepts, a couple to actually practice something new, studies some concepts on geeksforgeeks, homemade practice problems to familiarize myself more with some topics. Very adjusted towards what I wasn\u2019t familiar with. Yes mostly DSA. Heavily refreshed my big o\n\n- LUCK. With all the talented competition, you\u2019d gotta be in space to think that luck isn\u2019t in the equation.\n\n- please stop asking about TC. \n- no more resumes please.\n- I did not hear back after final rounds until I reached back to my recruiter a few weeks later. \n- I had a competing offer so that did speed things up post-final rounds\n- i didn\u2019t  graduate from an elite/pipeline school. My gpa was about a 3.3 when I applied. I have w\u2019s on my transcript.\n\n- I did not have a referral\n\n- I took leadership with an academic club in my school\n\n- 1 internship with an f500 company, nowhere near being a tech giant\n\n- no personal projects listed. Just major projects done in uni\n\n- iirc onsite problems were like mediums + dummy hard\n\n-  weeks between stages. Reach out to ask about your application status if you\u2019re feeling nervous or forgotten  \n\n- be talkative with ur tech interviewers. They may or may not know the language you\u2019re using. Make sure they know what you\u2019re doing\u2014 or trying to do if your code skill doesn\u2019t catch up. Nothing worse than if your interviewer doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and you don\u2019t finish. Let them know your thinking process.",

            "Google engineer and interviewer here - the #1 piece of advice I give to all fresh undergrads preparing for an interview is: study your algorithms and data structures. Your interviewers are looking for a broad tool set owned by someone who knows when to apply each tool. Make sure you understand complexity. Also, practice problems coming up with a simple solution first, and then talking through ways to improve it. Professionals rarely get the optimum solution on the first try, we want to see how you can iterate.",

It's toxic at its worst, and inspiring/movitating at its best, and it's not always easy to draw a line between those two things. A good analogy is a fitness community: where do you draw the line between inspiration, and unreasonable comparison? At what point does comparing yourself to others stop becoming inspirational, and become detrimental to your self-esteem? When does a conversation about meticulous dieting, become encouraging of unhealthy or disordered eating habits? \n\nIt is much the same here: seeing people with high paying salaries, and people who make a lot of sacrifices in order to get better at technical interviews, can be motivational but it can also be terrible for your mental health. The idea that you need to grind incessantly to be successful. The idea that you're a failure unless you make 6 figures. This place is rife with that kinda thing and you need to take everything with a grain of salt and realize that the majority of students don't operate like this, and it's not representative of the real world for most CS students.\n\nIf you enjoy programming, definitely pursue CS. Keep in mind that this sub leans towards a very specific type of student who is trying to land a very specific type of high paying job.

            "This is not a good subreddit to learn about the realistic cs education scene. If you enjoy programming in hs, you should absolutely continue to pursue it in college. You probably won't get a 300k offer at google after your first year of college (sorry to disappoint). Yes, getting your first job as a dev is going to be super hard. But once you have 5 years or so under your belt, you will be set. Don't worry about getting an internship. If you have the opportunity, of course, take it but don't sweat over it.",
            "I didn't even know about this subreddit before this post LOL.\n\nIf you're passionate about CS, go for it and don't give a fuck about others. I started at 20 without any programming experience and got my bachelor's at 25 (math is hard y'all). 30yo now and still passionate af for everything computers.\n\nThe best part about being in this field is the job diversity and availability. No need to work for a big company although I would recommend it for your first 2 years just to get some introduction to how enterprise works. Anyway, with a CS degree you can choose to go pretty much anywhere you want as long as you put your mind to it.\n\nRN I'm considering going back for a masters in robotics but I am so afraid of facing all the math again lmao (ngl finances will be a problem too but that's another topic)",
            "Ignore this shit show go have a good time in university my dude",
            "This sub is really unrepresentative. I, and many people I know, went to a normal state school, got decent to good internships, never had to grind leetcode, and got FAANG or other good offers upon graduation. (We're all graduating right now, so this was during the pandemic. Hopefully you'll have an easier run of things). \n\nOnly bit of advice, make sure your school is located near a metro with a large tech industry (I'm near Phoenix, and my first internship was at a small Phoenix based company. Without that experience I likely wouldn't have been able to get my subsequent internship / full-time offer). It'll make it a lot easier to get your first internship as you'll have access to a tone of mid to small companies at your career fair.",
            "I'am not in this major but so interested in programming. Is it possible for me to find a job about CS major?",
            "this sub is full of minmaxers driven by ego and prestige (and sometimes asian parents). if you actually enjoy programming just filter this out as noise. this field is lucrative, so it attracts tons of people looking for high wages who don't actually like the work, who a few decades ago would have been satiating their egos in finance or law, etc.\n\ngo into the field and find something cool to work on. it's great.",
            "1) Ignore this sub. It's full of stressed out college students that \\[a\\] have a weird (incestuous?) \"parental bragging rights at all costs\" kink, \\[b\\] have zero real world experience (or at most a summer internship), and \\[c\\] their understanding of the job market is \"either FAANG/Big 4, or VCR repair for the rest of your life, and there's nothing in between\".\n\n2) Both Leetcode and shooting 150+ resumes into the ether are stupid. You are unlikely to get a job that you will enjoy with that method.\n\n3) Get advice from software developer professionals instead. Like, literally find people with the types of jobs you would like to have, shoot them a message in LinkedIn and ask them if they could give you advice/an informational interview. Hint: they will \\*not\\* say \"grind more LC\" or \"throw 70 more resumes out\".",
