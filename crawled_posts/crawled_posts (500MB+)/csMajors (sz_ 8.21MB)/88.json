            "Yes, companies are not hiring new grads. This is because:\n\n1. For first 6 months, new grads are utterly useless and do nothing but ask questions and figure out how to do most the most basic stuff. This is not necessarily a bad thing, its expected, but they are deadweight and a detriment to other experienced developers who need to spend time helping them.\n\n2. New grads do not become worth their salary until ~2 years experience\n\n3. Many, many new grads leave before they reach that 2 year mark and become worth their price with the company having paid two years salary and lots of time from other developers to essentially train someone with no pay off.\n\nIts very obvious why new grads arent being hired. The market is tight, and new grads are a risky investment, not a tool. People tend to reduce risk in unstable markets. It has nothing to do with Gen Z or anything else. Once the market is more stable with high growth, the jobs will return as more companies would be willing to invest in new grads.",

So they only want to hire experienced people. \n\nI've worked as an engineer and later a data analyst, while it's true there is some stigma for gen z that is a smaller concern.  It's definitely the lack of experience. Millennials have a bad stigma to boomers still too.",

Yes I did an internship and yes they didn\u2019t give me return offer cuz of financial reasoning.",
            "This is an effect of COVID. Before work from home, companies were forced to hire juniors and interns and train them up. Otherwise they'd go broke from hiring all seniors locally. But with remote work, it's a much larger hiring pool, and there's less local pressure driving the cost of seniors up. So many companies are just hiring reasonably priced seniors to work remotely. And they're leaving juniors and interns out. This will bounce back eventually, but we're still really figuring things out in this remote work world.",

They were completing Contract work and using the unpaid interns to profit. I still went through with it and told my CEO I was leaving, and apparently I worked my way into being \"un-replaceable \"  position so they offered me a full-time Software Engineering position and less operations work + manage.\n\nThe other red flag giving your Software Dev Intern INTERVIEWEE Production Access WITHOUT SUPERVISION.\n\nYes, this happened. I had to sign an NDA to get the keys and SQL access. I had full production access as an intern interviewee with 0 supervision.

Is posting parody really in the same caliber non-parody posts? I wouldn\u2019t say so. Additionally lots of people here would be satisfied with just a regular post. If you, like me, are specializing in unfunny posts, then your dream job is likely being a karen or a killjoy or again, being a whiny 12 year old on twitter (vroom vroom).\n\nPart of the beauty of computer science is that it\u2019s applicable to just about anything else, what\u2019s with all the focus on parody posts?\n\nOne more thing: if you\u2019re good enough to successfully parody post, I would argue that you should stop procrastinating and get back to doing leetcode.",
