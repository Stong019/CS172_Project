I usually don\u2019t get this nervous but 1. it was my first in person interview. 2. I feel like i\u2019m letting my dad and his connection down as they really did vouch and try hard to get this opportunity for me. I feel so horrible for letting them down. I have already cried alone.

You sound like you're self-aware, and a good person that cares about equity. It's okay man :)",

        "selftext": "I FINALLY GOT AN INTERNSHIP OFFER!!!!!! \n\nMany months ago, I found out that one of my favorite startups was offering a data science internship. I had been using their app for over five years ever since they first launched and their mission is near and dear to my heart, so I applied immediately. I was super excited and enthusiastic when they got back to me asking to schedule an interview. Unfortunately, the interview didn't go as well as I would have liked, as even though I made a good personal connection with the interviewer due to my interest in the company, I was super nervous and messed up on some questions. My interviewer told me he'd get back to me soon if I am selected. \n\nMany weeks went by and I didn't hear back so I assumed I got rejected. However, I thought it would be worth a try to follow up, so I sent a brief follow-up email a month after the interview. Didn't hear back from that either. I continued applying to other companies but after hundreds of applications, I got only rejections and a handful of interviews/OAs that also ultimately ended up in rejection. Even after RippleMatch supposedly \"matched\" me with a company and told me that they wanted to proceed with an interview, that company emailed me afterwards saying they had actually rejected me and wouldn't be interviewing me! Like many other students trying but failing to get an internship during this year's brutal internship cycle, I became despondent. \n\nLast month, after getting my winter quarter grades back, I thought it might be worth a try to send another, better follow-up to the startup I'd interviewed with to let them know that I took and received in A in the database management systems class at my school, especially since I'd learned a lot of stuff that was relevant to the role. I knew the chances of it working were very low but tried anyways and put effort into the email to show that I was still passionate about working at the company. \n\nDays passed by with no response, so I just accepted that I wouldn't get the role and would have to try again next year. Since it's so late now and internships are drying up, I started making alternate plans about what to do in the summer and prepared for the worst. Then finally, a week after I had sent my last follow-up, my interviewer responded to me and told me he'd like to schedule \"a brief chat.\" I got my hopes up, but just a little because I knew that \"a brief chat\" could just be a codeword for rejection. \n\nFortunately, rather than rejecting me, the interviewer just asked me about what new things I've done over the past months since we last spoke and asked me when I could start. At the end of the call, he welcomed me to the company and said I'm hired for the role!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!! They're really flexible and letting me start after my finals are over which is nice because my university ends a lot later than most, and the internship is gonna be abroad in-person!!! That's a dream come true for me since I really wanted an in-person experience and it would be so cool to spend the summer abroad.\n\nSorry for the long post haha, I just got the offer an hour ago and all my family and friends are asleep so I just needed to tell someone about the good news. And I wanted to talk about the importance of following up and not giving up on your dreams. As dire as the situation for internships may seem rn, there is always hope.",

        "selftext": "I can't stand feeling like I'm being taken advantage of. My work and that of other Mexican students is being severely disregarded with Google's low salaries for interns working from Mexico.\n\nI'm happy to announce I've decided not to return to Google after evaluating their revised remote offer and deciding their compensation is a disrespect both to my work and skills and those of fellow students.\n\nLast year, one of the changes that we had to accept if we still wanted to work at Google was a compensation adjustment based on the cost of living in our country. It's worth noting that in 2020 Google made this adjustment while other tech companies that were still offering their program remotely didn't make any adjustments and paid the exact same amount they would've paid had the program taken place in the US, whereas Google paid about 10% of the original amount to its Mexican interns. Note that the interns have the exact same skills and knowledge as their US counterparts and that they performed the same work as well.\n\nIn other words, Mexican interns were only being paid 10% of the compensation while having the same skills and doing the same work just because they were located in another country. I've even worked at Google in the US before the pandemic and received their American salary, so it doesn't make sense to me that they're underpaying us this much because we'll work from somewhere else. The appeal of working at a place like Google vanished for me after reflecting on these facts. Because let's face it: even though it is an interesting company where you can do good work, there are a ton of other places where you could also improve your skills and learn new things, more so when salary is not a deciding factor.\n\nI won't give any specific numbers, but the salary of a Google intern is about 3 times the median personal income in the US, while the salary of an intern in Mexico (with the same skills and knowledge) is slightly under the median personal income in Mexico.\n\nI know for a fact that there are other companies paying the same or even a better salary than Google, some of which are Mexican, so for me it makes more sense to support a local company by working there at the same or a higher salary than working at a giant corporation that is literally underpaying me.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that not even the pandemic could stop Google and they\u2019ve become even richer than before, so I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t be valid to make this kind of criticism. This is not a war against Google, it\u2019s just a demand for more equality and fairness. I\u2019d love for this to reach the people at Google who make these kinds of decisions so they could question what they\u2019re doing.\n\nI know most of the people in this subreddit might be American, but if you're from another country and Google is also underpaying you, raise your voice! Demand more equality and fairness. I will personally work at another company that pays way more than Google.",

I see you guys posting about grinding questions all the time, so maybe this will convince you to do something that's more fun and actually applicable.\n\nI also posted this on Substack [with images](https://aheze.substack.com/p/getting-a-job-at-apple-without-going) if it's easier to read. \n\n* Learning To Code\n* Prior Job Experience\n* How Apple Found Me\n* The Interview Process\n* The Internship\n* Big Tech\n* College\n* Conclusion\n\n## Learning To Code\n\nI started coding back in 2019. I wanted to make apps, so I bought Angela Yu's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) on iOS development. I checked out some books from the library \u2014 [Sams Teach Yourself iOS 9](https://www.amazon.com/Application-Development-Hours-Teach-Yourself/dp/0672337673) was really helpful, even though it was outdated and for iOS 9. I also bought Matt Neuburg's [iOS 11 Programming Fundamentals with Swift](http://iOS 11 Programming Fundamentals with Swift) as a reference, but it was extremely technical and so I set it aside.\n\nI followed Angela's course for a couple months until I got halfway, then got straight to work building my own app. I called it **Find**.\n\nLots of people talk about getting stuck in \"tutorial hell\" \u2014 watching endless courses and tutorials while being unable to actually apply what they learned. I was able to avoid this by jumping right into the app dev process \u2014 I'd code until I didn't know what do and then search up a solution. I wasn't worried about efficiency or the \"best way\" to do something \u2014 you naturally learn this stuff after doing it for a while. Angela's course was useful for getting started, but to get a good grasp at what you're doing, you should be building projects.\n\nAnother thing that helped was Stack Overflow. It's been kind of dead ever since ChatGPT showed up (and also the community is not at all friendly for newbies), but I'd still recommend [making an account](https://stackoverflow.com/users/signup). You'll be able to ask questions, but more importantly, you can answer other people's questions. \"Learn by teaching\" as they say.\n\nAnyway, it's 2023 now and Angela's course is outdated :( so I'd recommend starting with Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) or [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100). But again, the tutorials are just for starting out \u2014 don't waste your time in tutorial hell and get right into building.\n\n## Prior Job Experience\n\nI didn't have much going for me besides my side projects. I worked at [Hyper](https://hyper.online/), a startup working on VTubers for iOS. I got the job via Twitter \u2014 Aaron (the founder) saw me posting my side projects and noticed that I liked anime in my bio.\n\nBesides tech jobs I worked at Rubio's Coastal Grill and was a cashier at Marshalls.\n\n## How Apple Found Me\n\nRemember my Find app? Someone on the Photos team at Apple saw it and DM'd me on Twitter. [Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/1D8QXJ5)\n\nI had been posting about Find on Twitter for a while. Here's the [promo video](https://twitter.com/aheze0/status/1579305528018497536) that I posted for the v3 update. Here's an [animation](https://twitter.com/aheze0/status/1573753632549281792) I made for the onboarding screen and a [swift package](https://twitter.com/aheze0/status/1574616440941948928) that I published.\n\nI think it's worth being active on Twitter \u2014 even after Musk's takeover, there's a lot of tech bros and industry people there. People will see your stuff and reach out to you. You'll get opportunities that you otherwise would have missed out on \u2014 for example, normally you need to be in college to apply to Apple, but I was able to get around that.\n\n## The Interview Process\n\nIn November 2022 I went to Apple Park to talk with my would-be manager. We had lunch and walked around the campus.\n\nWe talked about what a role at Apple would look like, and decided an internship would be good (since I still wanted to go to college). I remember that my manager specifically pointed out that he didn't care about where I went to school or my GPA \u2014 he said something like \"it only matters what you can do.\" That day I also met one of my future coworkers, who gave me some tips on improving Find's scrolling performance.\n\nIn February 2023 I went back to campus to meet the rest of the team. I talked with another manager about old age, college, and kids. It was really chill, but this was probably the behavioral assessment \u2014 they wanted to make sure I wasn't some complete weirdo.\n\nThere was no LeetCode or technical interview. I signed the offer letter in March.\n\nObviously, this wasn't your normal entry-level big tech interview process. I asked some other interns about their experiences \u2014 most people had a coding problem (one of my friends got two-sum, the first question on LeetCode) and the personality interview was more important. But I'm sure that at a higher position, for full-timers, there's plenty of people who get recruited and get fast-tracked in the process. There's nothing stopping you from taking shortcuts or a different pathway when applying for jobs. Do something different, like DM'ing the lead for the team you want to join. Make them *want* to hire you, and the interview turns into a free tour of HQ, lunch included.\n\n## The Internship\n\nWorking at Apple was more work than I expected. I thought I'd be going in, having lunch, then leaving. I saw vlogs from people at Meta showing off the rock climbing wall and bowling alley that they had right in the office. My friend from Google was talking about how she had a couple meetings per day and the rest was just free time.\n\nWell, not at Apple. I was there from 8 to 8, to catch the shuttle. Before my intern presentation I was working up until 12 (but that's on me and my bad time management). You had to pay for breakfast/lunch/dinner and even the gym ($18/month). The prices were fair, but it's not like the free food and stuff you get from the rest of big tech.\n\nIt was really fun. I was doing what I'd been doing for several years, but this time I was getting paid. I met some really cool interns and people from the design team who were absolutely cracked.\n\nWe had free corporate housing (got to be 18+ for this, so my friend actually had to live with his cousin) in this brand-new complex in Mountain View. The doors had smart locks on them that seemed cool, but were always broken. There was a hot tub on the roof complete with pool table and everything.\n\nAbout the work, I was there from June 5th to August 11, so my time was relatively short and I had to cram to finish my stuff near the end. The corporate structure was definitely way different from what I was used to, but it's well managed and gets stuff done. If you get the chance, Apple's really worth checking out.\n\n## Big Tech\n\nWhen I browse this sub there's so many posts about LeetCode, DP (dynamic programming, not double penetration), FAANG, etc... there's people sharing tips on how to \"crack the interview\" and people saying \"the best approach is repetition.\"\n\nI feel like people are so fixated on LeetCode and all these other coding questions that they're forgetting that this is just one path to getting a job. There's plenty of other ways that aren't as hard and don't require hours grinding over some dumb problem. Is it really worth grinding so much? Studying the most advanced Data Structures and Algorithms that you'll easily learn just from building? And after getting the job, are you even going to use the stuff that you spent so much time practicing?\n\nBut it's true lots of companies now just use LeetCode as their main differentiator in hiring. We can thank Google for this flawed hiring process---asking the same boring, time-consuming questions that test for proficiency in a roundabout way. Is it a coincidence that Apple was the only Big Tech company that didn't do layoffs?\n\nThe LeetCode craze is a real problem in the field. Sometimes it feels like all the high-paying jobs require it, and as a result we see all these people burning themselves out over useless questions when they could be developing their skills organically.\n\nEventually I think Big Tech and the rest of the industry will move away from LeetCode and shift to project-based interviews. They might give you a take-home assignment and you can show them how applicable and relevant your skills are. But until then, I'd recommend working on cool side projects and doing stuff that matters. You'll become irresistible :)\n\n## College\n\nI'll be going to college in September, so I can't speak much on it yet. I just know that it's not necessary and even not applicable for some roles, like iOS dev. So don't stress if you didn't learn a thing.\n\n[How do I fix my career? I'm a Software Engineer who learned northing during college](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/15swcy4/how_do_i_fix_my_career_im_a_software_engineer_who/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo that's how I got my job at Apple without going to college or doing a single LeetCode question. But I'm not saying that you should drop out or stop doing LeetCode completely \u2014 you need college for stuff like ML research and you need LeetCode for backend. It's just that I see a lot of people just trying to get a job \u2014 any job \u2014 in tech, and they constrain themselves to a specific role or profile. That's definitely not the play in this horrible job market.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Too many people taking this as some sort of stance on racism or diversity by the moderators, when in reality it\u2019s an attempt to clean up the posts in this sub and get them back to being on topic. diversity is good but when you walk around looking at everything through that lens you start trying to say things are racist or \u201canti-diversity\u201d when they really aren\u2019t. \n\nGo look at other subreddits for different degree majors, they actually have content about the degree instead of an internship/job market/DEI circlejerk like this sub is. I rarely ever see threads on here talking about programming outside of leetcode discussion, and even then barely anyone talks about actual code or methods. This subreddit has garbage content since I joined it 3 years ago.

But I was never able to stay committed towards my LeetCode grind. I would prepare for 1-2 weeks, and then stop my prep for few months. Every time I would try to start again I would feel like I am back to square one.\n\nBut it all changed on January 2022, I found that my wife was pregnant with twins. And that was a great motivation that would change everything.\n\nI devised a strategy to prepare more efficiently and stay committed to leetCode grind and achieve my ultimate goal of joining FAANG.\n\nFirst of all I created a list of top questions asked by top FAANG companies. Then I started solving them, and decided that I will make videos of their solutions and put it on youtube. Hence I started making leetcode solution videos. Made a promise to myself to solve 2-3 questions per week.\n\nIt was tough at times to keep up with full time IT job, a pregnant wife and I had to drive uber for 15-20 hours per week to make some extra money so we can handle the financial situation. On top of all of that I had to learn extra skills to solve and understand leetcode, plus make decent quality videos.\n\nBut as the saying goes, \"Tough times don't last, tough people do\" and I kept the hustle going. I would make videos at 5:00 am, or 11:00 pm. Whenever I got some extra time.\n\nAs a result now I have solved over 85 Leetcode problems, made videos on them. That helped me clear interview at Microsoft, and landed myself an offer. The interviewers at Microsoft loved the fact that I did that. One of the interviewer saw my video before my final interview, and my recruiter told me that they loved my dedication.\n\nHere is the list of the most asked FAANG questions I solved. Hope it helps some of you.....!!!!\n\n[Most Asked Questions for FAANG Job](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzP8j7matoUiJ15N-RhsL5Dmig8_E3aP/edit#gid=1377915986)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLocation: Toronto, Canada\n\nLevel: 61\n\nTC: 184K\n\n\\#FAANG #microsoft #leetcode #tech #technicalprogrammanager #softwaredevelopersalary #microsoftemployees #engineering  #software  #swe  #tech",
