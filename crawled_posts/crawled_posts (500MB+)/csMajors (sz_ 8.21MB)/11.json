        "selftext": "Quite tired of seeing people parrot crap about how the evil \u201cDiversity Hires\u201d are coming to take CS majors\u2019 jobs.\n\nOne of the most common things I\u2019ve seen said about tech is this: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about not knowing everything. You\u2019ll never know everything when joining a company, you learn on the job.\u201d Why, then, does it seem like underrepresented people in CS have to practically be Steve Jobs in order for many of you to consider us competent enough to get a job offer? Either we know everything and can jump to senior level on Day 1, or we simply got an opportunity because of our sex/skin color. Cool. \n\nWhen minorities (particularly Black people) or women joining the industry is brought up, suddenly everybody is concerned about \u201ckeeping CS meritocratic.\u201d I read some comments earlier on a post about being a woman in CS, and some comments were (predictably) whining about how companies care more about diversity now and not about who can best perform in the position. \n\nThe problem with this mindset is it presumes the two are mutually exclusive. Newsflash: there are plenty of Black/POC and women software engineers who can do the job; I\u2019m confused as to why so many of you automatically think otherwise. Many of you seem to believe any minority or woman can just walk right into Google today, ask for a job, and be given one without any demonstration of potential. I\u2019m pretty sure this isn\u2019t happening anywhere.\n\nOne minute, y\u2019all are raving about how hot the job market is. Then, when minorities or women are brought up, y\u2019all start talking about \u201cdiversity hires\u201d taking the jobs and how \u201cwe\u2019ve just changed who we discriminate against\u201d (meaning men, usually White, feel like they are being oppressed because Black people and women are joining the CS workforce and often are *actually* as good at software engineering as a lot of them *pretend* to be).\n\nWhenever someone asks how to snatch an interview at certain companies, many of you say \u201cget a referral,\u201d fully aware that it\u2019s acceptable to partly rely on your social connections to score opportunities in tech instead of entirely on your aptitude. I thought y\u2019all were concerned about protecting the meritocracy of CS, though? Why are you asking friends for favors if the job absolutely must go to the best-suited candidate?\n\nI\u2019ve also seen some comments (mainly on Twitter) complaining about minorities in tech \u201cruining the vibe of the workplace\u201d by finding each other and sticking together. If you are someone who thinks this way, I\u2019d challenge you to reflect on why that might happen. Underrepresented demographics in tech enter workplaces with virtually nobody they can relate to beyond occupation. This can be jarring in multiple ways. Then to also have to deal with a litany of microaggressions and major incidents of racism/sexism\u2026it\u2019s not hard to see why we find each other and stick together in these kinds of environments.\n\nSome see this topic as just a \u201cpolitical debate.\u201d Sorry, but the idea that minorities and women have the potential to perform well at a job in tech is\u2026not political. That has absolutely nothing to do with politics and everything to do with your own personal biases.\n\nI posted this here because I presume most of us, being CS majors, are in school and have yet to fully enter the industry. A lot of you should do better at interrogating your underlying (or not so underlying) racism and sexism before joining the workforce; we all do, to varying degrees, but I feel like some of you have done absolutely nothing to tackle your own prejudices. Ultimately, I wish y\u2019all would just boldly stand in your bigotry instead of hiding behind some false intellectualism. Trying to shroud your biases and hatred in \u201clogic\u201d only works for so long and on so many people before the rest of us look past the bullshit.\n\nTLDR: a lot of y\u2019all are bigoted as fuck and need to reconcile that.\n\nEdit: wow thank you very much to the generous people who gifted gold and other awards. This post was something I simply thought needed to be said among us who are preparing to become, or already are, CS professionals. I\u2019m glad it resonated with many of you.",

            "Kinda ironic that the people who hear about a woman/minority in cs and immediately go **must be a diversity hire! They are surely unqualified** is _exactly_ the reason why diversity hires exist in the first place. When these people go on to become recruiters, you bet your ass they\u2019re automatically filtering out all the women and minorities until someone tells them they absolutely have to. That\u2019s the thing with prejudice, when someone thinks all minorities are incompetent, they don\u2019t think they\u2019re being biased, they just accept it as part of their worldview and it becomes part of their mental hiring agenda.",
            "To add onto this, I think what people don't understand is that people in the underrepresented minorities often don't even apply for these roles. And it's  because they don't think they're good enough precisely because of people with the bigoted attitudes.\n\nThe diversity programs are all there to have outreach and tell them that they're welcome in the company and should apply, and many qualified candidates who may not have applied otherwise will end up applying due to this. \n\nThey still have the same assessments and everything that we all take.  they're diversity hires in the sense that they wouldn't even have applied for a role they're 100% qualified for, not because they're just trying to fill a quota.",
            "Man, you beautifully summed up what I couldn't put into words...\n\n\nI have been interviewing lately and sometimes I do wonder if there isn't some bias from the interviewer - whether it's conscious or unconscious- working against me, due to it being pretty obvious I'm Mexican, lol.",
            "Not cs but I know a lot of people in it. At my large university, Facebook did not hire a single white male intern. That is statistically impossible when it was around 60 people, mostly urm. Also IAs hiring clearly places a large emphasis on diversity. In the field I want to go in, I go on LinkedIn (anonymously) and look at the typical interns at companies. A disproportionate number of them are urms. The skill level in my field is very easily verifiable externally and the URMs are almost always less qualified. CS has leetcode and codeforce, so I don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s not like that in cs.",
            ">TLDR: a lot of y\u2019all are bigoted as fuck and need to reconcile that.\n\nBigot as fuck? Bruh stfu. People aren't complaining about \"race\" or \"minorities\" not being able to get a job or having these people replace their jobs. I never seen anyone complain about this shit until people like you start to force this weird conspiracy theory towards everyone in the CS field. Even if there were, it's because people like you made them believe a \"false\" theory going on right now. Women and minorities of many races have been working at tech companies since 2009, so wtf you on about?? Where do you even live? Tech companies in NYC and Cali has been hiring women and minorities for more than a decade LOL\n\nThe REAL issue is that companies hire \"cheap\" talent via outsourcing over ACTUAL fucking quality, you know. Not over race and gender. That's retarded. It's all about hiring cheaper wage slaves for good quality instead of paying a veteran CS Major of 15+ year of experience for 2.5 times the amount\n\nLook at Microsoft and Apple with Windows 10 and macOS Big Sur. The worst fucking cancer of software development in ages. It's buggy as shit and this is the RESULT of hiring low quality developers via outsourcing for cheaper costs and the layoffs of QA engineers. THAT IS THE ISSUE. DRILL IT INTO YOUR HEAD AND STOP PUSHING YOUR PERSONAL POLITICAL SHIT ON CS FOLKS! These people are the most chill people out of all the other fields I've seen in computer technology related fields\n\nIf anything, you (the OP) sound a leftist Trump supporter bum that has nothing to do all day and gets off by instigating shit like this on reddit. Politics solves nothing. Work does\n\nNow go back to work and contribute to society instead of spewing useless political posts OP LOL",
            "As they say, \u201cWhen you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression\u201d. 99% of the ppl ranting on diversity hires (atleast the ones I\u2019ve met) are the ones who won\u2019t get their desired jobs anyway. This is the convenient excuse they resort to.\n\nGetting a job in an under-represented field is not just about cracking 3-odd coding interviews. You have to overcome chauvinistic ideologies, natural biases and non-existent networks just to be present at a place where u are. People really need to understand the difference between \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d vs \u201cequality of outcome\u201d. Diversity hires, for eg, fosters equality of opportunity. \n\nThe day URM ask for standard hikes, regulated career growth, reserved nobel prizes and the likes, by all means we\u2019ll all stand for meritocracy for the good of all.",
            "Excellent post, OP, thank you for sharing your thoughts! You especially see this mentality on other anon networks too like Blind. Just recently, there was a post about how someone thought they did badly in their Google onsite interviews but still got an offer anyway. 100+ comments calling them a \"Diversity Hire\"... and then the OP of that thread commented that they were a white male. \n\nAs someone who interviews candidates myself, I think it's just incredibly sad and annoying to see people jump to \"diversity hire\" as a way to put down underrepresented peoples' achievements. \n\nWhat's also particularly annoying is the spreading of misinformation such as \"Diversity hire === Giving a free job offer without interviews to all the underrepresented people in the world!\". It's not; as other comments have also noted, it's about better outreach to ensure more underrepresented candidates have access to resources and information to access the same opportunities as others. They still go through the same interview process.\n\nIn fact, they likely have it tougher because they also have to overcome potential unconscious (and very conscious more often than not) biases (which good interview/hiring processes try to help reduce as much as possible but it's not perfect).\n\nExcellent post and thanks for echoing sentiments a lot of us also share!",

There is 100% a white male brotherhood going on and you'll just never be able to be a part of that, and it's a fact. The average John Smith will never see you on the level of his white male buddies.

As a POC myself, I've noticed that sometimes people like us - or any visible minorities - tend to get past resume screenings more often when there are others with comparable experiences. I mean resumes that are very much similar. However, minorities might get the chance at the recruitment process while others might not. I honestly feel I've gotten some interviews I didn't merit. Now, I understand that resume screenings can honestly be a lot of luck, a lot of the time. But I've just noticed this sometimes, to the point where I wonder the question myself of whether I got lucky to at least get the interview. Of course, what happens beyond the resume screening is all merit/luck.\n\nAnyway, just wondering if that's something that favours minorities, or is it just something that I've noticed around me?",
            "That's the problem with the \"diversity hire\" buzzword floating around. It makes people second guess their worth and it makes jealous people think others got in easily. If a company was straight forward and said, \"we hire the best person for the job\" then no one would complain if they saw a black woman walk into the office. The problem starts in the PR department. \n\nPeople in this field are generally very liberal and accepting of race/sex, but also very elitist in regards to intelligence. If they think someone skated by, they'll be monsters. It sucks. \n\nI honestly don't care if you are black, white, gay, trans, etc. I only care if you can help me hit a deadline. That doesn't make me a bad person, it might make me lazy though...",

Again, to me I don't care since I don't consider the race.\n\n>y\u2019all are raving about how hot the job market is\n\nCan't say that's the case for me; hard to even get interviews. I've failed more than 400 times after all.\n\n\\---\n\nHowever, my policy on meritocracy is quite hard and hence I am indeed not always comfortable when I see things designed only for URMs. The reason is that having events for a particular group alienates people from other groups who may also be disadvantaged but are not eligible simply because of their gender or race.\n\nA classic example from the UK is the case of the (consider the two equally competent) \"poor white boy\". I don't see them eligible for most of the diversity events by companies, while a \"rich black kid\" - let's face it that person is relatively advantaged right from the start - can access all the company diversity events. Who is better off in the end? Who *needs* access to these events from a fairness perspective? Similarly, in India, you have an easier chance getting government jobs if your caste is right - *ignoring everything else*. Yet another example are people with autism.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that grouping by which race or gender you come from isn't always the way to go, because that ignores several factors that are similarly important to consider.\n\n\\---\n\nPlus, this means that I would not consider acceptable for an URM to pass an entrance test while someone else with higher scores does not (which I've heard and have links to, but cannot verify, in India); that is, the passing mark for a test cannot depend on whether someone is an URM. This would be same for a referral too.",

I feel like I have to prove myself so much harder (hence the multiple masters degrees and imposter syndrome) just to be talked down to anyways.  They don't even care about what your background is, but will judge you right off the bat for your gender/race/thing you can't control.  I recently had a contractor on my team who we had just met who hasn't even worked with us yet say that he didn't believe the other female engineer and myself could possibly understand how to set up infrastructure (us two women are both senior data engineers and both have triple this guy's work experience).  The managers picked up on the sexism right off the bat and he was let go, but it's sad that he's going though as many years as he has treating female engineers that way.  I have also met women who have been developers from way back in the 80s and they're disappointed at how the gender mindset in this field has shifted so drastically over the last 40 years or so.",

If companies label their hiring drives as women only or something like that then people who get hired in that might be looked at as a 'diversity hire'.

            "I don't live on USA, but I don't really see, how diversity hiring would work here where I live. The vast majority of people in my country are white. Some of the get the job they want, others don't because they do not qualify. As for man/woman ratio, I can't exactly blame the companies either. Many of them are looking for graduates or even students. This also has to do with some laws as it's often more profitable for them. On my university just by looking at the students, I feel confident saying that about 95% of them are men. Even in my highschool, I was in a class with CS profile and the vast majority of students were also male. So I believe that there's something wrong going at much earlier stage than job hiring.\n\nNow, I can't speak for the situation in other places of the world, but I don't feel that the IT companies here are the primary reason for underrepresentation. Sure, they can do the 50/50 hitting ratio, say that woman don't have to be students/graduates but would that be even fair in this situation? Would there even be enough women interested now, given that it was very rare to find girls who were into CS back when I was a highschooler? Honestly, I don't know. I don't have enough data. I just feel that historically we mostly failed at supporting girls interest in computer science and now we are facing the results.",

            "I don't mean to be insulting. I did my best effort not to sound so without obscuring my point. I have nothing against people in minorities or groups that are considered underrepresented; I am in one such group myself: I am an immigrant, and not from Asia. The country I am from is relatively rare in America. When I was finishing my high school with 3,800 students, I know for a fact that there were two more people from my country other than me and two more with parents from there, nobody else. Hopefully, this allows me to express my stance without looking like a bigot.\nAlso, someone might correct me, but diversity hires aren't really a thing (look at any employer's website, they always cite some laws prohibing them to even consider race, sex etc.). \n\nNow, I did most likely take advantage of diversity college admissions, and I couldn't even refuse, I hate it. I am in very good college, and probably the biggest achievement of my life I deserved *in part* because I am an immigrant from a relatively rare country and the university wanted to contribute to their zoo of nationalities. I don't like this feeling, it is unfair to the others who weren't fortunate enough to be born outside of America and don't have an unpronounceable name. \nIf diversity hiring was a thing, I would be against it. Not because I don't want to be replaced by someone else. Also not because it's unfair (the moment I leave college and enter corporate world, the company is not obligated to be fair in their hiring process bc I don't pay taxes to help it). \n\nThere are several main reasons:\n1. You can devise any random number of groups and measure their achievement. Some of these groups will end up underrepresented, and the more random parameters to divide people you find, the more unequal groups you'll statistically get. Beautiful/handsome people will most likely be overrepresented bc they are more attractive. People whose name starts with select letters will be underrepresented (bc our of 26 letters, there will definitely some that subconsciously sound ugly when a word starts with them). People with unlucky names like Harold or Karen will be underrepresented bc of subconscious bias. People in suburbs or rural areas are discriminated against (by the life itself) when choosing extracurriculars (which are some of the most important factors in determining yr future, I can cite research if needed) and teen jobs bc if they don't have a car, they are practically under home arrest, while when you live in a city, you are free to get around by public transit. People of some other groups will be underrepresented for random reasons we will never understand, mostly subconscious bias-related ones. According to this idea, we as a society are obligated to fix that all and enforce that solution on the companies. To me, that sounds absurd. And I don't understand what's the difference between this and what diversity hires would be, if they existed (and what college admissions are rn). What we did is we happened to select the groups that we, humans, happen to easily recognize (or whose political voice was loud enough) and started helping out exclusively them at the expense of other discriminated people. \n\n2. There will always be a bunch of people who were in a similar (or even worse) circumstances than those whose \"underrepresentedness\" we are trying to solve, and who are not in any of these groups. This will stomp on them even more bc they don't get the benefits, but have the same adversities. My best friend in high school was Asian. He was one of the most hard-working people I knew and one of the smartest, but he lived in very big poverty. He couldn't even get a junk car (American South; completely car-dependent Charlotte, NC. Everyone else I knew had a car bc it was a necessity), so he had to spend huge money and many extra hours getting to or from work or extracurriculars (pretty much like me, but he was born here and would have enough time to make for a car if not for the need to support the family). He did end up in a pretty good college, I guess he got through. Yet, to pay for it, he had to join the fucking military (how broken does a system need to be that in order to go to college if you are poor, you often have to join the military). There would be way more scholarships available to him if they were given according to the main determinant of need: your family income, compared to the cost of living where you live. But they instead use race and national origin, so he was cut off. Yes, there are also some scholarships that target Asians, but proportionally to the college population, their availability is way worse. And if he just happened to be white, American-born guy, than any scholarships specifically for him would be considered discriminatory. Same with extracurriculars: you can easily make an all-girls STEM club, but an all-boys STEM club is gonna be considered discrimination and sexism. What if that's the only, say, robotics club available without a car? Or even available at all in a town?\n\n3. I did not see any convincing evidence that there is still discrimination in the workplace. The fact that some group is underrepresented does not mean on its own that it is discriminated against. As a simple example of one *first crossing the mind* reason why a group can be underrepresented: I would assume that there is less female police officers than there are male. Does that mean that there is discrimination against women in police? Maybe yes, maybe no, but that still isn't the reason why 80% of police officers are male. The proportion of females who would consider a job on which they might kill or injure someone else or even get in a fight is most likely much lower than that of men. \nOr see the number of parents among Asians (and no, I am not Asian) who force kids to work their whole childhood to get into a particular small set of jobs, like doctors or software engineers. I tutor coding part-time. I teach a Korean girl whose parents freaking forbid her to play toys bc if she wants to play, she can play piano or go do her hw. She has like 8 extracurriculars in 9 yo. Almost all other Asian students I had were like this (usually not to this extent, but the character of their relationship with parents was similar). So, if, say, 60% of Asian parents are like this (a random number. The point is that it's higher than in other races), it is reasonable to expect that significantly higher proportion of Asians will grow up to be in this field and low proportion will be in less luxurious fields. Does that mean that, say, construction building or trucking companies discriminate against Asians? No. They are, though, likely underrepresented bc they will be a disgrace to the family if they go into construction building or truck driving jobs. Does that mean that IT discriminates in favor of Asians? Probably also no, but they are overrepresented. There can be a million other reasons that we just don't know about bc we just don't know of the effects of some group-based factors on society that have nothing to do with discrimination but influence success. But you can't even talk about that bc you are immediately labeled a bigot and get shut up by others.\n\n4. This war on who is more discriminated shifts the public discussion from how to really fix the problem that your parent's life choices are so unbelievably important in determining your future to redistribution of inequality towards people whose adversities are less obvious. Maybe if instead we focused on the real reason why this happens, we'd figure out a way to curb suburban expansion or pay need-based scholarships to participate in extracurriculars, or pay government-funded parental leave or whatever else. But we are talking about the fact that some groups are more affected by all our problems than others, so let's dump the problems on someone else, so that it stops being as obvious",

So although this  is ganna sound like a person bashing CS, I\u2019m not but people need to broaden their horizon.\n\nYesterday in class kid to my right had tears down his face in the middle of lecture, just to be a good person I asked if he was alright and needed anything, he told me he didn\u2019t get an offer from Meta which he was expecting. I told him shake it off, it\u2019s not the end of the world, plus it\u2019s Friday so after lecture you can hang with your friends and go out and stuff. After he hear those words come out of my mouth he just went silent and said he is solely focused on job searching and that non of that \u201cirresponsible hooligan stuff matters\u201d. I stopped talking to him because I got annoyed for a second. By the way we are only sophomores lol.\n\nFirst of all there is more to life out there in computer science people. Finding friends, hobbies, or things that you enjoy doing is almost as important to a person then just some computer science internship. Go out with friends at night, meet new people, go enjoy life. Sitting inside until you land a VP job at Google is not healthy, I respect the grind but there is more out there. \n\nI also wanna say this, if your not an upperclassman, you should have zero expectations to get into these companies. Aim for small or mid companies just to get experience, it\u2019s so early in our lives that it\u2019s better to start building from small companies to get the experience to work at the big ones.  \n\nIf your in a place right now where u have things outside of computer science then your doing great, keep it up. For those who won\u2019t rest until they work at a company with 500k TC, I respect the grind, but take a step back when you feel down and go do something fun, and will probably bring you more joy.\n\nJust remember this, nobody on their death bed said \u201cwait let me write one more line of code\u201d.",

Is the money just there to sit in your bank account? And if so, what's the point of making it?

            "Funnily enough, I started doing better in school once I stopped caring so much about my grades. Spending 8-10 hours a day studying on top of overloaded semesters, and pulling multiple all-nighters in a semester got me kicked out of my school's honors program because I was just stressed and on edge all the time and I performed horribly during tests and stuff, resulting in a massive GPA drop. I think prioritizing other things was a big stress reliever & then the little bit of time I spent actually studying/doing schoolwork was more efficient, stress-free, and almost enjoyable.\n\nI also realized that even when going out with friends or even just chilling, I was still learning things about life, just not from textbooks. Learning how to manage my money during a weekend when I had fun stuff planned, how to be street-smart, how to comfort or distract a friend going through a hard time, or even how to relieve my own stress are all equally as important as learning to code or doing well in classes imo.\n\nThere are 168 hours in a week, and 40 hours of work per week means that just over 75% of your time per week *isn't* spent at work. There's so much you could be doing in that huge chunk of time to destress, relax, develop new interests, and just become a more well-rounded person in general.",

            "This is exactly what I always reply to the toxic freaks in this subreddit. Do these people not have anything better to do than sit in a corner all day filled with anxiety hoping that Google reaches out back to them with a return offer? \n\nBefore I went into CS I was really hoping that most of the stereotypes you see online were the minority, but oh boy was I wrong. Toxic CS fanboys (yes, that's what I call them because they are no different from console or car fanboys. They jerk off to their favorite FAANG company) are way too prevalent in this industry. They are arrogant, love to look down on others who don't have the same knowledge they do, and somehow think that getting into FAANG will get them laid. \n\nI 100% understand the argument for creating generational wealth through a job at FAANG and being able to live comfortably, but going about it the way they do is only going to mentally destroy them, once they realize that nobody is impressed that they joined FAANG, other than the jealous peers and their parents. Joining FAANG won't get you any pussy, it won't get you any meaningful friends, and it is not a hobby. It's a well-paying 9-5, and that's it.\n\nAnd for anyone feeling down about landing a job, I have a friend who graduated from college 4 years ago and he got a job at IBM and recently joined Apple, making 6 figures. All without a single internship ever during his college life. We hung out all the time, played video games and basketball, went to the beach, and not once was he stressed. He took it at his own pace and now he's doing incredibly well for himself rn. \n\nI swear CS fanboys don't like to enjoy life, it's like they love staring at a monitor for more than 8 hours. Please go outside, go to the gym, form meaningful relationships, cause at the end of the day, all of your programming knowledge will be meaningless when you're on your death bed, and the only thing that will matter was every relationship and good memory you formed in your life. Go do something else outside of obsessing over getting X or Y job, you'll thank yourself for it, trust me.",

            "While I am of the thought that life isn't just compsci, I do feel for the guy because he probably trained his butt off for this. Idk, I was in his shoes a couple of years ago, and the reason I cried was because I sacrificed a lot of relationships and \"hanging out\" in order to get in to college, and none of it felt worth after I got rejected from so many. If there's one thing I learned that I can pass on to this guy, it's that when you prioritize smth, you're revolving your life around it, and so far, I've been living college life putting my priorities into a number of things.",
            "Why would someone backlash at this? I felt the same way when i was getting turned down untill I stopped giving a damn. If i get the offer, great if I don't, also great. I got so relaxed that at one point it felt like I was doing these companies a favour by getting up for interviews. It was then when I landed an offer in a very nice cultured company or so Ive heard, ive yet to start my internship with them.\n\nAlso don't forget the amount of nepotism a.k.a networking this field has. Also don't forget how biased some recruiters can be. One company literally hired only good looking girls from my college. It was disgusting. So if you try your best and get rejected, don't blame it on yourself everytime, think about it carefully.",

Going on here and CSCQ and seeing new grads getting return offers in the six-figures made me question for a moment if my internship is even good. Thankfully, I\u2019ve mostly broke out of this thinking but it\u2019s so crazy how coming here and CSCQ and the general competitiveness of the field can be so toxic. \n\nI\u2019d be completely okay with a return offer of less than 6-figs if that means I can still enjoy other aspects of my life instead having to grind and burnout. There\u2019s always an opportunity to pursue it later.",

            ">But I want to preface by saying this is a community, we\u2019re everybody helps everybody so we all succeed or put ourselves in a better spot as a result of interacting with others in this community\n\nI pulled up to this community, so I can 360 no scope these FAANG internships. Honestly, idgaf about what u/sendmeanimetities or whatever weird mf's do. \n\n>. So although this is ganna sound like a person bashing CS, I\u2019m not but people need to broaden their horizon.\n\nok, this is your view of the world that people need to have \"broad horizons\". \n\n>First of all there is more to life out there in computer science people\n\nok, that dosen't necessarily mean you should indulge in it. \n\n>Finding friends, hobbies, or things that you enjoy doing is almost as important to a person then just some computer science internship\n\nWhy? This is your personal view of \"importance\". \n\n>Go out with friends at night, meet new people, go enjoy life\n\nWhat if spending time on computer science helps you enjoy life? There is nothing sweeter than seeing an offer letter. \n\n>Sitting inside until you land a VP job at Google is not healthy,\n\nWho said you are sitting inside to get a VP job? You obviously don't understand how it works. In our society, being at that level buys almost anything you want including happiness. \n\n> if your not an upperclassman, you should have zero expectations to get into these companies\n\nWhy? A bunch of my friends were extremely talented coming into college (USACO, \"hacker\" culture, etc.), but upperclassman like you told them \"to chill  out\". It's a fact that when you see someone younger than you who was doing more at your age you feel threatened. There are 100% some underclassman who should god damn expect to get into these companies. I'm surprised that you haven't understood that age dosen't matter in the CS world. There are 13 year old's our there 100x better than me at coding. What do you not understand about that. \n\n>. Aim for small or mid companies just to get experience, it\u2019s so early in our lives that it\u2019s better to start building from small companies to get the experience to work at the big ones.\r\n\nWhy do you have to start at small companies first? why can't you hack a project together on your own? AWS, Databricks, etc. have all commodotized computing. It's never been easier to start a side hustle. On top of that, even if you don't have experience, starting at a big company is incredibly valuable since you can leverage it for better experiences. \n\n>If your in a place right now where u have things outside of computer science then your doing great, keep it up.\n\nThe fucking superiority complex that reeks off of this sentence is absolutely insane. I bet OP looks down at people who are successful by saying \"that they have no life\" to justify his own mediocrity. \n\n>Just remember this, nobody on their death bed said \u201cwait let me write one more line of code\u201d.\r\n\nThis is not true. In an interview with Andrew Ng, Ian Goodfellow (godfather of deep learning) said that he had a near death experience and that's when he started going 10x into his field. He lives an incredible life, making millions of dollars a year, doing something he loves, and as a side effect, he has an incredible happy family life as well.

Right now I work as a senior software engineer but still I am doing just fine and I can try again later with other companies anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s also a lot of good practice. Anyway the Facebook recruiter told me that sometimes people fail the interview more than once before they get an offer.",
            "Well said! Sure, working hard is important, but I agree that it shouldn\u2019t be your sole focus especially at such a pivotal time period like college.

I may not necessarily have an internship this summer (*cries* - at least I\u2019m a sophomore rather than a junior ig), but I do have hobbies that I really enjoy and I have a boyfriend who is wonderful and I have like a solid 3 friends. And I could have a happy life if I didn\u2019t make a crap ton of money. \n\nPlus I\u2019ve been through a lot in life so maybe I should be more gentle on myself for messing up.",

Alot of ppl miss the whole reason or dont even know why they are working in the first place.

Maybe it's his financial situation or family situation or just his passion towards the job, but obviously the person put a lot of effort. Telling him to just shake it off, isn't going to do anything. Moreover, if something is your passion, it's okay to be a little obsessed over it. Hanging out with friends?? I used to skip meals and sleep over my studies because I was working and studying so much. But I had to, because I couldn't be a burden to my single mom and I wanted to help her out as soon as I could.",
