If you got rejected before team matching work on your LC skills, if after team matching do side projects in popular stacks to fill up that resume and have more \u201ckeywords\u201d in there.\n\nFor context, for summer internships at Google, after you pass the technical rounds you are asked to fill out a project preference survey. Then PMs search through a pile of these surveys and pick from it those with matching backgrounds / interests. The earlier you apply, the better your odds, as you'll be on the pile \u201clonger.\u201d\n\nThere are tons of students who pass the technical but get stuck in the team matching, usually they get sent follow-ups by recruiters the following year.

It was frustrating since it was so blatant how other nonblack tutors were given that respect right away.\n\nIn work, I notice this less and I get the impression that women also deal with this less. I'm obviously not a great source for women's experience in the workplace. But I hope this gives you some hope that the issue is smaller (but still real) once you're past college and into the profession. I also notice more more women compared to the % I saw in my CS classes. Rough numbers, but I feel like my CS classes were like a 80%/20% of men/women and at work it's closer to 60%/40% of men/women. My guess is that there is somewhat of a selection bias for men/women when it comes to choosing CS as a career. Since CS is not socially welcoming to women the way that it is to men, women  tend to go into it if they have a higher level of desire and/or skill in it early on. That would lead to women making up a much smaller percentage of students that drop out or graduate without being able to find a SWE job in the long-term. But I'm just guessing and inferring a lot.",

I'm 20 years into my career and I'm a senior dev, and I get men shocked I'm programming or doubting my skills.\n\nThat said, the paycheck is worth putting up with the asshat men in work, so I don't have to put up with them in my non-work life. I can always switch jobs, but social circles are harder to change, and financial independence is a major boon.\n\nProgramming was a women's field first, and I won't let them take it from me.",

I\u2019m not a genius or anything\u2014but I\u2019m not stupid either\u2014I\u2019m probably average or a little above average.

When I first entered into class it smelled like sweat and my partner who was a guy wasn\u2019t talking to me. He acted like he knew everything and I immediately thought all the stereotypes I heard must be true. At the end of the class I realized most of the people in there had no clue what they were doing. I gave people who cared about learning the time of day and asked questions to female TAs and the female prof. \n\nOverall I can\u2019t complain to much on being a woman in CS. I feel like because I am a woman it gives me more merit if that makes sense. I get small recognition for the effort I put in here and there and even got recommendation to apply to a woman in CS scholarship. I would try to join a women\u2019s focused CS group because it sounds like you need something different.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA first year",
            "I feel this so hard. At least in my undergrad program, our class was at least somewhat split (70/30 maybe?) so I had a good group of female friends who I was able to work and get along with. In my grad program, it\u2019s heavily skewed male and the majority (70%+) are Indian international students (no hate, I\u2019m Indian too). A lot of the international Indian men here have grown up in parts of India where women are almost always stay-at-home mothers who are given no respect by society. When I\u2019m assigned to group projects with them I have to constantly think about whether they\u2019ll respect my choice of clothing and makeup, and it feels like a fight to earn their respect. At my internship this summer in big tech (FAANG adjacent) I was the only woman on the team who went to the office in-person.

Change will never happen without shining examples. I promise you don't have to do it alone. Others have already mentioned the organizations that exist for women in computer science. But you can get help much closer too. Look for allyship. Don't let the droning noise of the internet cloud your perspective. Not every programmer out there is a basement dweller looking for opportunities to raise themselves by putting others down.\n\nMy previous manager especially was one of the hardest working and best leaders I've ever seen in a developer team. She was hands on, always taking hard problems on to challenge herself. While somehow finding the time to deflect BS away from the rest of the engineers on the team. She offered wonderful mentorship and a kind of mental security to her team that made it the perfect place to learn and grow while having an impact in the greater organization. Great inclusive teams exist, and if we're all nurturing to those who will come after us we'll see them far more.",

All I can say as guy is that I've worked for two different companies this far where we had plenty of female engineers and I never saw anything remotely demeaning or sexist occcur toward them and they had a full seat at the table and provided just as much value as men. \n\nThat said, I live in the Midwest and neither company were FAANG or Fortune 500 tier companies so I'm beginning to suspect that when bigger egos are involved you see more shit like what you're seeing. Everywhere I've been has been chill and equitable. But just know that those places exist (and are thrilled for every competent engineer they get) and go find one once you're through.

            "You\u2019re a beneficiary of affirmative action. You will receive preferential treatment due to your gender, being showered with opportunities while men have to fight tooth and nail.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LYiFDcpX6sQ",
            "I am sorry you're having this experience. There's nothing I can add to it beyond \"I believe you,\" so I will refrain from trying. These are observations, not an argument:\n\nIn my college of CS (Northeastern), the dean was a woman, 4 out of my 5 professors were women, and probably about 3/4 of the professors were women. All of the servers were named after prominent feminists, so the name of a feminist would appear in your email address. (Back then, the name of the server appeared in your address.)  I learned most of what I know from women. I've had women as bosses. I've had women as peers. I've had women report to me. When I once had someone at an employer accuse me of misogyny, my response to HR was \"how many women do you want me to line up to state that I'm fine working with women?\" \n\nI am telling you this not to toot my own horn but to say that the industry you are training in is not the industry I've worked in for decades.\n\nI'm a gay man, so my perspective is a bit aside of everyone else's. I can stand aside and watch the world obsessing about gender, and laugh at it. \n\nSo, let's take the job interview process.\n\nWhen a man interviews and I'm talking to him with young straight men, they're hard on him that he has to have 100% of the skills we're looking for (even if they didn't when they interviewed), and he has to be absolutely perfectly behaved and immaculately dressed, or they won't approve of him. When a woman interviews and I'm talking to her with young straight men, they want to hire her. It doesn't matter if she's completely unqualified or doesn't even speak the language, they want to hire her, and if I point out that she doesn't know anything or that we can't actually communicate with her, they start making excuses. I have sometimes had to put my foot down and say \"no, I will not hire her, because I can't communicate with her/she knows nothing\" and force the issue, and even then I still get \"we should hire her instead\" for every candidate.\n\n(For the record, I tend to bring women and minorities into a workplace that doesn't have enough of them. \\[Not to \"balance\" things, but just because I hire people without preference to gender or race.\\] I am talking about when I interview a woman who is *unqualified*.)\n\nOnce she's on board, the differences don't end.\n\nI need to be very aware of my working relationship with *any* woman, because it has happened that everything seemed fine and then (for reasons that have nothing to do with me) she accused me of sexism to HR and tried to have me fired. (I was just a convenient scapegoat.) HR told me outright \"as a man, if *any* woman makes an accusation against you, you will be fired if you can't *prove* her wrong.\" (At one point a woman said that she's a lesbian and I discriminated against her because I hate gay people... my response to HR was \"my boyfriend works a few blocks away. Should I ask him to come by to give me a BJ in your office to prove I don't hate gay people?\")\n\nI've had several women colleagues claim \"you hate women because you're gay.\" (That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.) I worked with one woman who worked her way up the corporate ladder, despite knowing *absolutely nothing* about programming, by dressing provocatively in interviews, coming on to men in the interview (she had no idea that I'm gay, and the guy who would be her boss was there and saw it), and accusing any man who disagreed with her in any way, no matter how slightly or how politely, of being sexist, and telling HR she wouldn't sue if they fired him and promoted her. (She failed to observe that during the incident she complained about me for I had three witnesses to point out that it was minor and I was exceedingly polite.)\n\nIs all of that sexist? Yes. Is it likely to harm you as a woman? Not substantially.\n\nSo yes, you're facing misogyny in college, and I'm very sorry to hear it. As a gay atheist cripple, I know how awful it is to feel stuck somewhere that you are discriminated against. I see you said \"after 3 years at university\", which implies that if you're working on your undergraduate degree, you've probably got a year (or less) left. If so, I encourage you to finish it and look forward to a career in which you don't have to put up with that shit (not only because it's less common in the actual workplace, but because there are various government agencies that will intervene if they try it on you). If you're a bit behind and will take 2 more years to graduate, I encourage you to consider transferring to someplace where you will be better treated. If it's a graduate degree you're working on, I encourage you to look into transferring unless you're about to graduate.",

Regrettably, he has decided not to proceed with an offer for you, and he will continue his search for someone with stronger web development skills. He and the entire team really enjoyed meeting you and they were hoping to be able to make things work, but felt he could not compromise on the skill set he needs, due to the volume of work his teams has.\n\n \n\nPlease feel to reach out if you have additional questions. I will continue to keep you in mind for any other opening we may have that are a fit for your background.\n\n\nI am not sure what to do with only 30 days remaining in opt period. \"he could not compromise on the skill set he needs\" if this is the case why did they proceed with 8 rounds of interview. I am not sure how I feel now, getting rejections everywhere. Getting rejected after I feel everything went well.\n\nAny advice or suggestions are highly appreciated. \n\n\nEdit : Thank you all for your support. This made me feel I am not alone. Everytime I feel like this is the lowest point, another lowest point comes along the way. But I am gonna move forward with the job search and hopefully some light comes at the end.",

So I wouldn\u2019t pay attention to the specifics, and just treat it as a generic rejection.",

Highly unlikely, unless you do something egregious like cause an HR issue.\n\nCan you not receive a return offer? A little more likely if you underperform, but I would say as an intern, this is more dependent on how well you took your assignments and showed a positive attitude and your willingness and ability to learn over the summer, not really how much of a rockstar coder you were.\n\nYou may not finish the project, or you may be a little slow, but those aren\u2019t factors that would make me want to write off a return offer for someone.",

If you have absolutely no idea about coding, you won't even be fires then, maybe you'll be let go just before your internship ends as sort of an \"dishonourable discharge\"\n\nWhat you want to do as an intern is not to compare your knowledge with your peers or try to act like you know what they're talking about, your job is to be positive, support the team you're assigned to however you can, find ways to be useful and never make them say the same thing twice while improving everyday.",

Certainly, every company varies a little bit what they expect from you but the bottom line is that you're there to learn from them, you are **not** a contributor to the company. You are not there to lift business-critical loads, at least not by yourself, and you hold no responsibility other than the responsibility to go in and be an information sponge and soak up as much experience as you can.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd even if you are making business-critical contributions, you're seldom on your own and are likely in a team or shadowing someone that *is* full-time and bears the necessary responsibilities, *(and they would be responsible for you)*. If there were expectations for you to know certain things beforehand then it was the company's responsibility to catch that in the interviewing process. And if they expected you to know a certain tool or language beforehand and do a job as a professional then they'd pay you as a professional.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't worry too much about what you do or don't know, going in, and/or how your code will be used, if at all, in the future. I'll be honest with ya, it's likely that any code you write will get tossed or shelved the second you leave. *(I'm fairly certain that's what happened to my code at the end of my internships, anyways, lol)*.
