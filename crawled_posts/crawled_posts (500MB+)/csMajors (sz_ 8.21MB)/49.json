Leetcode, system design, behaviorals, mock interviews, all that jazz. \n\nI had many setbacks: a Facebook hiring freeze, a rejection from Amazon and Google.\n\nTomorrow I start my first day at Microsoft and I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled! I found a team that seems really great to work with and I think it\u2019s gonna be a good product for my career growth.\n\nI feel like the moral I learned here is that if and when you\u2019re ready to change something about your life, the world is waiting for you. Considering how many great tech companies there are, if you\u2019re willing to put in the work for a few months you **will** get in somewhere. It\u2019s a numbers game. Be patient, work hard, and live a balanced life and you will make it.",

I probably would've been done applying to internships if I hadn't gotten this one after the interviews. It's a small company in my home town (also small, lol). It's close enough for me to walk to (but I don't even have to do that, with it being completely virtual now).\n\nAnd it all happened by pure chance. My dad saw the sign for the company on a walk, and aske the head of recruiting if they had any internship openings. She said they don't normally do internships, but to send my resume anyways and they'll see what they can do. So I gave him my resume, which he sent to her, one thing led to another, and here I am! My resume isn't even anything special. I only have a 3.3 GPA, no projects on my resume. Only other job was as a dishwasher for 8 months. I don't know what they liked about my resume, but hey, I'm not complaining!\n\nAlso, I'm going to be paid $25/hr! I was hoping for $20, but would've taken literally anything, so I'm really happy in terms of compensation!! I'm really hoping I do well, maybe even well enough to get a full time offer at the end! Last semester (really, the past 3 semesters, but this spring especially) has been absolute hell for me between the pandemic, isolation, depression, anxiety, all that good stuff. I was feeling completely hopeless and suicidal in May. But now things are finally looking up for me!\n\nI don't mean to brag or anything, I'm just really happy that I finally have an internship and don't have to worry as much about being able to find a job after I graduate. I just hope that someone in a similar situation to me sees this and realizes that there's still hope, even for us average people",

Drivers earn every bit of that 170k package through blood, sweat and tears. Literal blood, sweat and tears. UPSers are working 24/7 to get those packages delivered. Lifting upwards of 100 lbs at a time, managing ever changing and difficult delivery scenarios and working through any type of severe weather you can imagine. UPS does not care how cold/hot/icy/rainy/shitty it may be. You\u2019re not going home at night until that package car is empty, and only if there\u2019s no other drivers that need help after you finish. Drivers sacrifice a LOT of their personal time and work/life balance is virtually non existent until you reach the top tiers of seniority. Kiss your family goodbye over the holidays, you will have no time to do anything but work, eat while driving and hopefully get a little sleep at night. The job is hard on your body and it takes a really strong minded person to take this up as a career. \n\nI\u2019m just sitting back and laughing at all the comments I see lately. A lot of people think they can handle that job given the paycheck, but I can promise you, more people tap out within the first few months than you could ever imagine .",

From what my father has told me, you have to spend years working there part time getting paid only a bit more than minimum wage before you can even get offered the package car job. Even then, be prepared to physically destroy your body and have no work life balance. Many part timers refuse to even take the driver job due to how intense it is, even with that massive raise. Even then, less than half the people make it to that point with plenty quitting the part time job within the first week or even day. Also, that $170k number isn't even accurate, that number includes health care as part of the value. Actual salary is more in line with $110-120k.",

Anyway, I was in like 2nd year CS I think, so sorting algorithms and their complexity were fresh in my mind.  I sorted them by student ID - I think i used bubble sort.\n\nThe second one, was I think 3rd year.  I had an assignment to write a Roman numeral calculator, in assembly; MC68k I believe - I know, I\u2019m old.  I can\u2019t remember what class it was for though.

        "selftext": "CS majors complain about \u201cdiversity hiring\u201d and programs designed to benefit underrepresented minorities like it\u2019s going out of style. Those people, who are passing the hiring bar, are not why you aren\u2019t getting past interviews. A large number of programs  designed to uplift minorities are generally just providing mentorship and interview prep which you can get anywhere if you look for connections. For example, your school. Things like GHC where companies attend that are looking to increase the number of women in software engineering are not getting unqualified women. They can pass the hiring bar. Some programs, like ColorStack, which are more selective, partner with companies for internships. But you have to apply to get into those. And the people who apply that aren\u2019t in those programs aren\u2019t being affected by the company\u2019s partnership with a third party. Otherwise they would just reserve applications for those in the programs they partner with.\n\n Companies want to increase the number of underrepresented demographics in tech because they value diversity. When you\u2019re lamenting about how terrible it is that these programs exist, you\u2019re telling on yourself in a major way that you don\u2019t care whatsoever about diversity in tech. And for people who say it should be income based, not race based, plenty of FLI programs exist for that exact reason. The goal of companies is to increase the number of certain demographics in tech because they\u2019re historically underrepresented, and companies value diversity. Diversity in income/background is included in this (which is why these FLI programs exist). And minorities make up *such* a small number of tech applicants . They\u2019re not \u201cstealing\u201d your job. \n\nAnother major complaint is that it\u2019s unfair that minorities have access to programs designed to increase representation. But the tech sector is *still* so sparsely populated by black, Latinx, Pacific Islander people and women of any race that clearly, these programs aren\u2019t having a monumental impact. And you\u2019re not failing every interview you\u2019ve gotten because some unqualified minority stole your spot.\n\nThen there\u2019s the anecdotal stories that people like to throw out which they insist prove their point- about how their female/minority classmates are objectively worse than them and how they didn\u2019t pass an interview or couldn\u2019t get a job but their female/minority classmate did. To say that without having spoken to the same interviewer that you had when interviews are *so* variable is insane. You could say that about anyone. And, as a note, there is a factor of companies *wanting* diversity because diversity leads to innovation. People with different backgrounds and experiences are important to success. So when you have a severe lack of people with certain backgrounds, it makes sense you want to seek them out. \n\nIf women become over represented in tech, it would make sense to prioritize hiring. If black people become over represented in tech, it would make sense to end the programs designed to bring more in. But that\u2019s not the case right now.\n\nAlso, a lot of you guys have horrific social skills and are likely extremely abrasive or unpleasant in the behavioral section of your interviews. Factor that in.\n\nEDIT: There is one point being brought up repeatedly which I didn\u2019t originally address- and that is how these programs are for under represented minorities, but do not generally include Asian people. I figured that would be obvious as to why. The programs are for groups of people that are under represented in tech. Asian people are over represented. These programs are designed to get more people from groups that are not present in the tech sphere into tech. If anything, it proves that these DEI initiatives and AA are not here just for the sake of minorities, and that they are specifically designed to increase the number of under repped tech applicants. Now, an argument is also being made that it\u2019s unfair if Asian people from overwhelmingly one ethnic background are being represented, but Asian people are still being considered as over represented despite this. That issue lies in how the US defines race and is a much deeper issue- but I wholeheartedly agree that it is an unfair categorization of way too many people.",

I connect over many of the things in my background before we get into the interview, Legend of Zelda posters, Star Fox figures, D&D minis, My piano, a shirt I'm wearing.

Why the hell should a company hire 20% white, 20% Asian, 20% Hispanic, and 20% black and 20% mixed? If you do the simple math then you will have a vast majority of under qualified black people in the role. That\u2019s not racist, that just what basic statistics would tell you if you know how to read a bell curve is and assume skill level is normally distributed. You\u2019ll run out of all the competent black developers and be left with incompetent ones filling roles. If you\u2019re okay with that then that\u2019s a different argument.

In 20+ years in the field, I've always been active in hiring because I have a vested interest in who I work with.  I don't care about their gender, race, religion, age, orientation, etc.  However, at multiple fortune 500 companies, I was told to ask easier questions to women and non-whites/Indians.  One of the best engineers I worked with was never viewed as an engineer by upper management, but only as a black man.  A bonus point on their hiring numbers.  It's really disgusting how many people in this field think that the underrepresented groups just can't code.  If people didn't have those notions, we wouldn't even need diversity hiring.

I'm not sure if company I am involved in is just too draconic on this DEI thing but there are certain DEI metrics/quotas that need to be met that impact your bonuses and chances of promotion on a personal level and on a regional level these metrics impact how much support your location will receive from global in terms of helping you grow / expense internal projects / pool for bonuses/training etc. So everyone tries to hit those metrics and it really does get absurd I feel at times - for people who tick our boxes we have so many funnels - special bootcamps, lower interview standards, way higher chance to higher interns for full time positions even if their performance during internship/bootcamp was not good etc. And what is the end result? Do we get the benefits of diverse backgrounds and opinions that enhance our deliveries? Maybe, but we also have a lot of people who are underperforming from those DEI funnels that fail to be independent/productive more than a year after hiring (in addition to being extremely hard to put on PIP / fire due to negative impacts on metrics), we have special positions created that really are not needed to put our DEI hires etc. We also have some great and diverse people that are exceptional developers and that would not need this lower bar for hiring and DEI quotas. The idea that the solution to people being underrepresented is to shovel unqualified candidates into positions where they are a net drain to team productivity and struggle themselves is just puzzling and does not improve the perception of those groups in the industry at all.",

            "I see many people in this thread downplaying diversity, when companies want diversity is because lead to better desicions, for example one woman could suggest a feature for an app that would save stay at home wife a lot of time that no matter how smart is the white guy it would never come up with, the companies do everything for revenue so you can expect diversity brings money to the table,if it wasn't the case they would stop doing.",

            "I just think those programs are immoral.\n\nIt's not that I feel they provide adequate competition or are taking up my interview time.  I could and have passed interviews my entire life as if they were nothing.\n\nFor reference I am a self-taught foreigner.  I came to the USA when I was 4 years old.  I was raised in the ghetto.  My family's first dinner table was a door on top of two trash canisters.\n\nI know anecdotal experience isn't objective data and I concede that point.  That being said my lived experience tells me any asshole with an internet connection, time, and inhuman persistence can do what I do.\n\nI've worked for banks, big tech, startups, and all sorts of other shit and never have I encountered what I would deem as a restrictive amount of racism or sexism.\n\nSo my opinion is these programs aren't required.  My other opinion is if you think the diversity hires are taking your spot you are delusionally wrong.\n\nAs a leader in the company I work for now I would sacrifice a small child to Satan for competent engineers.  I don't care if you are fucking purple and from the planet shmushmu. If you can convince me you can actually build things without being fucking retarded about it then you are making 200k plus.  \n\nThe end.\n\nAnything short of this would be ludicrously stupid on my part.

Our manager wanted at least 1 female engineer to backfill a role, and we passed up on quality male candidates to get more female employees to up our diversity numbers. She was still a great candidate and I loved working with her but we did prioritize her cause of her gender. If we didn't have that priority would we have hired her? Probably not. Was she a good hire? Yea. You can have win/wins in these scenarios. The only one that loses is the the person we rejected cause he was a guy, but I'm sure he's fine",

            "I do not have the time to go through all these comments, but judging by the length of the comment section, you are clearly not seeing things from our perspective as well.  When the system does not favor oneself, it is easy to see the flaws.\n\nThe problem is not diversity hiring, it is the underrepresenting of majority demographics in tech.  White men have had it good for awhile, so because of this, I have to work harder than my peers to be seen.  Okay, not that big of a deal.  But that is not where it stops.  \n\nCompanies try to hire equal amounts of men and women for instance.  That is obviously cool, right?  Our perspective is no, but why?  The percent of women in the degree is far, I mean, FAR less.  The hiring rates should be based on that to make it fair.  That is what I mean.\n\nAs an example, Lockheed Martin gives out 200 scholarships a year, and good ones.  ($10,000)  However, look at their stats.  https://lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/communities/stem-education/lm-scholarship-program.html\n\n- 60% underrepresent racial group\n- 24% LGBTQIA+\n- 49% women (I am actual okay with this number here honestly)\n\nA white straight guy looks at this and says, well, I should not even bother, even if they are highly qualified.\n\nBut the big thing is, if you have a degree, YOU HAVE A DEGREE!  Why are we still pushing for over representing minorities because of cultural problems beyond this point?\n\nTLDR:  \nLook from our perspective.  White guys are constantly told they picked the wrong color and sex at birth when it comes to hiring, school applications, scholarship choices.  It happens non stop, all day.  It really gets exhausting being told I have white privilege when I see otherwise all day.",
            "If 3% of applicants are black, 3% of talent hired should be black. If you argue against that, you're lying to yourself to claim that it is not putting others at a disadvantage. \n\nThe solution to the problem is to target improving childhood education for lower income areas, which are primarily black dominant at the moment. Increasing the number of black applicants to universities and workplaces is the only fair way to solve the problem.",
            "> Companies want to increase the number of underrepresented demographics in tech because they value diversity. When you\u2019re lamenting about how terrible it is that these programs exist, you\u2019re telling on yourself in a major way that you don\u2019t care whatsoever about diversity in tech.\n\nI dont care whatsoever about diversity in tech. Why would I?\n\nDiversity brings only conflicts, from different error-cultures, leadership cultures, communication cultures, etc. I will always prefer to work in a homogenous team, because it minimizes conflict and is smooth sailing with competent people for the task we want to accomplish.\n\nPlease explain to me how having indian or black or hispanic people increase \"innovation\" in tech. It does not.",

I only got through rounds and received an offer after I stopped applying to companies which prefer diversity. \n\nYou truly have no idea how it feels to see a dumbass (college project partner) get into Walmart labs. I helped her clear the OA. I have nothing against her, I have everything against the system.\n\nShe's an extremely nice person, however I would unalive myself if I ever have to work with her. I say this to her face all the time and she agrees with me. I don't blame her, I respect that she took advantage of the system as we all should. There was a bit of jealousy initially but then I realized that I shouldn't be mad at her, she's only looking out for herself. \n\nWe should collectively stop applying to companies who prefer diversity. At least, that's what I did and I'm grateful I did that. Blame the game, not the player. \n\nHowever, stop pretending it doesn't matter. It does matter to those who sacrificed their entire college life and just kept grinding.\n\nLook out for smaller companies, no name companies, mature startups, etc. They don't give a shit about Diversity. Stay away from MAANG. It's an infectious disease. Ultimately, if you want to work on the backend like me, the best shot you'll have is to go for companies that process a lot of data. \n\nYou'll never encounter a massive scale like MAANG but there's no need to know everything. And bonus points, you won't have to be near MAANG-tards. I say this because while there are some extremely smart people in MAANG (obviously), most of the people came there as a goal. It will suck working with pompous people like that. \n\nI'm currently in a late stage startup and I'm loving it. I'm not as highly paid as MAANG but I'm happy here and I'm learning a TON.

There are a lot more unfair things about tech recruitment then our friends at the Women in Computing club getting the opportunity to chat with a recruiter interested in diversity occasionally. It's not 100% fair, since there are a lot of asian and white guys who had to overcome lots of circumstances to get into CS but are treated as atypical applicants, but I see why it's there and I don't think the intention is to be racist or sexist.\n\nI hope we can stop talking about this and just agree to disagree.
