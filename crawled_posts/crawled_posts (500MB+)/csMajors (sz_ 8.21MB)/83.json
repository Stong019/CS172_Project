Its actually insane how energetic it makes me feel.\n\n Maybe i will get burnout in the future but for now i want to enjoy it as much as possible.

And I do believe that knowing data structures and algorithms is useful. With that being said, I haven't performed any search, binary tree, list, or DP algorithms since I've been working. It's so dumb and it should not be used as a metric in deciding if someone can be an effective software engineer or not. Personal projects and the ability to verbally explain the work they've done should be used rather than doing a binary search on a string.",

            "I think OAs are okay because it levels the playing field + shows work ethic. \n\nAnyone willing to grind out and study data structures solely for the basis of getting job shows some serious commitment. Even if it's a bit wasted effort, it's a easy baseline to show someone's work ethic and prove they aren't lazy.\n\nBut more importantly it evens the playing field. I don't have any connections. First gen college student in entire extended family. I dont go to a top CS college. I'm not particularly outgoing or extroverted. All these factors work against me and really are out of my control.\n\nWhat do I have? The ability to put effort into studying data structures, and a fair even playing ground where I can be objectively compared against other candidates based on coding test scores.\n\nConnections only go so far until you can't pass a coding test. Naturally good at talking only goes so far until you can't pass a test. I think OAs prevent bias in initial screening and make the playing field fairer. \n\nSomeone coming from educated successful family who goes to top 10 school with tons of charisma will forever look better than me on paper. I can't compete with that. But giving a prereq coding test and deciding who to move to the next rounds based on that? Thats fair. The amount of effort you put into studying and prepping is a variable that you can control, making it a fair place to judge from.",

            "You forget the main idea that 100s of thousands of people apply to a single swe position. Now of that 100,000 ppl, 30000 pass the resume screen and 15000 can easily watch some YouTube video and start some API implementation/debugging through a interview or HackerRank, but only 5000 or less of those applicants actually have the logical and implementation skills to do a LC medium. A large purpose of LC is a filtering technique. Anybody can lie about projects pretty easily",
            "It proves they\u2019re a competent coder though. Which for most companies is a baseline requirement for a swe no ? So maybe should be weighted differently but has to have a place in recruitment imo.",

            "Agreed. Maybe not useless, cause it can provide a good foundation on recognizing efficient code, but that'll come with good work experience. Grinding leetcode is just memorizing patterns and algorithms, anyone can do it if you keep practicing.\n\nIn the real world, knowing proper systems design, coding design patterns, knowing how and when to google for answers is way more realistic. When or if you ever actually reach the point where you need to code something that requires heavy algorithms that for whatever reason isn't already implemented in a library for easy use, you'll be able to google for the most efficient algorithm for your use case anyway.",
            "Dude we all know it\u2019s an intelligence (IQ) test. You\u2019re not the first to discover that LC problems have zero application in real life. And to a large extent they do measure intelligence, problem solving ability, and show case your way of thinking.",
            "Sweet.\n\nDo you have an efficient way to comb through thousands, if not more applications to reduce them to an amount where it's cost effective (or even makes sense) to start giving them more attention with actual human hours?\n\nNo?\n\nNice, so it's the same post repeated all over again.\n\nIt's not the best system, no. But it's the best they have at scale. Sure, you'll cut off a good number of qualified candidates, but at the same time, you'll get a lot more through to the next round.\n\nAutomated OA's are kind of a solution at scale-- if you're a small company or a company not getting a large amount of apps, yeah, don't do this. If you're getting tens of thousands-- you've got a lot more to gain than lose.\n\nSure, it sucks for the applicants. But it's not for the applicants' benefit-- it's for the company's.",
            "I disagree with this. In order to solve a leetcode problem during a job interview you need at least to think and create something useful and efficient that solves the problem which a lot of people don't want to do and this serves as the first filter to know you and see if you can perform well as a software engineer.\n\nSomething completely different is people not wanting to study or grind leetcode if they are not good enough at it. Despite the technical interview there are a lot of things going on during the time the interviwer is asking you about your experience. Don't think this only the leetcode problem.  \n\n\nI keep making this analogy with mathematics. Probably an engineer does not need the hard math that is taught at university level and you won't use it if you're not getting into academy (masters or PhD) but what you do need is to think in an abstract way, come out with a feasible solution to a problem and provide proofs, that reasoning is what math can teach you.",
            "Leetcode is purely there so that the process can be automated. It is not about whether or not it will cover a part of your actual career - it won't. Anyone who actually writes their own sort implementation (for example) as part of work should have their head examined.",
            "Most tests are really easy though. It\u2019s just there to prove you\u2019re a competent coder that can work under pressure.",
            "Yeah but you could essentially say that about a degree aswell. Doesn't teach you any tangible skills for the workforce. More of proving that you have the confidence/discipline to complete it and can do so in a competitive market. Sure it gives you a good introduction to the industry and gives you a head start, but more of proving to the employee that your atleast competent.\n\nRemember you don't just get tested on your leet code skills. Alot of it has to do with personality and how you present yourself. The practical programming are to just tick one box of many.",

            "It\u2019s to filter out dummies who just google solutions .",
            "I mean leetcode style questions might not be useful for you, but consider the companies perspective. These types of questions are a quick and easy format that can be used to test new potential employees. The interviewers save a ton of time using these types of questions, and that can't be ignored. They may not be the best way to judge somebody's actual skill as a SWE, but it is good enough for their purposes. If you can show up, solve a few mediums, and have decent enough code while doing so then that still says something.\n\nIt's really hard to evaluate a large number of people quickly and thoroughly. That is why schools almost always have a curriculum and use tests for evaluation. These companies could waste tons of money testing everybody thoroughly and the benefits might not even be worth it.",
            "The only place that I applied to that didn't ask traditional leetocde type questions was mcKinsey. I just did their hackerrank OA yesterday. 5 questions. They were about making sql queries, a simple web page and express calls.",
            "Isn't it because its easier to evaluate and filter based leetcode than personal projects? My guess is that the probability that a new hire that leetcode is a better engineer than one who doesn't is somewhat significative (for some unknown reason). These big tech companies spend a lot of money on the interviews,  so that's why I guess their data must show some correlation. \n\nAlso, in my first dev job I used a sliding window approach to improve some query times. Then I did an internship where I used basic linear algebra base transformation to reuse some already implemented functions (I worked with some graphic stuff). My feeling is that those things are not frequent, but they do appear sometimes. But you are going to see it only if you already know that type of stuff. I'm not claiming that it is very useful, it's just that it is not useless.",
            "I think the minimum requirement for most of the jobs, especially those from the big tech, is a computer science degree.\n\nIf data structures and algorithms are fundamental cs concepts, then anyone who holds a cs degree should have studied them and these concepts are expected to be on their finger tips by the time they thought of joining one of the big techs because only a proof of that can show you read cs and actually understand these concepts, and one of the platforms to help you prepare for this challenge is Leetcode.",
            "Personally I think the main value in Leetcode is less about the algorithmic understanding and more about the ability to identify schemas in high level problem descriptions. I can implement any data structure you ask me to, but the ability to identify which one I need out of a newly worded context stumps me way more than it should. \n\nIt's helps you weed out people who can solve a math problem on a piece of paper from people who can come up with a solution based on abstract factors in the real world. In real life, that solution usually ends up being very specific and non-algorithmically intensive but I think people underestimate how impressive being able to tell what leetcode \"template\" they're looking at in a stressful interview setting is.",
            "No i disagree software engineering is saturated with boot camp grads and even people with degree who don\u2019t necessarily have the skill to be in the field the tests help filter out some of the people who have no skill . True sometimes they are too hard i myself struggle with some of these assessments during my current senior year application process but the grinding makes us better",
