Without additional financial support you would, on average, barely be living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nFor the numbers:\n\n $20/hr is $41,600/yr before taxes and with the most recent tax bracket rates is $33,548/yr if you forego all health insurance and ignore social security and retirements contributions. That's  $2796 a month. Median rent is $1700 and 35% of everyone rents.\n\nAverage sums for utilities, internet and phone bills from 2021 and 2022 values was \\~$469.\n\nYou're looking at around $600 a month to pay for health insurance, transportation,  food and state taxes and misc fees. Should I bother bringing up that average health insurance cost eats this up alone or that all but the cheapest state have food costs of around half or more of this? \n\nStop thinking people should be happy with permanent financial struggle you tone-deaf tool. You sharing expenses with someone else doesn't remove the expenses of single-income homes. You being used to poverty conditions while sinking into debt as a student doesn't make it normal. Other workers being exploited with little or no pay does not make these numbers you're justifying suddenly afford more. How old are you? Do you realize you are trading in years of your life and the start of otherwise formative career years for better prospects only to be so happy making just enough that a flat tire or surprise Dr. visit will make you go hungry for only half a month.

The introductory sequence weed out courses (Intro to Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms) which before had around 50-75 students on average with half dropping out and only 2 sections available now have 3 separate sections with each one filled to the brim with 150 students, 70 students, and 70 for the third as well.\n\nThe Data Structures and Algorithms course for this Spring semester across all sections has 250 students... so not very many are getting weeded out it would appear.\n\nBefore in the upper level courses like Compilers, Networking, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture the classes would be very small and intimate since only a few original majors would have survived and made it to that point. It used to be like guaranteed class sizes of maybe 20 people, 25 at most.\n\nComputer Architecture for this semester has 90 people in it. Operating Systems which before had only one section with around 25 max capacity now has 50 students, along with another section they had to open to accommodate another 30.\n\nCompilers, which is supposed to be an extremely upper level 500 level course, has 90 PEOPLE in it this semester.\n\nThis shit is crazy y'all.",

But then again, a person can prolly learn leetcode separately.\n\n2) chatgpt. people not caring to even review the answers they get on discord, instead they plug it into chatgpt and get the assignment out. easy bingo. and with chatgpt its become easier to learn the material as opposed to having to find the right yt vid anyways. so people relying on chatgpt (in the wrong way) will prolly not be in ur competition range too, assuming you work fairly\n\nor maybe number 3, people are just getting smarter. i mean nothing you can do there, except hope you have referrals or hope you're extra good at dsalgo",

The difference is that for software engineering that time is hidden: some started coding/debugging when they were kids, some code many more hours per week. And all that time goes into relevant understanding of how software systems work, to something they will be able to use later at work.\n\nSo a good engineer actually spends much more time learning - it's just not as formalized as with doctors. A teenager interested in brain surgeries can't just do brain surgeries on cats in her free time after school. A teenager who likes coding for Minecraft can.\n\nSo yeah, people who just superficially motivated, and who spend only like 4 years total, they just won't cut it and will eventually move on to something else.",
