That was confusing as this call was for an internship and not for his incubator so I asked to make sure this call was for the internship. He looked like something was wrong for a second but confirmed that I'm in the right place.\n\nHe commented I seem like a founder then talked about crypto for a few minutes (buzzword dump).\n\nAfter that, he asked another question out of left field. \n\nHe explained that his VC is an \"ecosystem\" of mid-career professionals and angel investors. Then he asked, \"which of those options are you?\" Well, I'm obviously not in any of those categories (which he'd know from my resume) so I was confused and asked what he meant.\n\nThe second I asked that he just stared at me through the screen in an awkward silence for no joke 30 seconds, doesn't answer my question, says \"ok we're ending it here\" like I'm a dog that rolled in shit, and just hangs up leaving me in the call with his fucking AI note taker.\n\nI guess I failed the culture test. \n\nWhat.

            "As a hiring manager at a big tech company I can 100% confirm that a female will get a role over a male if all else is equal. The same goes if you are Black, Native or Hispanic. However, sometimes roles are specifically targeted for only female hires for diversity metric purposes, we won't state this on the job application though.\n\nWhen I was hiring for 2 positions last year, i was explicitly given the instruction from my seniors that I needed to hire 2 females on to our team to boost our female to male ratio in our organisation as we were lower than other organisations in the company. \n\nI work for a FAANG company.\nI totally disagree with this and even gave a little push back on to hiring whoever is best fit for the role, however leadership was adamant in raising our diversity score for the org.\n\nIt took 6 long months to fill the 2 positions as 99% of the applicants were male. We still conducted interviews so we could have \"future potential applicants\" if required later on. \nThe 2 women that were eventually hired was a referral, while the other was an internal hire coming in from a totally different role with little to no experience or crossover.",

            "\"I applied to a single company and my friend got in but I didn't - the job market is fucked.\" - that's how it reads to me.\n\nSome of you really don't know what \"a job market that's fucked\" looks like. It's a market, where you struggle for months to get a minimum wage job you are going to hate.\n\nYou are shooting for a job in field where there are many open positions and the money is good. The market here is far from being fucked.\n\nPutting that aside, you seen to approach your situation already with a particular judgement in mind. If this wasn't about your scores, how do you know it was about your gender? Maybe it was about soft skills. Maybe they just found your friend more communicative. Maybe it was because they liked her more for possibly the most absurd, unexplainable reason - we have already detached ourselves from judging candidates simply by their hard skills the moment we assumed that your score was truly better. There's more than your scores and gender that goes into consideration when hiring people. If I were to take a bet, I'd say that more recruiters care about your soft skills and character, rather than your gender. \n\nOr maybe they found you to be overquaified for the position.\n\nIf this was a diversity hire thing, because that's possibility too - their loss, probably. There are plenty of other companies that should welcome you.\n\nEDIT: I'm wondering why the company would even bother interviewing you if the incredible level of advantage you described over your friend was still supposedly less significant than your genders. They could've thrown your application right to trash the moment they saw another one, with women's name on it if that was the case. If, like most IT companies, this company has more men than women employees, I would find it hard to believe that all those \"extra\" male employees in that company are some Einsteins for which they've made an exception due to their insane coding skills. And you were applying for an internship, where the expectations regarding hard skills are typically way lower.",
            "This is normal.  You are not competing against your friend.  You are competing against all the other men of your background/ethnicity who are applying for the same position.\n\nThere are X slots for people like you.  Y slots for people like your friend.  If the quality of competition your friend is against is worse, the requirements are naturally going to be lower.\n\nThink of it like business.  If your customer base is poor, you will need to price low to make the sale.  If your customer base is rich, you will jack up prices to get whatever price the market will pay.\n\nCompanies absolutely do this for hiring.  They \"price\" employees the same way, between diversity targets to meet political/social guidelines and staffing level targets to meet payroll guidelines (junior staff = lesser compensation).\n\nThis has been the way since time started.  This fantasy folks have about meritocracy in employment is crazy.  Wait till you find out most of the best roles are filled by referrals, who you know, business networking, backdoor relationships, etc...",
            "ngl a lot of people here are boiling it down to affirmative action, which i don't doubt contributed to their decision. HOWEVER if she genuinely was not at a level to meet their technical expectations they would've easily found another female applicant who was a stronger choice.\n\nOP said himself they had similar stats, she cleared the OA, and it sounds like she was able to complete most of the final design interview with the exception of understanding APIs, which imo is something that can be easily taught with a workshop.\n\nSo to me it sounds like she's below OPs technical skill level, but above the minimum skill level the company was looking for in hiring. Most companies nowadays look for interns who meet their expectation AND have exceptional soft skills / teamwork / extracurriculars / creativity / leadership / etc. They would pick someone like that over a candidate who exceeds their technical expectation but has nothing to show for themself as an individual, and no track record of being a good team player/collaborator to be a good company fit.\n\nIt's awful to work on a team with someone with a chip on their shoulder. Even if they are the best in their technical skills it makes for a worse off team with worse off results. Especially in the context of internships- recruiters and managers care about personality and potential a lot more than they did 5 years ago since the applicant pool of candidates who already meet their technical expectations is so large.",

Maybe you were too experienced or maybe they want someone who hasnt picked up habits and can be developed in a different way.

            "As a female minority, I plan on exploiting this reality to the fullest extent. \n\nIt's weird. If you're born to rich parents and their wealth helps you go to good schools and meet important people and help you get job, people talk shit about it. \n\nHowever no one blames you for taking advantage of your good luck. \n\nBecause no one earns the right to having good parents. \n\nIf a bout of luck falls into your lap and you somehow end up meeting someone who can introduce you to an important person or recommend you for a good ass job,  no one shames you for taking it. Because it's \"not fair\" that you happened to be in the right place at the right time. \n\nIf you're good looking and you're given preferential treatment for that. Is it fair? Fuck no. But attractive men and women don't go out of their way to turn down all the benefits their appearence gets them due to unconscious bias. \n\nIf you're tall you won't turn down the perception of being smarter or stronger or making a better leader or looking competence or being seen as intimidating in all the right ways because nature saw fit to make you tall. \n\nAsians don't do anything to discourage the positive image of them being smart, good at math, good at computers and science. And having massive connections within tech fields that give them an advantage of come pre-loaded with a bias that they're good in certain fields and are hard working as a group. \n\nWhich is funny because I lived for years in Asia. Most Asians are average AF. The really smart ones immigrate. The regular degular ones and the degenerates get left behind in the motherland. \n\nBut for some bizarre reason, people think that minorities and women and other underrepresented groups should be ashamed of or turn down the blatant bias of being systematically shown to us to \"level the playing field\" by a bunch of companies paying hundreds of thousands of dollars because it's not fair to everyone else? \n\nFUCK THAT BULLSHIT. \n\nBe a martyr for what? \n\nMy minority female ass is about to exploit the hell out of this reality. I'm glad there are not many WOC in tech. It's gonna make it easier for me to get in. \n\nDoesn't matter if you're a diversity hire. That reality doesn't stop your work ethic or your ability to learn and be an asset. I'm smart and hard working. And if being a minority and female gets me an extra push, then push my ass, bitch. \n\nIf people resent me for it, I'll shrug because just like people who lucked into being born into a rich family with deep connections, just like people born beautiful or tall or with genius IQ, I lucked into majoring in CS at a time where there aren't many like me and I have zero shame about it. \n\nI would expect anyone else to do the same. And people always do the same.\n\nIt's a delusion to think the world has ever been fair. It's never been fair. \n\nMost men didn't really care much about women not having rights or freedomsgir hundreds of years. Because it mostly didn't negatively affect them. Most white people weren't pressed about the advantages they were given for being white and the disadvantages colored people were given for being the wrong color because it didn't affect them. \n\nMost people born in first world countries don't spend an excessive amount of time sitting around lamenting the lives of people starving or dying right now in third world countries. You'd never give up your access to education, Healthcare, clean water etc to them. \n\nWe all take full advantage of whatever privilege is handed to us. That's just human nature. \n\nSo I'm not gonna be any different. I'm not dying on the hill of \"but it's not fair\" for you. You wouldn't for me. \n\nIs it fair to Asian or White males? No. I can admit that. \n\nBut, since it doesn't affect me. Sucks to suck, I guess.\u270c\ufe0f",

That one would be in the plus column, but not really huge unless it\u2019s in an applicable field. \n\nBottom line: since you both have no experience and no internships, you\u2019re going to be assumed to be almost identical on paper (because you both went to the same school and took the same classes). You\u2019re going to have to be taught from square 1 how to work in an office and collaborate on non-school projects. At that point, personality fit matters WAY more than technical skills. As your hiring manager, I know I\u2019m going to have to train you how to do certain technical things. I\u2019m fine with that. I really don\u2019t want to have to train you on how to fit into the corporate culture (or show up on time/shower daily, etc. Not saying this is you, but you\u2019d be surprised how unaware some entry-level candidates are). Your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 got you an interview, but the vibes you each put off in the interview determined who got the offer. \n\nNone of this is to say that you did anything wrong! You may have both done great, but she may have connected slightly better with the interviewers on a personal level. Who knows? Diversity was probably a factor, but technical skills and even answers to technical questions were a DISTANT 3rd place compared to personality-fit in your interviews. \n\nAgain, none of this is accusing you of messing up in your interview\u2014but it would be difficult for the two of you to accurately gage how the interviewers connected with you based solely on your own individual testimonies of how it went (unless one of you bombed it and the other hit it off really well). \n\nThis also doesn\u2019t apply to any non-entry level hiring experience. Once you\u2019ve got job experience (or even internship experience) technical ability matters more, just because we expect to not have to teach you as much once you\u2019re on-boarded. Entry level we expect to have to re-teach you pretty much everything regardless of how good your grades were in school, so those are almost completely personality-hires (once we\u2019re assured you meet the bare minimum threshold for technical competence).",
            "I think people tend to forget who we choose to hire and why.  Many believe the concept that more experience or knowledge makes for a better prospect.\n\nWhen I hire, your ability either makes it past a default threshold I've set for the position and pay band or it doesn't.  Everything else about you is then taken into account for a comfortable workplace.  That's it.\n\nIf I'm hiring a retail manager for a C-store, I don't need an MBA.  If it's between a man and a woman with the exact same skills but the store staff is currently 90% female?  I'm hiring the female candidate.  Even if the male candidate has 3 years more experience.\n\nHow you are perceived and responded to by the people who work around you is more important than additional skillsets.  You can teach people almost anything about a job, but I can't teach social skills.",

When we were discussing who would get offers and who wouldn\u2019t, I remember the hiring manager saying, \u201cshe may not have been the most impressive in the technical interview, but she\u2019s a woman.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that this happens but it\u2019s a reality we have to deal with, even in Piazza you get a special badge just for being a woman engineer. For the record, we do need more female engineers but hiring decisions should be completely agnostic of gender/sex/race.",

The idea is that you should eventually reach a place that doesn\u2019t put you at a disadvantage. Even this has its flaw because what if these places cease to exist in the future?

It's as if you tossed darts at a list of job titles and hoped for the best, only to find yourself miles from the target.\n\nYour cover letter, though commendable in its brevity, was as substantial as a cloud of vapor \u2013 promising much but delivering little. If we desired vacuous platitudes, we'd have consulted a motivational poster, not a job application.\n\nAnd let's not even venture into the abyss that is your online presence. Your social media profiles are a veritable minefield of unprofessionalism and indiscretion, a digital graveyard of common sense. If we wanted a cautionary tale, we'd have cracked open Grimm's Fairy Tales, not scrolled through your Twitter feed.\n\nIn conclusion, while we admire your audacity in applying for a remote corporate position, it is abundantly clear that your qualifications and professionalism fall far short of our standards. We suggest you redirect your energies towards endeavors more suited to your unique talents \u2013 perhaps a career in competitive napping or amateur cat videos.\n\nWishing you the best of luck in your future endeavors, whether they involve embracing reality or perpetuating your delusions of adequacy.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n\\[Your Name\\] \\[Your Position\\] \\[Company Name\\]",

I asked him what he meant, and he said every candidate he had interviewed so far just grinds LeetCode and he could tell. He said that apparently, everyone comes into the interviews and just codes out the solution regardless of how difficult the problem is that he gives them, but as an interviewer he doesn\u2019t actually know if they can code well or not, they could literally be copy pasting a solution that they memorized. He said no one talks their solution out loud, and doesn\u2019t communicate their thought process or ask questions, and he is left with no clue of their actual programming capabilities, so he isn\u2019t impressed by their solution. He also said that, maybe for other companies LeetCode might be good, but at Microsoft they aren\u2019t necessarily impressed by it anymore. \n\nI have no clue if I\u2019ll get the role or not, but just thought that was an interesting tidbit to share.

If you've memorized the solution that's fine (hey even I've been in that situation once or twice) but you need to fully understand it and be able to talk it through. \n\nI tend to take \"LeetCode\" though as meaning \"hot shit code does the job but nobody understands it because it is spaghetti\" type of code, though. There are lots of \"clever\" pieces of code running around the interwebs but most of it I wouldn't want in one of my projects.

Understanding how each data structure and their associated algorithms work, from first principles, is good. Quickly recognizing the pattern needed behind a problem statement is good as well.\n\nWhen I interview candidates, if I get the vibe that they\u2019re working off of rote memory, I might change the problem statement in such a way that the implementation of the solution might completely change. Candidates working from rote memory or using tools to solve the problem will choke. People with strong communication and fundamental skills will adapt and be fine.",

            "I agree with the point that candidates need to communicate their thoughts. However, this can be a problem on the interviewer's side if in the end he couldn't determine if the candidate just memorizes the solution or really understands the concept.\n\nWhen I interview, I don't pick a hard question. I'd pick a topic that all engineers should know.  Find a question that can have multiple solutions with pros and cons, or the question that can ask more follow up questions. This helps reveal the candidate's true abilities. The interviewer should be the helper, not only to be the judge. I think it's unfair to leave the \"communication\" part to the candidate alone. In the work environment, it's all about discussion and sharing ideas. The interview should be the same.",

            "Come on man just hold out.  So what you got a job?  I worked a second job at McDonalds to boost my income to qualify as a sponsor to my now wife's fiance visa...  I still remember some other musicians came in and looked at me, surprised I was working there.  They drug me in the dirt for it.  I didn't explain it to them and I didn't have to. I was earning more than them even without the McDonalds and could professionally outplay them (I was a classical guitarist with an injury changing careers).  Anyways, the whole time I was working on Engineering school.  Still haven't finished that... BSEE is work in progress, but I'm in graduate school for CS. Don't let surviving and taking care of what needs to be taken care of bother you.  As long as you keep your head up, unless the world really does come to an end, then you will have an opportunity.  Flip those burgers with pride and don't let any stupid lazy ass foo discourage you.",
