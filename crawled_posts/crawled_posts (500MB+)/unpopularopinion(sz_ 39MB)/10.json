            "I paid for oil furnace cleaning for 2 years. \n\nAll of a sudden in the dead of winter last year Furnace wouldn\u2019t run.  Called in an emergency and my normal company couldn\u2019t come (was during Covid and repair dudes were sick). \n\nNew company said furnace hadn\u2019t been cleaned in years!! and SHOWED me all the build up.  Said unlikely but not impossible it could\u2019ve caught fire.  \n\nSwitched companies then and there.  \n\nNever had another problem when I watch the workmen for a while now.  \n\nOne rotten apple spoils the bunch.",
            "I get you but people steal and you\u2019re a stranger.",
            "We had someone doing work in our house, mainly remodeling the 1.5 bathrooms, and he was caught drinking on the job. Not only was he drinking, but he didn\u2019t even bring anything into the house himself. It was our alcohol. So yeah\u2026. I\u2019m going to keep at least half an eye on the strangers that are hired.",
            "To be fair, watching work being done, especially work you don't know how to do yourself, is somewhat fascinating.  The popularity of all these house flipping/reno TV shows shows that.",
            "I never know what I'm supposed to be doing. I have social anxiety so I usually just hang out nearby pretending to be doing something important but really just waiting for them to be done lol.",

            "I like to at least be in the same room or close by. Maybe do some of my own work.",
            "I had Orkin over and do a 15k job at a house my wife and I bought together. After watching them the whole time, it started to feel awkward and they only had an hour left of work to do so I stopped watching/inspecting their work. \n\n\n\n\nTurns out that last hour I didn\u2019t watch them was when they started to skimp on everything. I know because it was the last room of the house that was left to work with and was beyond pissed. Left a bad taste in my mouth and will never hire Orkin again since later on I found out they subcontract to the lowest bidder no matter how good or bad their workmanship is. You bet your ass I\u2019ll be watching over the worker\u2019s shoulders even more. I\u2019m taking care of my investment and paying the worker to do it right.",
            "It's my home. I want that shit done properly. I have had fuck ups cause I wasn't monitoring them and they half assed their work to get home faster.\n\nEdit: is not about knowing better than the people I hire, it's not about having more knowledge than them. Since the place is mine, I need some understanding of what needs to be done and how it's done, at least understand it in theory. I cannot and will not blindly trust someone I hire do it how I want. This doesn't mean micromanaging them at every step either.",
            "A homeowner has every right to oversee what is essentially strangers in their home. \n\nYes, it may be a little uncomfortable knowing you're being watched while you work, but you are in someone else's home so it's understandable if they want to make sure nothing happens, as certain trades are known for leaving huge messes or causing damage or stealing.",
            "Sorry it's annoying but so is getting screwed over or having something stolen. \n\nI have cameras now to verify the work being done, any damage that might occur, etc.",
            "Sorry, I just don't trust you.",
            "I feel ya man but i also understand the home owner perspective too. They do have a right to watch what we are doing. However being a woman in construction for abit was annoying because some would tell me how to do my job. That is where I got frustrated.",
            "HVAC guy here. Most of your homeowners are not trades people and have no idea how to work with tools. Most of them are completely fascinated and baffled by what you're doing and are just curious. Very few of them are there to criticize or judge you. Also if they're just standing there that's basically a free helper.",
            "Naw if you\u2019re in my house and I\u2019m paying you I\u2019m going to be observing from time to time. Do the job correctly. There shouldn\u2019t be any reason as to why you are nervous",

            "Both my husband and I have experience in trades, and yeah... watch them. Don't get in the way, don't distract, but make your presence known. It is amazing how much some tradespeople will slack off if given the chance, and how little respect they can have for their jobsites.",
            "I enjoy not being robbed...",
            "I can\u2019t tell you the number of times my husband has been \u201chovering\u201d over work being done to our home and caught shit that the contractor would have done against our preference, like short cuts that harm the look of the home or would make things harder to repair in the future. IMO too damn bad. He tries to avoid annoying the contractor but every friggin day you will be watched and scrutinized working in my home.",
            "Do you wish you had watched the guys who fixed the leak in your basement?",
            "Sorry, but I caught a guy trying to get into one of my boxes where I keep my old computer parts when he was working in my basement. I hired you to do something and I'm going to ensure you *do that.* If you have an issue with being watched in someone's house, maybe get a job where you don't go into people's houses.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCgjccsrXjw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCgjccsrXjw)\n\nWatch that.",
            "I like to leave the guys alone to do their work but here's what happened when I didn't watch:\n\n1) the plumber busted my tile floor under my bathroom basin to fit something. Sure he filled the hole back in with all the busted material but I don't have tiles there anymore, I have concrete. \n\n2) I had my toilet changed out. It was a hard negotiation because I really didn't want to do it, but my super and I talked and I agreed after seeing my neighbor's finished job. It was supposed to be a job of toilet off, toilet on. NO! the same freakin plumber from the above situation broke my tile floor again to add to the sewer pipe for some reason and shifted my toilet slightly to one side. I knew immediately when I sat on it. He also broke and took away my classic marble plate that surrounded the toilet O ring. Again, he left the hole with just the broken material and my super had to concrete fill the hole while I went and got the matching tile at the tile place, which the super put in. \n\n3) Again in my bathroom. There was a leak from the ceiling. The old super was supposed to take down the sheetrock where the leak was and replace THAT AREA. Instead he pulled down my entire lowered ceiling and fixture. Sure he put up the new ceiling but it wasn't the same and changed the acoustics in my bathroom, and I got a cheap light fixture. \n\nI don't like to seem like I'm breathing down workers necks (although I do find their work interesting to watch), my mother told me its not nice to do, and I should leave the guys to their work, but whenever I don't watch they fuck something up.",
            "I hate having contractors or someone come over to work on something in my house.  Partially because I feel as a homeowner, I should be the one doing a lot of that work but also because as you stated.  I feel like I'm \"supervising\" their work when in reality, I'm just curious.  But I also voice that to them and it helps ease the mood.\n\nIf they are talkative, I'll be more than happy to sit there and have a conversation.  But if I am just going to stand there, I sometimes even offer to help because it feels so weird to not do anything while they do all the work.",
            "I love when customers watch me work. I get to know them better, they learn something, and they get to see that I\u2019m doing good/honest work. I\u2019m not cutting corners or anything, they are getting what they pay for. Keeps the water clear",
            "You need to watch them.  I've been scammed multiple times by assholes that cut a hose or break something else when you're not looking and up-charging for more work.  \"Did you know this other thing suspiciously close to what I'm working on broke while you went to the kitchen?  Throw in an extra 20 and I'll fix it for ya.\"\n\nAt this point if I need something fixed around the house I check YouTube to see if I can fix it myself and if not, I watch the repair man like a hawk.  Fuck their feelings.",
            "If it's a small job I like to be in the vicinity of it being done so that I can glance over and watch it being done. If it's large and will take multiple hours, I hang around for the start of it and then leave for the area for a while. I just don't like the idea of strangers in my home and I wanna be aware of what's going on I guess.",
            "My fianc\u00e9 and I had someone come by our apartment to fix our internet and I just hung out in the kitchen while they were in the living room. I wanted to be close by so if they had questions I was available and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving them alone in my place of living.",
            "You have to watch the people who are working in your house in case of theft, misuse of supplies or them not doing something right or not obliging to your rules about projects, and to make sure they\u2019re safe. It\u2019s uncomfortable Sometimes but how do you expect someone to trust the stranger in their house?",
            "Oops. We are spending thousands or tens of thousands of dollars for your service IN OUR HOME. We can watch you if we want.",
            "I bring you a bottle of water, let you know where I am so you can yell if you need me. It is ok to disappear while a worker is working but you know if I don't check out the work when you're done, if there is a problem later someone is gonna ask if I approved it. Trust me: I don't want to watch someone install whatsis on the whosis, either.",
            "I mostly install kitchens, Some people stay the entire time and watch like a hawk. I don\u2019t really like it but it\u2019s their house and if they feel they need to then so be it.  But if they talk to me it\u2019s usually going to take me longer because I\u2019m not getting in my \u201czone\u201d",
            "As someone who has been a carpenter for many years before I switched fields I will always watch not the entire time but I do try to make it crystal clear I want things my way. I don\u2019t nag or boss them around",
            "I've done home renovating for over 10 years .People pay good money and put a lot of faith/trust in us to be in their homes , you want to stand and watch us work you can as long as its safe I got nothing to hide and you're paying me .",
            "I see what you mean, but unfortunately some people don't trust tradesmen because a lot of tradesmen are scumbags lmao who do half a job then leave.",
            "I had a cable guy fall asleep on my living room floor after he turned on the TV, laying across the entire thing. I'd argue that is going to make the customers way more uncomfortable than me watching you to make sure you DON'T fall asleep on my floor. Just saying.",
            "What *is* the proper protocol? I stand there and watch because, honestly, I feel like it'd be more awkward to just go about my day and pretend nothing is out of place. It's also interesting to see how some things are done, it won't make you an expert but you could even learn how to fix a problem yourself next time.",
            "No offense but this sounds like a \"you\" problem. People are highly interested in what is being done to their property in case they need to know about it later... for example, where wiring is, pipes, etc... They aren't watching you, they are watching the process and with good reason.",
            "We hired a plumbing contractor to come do a job. We agreed on the details of the work. I regret not watching him because they did not do what we agreed upon. He took shortcuts and as a result we had a leak that caused a lot of damage. Yes, we identified and confirmed that the problem was due to his shortcut and he had to fix it but it would've been better for both he and I if he'd had done it right the first time.\n\nI would 100% watch a contractor again.",
            "Cool, I\u2019m still going to stand there and make sure all my belongings remain my belongings.",
            "I am a handyman and yes it is fucking annoying when clients do that but it is their house and obviously their right to do so... I draw the line though when a client tries to tell me the best way to do my job and diplomatically tell them to fuck off when they do.",
            "Sometimes people show up looking like they are addicts. Use language or have body language that does not instill trust in a client. \nOr they don\u2019t explain what they are going to be doing well enough to make the client  comfortable with their ability. \n\nThese people get watched.",
            "Tough shit. You're a stranger in someone's home and should not be trusted. End of story. Whether you're a thief, an idiot that's going to break something while working, or a decent human being who's going to be perfect, how the fuck do I know?",
            "why? so you can haft ass the job and i have to replace it? naw man.. making sure you do it 100% right..",
            "Some fixes cost less if found early. Besides, letting strangers go into my home without keeping an eye on them is dangerous",
            "I\u2019m not leaving you, some random fuckin guy alone in my house. You\u2019ll be watched all the way out the door. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a contractor, you could be a fucking travelling nurse you\u2019re still not going anywhere without me. If you feel uncomfortable about this than all I can say is buck up.",
            "Too bad. Get over it. I hired YOU, not vice versa. You are temporarily my employee or contracted worker, working in my own home. You\u2019re getting my money.\nI have no idea if you\u2019re gonna do something sketchy, steal something, or maybe you set up a tiny little camera in my drywall. Possibilities are endless. \n\nYou guys ever see those movies where the main procrastinator dresses up like some everyday schmucks job as a cover to sneak in somewhere? Especially construction, electrician, etc, and gets into the company\u2019s building?\n\nPeople have an unduly higher level of trust for skilled hired labor. Just because someone knows something you don\u2019t know, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trustworthy.\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t change it because I think it\u2019s hilarious, but how did no one comment about me accidentally saying \u201cprocrastinator\u201d instead of \u201cprotagonist\u201d? \ud83d\ude02",
            "I'm paying for it.....I get to watch it get done. Hell, minimum wage guys at Subway are compelled to perform under their patron's watchful gaze.  Why can't I?  If I'm forking out several thousand dollars to build a deck or a finished cabinet set, I get to critique how it gets built.",
            "So. Had AC installed. Left them to their shit, kept a nest cam open in the basement. They were vaping in my home...\n\nHad painter come. Didn't mind either way if I was there or not, but I for the most part let him be and only bothered when he was taking a lunch break or prepping. Painter missed a lot of spots and took a big chunk out of my closet door. Packed up his shit and left pretty fast. This was the last day anyways, but he didn't finish what he was supposed to.\n\nHad baseboard installed. 2 friendly guys came. Asked them to do my office first so I could leave them be. While I was waiting the other guy was starting the living room. Apologized to him for being nearby, said I was told workers don't like being watched. \n\nGuy said, no need to apologize, only people who have something to hide don't want to be watched.\n\nAt this point, don't really care what they think, my home, I can do what I want in it. Because it seems most of them arn't that trustworthy.",

            "Every time workmen have come to my house or the house of anyone I know, they\u2019ve damaged something or done something wrong. When you stop breaking my stuff I\u2019ll stop feeling like I have to watch you.",
            "Used to do waterproofing in houses and I can confirm people would stare, Alert me to the fact they were watching me on hidden cameras or asking thousands of questions. Can you wait until I\u2019m DONE the job? I don\u2019t mind checking in, but don\u2019t hover forever.",
            "If you're working on my home and I don't watch what you do, you might fuck it up in private and hide it like, oh, all of the people I've hired and not watched.  You may be trustworthy, but your peers are a bunch of liars, thieves, and cheats who must be watched like children.  You're in my home.  Put it in the contract if you don't want people watching you work.",

            "I\u2019ve had contracted workers break and scratch things in my house and not tell me. Do you think a worker who wants to quickly get through your house to get to the next actually cares about doing the job right? I\u2019ve had my hardwood floors messed up, with huge dents because of their equipment smashing into the floor because they simply couldn\u2019t be bothered placing them down gently. I also hired a worker who stole property from me because I gave him privacy. He literally stole my iPod shuffle years ago when they were popular.  Worst part is, I had no idea who his true identity was because he was an illegal immigrant so I couldn\u2019t go to the cops because they will just jot down the information and do nothing. You can\u2019t trust people around nice things anymore.  My aunt got scammed because the workers asked for more material from Home Depot so she went to buy planks of wood and when she came back, she found out all of the materials she bought for them was stolen including many of her belongings.

My mom and dad stayed in the kitchen where the back door to the backyard was, offered the dude coffee and cold drinks and periodically checked in on him to see if he was ok and see how far he was in his work. Generally pretty kind to the dude. I can\u2019t remember why but he went to a basement for a couple of minutes unsupervised towards the end of his work and when he left my dad found out he stole a couple of things from us. Learned right then and there that if someone is ever in your house to do some work, you gotta watch what they do, no matter how kind you are to them or how kind they are to you.",

            "I get that you're uncomfortable, but if my cheap ass landlord hired you I do not trust you by default and not making you uncomfortable is very low on my list of priorities. I will offer you coffee and cake if there's some in the house, but you are a stranger and I will not leave you alone, and honestly I will probably ask one of my other roommates to be present in the other room at least because I do not wanna be left alone with you. My safety is more important than you feeling comfortable.",
            "I know you trust you, and you're probably trustworthy, but I had a roofer bitch to the GC about me watching over his crew's shoulder...\n\nI was watching over their shoulder because the very first day after they left I checked the garage roof they'd installed, found a good dozen gaps I could see clear under the shingles, and none of the ridge vents were installed correctly.\n\nSo day two they came out to me stopping work and hand walking them to each error... I made them pull the whole roof down and start over doing it right this time. His crew didn't like me pointing out their errors, and there was lots of grumbling... So yeah I bet he and his crew didn't like their work not picked over, but I'm spending $10,000 to make sure the roof doesn't create $50,000 worth of damage the first time it snows....\n\nI also tracked progress, I took pictures twice a day, made sure work was being done, on more than one occasion I was told they'd worked, but showed up to zero changes.\n\nWhen the invoice came he tried to bill me for 4 days labor more then we agreed to, and charged me for the wasted shingles. I sent him a check for the agreed upon rate, and dated photos of the incorrect shit and the \"progress\" made on the 4 extra days it took... He cashed it and didn't call me back.",

The tile is also uneven, and the grout is so thick in certain parts that it leaked out and made a mess everywhere.\n\nI had to bust out the entire wall to fix the plumbing, etc.\n\nWas a big fuckin mess.

            "As someone who has been on both sides of this many many times, hard disagree. Which I guess makes it a good unpopular opinion. Terrible life tip though. \n\nWhen I'm working in someone's home I'm more than happy to have them watch. It may be awkward, it may be annoying at times, it may take longer. But if you approach it as them trying to learn or at least protect the investment they're making with you, there should be nothing wrong with it. \n\nWhen I'm the homeowner having work done, I always ask a simple question, give some sort of information about the item they're working on, and work in some way of asking politely if they mind me watching and seeing how it's done. I have never had someone say no, or so much as hesitate. I've often gotten some discount by helping, whether it's because I found something they didn't (furnace) or carrying buckets of gravel out from under the slab so they could keep going on the project. But it's never been an issue.\n\nAnd you know what? The first time it *is* an issue to watch what someone is doing in my own home, they'll be leaving my home and giving business to their competitors. I'd expect the same when I'm on the job. \n\nLook at it as an opportunity. If you're proactive and make the occasional commentary on your work (\"I'm doing this because this, this part does this, this vents out for that...\") it will help ease the awkwardness and prevent a lot of the feelings of impatience on the homeowner's part. It will also increase positive reviews and repeat business.",

We just had a plumber and they wanted to check through our tub drain access, so I had to give them access to that space, it\u2019s easier that I was standing vaguely close so he didn\u2019t have to find me). \n\nReason 2 is I have pets. Most workers arrive more or less unannounced within a wide timeframe, no time to secure pets. I\u2019ll grab the cats as they decide to wander by. I also need to make sure they don\u2019t get into anything.

My deck was a horrible job. They cut one board short and instead of scrapping that they cut every other board short and did an additional board going the opposite way at the end. Didn\u2019t trim the excess board off, they\u2019re all different sizes, no stain on our deck, varying gap sizes between boards, boards horribly warped due to improper install, etc. My kitchen has doors that are 1/4\u201d bigger on one side than the other. My ceiling has screw holes and large patches of bad texture that wasn\u2019t sanded. \n\nIf I\u2019m spending all that money, it\u2019s going to be done right. Is it uncomfortable? Maybe.

Same with theft. You have to be there and ensure everything goes well. Now if it\u2019s someone you trust or the area is already under surveillance (meaning damage and theft are all caught on camera), I tend to stick around to learn what the person is doing and how they do it so well.

            "I think what's even more annoying about it is that they have to make a whole new bit or act every elimination round or whatever(haven't watched in year.) Learning a new song is pretty easy. Learning a new trick with a  dog or other bit is far harder. Remember that woman who did the bade dancing thing? She had to carefully practice for years to get that right(she was dancing on two beams over razor sharp blades.

            "You have guys who do some crazy death defying stunts, some mind blowing magic tricks, or some awesome painter with a twist to his work. \n\nIf they make it to the new round, they have to think of a way to top that.\n\nIf a singer moves on, they just sing a different song.... that's it...",

Had a good sob story\n\n2. Performed unremarkably but decently at a talent that surprised them based on his appearance (basically shocking them by subverting their stereotypical expectations)\n\nHe made it pretty far before they found out.\n\nI linked the article but you can find the video of his footage of the whole process which is pretty cool",

Singing just takes away from the art of talent, and for there to be several singing acts in the finals each year annoys me. ",

I remember when i was a kid watching AGT almost religiously i was enthralled by this group that had an intricate dance performance in a pitch black stage wearing a special suit that would light up certain areas in a neon light. The performances they made were absolutely stunning and they made it to the finals only to be shot down by a guy and his acoustic guitar. 10-12 year old me was absolutely furious and never watched the show again.",
            "Side rant / question:\n\nIs the point of AGT still to get your own Vegas show? If so, I just don\u2019t understand how a singer wins over like those amazing light shows or illusionists.\n\nAnd why do kids advance at all? I mean, if they\u2019re amazing singers or acrobats or something, great. But usually they\u2019re OK at something and they get advanced just because of a sad story or they\u2019re cute.

            "Also your sob story shouldn\u2019t give you an edge. Your relative passing away is sad but doesn\u2019t affect your performance at all.

So we \"reconciled\" which was really me just waving the white flag. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago. We divorce. Its amicable. We realize we have grown apart. Or so I though. 3 months after we split, I met a new guy who is an absolute saint. Ex goes on a tirade, threatens to kill the new boyfriend. All over text. Police report filed, charges filed. He has my kids one night and texts me the different ways he thought about killing himself. I had realized over the last year or two that he was a complete narcissist and was trying to manipulate me again. I called the police, they came and gave me back my children, after he wouldn't tell me where he was with them while making threats of suicide. He was taken for a mental eval and they discharged him after 3 hours. This sent him on a whole new tirade. Over 700 texts in less than a week. He was arrested last week and bonded out. He goes to court in a few weeks. \n\nHe told me that I am keeping him away from our kids to spite him. He doesn't know i've sat down with my girls and explained that daddy does want to see them but his head hurts too much and mom doesn't feel that its safe for them to be around him right now. They understand. When I told a friend about his suicidal threats, all it took was for my friend to look at me and say \"thats not your problem.\"\n\nSuffice to say, I am filing for full custody of my children and am hoping my ex winds up incarcerated soon so he cannot continue to do what he has been. My only reprieve is that there is now a PPO (boyfriends) and bond conditions so he can not have any contact with myself or the boyfriend or the kids. If he says the only reason he is still alive is because of the kids, there is no way in hell that I am letting him have them. His great grandfather put the whole family in the car one day and proceeded to blow his head off in front of the entire family. No way in hell would I ever put my kids in a situation where that could potentially happen.",

I never actually told someone I would kill myself if they didnt get back together with me, because logically i KNOW that I'd be forcing someone to be with me who does not share mutual feelings for me as I do, them. But I've had that feeling, that deep feeling of desperation, where you want them to know so badly that you're suffering because of them not wanting you. \nAnd yet somehow, after coming out of all that garbage, both from being told they would harm or kill themselves because I left, or vice versa, I feel that it is only appropriate to respond to these people with the attitude of, \"I really hope you're not so stupid as to end your life over someone else, but if it means you fuck off away from me, I guess do what you feel you gotta do.\" \nObviously, you cant legally say certain things so aggressively. There have been articles about a girl who went to trial because she essentially said, to her manipulative \"suicidal\" ex boyfriend that she \"Hope's he'd just do it since he talks about it so much\" or whatever (paraphrasing)...and when he ACTUALLY went through with it, and successfully ended his life, she then had to face charges from his family that she ultimately was to blame for his actions. \nMy unpopular opinion, going along with yours...would be that she was the victim in the first place, and out of anger she said something she shouldn't have. But she is NOT A MURDERER. He is the only one to be blamed for HIS POOR DECISIONS. Idk if she served any time or anything I never saw any follow up. I dont even remember how long ago it was but the article was floating around for a hot minute and it made me sick. \nThe manipulator is responsible for their own actions. Period. She is still the victim of an abusive, manipulative person/relationship. When the relationship ended, any ties to that person are kaput unless she were to have, literally herself, killed him. \nSo. Yeah. I agree with you, if someone ever threatens to harm/kill themselves/others/you, TO THE POLICE YOU GO. And if that doesnt resolve the issue, whatever happens is NOT ON YOUR HANDS.",

            "Counterpoint:\n\nMy last relationship was my first in 8 years. I won't go into details but my life has been mostly just awful and I've often contemplated suicide over my 5 decades. She seemed to love me and I thought I had a new chance at something special. We lasted a little over a year and things didn't work, not for her anymore. \n\nAgain, long story...but I just wasn't my right self at the time (not long after having cancer, being evicted, losing a ton of weight, getting hit by a car, having another surgery etc.) and I wasn't a great boyfriend. But neither was I abusive or disloyal or shitty. I just didn't get it right. \n\nDon't wanna go into how, but I was able to peek into some stuff she was saying to friends as we split and I didn't immediately adapt to being platonic with her, and among them were mocking allusions to my weight/eating addiction issues (which I shared with her in hope that she'd be sensitive, which she wasn't) mentions of some other guy she liked (weeks after ending our 16-month, cohabitational relationship), and, worst of all, glib comments about my expressing desperate, suicidal thoughts to her (no, not in the form of \"if you really leave me I'm gonna kill myself\", more like \"I don't know what to do with this, you're the best thing I've had in ages, I'm worried this will be the last straw for me etc.). \n\nShe basically told her friends, as they discussed her cutting me off completely (which she did soon thereafter because I wouldn't instantaneously start acting like a nonsexual acquaintance), \"but what if he kills himself?\" Not \"I know we're not gonna work out but I do really care for him\" or \"I still love him despite this and intended to still be in his life\" (which she's done with every other ex) or \"the thought of him hurting himself is horrifying to me and I need your help navigating this\"...nope. Just like \"Why do I have to have this messy, pathetic shit in my life a for even 10 seconds after I've dumped him?\"\n\nThis, to me, is why it's not necessarily an across-the-board, one-size-fits-all, slamdunk thing to just cut someone off or even be aloof about their depression.

Logically, I of course knew I'd feel other emotions if I had to discover his body, but it's hard to perceive that when you're so emotionally dissociated.  When he started to realise it was truly over that's when he really started losing it. one afternoon he tried to rape me in the kitchen.

If they DO attempt, they're more likely to do it in a way that can at least be reversed (overdosing). Its a power play, 100% of the time and purely for control. \n\nThat being said, dont fall for it.

And there isnt shit they can do about it. \n\nThat being said, you are *not* responsible for someone else's actions in a situation like this. It may sound cold or callous but that's just how it is.

If they threaten suicide if you leave, find them some help. Do what you can, but don\u2019t leave yourself in a bad situation. If someone is acting like that, they genuinely need help, and you\u2019ve gotta try and get find them help.

            "Discourse is extremely important in politics and often is a source of positive social change. It's hard to hate or be aggressive to people you have a genuine conversation with about troubles and points of contention. The problem that's been developing is that it's not that simple, there's an extreme divide that's spreading throughout the world. I'd argue it's migrated from America to pretty much every developed nation now, even some developing. The narrative is largely boiled down to some extreme black and white points with people so far apart that they can't even see the other as human anymore. It's issues like abortion that there's some people on one side who believe is child murder and there is no reasoning with the opposition side. And in return, the other side believes how can you reason with someone who believes in something that in your mind sees a cluster of cells as a person when you simply know it's not.\n\nIt seems to be like this for many issues, and I'm sure many people don't feel aligned with extreme beliefs. But it's the media narrative and it's pushed to the absolute extremes and people think they have to pick a side.\nI think these imagined teams do more harm than good and don't really exist as they don't represent most people's political views. Left and right wing is harmful imo.\n\nSo when you live in that kind of climate, there's people who are simply incompatible with eachother and effectively don't see the other as human anymore.

Can anyone challenge this? Am I in the wrong?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSimplified:\nYou can only get rid of dangerous beliefs by challenging them - attacking the person doesn't work. You need them to understand why you feel like you do, and why it's more valid than their own view.\n\nIf you wish to seem righteous, then you need to act righteous. If you want other people to die because their opinion differs, then you're acting in your own interests, not theirs and not societies.\n\nEvery belief is caused by a reason - it's wrong to assume that this reason is always malice. You need to understand the other person, you need to give them a chance. Even the nazis were heroes in their own minds. The values that you feel are *required* in order to be a good person, or even *human*, are likely values that you didn't always hold. But do you hate your older self? Do you see him/her as evil and want them dead? If so, is that not a problem?",

Are people trying to say that I should not be their friend just because they disagree with me about one, tiny thing? Should I put my best friends to the sword for disagreeing over a favorite color or type of music? This isn't how our species works, or... perhaps our inability to come to this conclusion is leading our species to ruin.\n\nI have a question for those who disagree with this person's post: do you believe that the only acceptable way of thinking is intolerance, and negotiation is unacceptable because only your opinions matter?

How on earth am I supposed to stand up for my rights when people are allowed to take my rights away for disagreeing with them, or when I am being forced to change my opinions or expose my private beliefs at threat of job termination, doxxing, or sometimes even death itself by someone saying \"if you disagree with me, unfriend me,\" which gives the potential of me being attacked for my silence just because I have an unintroduced, alternate perspective on the matter? We need to let go of this toxic \"Yes and No\" culture, where alternate perspectives are discouraged and anyone who refuses to assimilate is deemed an outcast.\n\nI understand that those who disagree are offering valid exceptions to the original post throughout the comment section, such as unfriending a pedophile, racist, or someone who supports animal abuse\u2014all of whom are terrible people\u2014but casting people aside just because they disagree with you is almost like justifying the actions of infamous dictators such as Kim Jong Un, Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler, who literally killed people just because they disagreed with them. Who in their right mind would want to be anything like these three people, the most embarrassing and heartless persons to ever walk the earth, or justify anything they stood for? I sure wouldn't, would you? What if I told you that you are acting just like them by refusing to accept or empathize with anyone who has an alternative perspective?",

            "These movies are what I imagined in my head as a kid in the 80s reading comic books. Exactly how I pictured them. They literally feel like watching a Marvel comic book come to life. I waited over 30 years to finally get the movies I imagined, so yea, I definitely fawn all over them. But good use of the sub, have an upvote.",
            "I like them just fine. But I judge a movie on how much I have fun or enjoy watching it. Not how \u201cartistic\u201d it is. Or how it \u201c moved cinema\u201d. \nI go to the movies for fun.",
            "I agree that the MCU is overrated, but I disagree with the reasons listed. I do think Civil War had more repercussions, regarding the Avengers disbanding, though I don't like how they did it and I think Civil War is one of their weaker movies. The humor can definitely be crappy, though. \n\nI think the main appeal of the MCU was the origin stories and the first Avengers movie being a crossover. But they aren't crossovers anymore. No one has a solo movie, every movie has someone from another \"franchise\" in it. It's no longer 'a new superhero movie!' or 'an ambitious crossover!' It's 'season 3, episode 9 of Marvel' or 'the season 3 finale of Marvel.' And, at this point, so many of the movies are so formulaic and too similar in tone. \n\nI've always been more of a fan of DC (comics, mostly), even if their movies failed to recreate Marvel's success. But at this point, I think the thing that gives DC a huge leg up, at least for me, is the fact that they can make movies that feel different in tone, plot, etc. The key will be seeing how they pull them together post-Snyder. But, if they will be using the established multiverse from the Crisis on Infinite Earths TV crossover (and it sound like they will), DC will be able to give a fresher take on crossovers and do them even better than Marvel.",

Any movie can be considered dumb if you don\u2019t like it... are romantic comedies stupid because the ending is predictable? Are horror movies dumb because it\u2019s just jump scares? \n\nMarvel movies aren\u2019t meant to be up there with Citizen Kane or whatever, they\u2019re a bit of fun. If you don\u2019t like it, cool but eh loosen up a little. Don\u2019t take them so seriously.",

            "Fully repsect your opinion, just throwing in my two cents\n\nI'm a big MCU fan and I've seen almost of the movies in theaters (missed captain America and thor first installments). Ill admit, after Endgame I reflected back on the last decade and I was burned out. I only saw Far from Home out of completion sake. I have no interest in black widow. The last few movies (Dr strange, black panther, cap. Marvel, both Spiderman, antman) were throwaways. I wasnt crazy impressed, but entertained. The formula is wash rinse and repeat.\n\nWith that being said, they do their job. For people, kids and adults, who look up to superheroes this is what they want and need. To bring characters that have been around for generations to life. To take you on a space adventure. To marvel at a mega suit of armor. To let you ride along while your team saves the world. People don't need to remember the soundtrack for a movie to be good lol.\n\nThe great thing about media is no one has to like the same thing and anything can be considered worthy. Im sure with minimal effort you can find another post saying the same thing about whatever movies you like. No one is really right or wrong, its just a matter of what you connect with.",
            "Yeah, but as far as the \"summer blockbuster\" style of movies go, they're 10/10. \n\nAre they high brow art? Of course not. That's not the point of the genre. They're a fun ride to hop on and enjoy, not complex character studies or attempts to answer complex philosophical questions.\n\nFor what they are trying to be, they're phenomenal. If you're looking for movies that advance our understanding of the human condition, no, you should look elsewhere.\n\nIt is okay for movies to be dumb, fun and popular. They don't all have to be Citizen Kane.",
            "Lol those are some really weird points. \n\nCrap humor? I mean that\u2019s kind of subjective. I happen to really like it\u2019s sense of humor. \n\nForgettable music? The riff of Ironman comes to mind that\u2019s super recognizable for everyone or the entire soundtrack of guardians of the galaxy. I know GoTG\u2019s soundtrack are already familiar old tracks but they made them popular again to a new audience so still counts as far as I know. Just because you can\u2019t remember a single track doesn\u2019t mean anyone else doesn\u2019t either. \n\nAlso the connection between movies is quite a bit deeper than you make it out to be. When introducing new people to the MCU they tend to be completely lost to the importance of a lot of things due to not seeing the other movies. But still they need to be enjoyable for new viewers so there needs to be a balance. \nHow many movie franchises do you know with as many movies as the MCU that all tie in together?",

I thought I was wound right but you need to loosen up brotha. Life is short. Enjoy shit.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m curious what movie(s) you would consider antithetical to your assessment of these movies.",
            "I've never understood the appeal of these kinds of movies.",
            "I agree. Also the new SW films (The sequels, solo and rogue one were infinitely better) and most big bluster coming out now are hot garbage. It's like a production line. No artistic integrity.\n\nThe comics have all the integrity, Disney has the urge to profit from it and it's extremely transparent within the film, not just disneys marketing.",
            "THANK YOU. There's nothing wrong with liking superhero movies; it can be a nice relax from the real world. But thats about it. Marvel fans act like the MCU are masterpieces and Oscar material or something. They're not.\n\nLegendary director Martin Scorsese  put it best: they're like an amusement park.",

            "Ok well your taste in humor is very much subjective to you. So you can\u2019t particularly say it\u2019s bad? I mean if you think the execution of jokes is bad that\u2019s valid but that is a personal thing.\n\nVery little character development? Now I\u2019m just going to use iron man for an example. He starts off as a billionaire playboy. Not a care in the world and a grade A asshole. Once he gets kidnapped by terrorists he becomes \u201cIron Man\u201d. And decides to be a better person due to his previous trauma and learning he isn\u2019t untouchable. He is relatively the same during iron man 2. He then gets recruited to the avengers where in the fight against the aliens he sends a nuke in to a portal. This portal shows all of his friends being killed in a dark future. This mindfucks tony for the rest of the MCU. In iron man 3 he is constantly nervous and panicked. He even quits being iron man by the end of 3. In age of ultron Tony decides that not just a group of people can protect the world. So he builds ultron and he fucks up majorly. This feeds in to iron mans guilt and anxiety about himself. Civil war Tony is so guilt stricken he decides to fight against the people he was once allied with. He is also angry because his parents were killed by captain americas best friend. Also it\u2019s worth noting Tony doesn\u2019t really joke around in this movie. He is pretty serious throughout. Unless he\u2019s showing it up with peter and doing the \u201cTony Stark\u201d persona. Due to Tony being kinda foolish he gets Brody hurt and nearly killed. He also gets his ass kicked by captain America and Bucky. In spiderman homecoming Tony takes on a more father role for peter. He is essentially the new uncle Ben. In infinity war Tony again debates retiring the iron man persona. But Thanos striking has kinda ruined that idea. And at the end of infinity war he gets trapped in space. Which he saw happening in the black hole during the first avengers. In endgame he meets up with pepper and he settles down, has a kid the life he wanted. He sacrifices himself because it was the only way. Saying the famous line that started it all \u201cI am iron man\u201d. So I don\u2019t get how he is forgotten?\n\nDrax while getting minor development he is also a side character. But he has some of my favorite scenes in the MCU. In Guardians 2 when he talks about his family and Mantis the person who can feel emotions. And she just starts crying from all the sadness coming from Drax. But drax is completely stone cold. \n\nMusic is accurate it is fairly forgettable. However I do like the song that plays when thanos \u201cwins\u201d in infinity war. That is memorable imo\n\nNow these movies aren\u2019t high class cinema. And I\u2019m not gonna say it is. But to act like there isn\u2019t any substance is wrong. These movies very much have depth and really interesting callbacks later on. Some dialogue comes back in ways. Tony saying \u201cand if you die that\u2019s on me\u201d in homecoming. Comes back to bite him in infinity war when spiderman bites the dust. The reincorporation of \u201cI can do this all day\u201d. The guardians films specifically 2 are very much emotionally intelligent. The world is also very fleshed out. Spiderman homecoming is a very intresting film because it details life for everyday people in this universe. My favorite line of dialogue coming back is in the doctor strange movies. Where Dr. strange argues with the other sourcerer about how he lacked imagination. And Dr. strange having to say \u201cthere was no other way\u201d in infinity war to Tony. \n\nFeel free to call me wrong. I very well could be and like to debate stuff like this!\n\nSorry if I typed a lot",
            "Meh. I like them.\n\nFor me cinema is about being able to suspend disbelief. If we looked at all films like yku have here, then you could tear anything to shreds.\n\n\"What, so Forrests leg braces just fell of because he wished to run so hard? In reality he would've got his ass beat\".\nDoesn't make for such an inspiring ride.\n\nSometimes fantasy is fun.

The fact that Marvel has adapted the source material and not compromised on quality is what makes the fans think of these movies as masterpieces.\n\nAlso, I live in South Africa and as a South African, I can assure you that when you have to give your hard-earned money away to watch a movie, you're gonna watch the entertaining movie over the sophisticated movie.",

            "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re overrated if you talk to the right people about them. The beauty of the movies isn\u2019t the cinematography or the depth( some of the movies are deep nonetheless) it\u2019s the adaptation and connection between them. A movie like guardians of the galaxy Is what makes marvel so good they took a bunch of heroes that even longtime marvel heads didn\u2019t care about and made them lovable. It\u2019s the adaptation that people love",

            "\u201cCivil war had no repercussions\u201d\n\nIdk man, cap Natasha and flacon all becoming fugitives and the avengers not being there when thanos arrives I would say had some impact on things \n\n\nAlso the story\u2019s are not \u201cloosely connected\u201d like to have captain America iron man Thor and then hulk have there own movies to then all be the main people in avengers was huge and lead the universe to expand. Infinity war had nearly every MCU charter there and not just as loose cameos, but as actual people. Also the films have narrative cohesion between 22 films. There is not a lot of things that contradict each other especially in the latter MCU movies \n\n\nAlso iron man had a huge arc\n\n\nHe started as a arrogant billionaire that was forced to see what destruction he had caused \n\nHe then was motived by fear after the events of New York with Loki\u2019s attack and after the went through the worm hole.  The fear which was boosted by scarlet witch caused him to make Ultron which caused a city to drop out of the sky. Tony was then filed with guilt and was no longer the arrogant asshole he once was. This lead him to sign the Sokovia accords and basically dismantle the avengers. And he died laying his life on the line for the universe. \n\nThis is a huge arc and not only is it consistent through every film he is in but he also had a consistent arc through nearly 7 directors. \n\n\nThe MCU is unheard of, keeping 22 films with a consistent narrative. The only other thing that comes close is Star Wars. With 11 films. But those films range in quality and the MCU IMO only has 2 or 3 bad/Mediocre films",

            "Now this is going to sound contradictory but, while marvel movies are popular, this is not an unpopular opinion. In fact, this is the third time I've seen this type of opinion hit the front page in the past 2 months.\n\nWe get it, marvel movies are just money printers. Marvel fans understand that as much as anyone else. The movies are also pretty self aware, that's why they are so successful. It'd be like saying \"the fast and the furious movies are unrealistic.\" Maybe at first their goal was to be realistic but as the movies went on, they realized that they were becoming a joke, and got ahead of it. The same is true for marvel movies.",
            "I\u2019m gonna say I disagree, and this is one of those \u201cLook at me I\u2019m quirky, I don\u2019t like what\u2019s popular\u201d opinions which is based of entirely of subjective points without providing something objective. \nBut I\u2019m happy to try and argue my side on your subjective points.\n\nYes they are loosely connected, that\u2019s the point of an anthology series. They are a collection of films set in the same universe while not being sequels. And when characters do interact it does screw with that idea cause they\u2019re set in the same universe.\n\nCrap humour- I like it, it isn\u2019t for everyone I get that but I like it and I know a lot of other people do cause of how popular the films are.\n\nVery little character development - man you really did watch the films. Especially since you mention Drax who\u2019s in the same film as Peter Quill and Rocket who have serious arcs in both films. For sake of time I\u2019ll keep to the first. Peter a kid who was kidnapped from his home as child grows up being taught to only help him selves and to quote from the film \u201csteal from everybody\u201d he later meets a bunch of people he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with and proceeds to use them for his own gain to get out of prison, realising they may be the only people like him in the galaxy. He then let\u2019s his asshole programming come out again when deciding what to do when they find out it\u2019s the power stone and what ronin wants it for. After all this once they are forced into helping xandar they have a serious character building moment together, every character EVEN drax before they do the plan montage. I\u2019d say Rocket follows are fairly similar arc although rocket instead of being raised by pirates is literally born in a laboratory and had to fight to survive as a tiny rodent.\n\nDrax is a joke, he\u2019s also a fucking amazing character. He\u2019s the strongest guardian who has his purpose on the team as both child and father, it\u2019s unique and fun.\n\nForgettable music is just wrong for me, I love the marvel music, I know I\u2019ve talked about guardians of the galaxy a lot but the main motif of that film is absolutely brilliant same for vol 2. Showtime, A-holes comes to mind and so does Black Tears. And Iron man 3s score is amazing too, end credits \u2018can you dig it\u2019 as well as the price that\u2019s just \u2018iron man 3.\u2019\n\nNow shallow detail and that fans think you need a high IQ to understand it. I\u2019ll say this now, nobody says you need to be smart to watch these films. In fact, as a film student I think the best films are the ones that everybody can watch and enjoy, I\u2019m sad you can\u2019t just let yourself be immersed in what are a bunch of fun films. Yes they aren\u2019t cinematic masterpieces, but they are loved and to call people like me who love them pathetic is just, wrong and it insults you way more than it does any fan because you\u2019re obviously not willing to give them a chance. I\u2019ve been watching these films since I was 10 and I\u2019m turning 19 in a few weeks and my love for the films hasn\u2019t dropped because of these things:\n- I love the connected universe that they have built, it\u2019s so cool to see your fav characters form separate films interact.\n-I love the humour, it\u2019s unrealistic but it sets the tone for the films, they\u2019re can be these world ending stakes but it\u2019s well within starks character to crack a one liner because that\u2019s how he deflects and it\u2019s great.\n\n-I love the journey that each film takes you on with each character, by the end there\u2019s always something new learned for this new universe and that has an impact on the rest of the series. Hydra being shield, The battle of New York being a strong reason the vulture exists the return of the 10 rings in Shang-Chi when that comes out.\n-I love the music and how the composes such as Alan Silvestri, Tyler bates, Pinar Toprak and Brian Tyler create the perfect emotion for what is happening on the screen telling a story of their own.\n-and I love being part of a community who love these films as much as me. I went to ye midnight showing of Avengers Endgame and was sat behind this big muscular guy and couldn\u2019t see the screen, his wife turned him around before the film started and saw scrawnier little me and he said sorry, he shuffled down so I could see and said \u201cdon\u2019t want to ruin endgame for you.\u201d these guys love the film they love each other and there is no need to attack them and the films because you don\u2019t enjoy it because at the end of the day, the best thing I learned as a film student is that film is subjective. Someone out there is a massive fan of the Green Lantern film and may hate citizen cane. Your points are valid, but they are valid for you and not necessarily everyone else.\n\nI know I\u2019ve definitely fallen into the marvel fan jumps onto the opportunity to shit down non marvel fan but at the end Of the day it probably doesn\u2019t matter. But that\u2019s my fill I guess. Have a good day and I hope you are well.",

You e clearly chosen weaker example to strengthen your point.\n\n- I can\n\nI don't think they're high art but they're very entertaining and do some very clever things. Enjoy what you enjoy!",
            "First let me say, either you haven't watched them, or you haven't paid attention. No, they aren't Oscar winning, world moving films. But to say they had no character development is far from true. Tony forgotten after IM2? Sure, except how he develops in every movie, eventually sacrifices himself (more than once) and becomes the face of the Avengers. Nearly every character grows and changes over the course. And Civil War certainly had repurcussions, unless you didn't see any of the following films with the distance and conflict between Stark and Rogers, et al. They didn't dive deeper into the super registration act, which would have helped. Drax goes from no nonsense revenge machine idiot, to fun having, caring, protective friend. The list goes on.\n\nForgettable music? You haven't seen Guardians, have you? The other movies all have mostly original, orchestral music. People can't name the original orchestral songs from even the best movies around, unless they buy or listen to the soundtrack regularly. So that takes us to the music like in Guardians. Music that many can name, and that's so popular it got a whole generation of kids enjoying the oldies. My 9 year old asked for and got a Walkman a couple years ago for his birthday, along with the cassettes from both movies. Made him fall in love with music like he hadn't before. \n\nObviously they aren't super deep movies. There are details you won't notice the first time, but there's not some super deep underlying message in there. Sounds like you're either fishing for reactions (and karma) and succeeding, or you just don't like the movies and already had your mind made up before giving them a chance. And that's fine, too. They're made to gather a huge audience, and just like anything pop, from movies to music to books, that means making it simple and to the point.",

            "So, I get it when you look deeply into all these from a story perspective. I would definitely disagree on the music. Iron Man had so many great AC/DC songs in pretty much all the movies, such as Back in Black, Iron Man, and Thunderstruck. Guardians of the Galaxy had arguably the best soundtrack of any of the movies. They say James Gunn selected the soundtrack before any of the movie was decided, and the movie was built around the soundtrack. THat's how you know you have some solid tunes. THere's a reason the whole Awesome Mix Vol. 1 was such a big hit, and made its way into almost everyone's playlist. Actually the biggest song that I don't remember is in fact, the Avengers' theme. \n\nAs far as being forgettable, I feel like it really depends on the person. A lot of people didn't grow up with a lot of comic book exposure, some people did but weren't interested, and some people loved all of it. The movies are attempting to do two very difficult things. They are trying to please all sides with both fan service to the loyal comic book fans, and create a movie that makes sense to people on the outside. That's really difficult. That's the reason so many movies based on books don't really have a lot of success. The fact that Marvel was able to grow an empire like that and dominate the movie industry like it did is a feat in and of itself. I feel like not as much credit is given there from the haters.\n\nSo in short, on a shallow level, I get what you're saying. I agree with some of it. The movies could probably do better in a lot of ways (especially Endgame, I had some big problems with that). But in general, Marvel has managed to keep my interests going for years, providing movies and characters I will never forget, moments that I will remember as emotional, thrilling, and funny. They managed to take this and stretch it out over the course of many years, referencing some of my favorite parts later down the line. To say that it's not interesting or forgettable is ok and you can have that opinion, but there's around 22.55 billion people that disagree with you. I mean, you don't have to like the movies, and they can be overrated, but that also doesn't mean they aren't good movies and that they won't provide a great experience for everyone who sticks it out through the lifespan of the MCU.",
            "Let's be real compared to anything DC it's oscar worthy..",
            "Ehh, there' some depth. You're clearly upset someone had an argument with you or something and feel the need to vent, but your opinion isn't fact. While the films are far from masterpieces, they're exactly what fans want from comic-book-to-film adaptations and they don't even have to be 100% accurate to the comics to be loved.\n\nThey have their emotional moments, enjoyable characters and often good writing, but they're never going to be the kind of films that make audiences turn off the TV afterwards and have a deep conversation about life. They're entertainment in its purest form: a distraction from life.\n\nAnd that's why I love them. They have enough of a connection to reality to make me occasionally feel something for the characters and intrigue me about their backstories or what they're planning for the future, and yet still keep me entertained.\n\nBut some fans can connect with the characters a bit more and there is a bit of depth to each character and their writing. Any film can manage that, so it's not an accomplishment by any stretch of the imagination, but it's still there and pretending otherwise only further discredits your opinion.\n\nAnd Scorsese is a hack. Just saying. Will never understand how a man of such little originality can be bothered to open his mouth about another genre and attack it for its success.\n\nOh wait, yes I can. Jealousy and hypocrisy are staples of mankind. You could make a movie out of that.",

I would easily say that Infinity War and Endgame have the best visual effects of any movies. \n\nAnd I think some of the soundtracks are good! Not great. Not Batman or Star Wars great, but Captain America, GOTG, and even Antman have good themes. \n\nTo each their own.

If you watch an amazing movie anither time you may catch all the little things that mean the world to the story\n\nMovel doesn't even try with small element.  For example a very simple version of this would be having a fight scene that, through some mixed dialog and character movements can intorduce the character to the audiance.  Whithout the need for obvious exposisition.  There is a good video on youtube about this in relation to the pirates of the Caribbean first movie (even though the movie as a whole wasn't amazing or anything, its just kind of a good element to make a movie atleast good)\n\nBasically, attention to detail and subtle character and plot development are cornerstones of great cinema and marvel movies just don't get that for me.\n\nI'm not saying you cannot enjoy it.

            "Statistically speaking in the United States, addictions are what got a lot of people in their situations-my city has an entire street littered with needles and tents. Feeding their addictions will likely end up killing them, and 100% doesn\u2019t fix their problems. Besides, there are dozens of multimillion dollar non profits in urban areas dedicated to feeding, clothing, and housing the homeless-there\u2019s more than enough help available. Homelessness is a more complicated problem than \u201cthrow money at them and they\u2019ll sort themselves out.\u201d But hey, I guess letting them all overdose is a good way to fix that problem. \n\nIssue two: panhandling rings and exploitation. Most of this money won\u2019t end up with them. These rings go as far as to cut off limbs to incite sympathy and earn more money-especially in Southeast Asia. Giving them money will further contribute to their suffering and this practice if anything. Children especially are very likely to be part of these rings, usually by force, as they\u2019re the easiest to exploit and generate the most sympathy. This is all legit-live in a developing country like Indonesia(which I have) and you\u2019ll hear about these rings. \n\nHomelessness is a pretty complicated issue: it\u2019s not just \u201coh, these dudes dont have a home. Give them money and a roof and we\u2019re all good!\u201d That\u2019s why it\u2019s an unpopular opinion-it\u2019s poorly informed.

            "I have to disagree. \n\nI work in the medical field, and I will in no way sponsor someone to damage their body, only for them to end up in the emergency room in the middle of the night, claiming hospital beds, personnel, and resources for themselves. \n\nI live in a country with a social system and I believe that every human should have their basic human needs met. There are structures to ensure this but in _three_ cases they do not work: \n\n1. A person is mentally unable to (due to mental ilness or drug abuse) apply to those services\n\n2. A person lacks the required documentation to apply to those services\n\n3. A person chooses to be homeless due to their own beliefs or their culture\n\nIn the first (and maybe second) case, giving people money to buy drugs would just be feeding into the problem. These groups of people generally will hold signs saying they are hungry or cold or need medication. What I would do in that case is give them what they ask for, so if they say they are hungry they will get food or food vouchers.\n\nYou cannot say that if a person begs for food you should give them money. If they want money then they need to ask for money and be up front. \n\nWe do have people (third group) who actually are confident about their drug use and say that they need money for drugs. And, as much as I personally don't support it, I've seen a lot of people respect their honesty and support them. \n\n\nIn the end, when it comes to donations, beggars can't be choosers. If someone donates a pair of socks but you would have rather had cotton candy then you should still take the socks - and most _genuine_ homeless people will.

            "I don\u2019t give money to panhandlers. Many local organizations are supported by grants. Often times these grants are based on support they provide to the community.

Unless you are willing to pay for full rehab, healthcare, housing, get them a job if they don\u2019t have one, etc then you can\u2019t judge how people use their money. A lot of drugs are also extremely dangerous to quit like that and need assistance, which is expensive. \u201cNot funding their addiction\u201d can lead to more harm, but nobody wants to acknowledge that or give an alternative that actually helps. It\u2019s not a simple situation. There are also a ton of cases of people poisoning food, not to mention people have food allergies, restrictions, etc. Homeless people are still people like everyone else and should get the right to use their money how they see fit- they know their situation better than anyone else.",
            "Addictions (as well as mental illness) are the main reasons people become homeless in the first place. Homeless people cost the state a lot of money.

I gave 5 dollars to a homeless person and he saw the twenty in my wallet and berated me for not giving him 20. I was making minimum wage at that time. Every day we have fires and murders at homeless encampments which are usually conveniently placed on school grounds or right out side an apartment complex that charges their tenants thousands of dollars a month for rent. For the ones who intentionally don't work i have no sympathy for them but if some people are just in a rough spot and need help then i would attempt to help them. The problem is figuring out which one is which so now i avoid them alltogether. I heard a murder last weekend at a encampment one street over from my apartment. 3 sets of gunshots.",

Over the course of 3 months Mitchel told my dad all about being homeless and that for the vast majority (especially people younger than 40ish) people were choosing to not work and to panhandle instead. He said that most people will wake up and run dirt on the face and clothes, rough up their hair, and grow a messy beard to fit the look. He said there are legitimate homeless people but that they\u2019re few and far between, and that they\u2019re usually homeless because they\u2019re mentally ill. \n\nI never can tell if someone is faking or not, but a good meal is a good meal, and I\u2019m happy to feed someone if I can.

            "So you're saying it's cool to give them money for drugs/alcohol because \"it will provide a small amount of temporary respite?\" Well that's fucked up reasoning.\n\nI'm sorry but I'm not going to contribute to someone's death. I'm not going to contribute to them getting fucked up and bothering people on the street or on the subway. \n\nWhere are you from OP? I've always lived in Jersey/NYC. Yesterday a man in Penn Station kept bothering people for money. This isn't out of the ordinary especially for a Saturday night at 11. He was obviously fucked up. \n\nSo I should have given him $5 so he could go get more drugs and bother more tourists? More people trying to get to the airport? More naive people trying to enjoy their night in the city and just get home?\n\nMaybe homelessness doesn't hit as hard where you're from. I know there are homeless people everywhere but I'm not talking about a tent city under an overpass in East Bumblefuck. I'm talking about giving a guy jerking off on the street $5. \n\nI'll give them food. I'll keep them alive. I won't support their addiction, death and damage they could do to others.",
            "\"If you want to give, then who are you to judge how it's used?\" - I am judging how it's used because I am giving them my own money so they can help themselves. If they use it on drugs or alcohol it leaves them in the same situation they are currently in. You can't tell me someone who's homeless will be better off long term financially if they spend the money I give them on a case of beer. So yes, I am one to judge.\n\n\"Also, if drugs or alcohol can provide a suffering human with a small amount of temporary respite in this world, what is wrong with that?\" - See above. What's wrong with that is sure short term it may give them some respite, but it does not help them get out of their situation of being homeless. I'm not giving money for a homeless person to enjoy a fleeting moment. I'm giving them money so they can buy food or clothing to ultimately feel good enough to get themselves bacon on their feet so they no longer have to beg for money or be homeless.\n\nIt's why I don't judge someone who goes to the bar every weekend, but do judge a homeless person who spends money on alcohol. It's not what I am giving you the money for. I'd agree cash is more helpful, but only if it is used properly by the homeless person to help themselves. It's why an act of compassion and asking how you can help will always be better than blindly giving food. But no, I'm not giving a homeless person money when I don't know what it will get used for.  \n\n\nEdit: Didn't even touch on the fake homeless people out there just collecting money and taking advantage of nice people.",

            "I was a heroin addict for 27 years ( 22 or 3 clean now), If someone asks me for money and I have it to give I don't give a shit what they use it for in fact if I ask them food or vice and they tell me vice I try and give them enough to score. I was a functional dope fiend so seldom had to beg lucky I suppose. The war on drugs is idiotic and damaging and needs to be done away with. As for homelessness I can really never know what led them to their circumstance but if they are in asking I am giving whenever I can. I left the US long ago and live in a developing country and don't really see many beggars/homeless here the society tends to take care of each other pretty well.

The more sophisticated packages even have software and tutorials on how to fake timestamps and assorted verification techniques that clients use to try to determine if she is real. \n\nIn the hacker community this is known as e-whoring, and is considered an easy entrylevel cash grab to fund larger scams or purchase better equipment and software. The most skilled at this con equipped with the right photo package, editing software, and manipulation skills can make up to $1,000 a week utilizing the proper platforms.\n\nSuch forums are FULL of guys showing off screenshots of all the cash they've made conning horny redditors. One such story involved a guy going onto an LGBT subreddit posing as a trans teenager made homeless by bigoted parents who responded to them coming out as trans by throwing them out of the house and freezing thier bank account.

I never realized the detrimental effects pornography had on ones mental, physically, and emotionally well-being until I came to point where I finally realized everything in pornography was staged; from the sets, the actors, their reactions, the sex acts themselves. It\u2019s all for show and fantasy! And for so long I struggled to separate fantasy from reality.\n\n\nPorn addiction is real. And it\u2019s a struggle everyday to make sure I don\u2019t fall back into old habits.\n\nI\u2019ve never been aroused by a real woman before. In no way am I intended to self diagnose, but it is possible that I could be suffering from low testosterone levels, low libido, and erectile dysfunction.

Some relationships which start between two teenagers last longer than anyone would expect. Those relationships can also be more mature than relationships of people in their 30s. Not one relationship is the same as the other. Everyone is different and each relationship is unique. No one can know how it will work out or what goes on in the relationship. You can be 60 year old with 300 past relationships and tons of experience, but you are still in no place to judge whether the relationship is going to last or not. You can\u2019t know, regardless of your age or number of relationships you\u2019ve been in. \n\nThere is a certain pattern and yes, teen relationships don\u2019t on average last long. However, I am sick people telling teens that their relationship is not going to last. It\u2019s simply something you don\u2019t tell. It is rude. But older people usually think they have a right to comment on teen relationships and tell them about the outcome or assume they know anything about what\u2019s going on between two people. Let me tell you, in most cases you don\u2019t, because as I said, no matter how much experience you have, each relationship is unique regardless of the age of the partners. \n\nAny relationship, no matter partner\u2019s age can work out or not work out and no one can possibly know.",

            "The reason why people go around telling teens that is because teen relationships tend to be intense and teenagers often change their life plans/put their dreams on hold to pursue/continue relationships- which often don\u2019t last. \n\nFor a person who wishes to have a long term relationship at some point in their life time, making that a priority at a young age can get in the way of achieving their other dreams- like college, careers or hobbies. As people get older and have a better idea of who they are, relationships can move up the priority list. Teenagers don\u2019t know much about what careers would be best suited for them or what hobbies they might be interested in- and if they focus too much on a teen relationship instead of exploring more and more career and educational opportunities, they may never figure out their passions/interests.\n\nTeenagers are quick to give up on their dream school, or dream career or their close friends and family for a romantic partner- and they\u2019re often too young to make these decisions. \n\nA teenager changing their major to be in the same college as their partner will have a more drastic impact on their lives than a 35 year old changing jobs to be closer to a support system to raise kids with.\n\nThis is not to say that teenagers shouldn\u2019t date- but there is often a real fear that being too involved with someone else can often lead you to not knowing who you are without that person in your life- your hobbies and interests often blend together because you don\u2019t get the opportunity to explore your own interests separately from a partner .",

            "Yes they can last.\n\nBut statistically - they don't simply due to the lack of life experience teenagers have,\n\nI'm 30 and know of about 4 different highschool sweethearts. None of them are together now because they have changed since school. Heck, i have changed SO MUCH in the last 5 years, let alone 15. I'm definitely not the same person i used to be, partly because i wasn't even gay when i was 15.\n\nPeople change. Getting together and staying with someone while you're a teenager and still staying with them limits the experience and life exposure in your adulthood. You will most likely resent and regret the lack of experience you have gained in your youth.",

My baby brother is just graduating college and has zero idea what his next plan is, they have never officially lived together and I know they will not last.

            "People that tell others their relationship is doomed are assholes...no arguments there.\n\nHOWEVER; The majority of teen relationships truly do not last.  I think the term 'puppy love' is quite accurate when describing most teenage relationships...they begin when you just shifted from child to adultish, likely have only met people in your hometown, and haven't really figured out who you are/what you like or need in a partner.\n\nWhile I don't think it's anyone's business to tell a teen their relationship has no value, I think it's totally valid to at least convey the above to a teen that is considering getting married or having babies right out high school.",
            "They *can* but usually *don\u2019t,* and I feel that it\u2019s much harder nowadays because people can just easily find another person through dating apps. Forgot what that fallacy is called it\u2019s like when they have a lot of different options and don\u2019t want to settle.",
            "I'll see your unpopular opinion, and raise you one. Whether or not they CAN last isn't really the point. Whether they SHOULD last is. What older folks are likely often saying is not to let a relationship define who you are before you get the chance to define yourself. The person you are at 16 is not the person you will be at 26 (36, etc). When you're a couple, you are forced to make decisions as a couple, and that limits your ability to be your own adult and make your own choices and have your own experiences.",

            "You are correct, however considered one thing. When you are in your teens you are still learning who you are and what you like.  Your brain literally hasn\u2019t even finished developing yet.

            "I find it odd to comment on other's relationships no matter what, but I always found it very hurtful when people told me that my high school BF and I wouldn't work out. Like, we didn't and that's absolutely fine, but I never forgot who told me that I was wasting my time. I learned so much from that relationship and I loved him immensely, that relationship absolutely taught me the depth of heartbreak but how amazing good relationships are. I still wish him all the best and I hope he lives a wonderful, fulfilling and well-loved life.\n\nAll in all, not all failed relationships are worthless and you look like a total walnut if you tell people they'll never last and then they do.",

I believe that one of the most important factors in a successful marriage is when 2 people change in the same direction. It is not common, but is surely possible.\n\nMy wife and I got married in our late 30s. We both had life experiences that taught us what we wanted, needed, and what we would not stand for in a relationship. Imo this is the best time to commit, but my opinion is only valid for my life.\n\nMy father taught me a very valuable lesson many years ago. He admitted to me that he married my mom because he expected her to change. He thought that he could influence her behaviour into the perfect wife/mom. He is a wise man to realize that he failed miserably, and I respect him so much for sharing that knowledge with me. \"You cannot change a person son, you cannot\". I always kept that in the back of my mind and got married when I knew that I found someone who I knew I could accept, and who could accept me. For better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health... you know the rest. :)\n\nHow any teenager can find that with such little life experience is nothing short of a miracle, but who the hell are we to judge??",

            "I dont think people should be actively telling teens that their relationships are doomed because that's a real assholey thing to do.  Even if its immature, they're still in love and that's a crappy thing to hear.  With that said... its also pretty true.  Very, VERY few people marry their high school sweetheart and even if they do, they tend to have a much higher divorce rate than the general population.\n\nThe reason is that teenagers are young.  Even if they feel grown, they're still children and haven't become themselves yet.  Not only are their brains still developing, but most of them have no idea what the world is actually like and haven't solidified their own sense of self in society.  Most teenage relationships end because the couple grows up and they're different people than they were as teenagers.  Its the same with friendships (even though those tend to fare a little better overall because of a different set of expectations).",
            "They CAN, but they very, VERY often DON'T. Of the ones that DO, many of them SHOULDN'T.\n\nListen, if someone meets the right person for them in highschool, that's great, but it has to be a really specific kind of person. You're nowhere near being your fully developed self, physically, emotionally, ideologically. A relationship that can successfully last after highschool has to be between people that help each other grow, and can be understanding of the way their relationship can and will change over time. These are not common traits in any highschooler.\n\nOn the flip side, staying in a relationship can inhibit your growth. It can keep you inside your comfort zone, doubling down on beliefs or habits you otherwise may have realized didn't suit you. It can cause you to settle down too quickly, which can set you up for a feeling of not having explored yourself or lived your life. These feelings can lead to divorce, troubled homes for kids, or domestic abuse.\n\nSure, some kids luck out and find their match early. Those people will always be cute endearing stories for us to hear when we meet them later in life, but are absolutely not a standard anyone else should live by. Other than heroin/crack/meth I can't see myself discouraging from doing anything other than staying with a highschool partner through college.",
            "People generally make those comments because teenagers put such a high value on relationships. Going to the same college as a bf or gf, wasting time instead of studying, or planning your life around a SO. I met my bf of 6 years in high school but honestly i wish people had said that to me. He isn\u2019t my entire life and we might not end up together. I followed him to his university. I was able to make my own path but when you\u2019re 17 your relationship feels like the most important thing.",
            "Honestly.. it\u2019s just good advice. Why they\u2019re telling you as a teenager is so you don\u2019t get too hurt when it doesn\u2019t. I know guys who because they invested too much when they were 16 cannot have a proper relationship. Also there are sooo many life changes that happen in your teens and after because as a teenager you\u2019re still discovering yourself and having a partner will almost definitely get in the way. E.g most teenage relationships end first year of uni and unless you\u2019re both willing to not argue a lot about meeting new people or whether or not to go to the same uni and possibly miss out on a relationship with yourself, there\u2019s not point. I know relationships that have lasted from teenage years but they\u2019re usually dodgy as hell with loads of gaps and lots of cheating in between. Not saying it can\u2019t happen but probably won\u2019t unless (and I choose my words carefully) you both have an individual goal and the other person fits into your future with the goal in mind but if you\u2019re goal is to make the relationship work, you\u2019re setting yourself up for a lot of resentment and may not even be as much as friends in the future. What I\u2019m saying is it can work the odds and just against you. Most of the people who are saying it won\u2019t work were once as adamant as you, so if you notice not many of them are willing to reply to your comments as telling a teenager they can\u2019t have what they want only makes their immature brain crave it more to prove they are mature, but maturity is taken everyone\u2019s view on board and learning from it instead of rebelling. For me it was a relationship at uni and today I don\u2019t really think about anyone I\u2019ve dated because my relationship with myself is important before anyone else, hope that helps :).",
            "Yeah but I'd argue that people need to be single at some point in their 20's-early 30's so they can do their own shit. I was happy in my relationship from 16 to 23. But after it ended I actually became someone. I did things. I traveled. I camped and road tripped with friends. My friendships grew so much stronger because I could be me, properly. Without trying to keep my gf from being upset or angry with me. \n\nI went out all hours of the night and didn't have to report back to anyone. I quit my job and backpacked for 15 months. If my teen love kept going, I would have missed so much. I didn't have a bad relationship. But people know what I mean.

            "True, you don't want to just tell a teenager, \"Your relationship isn't going to work because you're young and inexperienced and everything is going to change.\"\n\nBut it would've helped me as a teenager to hear, \"It's seriously OK if a relationship doesn't work out, especially when you're this young. Have fun and be excellent to each other.\"",
            "Besides, I would never take relationship advice from someone who had been in 300 past relationships. \nThere\u2019s obviously something wrong with them.",
            "OP, according to your post history, you're 18.\n\nHow in the living hell do you think you have an informed opinion about this?\n\nI mean, in a way I get it; at 18, I thought I had all the answers too. I was certainly smart, well-educated, and mature for my age, and qualified to make adult decisions for myself. But man, in retrospect, I knew next to nothing about relationships - especially long-term ones - or the way that people can drift apart over time, or the way that we ourselves change over time even in our adult years.\n\nYes, you're an adult, and yes, you're qualified to make your own decisions. But you're not the person at 18 that you will be at 30, and neither is anybody you're currently dating. You might not even be slightly compatible by the time you reach that age. Right now, what you're lacking at 18 - regardless of how intelligent you may be - is the perspective of what a decade as an adult really feels like, and how it may shift your point of view.\n\nGet down off your high horse and try *listening* to the people who have lived through it.",

            "The person you are as a teenager in no way resembles the person you mature into and the vast majority of the time relationships will fall by the wayside.  That\u2019s not being mean, it\u2019s being realistic.  The person you are looking for at 30 is an entirely different person than the one you dated at 16.  And now for my unpopular opinion; if you are getting married BEFORE you are settled in your career it\u2019s a mistake. 30 is a great age.",
            "You grow too much from your youth to adulthood and more often than not you\u2019re going to outgrow the people around you and develop new relationships and friendships. It\u2019s cute to imagine it\u2019s going to last forever and hey every 1 in 100000 sure it works fine and you grow together. Odds are though anchoring yourself to someone who you dated as a kid without experiencing the variety in life now-a-days will leave you wondering what else is out there. I\u2019ve known about 5 couples who\u2019ve been together since 18 or earlier and or never had sex with anyone else and they are all fucking miserable marriages.\n \nYou aren\u2019t going to be the same person you were at 40 that you were at 18 and if you are, that\u2019s sad.",
            "I disagree with most comments just being cynical. Sometimes, you can grow with the person, even when you met as a teen. People in the comments state that you change too much as a teen to stay committed, but are you settled as a person when you're 30? Even if you met someone at that age, you would be different 10 years later. People change all their life, if it was a reason to break up, then there would not be happy marriages anywhere.\n\nStill, as someone underlined, staying with your high school sweetheart is a very rare occurrence, and teens should keep this in mind when choosing their college majors, career path, etc. Teens tend to live very intensely and throwing away everything just for your high school sweetheart might seem a little inconsiderate. At least, I would not encourage that kind of behaviour in my children.\n\nAnd I'm saying this while acknowledging that adults tend to be veeery cynical and mean for no reason towards teenagers. While being careful with how they behave, you can also talk to them without being condescending.",
            "Oh my god telling a person in fucking high school that they likely wont marry that person they started to date is completely fine. Many teenagers fall in love too hard for no reason. Get off your high horse.",

            "I agree you are an asshole for telling teenagers it won't work out, however I think it normally comes from a good place? I don't think adults say this to teenagers that are obviously in very happy and healthy relationships, if there is something bad about the relationship like constant fighting or they have changed and find they dont have as much in common anymore it could be more of a gentle reminder that they don't have to stay in that relationship? I dont know maybe when I was a teen I was lucky I had adults who had my best interests in mind but I can't imagine adults being malicious about a teens relationship like that (I'm not denying they can exist)",

This is anecdotal, but they all have children, and none of them have left their hometown. In my eyes, it's just cognitive dissonance-- they'll almost always convince themselves they made the \"right decision\".\n\nBut if they ever split up down the line, they've been *robbed* of a wealth of experiences, both social, emotional and maybe even intellectual, because they stayed the course they chose when their brains were barely developed.",

I think the real problem here is that we as a society need to normalize breakups, the cutoff probably being engagement. The fact is its incredibly slim that you actual meet \"the one\" especially in your younger years when emotions and self identity change. I think it's better to tell a teen it \"might not work out\" and thats ok. In fact it might be a lesson learned for the one your meant to be with down the road. The important part is you try to make the good ones work and let the bad ones go.",

However its a safe bet to put money on any given one not lasting. \n\n>It\u2019s simply something you don\u2019t tell.\n\nSo we should constantly lie to them just to make you feel better? Or should we prepare them for the reality that the guy they met last week isn't the love of their life and they aren't going to die together 70 years from now?\n\n> Let me tell you, in most cases you don\u2019t,\n\nIncorrect. In most cases we do know. The simple statistics say then relationship will end and relatively soon compared to human lifespans.\n\n>each relationship is unique regardless of the age of the partners.\n\nNo they really aren't. Humans work on chemicals and biological processes the uniqueness of any given relationship is vastly overwhelmed by those factors.\n\n>Any relationship, no matter partner\u2019s age can work out or not work out \n\nCan but likely won't.\n\n>and no one can possibly know.\n\nYes we can. Having decades more experience and not actually being in the relationship outsiders can often see the flaws that people in the relationship overlook at the beginning. Flaws that over time blow up and destroy the relationship once the people involved stop reacting to pure hormones and think about what is going on rationally. \n\nDad doesn't like your new boyfriend does he?",

Someone there when family passes or friends disappear, to go through the terror of adulthood with you. \n\nIt\u2019s a rarity, that\u2019s for sure, but there are 1,000 other ways to go about interjecting your opinion on a relationship.",

But realistically most people will suffer the consequences. \n\nTeen dating is exactly the same.

How many people give up scholarships to good schools for a boyfriend/girlfriend who isn't worth it and derail their lives? How many get married early with a kid on the way and again totally derail their lives?

I was the stupid one, he rejected to look it up himself and preferred to tell me how dumb I was about it.\n\nI didn't get pissed, but really annoyed by how he treated me and was just really really tired and told him to just leave it several times, but he was so argumentative, that he wouldn't stop. So finally I told him, that either he could leave and move to the living room, or I would, because I just wanted some peace and couldn't handle his bitchiness over such stupid things. \nHe packed his blanket and pillow and without another word moved to the couch.\nNext day as we got up we talked it out, he apologized and things were done.

Meanwhile, he did little to nothing for financial contribution to the household.

Dwayne goes on a set and regardless of who's directing, writing, etc, everyone knows he's in charge and things are gonna go his way.  Arnold would listen to someone half his size yelling at him about his performance, things he could do better, differently, etc, be asked afterward, \"Hey, why'd you take that from that guy?  You both know you could rip him in two if you wanted!\" and answer, \"Because he was right.\"  Arnold sought out excellent filmmakers, excellent directors, and listened to them regarding their craft and how he could develop his.

They put on extremely different public personas than how they actually are. They train constantly to perfect these personas, using a team of PR agents and assistants to get them to maximize their marketability. There are actors out there who take more acting classes on how to be perceived in public appearances than they do for their actual acting roles. \n\nThe reality is that almost no celebrity is *themselves* on camera. They just want to do things that make them more likeable. You think Keanu Reeves and Dave Grohl (reddit sweethearts) are somehow except from this? You think Keanu was not thinking of how 'cool' and 'laid back' he would look when he agreed to do a video of him hanging out with puppies? \n\nAlso, more often than not, celebrities are *whores*. They have countless supermodel-level people crawling on the floor to be with them. Its impossible to resist for them. So many celebrities put up this face of them being weirdos or loners or 'incels' (not political kind) and then are banging hot models five times a week.",

She wears a lot of hats, but one of her main tasks has been setting up press junkets to promote movies (cheesy interviews with actors and the movie poster in the background). She has worked with 100s of very famous actors setting up what most call the worst part of acting: promotion. She has some AMAZING stories of her direct experiences with VERY famous actors. But whenever she is asked who is the absolute worst person she has ever worked with, her answer is \u201cThe Rock, and it\u2019s not close.\u201d\nWhen I first heard this I was shocked! I always thought of The Rock as a funny, humble, and thankful person. Everytime I have ever seen him speak he just seems like a dude you want to have a beer with.  My friend said \u201cHe is without a doubt the most insecure, selfish, petulant, demanding, argumentative, angry asshole I have ever been in a room with. If there was ANYTHING not the PRECISE way he wanted it, he would have an absolute meltdown and scream at the top of his lungs berating the staff. And once we fixed whatever ridiculous problem he had, we would still complain non-stop about how everyone around him being \u2018a crew of fuck ups\u2019 sometimes the only way to talk him down off the edge would literally be to bring a camera in the room, or relocate him to a room with a camera. Whenever there was a camera in his vicinity, he would completely 180\u00b0 switch into being the mode warm, kind, and happy person in the room. It made me sick to my stomach to see how effortlessly he could transform into the Rock America knows and loves, yet he chooses to live his life making everyone around him miserable. When I was asked this question 8 years ago, I would name 3-4 actors that I had negative experiences with, but my time with Dwayne has so far exceeded any negative experience I have ever had with anyone in my career.

Men who don\u2019t want women to use dildos or vibrators; women who don\u2019t want men to watch porn (or some specific kind of porn); people of all genders who feel somehow rejected or even cheated on when their partner masturbates.\n\nWhen someone wants to control what their SO wears or their hobbies or social life, everyone is quick to proclaim how controlling, boundary-trampling, and potentially abusive this behavior is. But when it comes to people laying out rules for how/if their SO can masturbate, somehow this is treated as a normal and okay thing for a partner to have control over.\n\nThis is NOT normal or okay. \n\nYour insecurities about your SO masturbating are not your SO\u2019s problem. \n\nBeing in a monogamous sexual relationship doesn\u2019t grant you dominion over the other person\u2019s body and mind. \n\nPeople get to think and fantasize about whatever tf they want, watch whatever tf kind of porn they want, and masturbate however and with whatever tf kind of toys they want. Trying to police that because you are insecure is totally inappropriate and controlling behavior. You should neither do this to a partner nor tolerate a partner doing it to you. \n\nExceptions where it\u2019s okay for a partner to make requests / impose their opinions:\n- Excessive masturbation/porn addiction negatively impacts the couple\u2019s sex life\n- Matters of basic courtesy (e.g., don\u2019t leave porn out on the computer; don\u2019t do it in the bed next to me, etc.)\n- When it involves interactions with real people (e.g., virtual sex workers or sexting with internet strangers)\n- Obviously if it involves anything dangerous or illegal (e.g., public masturbation or self-asphyxiation).",

            "I was struggling with one of the exceptions. My bf was badly addicted to porn. It ruined everything for us. Details spared because it's truly traumatizing.\n\nI was always invalidated because people would say that it wasn't my business, i was being a controlling bitch by asking him to cut down on the porn use. He couldn't get it up or cum for me but he would do it to porn no problem, often in front of me and hide it and lie from me too. We barely ever had good sex for 1 and a half years.\n\nIt didn't even stem from control or insecurity. I started the relationship and realized his addiction and it didn't bother me until i realized it was seriously reducing his general affection/attention span to me, let alone sexual attention too.\n\nI really wish people were more open to the fact that yes excessive masturbation ruins your relationships and especially if porn is involved with it. Be more open to women (and men) if they say there's an issue with it. It isn't always insecurity.",
            "In my opinion, a lot of relationship \"problems\" can be solved with a bit of acceptance that your partner is their own person with their own views, and a short conversation. Really for me, only time you can say your partner can't masturbate is if you agree that when they want to, you'll have sex with them. But thats just unfeasible.",
            "I mean yes, you can\u2019t police your partner\u2019s masturbation habits. But if for example one said to their partner, \u201chey it makes me really uncomfortable that you watch porn while we are together, I would prefer that you didn\u2019t.\u201d and the partner continues to watch porn, it is totally within the other partner\u2019s right to break up with them for it.\n\nIt very much is not okay when a partner tries to control their partner\u2019s masturbation/porn watching habits.",
            "I think it is down to each couple to decide what works for them. Like with my husband and i, we\u2019re pretty equally matched when it comes to sex drive, and generally one can get the other in the mood by simply propositioning them.\n\nWe have an agreement: if one of us is horny, the polite thing to do is see if the other person is interested in sex first, then if they say no, the horny person is free to go masturbate. It is really easy in a long term relationship to get into the habit of taking care of yourself \u201cbecause it\u2019s easier\u201d. It\u2019s a slippery slope to a dead bedroom.",
            "Also, people always like to bring up how women are crazy if they don't want their partners to watch porn. There are several reasons someone might not want their partner to watch porn. Couples should have a conversation about it, come to an agreement, and then whatever the agreement is must be stuck to, or just realize incompatibility and go separate ways. Anything else is dishonesty and hurtful.",

            "Nobody has the right to control their partner's masturbation habits - totally agree, because masturbation has lots of benefits (except in cases where it is excessive and/or it causes harm) and, even if you are in a relationship, you need that 'alone time' (or not alone!).\n\nHowever, the same doesn't happen with pornography. Porn not only has negattive effects on brain development (and we're talking about lifelong development), as it can cause relational problems (including, as you said, problems in the couple's sex life), low self esteem, depression, anxiety and so on. Besides that, the porn industry hides big social problems as human trafficking and sexual violence and abuse (including child sexual abuse), among others that you can easily find with a quick research. If you think \"but I'm not consuming 'that kind' of porn\": 1. you are still funding this industry and these big corporations, even when you are not directly paying, and you know that; 2. you don't know about all the actors' working conditions; 3. you don't really know if even that amateur porn you are watching was published with the consense of everybody in it.  So I don't really think you should wait until it has a negative impact on your sex life to either find new activities (if you are the porn consumer) or to let your partner know about all the damage pornography can cause in everybody's lives and help him/her get out of it.\n\nYou talk about addiction and, like in any addiction, you don't understand what's happening from the beggining, maybe you can't even see that you are addicted... Maybe you are not addicted, but just yet.\n\n(I'm not leaving any source here because everybody can find information online - including numerous scientific studies and articles).",

            "I feel conflicted about this. I agree with the sentiment 100% but I also think that it\u2019s reasonable to request your partner not do things that make you uncomfortable.

I know my body, I can get myself off in about 5 minutes if I put my mind to it (ladies and others with vaginas know just how quick this is lol).\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly how it ended up coming up in conversation but I think my boyfriend was annoyed that I was responding to his texts quickly enough while I was gettin\u2019 busy, so I explained what I had been doing.\n\nHe flipped a lid, saying I should have texted him so we could sext and get off together. I tried to explain to him that I wasn\u2019t even really \u201cin the mood\u201d per se, was just really horny and wanted to rub one out quick and get on with my day. Sexting would have just made it take a half hour and it wouldn\u2019t have been as satisfying because I\u2019d be annoyed at that point.\n\nWe almost broke up that day.

            "If you agreed on a relationship where you're not constantly lusting after other women, and all of the sudden now you're a porn addict, yeah I kinda see the problem with that situation..  If its a completely godless and secular relationship, then do whatever you want without considering how your partner feels about it.  Different people have different value systems.  Just because you personally don't think hardcore porn is immoral doesn't mean everybody feels that way..  It all depends on what page you were on when you started the relationship.  Also, there's nothing \"natural\" about draining your libido every 12 hours to some hardcore scat porn because you've activated the coolidge effect by blasting your brain with dopamine constantly to the point where that's the only thing you can get off too.  Internet porn is a product of modernity, and never before in human history did we require it.  You're not gonna die if you go more than a day without fapping to some degenerate shit, and its not unreasonable for your partner to ask for an uncorrupted spouse.",

Masturbation (and porn, and toys) can be an escape valve for these differences: the partner with the higher sex drive doesn't have to beg the other partner for more sex, leaving them feeling rejected and their partner feeling pressured.  Porn can also provide an outlet for things that one person's into but the other person's not.  Like watersports?

And it's controlling to tell them to be okay with their partner doing that.

It\u2019s a private act. Sometimes I want to see a couple women have a threesome. Sometimes I want to do it myself to save time and energy. Sometimes I\u2019m not in the mood to have sex but need the release. \n\nI\u2019ve found it very strange there\u2019s an issue with it.",

            "My ex-Fiance is/was asexual but was still in the closet for most of our relationship.\n\nThis was one or our biggest arguments. My issue was I felt like something was wrong. He was jacking off, but we were never being physically intimate. Every time I tried to open a dialogue about it, he got defensive and would say it was his body and his choice.\n\nOne day he even silently jacked off into the toilet while I was in the shower, and laughed about it when he was done. I asked him why he would do that when we hadn't had sex in over a month and a half, I was home.  \n\nIt wasn't not about the masturbation. It was about choosing masturbation over physical intimacy every day for months with no discussion or opportunity for growth. That, to me says there's something wrong in the foundation of the relationship. You can masturbate and do with your body what you want. But it's important that both people in the relationship feel wanted and loved. Physical intimacy can be a really comforting expression of safety, trust, and affection.",
            "I feel like this is mostly directed at women who think their partner is \u201ccheating\u201d on them for masturbating or watching porn. \n\nI know many women who have gone to hysterics because they caught their husband\u2019s masturbating - how dare they? Why don\u2019t they want to do it with me? \n\nBut why would a man care if his wife or girlfriend masturbates?",

I thought no couples really tried to actively police each others masturbation habits.....until I read this thread and realized people are fucking idiots. How many people came to the  defense of  controlling someone's masturbation and their body is pretty sick and a red flag for any relationship these people are in.",
            "Unpopular opinion: How my partner and I define our sexuality and masturbation within it is none of OPs business",
            "1. All porn effects men, majority have never stopped long enough to notice. \n\n2. It is not ok to fanatasize about any and everything. So it's ok to orgasm to the guy from your work? While your boyfriend is at home?",
            "You are way over simplifying this and there is a lot more room for personal preference within a relationship than you are leaving with your statements. You can make this sweeping statement for yourself and what you find acceptable or not in your own relationships. You don't have the power to tell everyone else what is and is not ok within their's. \n\nWhile it may not be something you can necessarily control whether or not your partner chooses to masturbate or how or how often, you absolutely CAN control yourself and what you are willing to accept in a partner and you do have a right to expect honesty. \n\nThis is also something that can be fluid within a relationship.  When my SO and I have an active sex life I don't worry too much about how much he masturbates and how.  But when our sex life is less satisfying and less frequent for whatever reason I find it very insulting for him to choose to masturbate instead. It is hurtful. \n\nThis is something that we have openly discussed within our relationship from day 1 and he chose to be in a relationship with me knowing how I feel about that.  He chose to be with me with open eyes, knowing this.",

However, there will be little to no recognition for what we do/did in this pandemic. First and foremost the medical field deserves the top spot of recognition. Hands down. The next most appreciated that I've seen has been those that work in the grocery stores and public markets. While I don't fully agree they are in as much risk now, with a lot of companies restructuring to minimize their risk, I'll concede that, due to dealing with the crazies and the Karen's, they should be given their recognition. Beyond that, first responders and emergency personnel, companies taking care of their employees, governments response to the pandemic, financial relief, easing of burdens in this crazy time. \n\n\nOh... and truckers can work more in the industries we need. I haven't seen a thanks, a nod, even a smile for what we are doing for you. No thought that this pandemic has put an even bigger strain on an already burdened industry. No concept that our work has doubled an already overburdened infrastructure. No nod for those delivering the goods the hospitals and markets need to continue operate. Just an expectation that we'll handle it. An ignorance to the key role of distribution put on the industry to keep things running. Without half of us everything will collapse. So thank a trucker, be patient, and for the love of God be respectful.",

Between the two of them they had 45 years of experience as team drivers. I have learned a great many things from the two of them about romantic relationships and personal development. One year after meeting them, M was diagnosed with breast cancer. Three months later she was out of the truck and going through treatment. I ended up sending her some medical m carts to help with her nausea. In the meantime C was still working, and it was tough for her to be away from her sick wife. Throughout this whole time, C still had the awareness to see some of the things that I was going through and give me the support that I needed. A year later, M's cancer went into full remission and as of today did not return. Although I no longer work at that company, I still talk to quite a few of my former coworkers, including several people that C & M had bought with them to the company.\n\nHere are a few more things that I have experienced/witnessed/been around to see:\nkickbacks and everything that follows\ndrivers who nearly died on the job\nhaving to call the police on drivers\nGrown man eating boogers when he is stressed\nMen threatening to kill each other\nDrivers abandoning trucks \nThere is more than I can possibly put here\n\n\nTl:dr: don't assume what people are like because of their profession. You will probably be wrong. Also if you work in an industry long enough, stupidity will eventually stop surprising you",

I went to an event my company was hosting a few weeks ago where we partnered with someone in a comparable position at one of of our client companies. I made a point to not talk about the projects we were currently working on together and just talk about life. The next day at the office my manager started asking me questions about if I had talked with her about x, y, and z. I said no and even quoted the above quote. I could tell he was confused and a bit annoyed lol.",
            "I literally relate to this post so much. I talk about this stuff to my wife every time I get together with my family. Everyone is trying to constantly keep tabs and check themselves on the \"social ladder\" by constantly asking me about work and if I got a certain job out of college. It's honestly fucking exhausting. Like I'm worth more to the world than what I do to put food on my table.",
            "I recently retired early at 55 and noticed something with my older friends who retired after 65. Work was the bulk of their identity. Without it, they have no idea how to fill their lives or what to do with their remaining days. They might have kids but never really maintained their relationships with their adult kids and their grandchildren. \n\nSimilarly I read a lot of inquiries from Reddit about how to make friends or find a community outside of college. It\u2019s especially hard when they choose to live away from where they went to school. \n\nConsider finding a hobby that speaks to you. Find something that doesn\u2019t require any money or doesn\u2019t continually require money once you get your core equipment. Also think about a hobby you can do when you are physically compromised. Going to the gym is fine but not very useful when you are nursing a pulled muscle. \n\nHaving a hobby fills your days and gives you something to look forward to when you don\u2019t have any big events to look forward to. Anyone notice how work time quickly flies when you are counting down the days to a big vacation?\n\nHaving a hobby often means having a community independent from your family and one where ever you go. Make time to drop in on the local community of makers or writers the next time you travel to see what skills they might have different from your local community.",

Some of them I read and think, \"I could see someone doing this in a truly platonic way.\"\n\nPersonally, I have an experience I think about often. A coworker (girl) invited me over to get drunk on tequila and sleepover. When it came time to go to bed, I asked where I should sleep and she said \"Well you can sleep on the couch or you can come to the bed with me.\"\n\nI elected for the bed.\n\nHowever I wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so I didn't initiate anything and she didn't either.

            "This is exactly why guys \"miss\" hints. \n\n\nAnd some of the \"hints\" that are supposedly missed are things that can definitely be done by girls that want to be just friends.\n\n\nIt is a confusing place out here and people just need to communicate more clearly.",
            "Yeah there's also the situations where the girl's hints were received, but she bails at the last second because she is too shy or changed her mind. \n\nThis confuses guys into thinking they misinterpreted all the signals when in fact they didn't, the situation just changed. \n\nI think that's how you get guys being extra cautious even when it's blatantly obvious the girl wants them",
            "Yeah that's the thing, subtle hints aren't going to be taken not just because of obliviousness, but because it's primarily important to not go too far, as a man, both because of her own boundaries and the social consequences. Everyone in this thread telling you the girl you drank with wanted you, but we really really don't know that, and Reddit loves to assume based on unreliable narrators' one side of a purely text based story. (Not that you're unreliable, that many OP's are.)",
            "Exactly. This is why guys might not get your hints. There can be a huge risk if we\u2019re wrong. We have to be certain.\n\nEdit: to address some replies, it\u2019s because hints and taking hints are very subjective. Some girls would think small hints are actually huge. And vice versa for guys. And that\u2019s the problem. There is no objective standard for a big hint and what exactly it means. Additionally, stopping to ask for clarity is a decent option but sometimes it really turns people off in the heat of the moment.",

            "For me it's better to miss the hint than to misinterprete it and then corrected by her. I've seen a lot of sexual abuse in my own family. I would be terrified if somebody thinks that I'm a perpetrator too because of that.",
            "I don't think it's as much as guys missing hints as it is them being apprehensive of them.  Most guys rarely get hit on, so honestly, it can come off as feeling like some sort of joke or trap. The reason why that feels that way is because at some point in our life we've all been baited and used by a woman, so we become very suspicious down the line when a woman is assertive/dropping obvious hints. \n\nIf you want to go full Reddit you could say it's a trauma response -- I know some dudes who were traumatized and super guarded after that one girl baited them in and discarded them.  Take that how you want.  I'd rather have a missed opportunity than a sexual assault charge or be made to look like a fool.",
            "Always better to err on the side of caution. Op, you made the correct decision. Don't let these clowns convince you otherwise. If you were wrong and ended up violating her, very bad things could have happened. A very basic cost vs. benefit analysis proves that you did the right thing. What do you have to lose if you had sex with her? Everything. What would you have to gain if you had sex with her? Nothing, in comparison to what you'd potentially lose.",
            "I'm in my mid/late thirties (depending on your breakpoint); married, no kids (don't want any), and feel pretty youthful - but I don't envy today's *actual* young men. \n\nThere simply wasn't the same level of innate *fear* back when I was in my teens/twenties (not all that long ago) that I perceive in young men these days, in regards to a misinterpreted signal. I chose the word fear intentionally - because that's what it is. The worst I ever saw or received was a quick 'turn of the cheek' from a girl if you got the wrong idea (happened maybe twice, ever), and that was that - nothing else happened. Nothing was said (other than an apology from myself). There was the understanding that there was a 'missed signal' - not some sort of sexual assault attempt. These days, that simple of an error can and does get people labeled as people who have tried to assault someone; our culture seems to increasingly be teaching that men operate from a perverse orientation, where they try to exert some sort of patriarchal sexual power over women - it's seldom (never) a 'simple mistake' and instead read as 'he tried to assault her'. Standard disclaimer - sexual assault is wrong, and that shit didn't fly even back in the 1990s (at least not in my peer group), and there's no attempt here to exculpate men who are indeed predators - because they do exist - but I can't help but feel that we are creating a culture of fear, both in young men and women; in women, a fear that all/most men are sexual predators, and in men, a fear that if they say or do something flirtatious that isn't 110% welcome, they'll get #metoo'd into the nearest prison.  \n\nMaybe I'm over-perceiving things, but I'd not want to be back in the dating game these days - it seems terrifying, and one mistake could blacken your name.",

            "Tbh girls should just man the fuck up and say it like it is. In this day and age, I'd rather date a girl that knows what she wants or doesn't and tells me outright, so I can avoid wasting my time and pondering forever about whether or not I missed out, like OP.",

            "Growing up, we moved, and lived, all over the world. In my early teen years, I noticed that dating \"rules\" were varied. To the point that I adopted a rather odd policy.  The \"open door\" policy. During casual conversation, I would state that until She opened any \"door,\" i would consider it closed. Short version, if she held my hand, then, the door was open to hold her hand any time past the initial. So on and so forth.\nStill made for some awkward moments... been called gay, uninterested  etc?...",
            "Been there done that. I was at a beach in a European country with a family friend and we were out all night drinking watching the sun come up. Everything felt right when she cuddled up next to me (I assumed for warmth after I misinterpreted the situation). I went for a kiss and it was avoided in the cringiest moment of my life. We're still very close friends and it's just a blip in our past now but holy shit was I embarrassed.",
            "This is why hints aren\u2019t stupids. Be blunt. I\u2019m ace. Hints go over my head since sex and some dating rituals are not on my radar. It is super awkward and uncomfortable when the other person gets offended.\n\nHints are cute in movies and books they are stupid in real life.",

            "I was a senior in high school and I was friends with a girl who was having problems with a long distance relationship. I was a decent writer in school so she wanted me to help her write a heartfelt letter to her bf. She invited me over her house and it was more of a hangout than me helping her write. She started inviting me out to the mall and to the movies too. Things really got confusing when she started inviting me to her room. We would lay in her bed together while we talked and watched movies. She would change in her room with me still there although I always had to turn around. She would call me her knight or her husband at times. I really fell for her, but I eventually cut ties with her because she still had a boyfriend and she never broke ties with him during that whole situation. I felt very hurt because I was being played.\n\nI believe both men and women should never do things like this. Dont play around with people's feelings. If you want people to respect your boundaries then you have to show some respect for yourself and for their boundaries as well.",

            "Yeah, when I was in college I remember getting trashed and completely misreading cues and hints and going for it when I shouldn't have.  So very quickly I came up with the idea that if I'm actually drunk I don't make the first move, don't crowd or corner women.  Be the aloof guy, while still flirting and getting that eye contact going from across the room.  If something happened, yay, if not whatever I still went to a fun party or whatever.  While sober it's just a game, you can tell when a girl is into you, but you can't just say \"wanna fuck?\" unless you look like Chris Hemsworth, which I absolutely do not.  It's a back and forth, and speaking from experience, I don't think guys are missing hints as much as getting bogged down in insecurity.  Now for misreading those hints, it's not an impossible language to learn, and it doesn't reguire mind-reading, if it feels cold but sounds hot, don't go for it.  If it's hot all around, don't rush it, but also don't wait so long that the interest wanes (the danger of long term crushes, she was into you on day one, you didn't make a move until day 876 and now it's weird).  A woman also doesn't  ask you to sleep in a fucking bed with them platonically unless it's clear you are just friends, to both of you.  If you don't understand your female friends enough to know whether or not they want to fuck, then are they even really your friends?  Don't be the dude who befriends specifically to try to bang the girl one day when the stars align, that's weird.  IDK I might be wrong but I see so many dudes fixate on one person when the girl has the attention of dozens of guys, suitors. And then overstep because this one pretty girl is all he thinks he'll ever want, leading to weird and fucked up behaviour.  That turned into a rant.",

            "My question is, how did women survive before the 60\u2019s? Did they just grow up being taught that men would just do what they want, and if they were uncomfortable to just put up with it? Like, I don\u2019t like this pendulum swing we\u2019re in right now where everything needs verbal consent, because some things are uncomfortable to say out loud and they can ruin the mood, so it doesn\u2019t work to ask consent for literally everything. Every single kiss scene in every teen romance movie happens without any verbal consent and women eat that shit up. They clearly don\u2019t always want explicitly verbal consent. \n\nHowever, I just don\u2019t know what the alternative could be. I think maybe if more women understood that guys are earnestly trying to read their cues and do romantic stuff because they know you like that stuff, then maybe they could be more discerning when a guy tries a move and fails. Instead of assuming every guy is an asshole, maybe we could all realize that it\u2019s really hard playing a game where it doesn\u2019t work as well when you\u2019re honest with each other?",

I have been followed to the bathroom and accosted by more lesbians purposefully ignoring my no signs than men. They somehow thought it was okay because you know, female and gay.

And if she's bitter because you didn't \"take the hint\" shame on her.\n\nWhy is it acceptable for women to do these childish behavior, trying to hide what they really want, why does it have to be hints instead of affirmation ? Why do we accept these childish behavior but if a guy is not up front about what he want from you he's an hypocrite ?\n\nThat's just fucking dumb, ladies, grow up.",
            "In AskReddit, every single \"what hints did someone not get\" thread has a \"when did someone overstep your boundaries\" or \"what was your creepy experience\" thread. One person's \"you can sleep over\" is an offer of lodging because it's late and driving tired is dangerous. Another person's \"you can sleep over\" is an invite to sex.\n\nTo make a simple Pascal's Wager:\n\nHint given, opportunity taken: sex\nHint given: opportunity ignored: no sex\nHint absent, opportunity ignored, no sex\nHint absent, opportunity taken: trouble\n\n3/4 of the possible outcomes end in either no sex or in handcuffs.\n\nIt's even worse when you're dealing with intoxicated young people who don't have great communication skills.

Get into bed with them, touch them and they give you sex without complaint. \n\nBut wait! Come morning, you're being told you raped them!

        "selftext": "The thing about marijuana is not that it's physically harmful. It's mentally and emotionally harmful. It encourages you to use it habitually. It might not be physically addicting but it's certainly highly psychologically addicting. How many people do you know who use marijuana casually? The problem is that people abuse it frequently, and it causes them to suffer or atrophy in other areas of their lives, or they use it to cope with something else they're not willing to confront.\n\nFor me, I used weed as an excuse to not participate in society. Rather than see my friends I would just get stoned and turn off my phone. I wouldn't talk to anyone or go out. I was afraid to go out so I used weed as an excuse not to.\n\nThis caused me to have low self esteem. I thought of myself as a loser pothead - because I was. I think many potheads feel this way, but they would never admit it to anyone else.\n\nBut once I finally decided to drop it once and for all, my life has improved so drastically. I felt like a human again, like a member of society. And I realized that it hardly even did anything for me anyway. It turned me into a stupid person. I'm not stupid.\n\nI think the damage that marijuana does is complex, but significant. I think the culture surrounding it and its reputation as a \"safe\" drug is extremely dangerous.\n\nTo quote the great and wise Randy Marsh:\n\n>Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but\u2026 well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at *anything*.\n\nedit: This thread really blew up so I would add on: if you feel you're in a similar situation to mine, my best advice is to reconnect with friends and focus on your abilities, skills, and talents. When I quit I focused more on my creative writing and that built my self esteem like crazy. I realized that the feeling of fulfillment and happiness I got from doing this every day was far greater than the meager feeling of being high that I got from marijuana. I'm now on track to finish my first novel by the end of the year.\n\nA lot of comments are talking about how moderation is key and not everyone uses it the same. My question is: why use this drug at all? What does it help you with? And for whatever problem it is, is there another, more organic way you could solve this problem? For example if you have anxiety, maybe you can work on therapy or confronting this issue and trying to get some closure.\n\nIf you feel the need to get high every day, ask yourself: Do I enjoy life without this drug? And if not, try to figure out why that is and what could help to change it.",

            "I was a pothead for many years, and I was the first one to advocate on how it wasn\u2019t harmful and everyone could benefit from its use. It took many years for me to realize that the argument (like most things) is not absolute. I used to smoke and be able to relax and have fun, or smoke and go right to bed and sleep like a baby. As I got older, I would smoke and be filled with anxiety, or I\u2019d smoke and my brain would feel like it was spinning on its axis and I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep. Despite these effects developing, I continued to smoke. Once I decided to stop and I spent a few months of being clear headed, I then realized that marijuana was actually harmful to me personally, and my life was much better without it. I\u2019m at the point where I get anxiety just thinking about being high, and have accepted that it\u2019s not for me and I won\u2019t participate.\n\n\nOn the flip side, I have friends who suffer from trauma, PTSD, and severe anxiety. These people smoke regularly and it genuinely helps them deal with their issues without the use of pharmaceuticals that (in my opinion) are way more detrimental to a person when compared to marijuana. Again, the argument is never absolute, but I definitely see the aspect of the argument from both sides. Anytime someone tries to sell me on this idea that it\u2019s a miracle drug that cures all, I have to remind them that all drugs have a side effect. I\u2019m an avid coffee drinker, and I\u2019m still aware of the negative effects it has on me, especially as I age. But I also see it\u2019s benefit to helping people with many complex issues.",

Everything revolved around weed and finding ways to smoke without outing myself. I destroyed my self-esteem over it. I've been weed-free for > 3 years now.

            "Hello, pothead here. I completely agree it is probably the most psychologically addictive as it\u2019s definitely the most accepted drug. If for example, I was to start smoking meth instead of weed, all day every day, it would be far more shunned upon by society/ friends/ family etc. Basically, it\u2019s harmful because you think it\u2019s not opposed to other lifestyle drugs.\n \nEdit: I\u2019m referring to illegal drugs here.",

But if you set guidelines for your use (only after 5, only on weekends, etc) then I don\u2019t see what harm it does. Just being able to smoke and take a break from my constant, swirling anxiety genuinely changed my life and has made a lot of other things seem more possible.",

Also in the last 10-15 years the cannabis has got so much stronger and the chemical (name escapes me!) that balances it out has been reduced so it\u2019s even more harmful. Generally not an opinion that goes down well on here so thank you!",
            "I honestly agree with this post wholeheartedly. My life has been completely altered by weed. Ever since starting to use it habitually, I over analyze everything especially social interactions. Giving me anxiety in ways I had never felt before in my life. And then from isolating myself from my friends and family I indulged in a lot of self hatred and just really struggled to stay in reality. I'm still smoking weed on and off every now and then but smoking it turns me into some really dark and hateful person at least towards myself and I know that's not everyone's experience but yeah I do agree it's not as safe as people make it seem.",
            "As many have noted, it depends on the person. I was an opiate junkie for a decade but I\u2019ve never even had the inclination to abuse weed. I smoke a couple of bowls during the three hours leading up to bed time while I\u2019m reading, and I only do it then because I\u2019ve had horrific insomnia since getting clean three years ago.

            "Idk. I hear people say this but it doesn't resonate with me. I've been a near daily user for over a decade but when my dealer is out of town, it doesn't really matter. When the pandemic started, I went over a month with no weed b/c my guy was stuck out of state and not only was I fine, I turned down offers from a couple of friends that offered to sell me some of theirs. I also have a good job and haven't withdrawn from society or anything like that. That's not to say that I'm a social butterfly, I do enjoy my alone time but I don't think that has anything to do with weed. I just like the way it makes me feel but it's not that important. \n\nThat said, it wasn't like this when I was younger. It may have contributed to my depression as a teenager and when I was in my early 20's I really did get upset if I didn't have any. My personal theory is that marijuana is more likely to have these adverse effects when your brain is still developing. I don't think it's a great idea for younger people to use it. Also, it could just be that everybody is different.",

There is nothing inherently wrong with cars but tons of people die every day because of carelessness in driving. Instead of saying cars are bad or good or harmless or inevitably dangerous , it's more realistic to say that cars when used responsibly can be benign or even beneficial, but some people aren't capable of using them safely and some people become careless in their use of them. \n\nLots of people use marijuana to just relax once in awhile , and it doesn't have a negative impact, but lots of other people use it to escape reality and ignore obligations and growth. Both of these experiences are real, and don't cancel eachother out. Same goes for gambling, porn, alcohol etc. We all probably know lots of people who partake in these substances / behaviours responsibly, and others who have it take over their life. \n\n\"Marijuana will ruin your life\" is a dumb thing to say, but \"Be Careful, marijuana could ruin your life\" has some merit to it.",

Sometimes at night I would cry because I was so addicted to it. I tried quitting a month ago but I just couldn't. Fortunately I just got my wisdom teeth out and I'm absolutely terrified of a dry socket so I was forced to quit and honestly just in 4 days of not smoking I can go up the stairs without hyperventilating and getting dizzy,  I don't feel like shit as often as they did on weed, I just feel different. I was a little cranky but then I realized I was actually improving my health. I'm proud of myself for quitting and I actually feel way better and I don't think I'm going to smoke again at least for a long time. Growing up I didn't think I'd ever smoke weed but unfortunately I develop the habit when my cousin shoved it in my face when I was at my low point after a hard separation for my best friend that broke my heart so I immediately took the weed to feel better ever since then I've been addicted like crazy I would smoke every single day multiple times. But now that I've quit I feel way better and I'm proud of myself.",

I have had 1 joint since then and it sent me into the worst state of paranoia and anxiety I have ever experienced. And I actually blame the weed for the social anxiety I have now.

During my peak of smoking I would get high 3-4 times a day and eventually my tolerance built up to what it is now; when I smoke I can hardly function. Paying attention to any one thing is hard, I forget things someone has told me seconds later, and it makes me crazy anxious and irrational. I started smoking because it was a really fun thing to do with my buds, but now it's hard to not think of it as something that I need to do everyday. I definitely think it's a case to case basis for everyone, but moderation is still key.",
            "Yep. I've never been much of a smoker. A lot of the people I knew that started using it heavily in their teens and up to their 30s or even 40s would always have anxiety issues with simple things. Then a lot of them would stop and after a few months their anxiety issues would get better but not resolve. Unfortunately they never let their body learn how to process their anxieties. It's the same with antidepressants.

Or next Monday is the day week I officially quit and get back to my investing. \n\n But nope.

So with a striaght face the government is trying to say you're an adult and you need to go to prison for recording yourself because your a chilld victim. \n\n\nThe other joke is about being tried as an adult for buying and consuming alcohol underage. Because you're an adult at 18, but you're underage for drinking. \n\nWhat if you have sex on camera at 17 but you're also buying and drinking alcohol on the video.

It\u2019s also weird how movies and TV shows are so willing to show characters who are supposed to be in High School having sex. Even if the actors are well of age - why are people so fixated on watching what are supposed to be High Schoolers boning? \n\nIf you\u2019re not a teen but are arguing to keep teen porn\u2026 You\u2019re also really creepy."

Of course. He was eventually transferred as well. My ass has been slapped at work by a female staff member, I've listened to stories about how women have openly bragged to me about their sexual promiscuties. Things I would never have the balls to say to a woman in the workplace. Any time there is an issue regarding two staff members of the opposite sex having issues, it is the guy that usually loses his position. It happened to me years ago. Even though I wasn't demoted, I was falsely accused of something by a female staff member who I considered a close friend of mine and I was transferred. It was completely unwarranted, so much to the fact that I work with her again.

I was sexually assaulted by a woman at a different job. I had bent over to pick an item up and, as she was walking by, she smacked my butt saying, \"nice view\" and walked on. I should have said something but it was so icky I didn't. I'm a big, tall guy who wouldn't be stereotyped as being easy to make squeamish, but I have had a small exposure into the experiences of many women and I did not like it.",
            "I believe in a woman dominated environment, they can slide with more things just like how in a male dominated environment men would get away with more things. It\u2019s humans being humans. I don\u2019t disagree with anything you said though. It happens even in \u201cfriendships\u201d. Females would touch and grab my ass and titties a lot even from middle school times and no one deemed it unacceptable. However, if boys did it , it was perverted and rapey.  \n\nOne time a female coworker of mine decided to rub her hands across my nipples in the middle of work and a male coworker (who I was close to at the time) stared at her and said \u201cWhy are you touching her like that? You\u2019re over here molesting her at her job\u201d and I was so used to it by then from women, it made me realize how I didn\u2019t even feel the urge to report her (even after he said that) but I definitely reported a male coworker at that same job who was talking about wanting to see me naked, and he never physically touched me the way she did.",

            "Sexual harassment/ violence is completely unacceptable no matter what gender is committing it. Sometimes the workplace won't act on the victim's behalf, so if you've truly been made uncomfortable/ victimized then seek the proper outlets and legal entities.\nHowever the stats do say women suffer much more often and also leave/are relieved  of their jobs at much higher rates due to sexual harassment and violence. Not to mention corporations, like Blizzard, have had work cultures around sexually inappropriate conduct towards women. It's not exactly like female victims have it easy. \nBad actors who are women, shouldn't just be lumped in with \"women\" broadly speaking. People aren't a monolith. Like people who do the \"blacks do the crime... you're also a black guy so what do you have to say about the crimes of your kind?\" Routine lol.\nDon't be one of those men who jump down the weird misogynist pipeline over an intellectually unsound thought like that.

I was her only direct report, I was 22, and she did no work for 6 months.\n\nOne day the CEO said she needed to learn how to use the product. She spent two weeks and I tried to help. But she decided she wouldnt/couldnt and would just pin the blame on me. I was doing my own tasks and didnt expect it.\n\nShe wrote me up and did a desciplinary hearing. I proved the work was never assigned to me. She changed her accusation 3 times.\n\nThe 3rd time she accused me of threatening her, verbally assaulting her, making her feel physically unsafe, and causing nightmares. Everyone knew it was a lie. But they had to take it seriously or else she could sue the company.\n\nI refused to ever be alone in the same room with her again. She was furious when she demanded to be in a closed door meeting alone with me but I refused. Would shout at me for it. \n\nWould also ask me \"why arent we friends?\" and \"why dont you smile more?\" after doing all of this.\n\nWhen I broke down and told my mother she told me \"you are just afraid of a strong woman\" and smiled. \n\nI told some girl friends and they instantly sided with the manager and said if she said I threatened her then i must have threatened her as women dont lie about that stuff. \n\nThe experience taught me a lot about the nature of women, and the types of power only women have and how they can abuse it. And just how strong the \"sisters before misters\" bias is. My mother own knew I was driven to severe depression and still sided with my manager even after knowing the facts. Girl friends Ive never lied around for 6 years instantly said I must be a liar, and they had no idea I was a liar.",
            "I work in a hospital as maintenance and being the youngest guy in my shop and relatively good looking have been thrown to the wolves to deal with more \"difficult\" people who call for us. Comments are made all the time but I'll be honest I'm really good at just ignoring it after 12 years in the navy and dealing with women and a few gay men on ships.",
            "I get the feeling that this happens much, MUCH more than people already think.  Women get raised with the preconception that they are much more delicate and weak than men.  Meaning that they should always be wary of men's intentions because they are the stronger, more predatory sex.  So they are always on the lookout for creeps and look after each other to keep each other safe.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But it gets to a point that they form a sort of groupthink situation where, if one man's advances are unwanted by one, they are unwanted by all.  Or if one of them shows the type of predatory behavior that OP refers to, and find it acceptable, then the behavior is considered acceptable by all.  When it comes to justifying inappropriate behavior or bullying or ostracizing, women usually do it as a group.\n\nMen do this as well, don't get me wrong.  But individual self-reliance is the trait that men are usually raised with.  So in negative situations like bullying or harassment, it's more like seeing how much one individual can get away with while his peers cheer him on.  Instead of how much they, as a group, can get away with, like it tends to go with women.  The crucial difference is that once a man is on the receiving end of harassment or unwanted attention, he's on his own.  That pressure to be individually strong means that you can't ask for help.  Because if you do, then you're not a real man.  And too often, when they bring it up to see if they can get some positive support, the social consensus is usually against them.  \n\n\"If you didn't want her to touch you, why didn't you push her off?\", even though we are also told not to ever use force or put your hands on a woman because they are weaker and more delicate.  \"If you didn't push her off, then you must have liked it.\" even though you also hear assholes say that when a woman gets raped.  \"You work out and dress nice, so what did you expect working with a bunch of women?\"  That's just the men's equivalent to \"you must want the attention if you're dressing like a slut.\"  And then there's the one usually reserved for men only: \"What, are you gay?  I wish chicks were all over me, touching me all the time.  But they never even give me a second look!\"\n\nSo women usually have a social safety net that tells them to be extremely suspicious of men's attention because of men's ulterior motives, whether or not the circumstances warrant it.  \"Better safe than sorry\" isn't a bad mindset to have, unless it becomes full blown paranoia.  Which is easy to happen when you're part of a group that all thinks that way already.  But men usually have a small social \"safety net\".  And if you bring up being harassed by women, that safety net turns on you and tells you to be thankful for even unwanted attention.  And because men really are starved for attention and affection, it's very easy to give in to that mindset.  And the more \"enviable\" the situation, the more open to ridicule you might be.  Hence even more reason to keep it to yourself.  That's why men who are sexually assaulted by women come forward as often as women who have been sexually assaulted by men do.\n\nBut just think about that for a second and imagine if the roles were reversed.  I know in the past, assholes have said some pretty horrible things about women who have been raped.  But if you're a woman, can you imagine what it would be like if the \\*normal\\* response you've heard other women get when they come forward is \"oh, really?  Well, you should count yourself lucky you got raped.  It's not like anyone else wants to fuck you anyway.\"",
            "Truth be told, no matter their gender, anyone is capable of being a perverted jerk and sexual harassed.\n\nIt's kind of funny how, when I started to view everyone as full-on equal (socially and professionally, of course), I noticed how even the \"feminists\" could be just as backwards as the mysgonists.",

            "You know I used to be cool with those videos on YouTube UNTIL I dealt with one irl. \n\nThey're so fucking annoying, and it just feels weird to be working out while people are filming (without your consent ofc). Like these vloggers took so long to use the deadlift section so me and my friend decided to do another thing instead. I don't want to be in your damn video. I paid the gym membership to workout. That's it.\n\nEdit: It's cool if you're doing it for form. No problemo. That's personal use. It's a problem when you're doing it for YT or IG style workouts and the like. The people I encountered were the latter.",
            "There's the law and then there's policy.\n\nThe law pretty much allows for filming and picture taking in any setting where there is no expectation of privacy. The only real exception is when such images are for monetary gain.\n\nPolicy allows for amendments. If the gym's policy is to not allow videos or pics in public settings and they make it known, then they can (possibly) trespass the offender. They can't demand the deletion of the vids or pics since they are the property of the possessor. They can ask.",

            "Agree about not taking up two machines.\n\nBut with simply filming themselves (which is not a thing I personally do), it\u2019s not always for Instagram. Some people film themselves to check their form. You can\u2019t always look in the mirror to do this. For example, you can\u2019t see if you\u2019re keeping a straight/neutral back during a deadlift because that requires a profile view, and you can only face forward. \n\nThere are also online forums for people following particular workout programs (Stronglift 5x5, Wendler 5/3/1 etc) where members will post videos of their lifts looking for form checks and advice. \n\nIn any case, I don\u2019t see the need to be self-conscious about being in the background of someone else\u2019s video. It makes no difference whether it\u2019s in a gym, on the beach or at a bus stop. People can film themselves anywhere, and you could be in the background anytime. Don\u2019t worry about it. Whether it\u2019s for Instagram or for form checks, the person is only watching themselves.",

I don\u2019t post the videos to social media or share them with anyone else, I just delete when done. \n\nAlso, and I don\u2019t make these kinds of videos, but when I first got into lifting I watched a ton of videos on Pinterest of other woman recording their lifting routines. Really helped me learn a bunch of great gym workouts. \n\nI will agree with no one besides you (and if you have one then your trainer) cares about your workout.",

Not sure if they do anything but no one should be shamed for trying to be healthy. I also noticed that it is a lot of younger people who do this. \n\nhowever I will admit that I did film this lady at the gym one time. She was on the elliptical and she just looked....magical. Like she was floating on air the way she moved on it. Idk if she was dancing or just living her best workout life but I was mesmerized watching her. It was impressive.

He\u2019s in his high school football team, so he records his workouts to show his coaches that he\u2019s following their workouts, since they can\u2019t really train together due to covid. Its not necessarily to show off, but it helps him be motivated to work out.",

            "Personally, I don\u2019t mind someone filming themselves at the gym. They might want to work on their form or they might have a fitness channel. What bothers me is people intentionally filming other people at the gym without their permission. I\u2019ve seen videos where guys filmed a woman working out because she was attractive, that\u2019s crossing the line.",
            "Anytime I see someone set their phone up on another machine to record themselves, I will always go over and use that machine. It doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019m working on that day, I will do one set of whatever that machine does just to inconvenience that person.",

            "I definitely get the opinion, but I also support the people filming in the gym. I follow a lot of YouTube fitness channels and learn a ton from them. \n\nI think it\u2019s be good etiquette for the people to not take multiple pieces of equipment and ask the people who would be in the background of the shot if they\u2019re fine with them filming there. It takes a lot of confidence to film in public anywhere and I think as long as it\u2019s being done courteously it should be respected.",
            "Yup definitely agree. Also phone conversations in the gym should be banned as well while we\u2019re at it.",

            "Some of us enjoy certain aspects of working out, and recording big PRs can be great to look back on and enjoy. When I do film (not often) I try to minimize distracting others or getting others in the video. \n\nI can understand being annoyed with the way some people video, granted I\u2019ve never ran into anyone obnoxious in 16 years off and on in the gym. I\u2019m sure there are people out there though that don\u2019t understand basic social etiquette. \n\nBut a blanket ban for everyone? Fuck that. You may not give a shit, and I don\u2019t care that you don\u2019t, but I do care about big achievements I\u2019ve worked my ass off for years to hit. The videos are for me, not you.",

            "Hi! Competitive powerlifter here. A large majority of us powerlifters or any competitive lifter are coached through online trainers, and form checks (sending a video of your working sets to your coach so he can shock your form, strength, imbalances) are a huge part of the coaching process, and to do so a video of our sets are needed. That being said using other equipment or setting your camera up super far away from your lifting location is extremely obnoxious and anyone who records their set in a way to inconvenience others is aggravatingly us too, and using that misused space to take a crappy video to thirst trap later on instagram is a real asshole thing to do. For any competitive lifter, it\u2019s fairly necessary to record your sets if you want to be properly coached so i hoped this helped!",

            "There's lots of legitimate reasons to film your own workouts.\n\nI think a reasonable gym policy would be that filming is fine, but if youre taking up extra space (like an extra machine) and someone wants to use it you let them, and if someone is working out near you and can not work out elsewhere (specific machine, gym is crowded, etc) and asks you to stop filming them you do so.\n\nLike most policies this boils down to \"don't be an asshole\".  But there's nothing inherently assholish about filming yourself at the gym.",
            "I\u2019m inclined to agree, but I\u2019m reminded of a post I saw a few days ago about a kid being assaulted for \u201cworking out too loudly\u201d. The assaulter was banned from the gym, and the kid\u2019s family given a year (lifetime? It\u2019s fuzzy) membership, and that probably wouldn\u2019t have happened if he wasn\u2019t recording it.",

Not something that is necessarily tied to filming which in and of itself is generally a well mannered, unobtrusive practice.\n\nAlso, I agree influencers can be annoying, but the gym isn't exactly going to outlaw them as they should be fairly easy to ignore and they aren't breaking any laws. Sometimes I see vloggers on the train. Walking up and down, talking loudly into the camera. Sorta selfish of them, I guess, but it's totally within their right to record their little vlog and it's on me to get annoyed by it or not.

            "I met my wife when I was 16 and her 15. We dated less than a year later. Got pregnant like idiots when I was 20 (2nd year in college), we've now got 3 kids and have been married for almost 6 years. Never, in our 9 years together, have we actually considered breaking up. We've never even gone to sleep after an argument without working through it and making up first. I've never dated or even held hands with another girl. \n\nYet so many people -our parents included- view teen relationships as dumb. We're told to treat HS and even early college 'casually', because you're 'just a kid'. \n\nWell the fact is that 2 people can grow and mature together. The fact is that there's never a switch from \"child\" to \"adult\", it's just a slow maturing. All the things relationships that happen as a \"child\" will affect the \"adult\". I know several peers who are still fucked up from \"insignificant\" relationships. \n\nthe worst is when parents (usually mothers) think it's so cute when their kid starts dating in middle school. \"aww you're going on your fiiirst daaatee! my little baby is growing up!\". Like this shit is no joke... people can become jaded because of these relationships. People have sex, can get stabbed in the back by friends, and get alienated over rumors/leaked nudes. Relationships are NEVER something to be taken as insignificant. ",

I can remember the moment I saw her. My parents constantly told me it was puppy love and not to take it seriously. They belittled what I felt and told me it was stupid to get in a committed relationship. We have been inseparable for 13 years and married for 8 of them. Every moment has been like a dream to me. We are also are expecting our first child this summer. Sometimes it is good to meet so young, Some people grow apart, but I am lucky we grew together.

I do my best to calm her down but their relationship is just so stupid! Always acting cold to each other and arguing about pointless things. Now she doesn't answer me because \"she needs to be alone\".\nAnd when I'm telling my friends that they sound ridiculous when they complain and cry about breaking up with their 90th boyfriend they just tell me I'm jealous and I just need to find someone.\nMaybe I sound too angry but seriously this shit drives me crazy and I have a lots of friends with relationships like that so when they call me and cry about the fucking argue they had with their fucking boyfriend makes me go fucking insane.

The person clearly doesn\u2019t want to break up with that person and they want to work it out, they are in love, they invested a lot into this person etc. There is nothing wrong with trying to work things out in a relationship, that is what builds a fucking relationship. And not everyone\u2019s relationship is black and white....everyone has different situations and a lot of other people\u2019s advices are coming from a place where they fucked up in their relationship which may not pertain to the other person. \n\nAlso you have to keep in mind that the person asking for advice did not tell you their whole relationship so you shouldn\u2019t assume you know their entire relationship based off that one problem they told you. \n\nBut yeah I definitely agree with you on this.

At first, time is only felt vicariously, as something that happens to other people. You get used to living in the moment, because there's nowhere else to go. But soon enough, life begins to move, and you learn to move with it. And you take it for granted that you're a different person every year, Upgraded with a different body...a different future.

            "Its good to remind them not to do anything they might regret later BECAUSE its unlikey that their first relationship will last to the end of time",
            "I agree. Because some relationships do actually last which is a heartwarming story. Others, well, you need to learn how to date, respect other people, learn about love and attraction, learn healthy relationships. If you dont and you get told not to date until you find the one you will marry, well, that is literally the point of dating. \n\nSo you would.never date and marry anyone since you dont know they are the one until you date them. Or, if magically you just know this one is the one, and you have never dated before, chances are it ksnt going to go well",
            "I couldn't agree with you more. It's not just stupid and rude it can also be very damaging to the teenager.\n\nIf they are asking you (an adult) about relationships it means they trusted and respected you enough to come to you. Chances are that they're  seeking out an adult because they know they're out of the limits to deal with this problem and want to learn more about how to be in a healthy relationship. So they turn to an adult to give them guidence on what to do to learn how to deal with these sort of problems.\nWhen I was a teenager in HS I went to my cross country coach about a fight I was having with my boyfriend (well she saw me crying and asked what was wrong so I told her)  She talked to me, and gave me advice that helped my relationship in HS. The exact same advice she gave me also helped me solve a fight with my boyfriend last week! \nWe need to help teenager and begin to give them real advice and life lessons. Especially when they cared enough to ask about it. \n",
            "Factually speaking, we learn from all of our relationships.  So it doesn\u2019t matter whether they last, they teach us about our wants and needs.

Also, romantic relationships are at the very core of the human experience. So yes, fuck anyone who tells you they\u2019re pointless. They\u2019re literally just plain wrong. ",

It\u2019s still really important not to do this in a patronizing or condescending manner, but in a loving, encouraging way.\n\nI think the reason people are so quick to give the \u201cbreak up\u201d advice is because nowadays relationships in general aren\u2019t valued as much as they should be, it\u2019s collateral damage from our \u201cinstant gratification\u201d mentality.",

            "But learning from teenage relationships help them shape a healthy relationship later in life??? People are stupid telling teenagers it doesnt matter. If anything, it matters even more.",
            "Is this really an unpopular opinion? Do most people really say those things to teenagers? All relationships matter and none are pointless or stupid. I've had good and bad relationships but regret none of them because they've all taught me something and helped me grow as a person. Teenage romantic relationships help teens find what they do and don't want in a partner, among many other things. \n\nI only dated one guy, briefly, in high school and I feel that hindered me when I entered my first serious relationship as an adult. If I'd dated guys in high school, I would've been better equipped to recognize red flags and maybe wouldn't have ended up marrying the first guy I had a real relationship with. Maybe I would've realized sooner that our relationship was codependent and abusive. I was naive because I had basically no experience in the dating game. I spent 14 years with him instead of running for the hills at the first sign that something was very wrong,like him saying he loved me after a month or getting jealous over me talking to my male friends, including my gay best friend who clearly wasn't trying to hook up with me. Maybe I would've bailed after catching him passive aggressively poking holes in the condoms after being told I didn't want children until I was finished with college and settled into a career. That would've made me a single mom at a young age (20) but I eventually ended up becoming a single mom anyway. Maybe I would've realized he was slowly isolating me from all of my friends and gaslighting me about so many things. Dating and especially marrying him was a horrible idea in hindsight but I don't regret any of it because he gave me our children and he unintentionally taught me what I don't want in a partner. Unfortunately, he also conditioned me to question myself when my gut says something is wrong and he conditioned me to accept bad behavior from men, which I'm making real progress on moving past. \n\nI encourage my daughters to \"date\" boys at their school. \"Date\" because they're in middle school and at their age dating mainly equals holding hands at school, texting/calling each other, and occasionally going to the movie theater or skating rink. It's mostly innocent but it helps prepare them for the less innocent relationships they'll probably have in high school. The high school relationships will help them prepare for more serious adult relationships. I don't want them to end up like me.",
            "There's a weird doublethink going on: where your teenage romance was a sign of true love if you marry or something later in life, but in the moment we treat it as completely trivial. We have weird hangups about teens in general I think.",

Any adult telling you otherwise missed some lessons, and is indeed, both rude and stupid.\n\nAn important example: the art of arguing without saying hurtful things that you don\u2019t mean. That\u2019s an essential relationship skill. How do you learn it if you aren\u2019t taking your relationships seriously? At what age do these adults think relationships become serious, 18?

            "This will probably get a few downvotes but this is just my honest opinion. I can understand why people feel like a teenage relationship is just silly and will never last. I do believe teenagers can have serious relationships, I myself am in a relationship with a teenage sweetheart. We've been together for almost 4 years. \n\nFrom what I remember in highschool a lot of the relationships weren't really built on much and they often only lasted a couple of weeks. It would usually go something like, girl/guy has a crush on someone based purely on looks, they ask said crush out knowing little about them and then break up when they realise they have nothing in common.\n\nA rule I generally followed was that the couple had to have been together for at least a month for me to consider it serious, an acception being that said couple were friends and knew each other before hand.\n\nI know a lot of people I knew from highschool don't consider their two week relationships as something serious. Usually out of embarrassment or because they barely knew the person. ",

Even when they're young, most people want to be with their lovers forever, most don't enter a relationship knowing it'll die (though I know a few). \n\nAs the top comments on this thread say, this is definitely an issue with r/relationships and related subs. All they encourage if someone is not in a long term marriage is breaking up over the most menial things that the person has come to the sub for advice on. Of course, some situations are really bad. But there are two sides to every story and that is the one issue on r/relationships, is it becomes a sub about telling people to ghost others in their lives. ",

The thought that no matter how I felt currently, we'd probably break up anyway. Those doubts are what made the relationship feel unstable and disposable.

As a teenager myself, I haven\u2019t been in a relationship ever but I\u2019ve had my share of what terrible relationships look like when they realize that their relationship is coming to an end. At my old school, there was this abusive dude that had been dating this other girl for 3 years, and when she finally told him I want to break up with you, he punched his hand through a iron netted window. A window with F*CKING IRON STRANDS INSIDE OF IT. When he pulled his hand out, the netting scraped his arm so bad he started bleeding and he passed out. Moments later, the ambulance was at our school and they took him to the hospital. It\u2019s sad to see teenagers being fooled by their own ego, or whatever it is, just to make them feel like they are always right. ",

We continued dating through and after high school including two and a half years of long distance. We\u2019re still together to this day and coming up on six years now. \n\nWhenever I see a teenager asking for help with their relationship on Reddit, I try to treat them with the same respect I would have wanted at their age. I try to give them other solutions than breaking up with their partner a lot of the time, and it often comes down to a problem of mixed messages and confusion that can be resolved through better communication. I\u2019ll only tell them to break up immediately if the situation has actually turned toxic (such as the partner cheating or treating them very badly), and I even try to do that with as much respect as possible, framing it as \u201cyou deserve a partner who treats you right\u201d rather than \u201cthere are plenty of fish in the sea.\u201d The former is empowering to hear and doesn\u2019t belittle the person\u2019s age because you deserve a partner who treats you well at any age, the latter devalues the effort you have put into your current relationship even if things are currently going badly and suggests you can just cut all the strings and throw it away. Most of the time it\u2019s not that easy, even for young people who don\u2019t have their lives all tied up yet. The emotional attachment is still there and needs to be addressed respectfully too. In general one big issue I see is adults trying to make teens feel better by telling them things like \u201cyou\u2019re young, it won\u2019t matter in a few years\u201d and while that might be true sometimes, it definitely isn\u2019t comforting to hear in the moment and invalidates the teen\u2019s feelings. Not cool.\n\nNot all teenage relationships are going to last forever, that\u2019s a fact of life. And so what? I just don\u2019t see a point in raining on their parade and being a dick. There is always a chance things could work out in the long run if both people are right for each other. Even if they don\u2019t last, learning how to communicate with an SO and successfully solve problems with them as a teen is kind of like putting on the training wheels for when you\u2019re adults and relationship issues get more serious. It\u2019s also a good way to start learning what traits you do and don\u2019t like to have in a partner. Why call them stupid and be mean when dating young is a great way to learn life lessons that can be useful for years to come? If you never try something out for yourself, you\u2019ll never know how to tackle that experience. Sometimes even if things aren\u2019t going well, you need to let teens try and fail and scratch their knees up a bit rather than telling them to just give up right off the bat.",

Regardless, I don\u2019t think teenagers relationships in general are stupid or don\u2019t matter. I think that we all have to grow and mature and often relationships are a way for us to grow and mature.

Fostering a lifelong interest in animals from youth probably does have an impact in them supporting conservation later.",

If you think about how much your average 5 year old knows about dinosaurs and switched that to knowledge about say primates or reptiles or whatever snd then nurtured that knowledge you'd have a world full of really passionate experts. \n\nI would say most leaders in zoology probably had real life exposure to the animals they study extremely young \n\n3. So I think rather than banning kids we just need to get more comfortable as a society kicking poorly behaved kids out of places.

            "I'm almost on the same page.  \n\nMany of the animals in zoos are protected legally in their countries of origin and by international law, zoos have a real reason have keepers and staff that care deeply about the animals and their well being.  They aren't immediately replaceable, and healthy/happy animals are more likely to copulate and have healthy offspring to place on exhibit.  Conservation of the animals in a zoo and the national/international community of zoos in general is has become very important to the institution itself. \n\n\nBut make no mistake, zoos are there so people can see these animals that without having to travel and disturb the animals in their natural habitat.  Publicly owned zoos were seeded and perhaps continuously funded for the people to come visit and see the animals inside of them.  Since we quit using beasts of burden in modern society, more people  worry about the well being of animals themselves. Using the conservation message is a great way to rationalize keeping animals that in their natural habits in a habitat a fraction of their natural range size in an unnatural climate for them.  \n\nIf you ban young children from zoos you are going to cut out a considerable percentage of the people that pay to visit the zoos,  and that would be harmful to the zoo's ability to be self funding.  Instead, of banning children, talk to those who build the exhibit's viewing areas or platforms for a \"child friendly/safe (for the children and animals)\"  But realize that there is going to be interactions (negative or not) between the animals on exhibit and members of the public that they exhibited for.",

Also, some adults can be idiots as well and be a nuisance to the animals.\n\nRegarding younger kids not \"understanding\" what they see nor issues about conservation I'd disagree with that based on personal experience alone. I remember distinctly as a young child (younger then 6) visiting the zoos and beginning to grasp the concept that the zoo animals weren't in their natural habitat and why. Zoos helped reinforce my love of animals at a young age. So, I would hate if other young children wouldn't have the same opportunities to gain a further respect for the animals.",
            "I think kids need to see the animals; they just need to be better separated. One-way glass that\u2019s set apart by a soundproof plastic barrier on the human side, so even if the kid bangs on it, the animals won\u2019t see or notice. Hell make the zoo a big open space with partitioned safe habitats abs then let humans go through hamster tubes to see stuff.",
            "Sounds to me like you have parents who need to be educated on proper zoo behavior. Children can't be expected to know not to do that. It's their parents jobs to tell them how to behave. My children love the zoo and every time we have gone it's a lesson in respect for other species. You have a parent problem, my friend, not a child problem.",

            "Imagine not knowing toddlers have paid your salary your entire career.",
            "In that case I\u2019d think Zoos should adopt a more \u201cmuseum-like\u201d approach where specific animal exhibits are off limits to free roaming people, and need to be chaperoned by a curator of some kind that educates and watches the crowd\u2026wait, don\u2019t they all do this already?",

I didn't understand what was problematic about my behavior and now i do, i was aware of times where i crossed the line and felt badly about them but i was expressing a pattern. The things i'm guilty of are a far cry from forcible rape, assault, yelling, threats, intimidation and predatory acts but im guilty of abuse and to some people the other merits of my character are gone now, people i loved. It's been really difficult for me but i would never presume to take away the platform of the very real victims out there.\n\nI'm sharing my story to let you know i do understand how dangerous cancel culture is but also to say that people do deserve a platform. Sexual crimes are rampant and ingrained in our culture and we desperately need to change that. I'll own the mistakes i have made and be a sacrificial lamb if it means people find justice for the horrific crimes going on out there. People who are thoughtful enough to give me the benefit of the doubt and are thoughtful enough to know i'm for the most part a good person, an ally , and a man who is capable of changing controlling and abusive patterns are the only people i need in my life. Those who wish to form a lynch mob can cancel me if they want, there's a whole world out there outside of twitter and im excited to see it.\n\nCancel culture is a byproduct of an echo chamber hive mind, twitter is the judge jury and executioner and there wont be justice in it if it continues unchecked. I do believe in social public community justice and i hope it evolves in a healthy way. I am in therapy now for two reasons. Firstly and mostly to change controlling tendencies ive had and now secondly for receiving death threats and being made a pariah for things i truly didn't do. The issue at hand is more complicated than your post is implying and i think you're not considering the amount of horrible abuse that is truly out there. I get your point fucking trust me on that, but i think its privileged, disgraceful and misguided to tell someone you \"sure, you were \"abused\" but you weren't really abused..\" In fact its horrible. Some people also aren't able to truly articulate traumatic experiences, and what they've written online isn't the full extent of what they went through.\n\nTLDR; its a complicated issue. Victims deserve a platform. Especially ones who can no longer seek out legal justice. They're trying to protect people. But yes twitter is dangerous when unfounded accusations lead to other people being hurt. Lets discuss solutions instead of creating more pain. Point is i disagree with you, as someone who has been through pain as result of being put on blast publicly. The large majority of women are not lying and we should listen.",

        "selftext": "Schools, in my area at least, have been allowing fewer days for leave for sickness and becoming more strict on how and when those days are used. This is to encourage \"perfect attendance\" and it is harmful to the child in more than one way. \n\n1. The child is pressured into attending school even when sick, further suppressing an immune system that is already stressed by environmental factors. This can lead to a number of complications for the child, both short and long term, from leaving them susceptible to secondary infection, to the development of autoimmune disorders. If the child is taught to take proper care of their health and to heal when they are ill, then they will be better off in both regards.\n2. The child is being conditioned to work ill. The future can never change to allow for better work conditions if the next generation does not progress beyond what the previous has. From a young age, American children are taught they must suck it up and work through it. Studies have shown that if a worker is given a generous sick leave, not only does the productivity go up but the medical cost goes down because the chances of serious illnesses are reduced. Workers can afford to stay home when they are sick. Our students are taught that working ill is what is expected of them and not only is it expected but most schools are tightening the noose and making it harder for the children to take leave when necessary. By the time an adult emerges from the school, they are used to \"shaking it off.\"\n3. The financial burden that is placed on a family because of policy change requiring doctors notes when insurance is not widely affordable, nor is a visit to a local doctor exactly cheap. A same-day visit to a local urgent care can easily run two hundred to three hundred dollars. This is also coupled with the hit already being taken by a parent that is missing work and may or may not have paid leave to do so. If a note is not returned to the school from a local doctor, at the very least the absence is unexcused and counts against the child, affecting everything from grades to driver licenses. In more strict counties and municipalities, a child can be counted truant without the doctor's note. Policies like these are ill-guided and do not produce the results desired. They impact grades and performance in a negative manner and hurt the morale of both parent and student.\n\nUnfortunately, in today's world, schools influence our children more than we can ever realize. They shape much of their rationale and critical thinking skills that will follow them for the rest of their lives. As parents, it is up to each of us, to be active in trying to shape the policy that governs the school system.",

            "Agreed. My parents encouraged me to stay home when I was truly sick and I still follow that to this day. Ethically it's rude to infect other people when you are very ill plus it takes longer to heal in the long run instead of taking a day or two off. \n\nI am also working commission as well as there are no paid days off in my job, so it is not a luxury for me to take a day off.\n\nThis workaholic mentality needs to be changed and we will gain productivity in the long run when people aren't sick shamed. Children especially. They need to heal when they are sick.",
            "I honestly genuinely hate missing school cause then I have to catch up but when I take a break I NEED that day off. There is no room for want when it comes to work load for me at this point.",
            "Honestly, it is this way because of school budgets.  Schools (in the USA) get money based on how many students are present each day.  If a student is absent, the schools lose the money for that student.  This is called ADA, or average daily attendance.  ADA is the majority of most school\u2019s budget. Schools are so underfunded anyway, they often resort to perfect attendance policies and other questionable (imo) practices in order to make sure their budget stays in the black.",
            "I can confirm. I work in the food industry and even when I know I may be contagious, my bosses and coworkers make me feel like crap about calling off (ahead of time, never less than 4 hours before my shift). Their reasoning is that there is so much work to do and \u201cback in their day\u201d they used to go to work no matter what.",
            "It\u2019s not as simple as taking days off when your sick as an adult. If I take days off when I\u2019m sick I don\u2019t get paid. When I don\u2019t get paid bills don\u2019t get paid",
            "\"Schools, in my area at least, have been allowing fewer days for leave for sickness\"\n\nhuh? I didn't even know that there were \"sick days\" ... for school. I thought you just didn't go in if you were sick. That's how it was when I grew up. Well I have a 5 year old now so I'll find out soon enough. \n\nI say screw the rules and do what's best for you/your family.",
            "One of my pet projects since I was in school was keeping track of all the \"in the real world\" proclamations that got made in classroom settings, and checking to see how many of them wound up being true, and a huge number of them were total BS. \n\n\"If you're not in your desk the second class starts you lose all your participation points for the week, because the real world\" is an example that comes to mind. Every job I've ever had has more or less had unspoken \"round up to the nearest 10 minute\" timekeeping. And this is on purpose. It's illegal to make people work if they're not getting paid, and it's also impossible to time your entrance so your butt hits your seat at the turn of the hour. A lot of companies err on the side of the employee and let you just put your official start and end time on your timesheet if you're showing up relatively around that time every day.",
            "I think the attendance policies are more to hold the parents accountable. I work in a school and a lot of parents don\u2019t take their children\u2019s education seriously. Kids miss a lot of days and what happens is low literacy, coupled with low retention of content learned in class and bam! You have a bunch of 4th graders reading at a kindergarten level. \n\nWhenever a child is doing poorly in school, the first question asked is \u201cwhat\u2019s their attendance like\u201d and I would say more than 75% of the time the child has been absent for 20, 30, 40 days.",
            "I was constantly sick during secondary school and was in like half the time, even though I had better marks than some kids who were always in I still got constantly told by teachers that I need to be in more, my parents even got a letter about this even though I always had notes from them because I was genuinely sick.",

By the time I got to high school, I knew most of the material and also wanted freedom, so I cut class every chance I got. After high school, I still wanted nothing to do with school anymore so I took a few years off before I grew up a little and went to college. \nNot allowing freetime during my childhood definitely had an impact on my time in high school and college. I'm all grown up now, so it doesn't affect me the same way, but I do absolutely feel like I need to \"suck it up\" when I'm sick and end up going into work anyway. A few months ago, I got hit in the head on my way to work, and had a concussion. My wife forced me to go to the ER - all I remember was thinking \"I can't miss work\" no matter the consequences to my health.",
            "That's the point. School is designed to create factory workers who are willing to sacrifice their own wellbeing for the company.

            "My last job (administration at a major University- a sickness in it's own rite...)had **numerous** people who would come in deathly ill sneezing, coughing and dripping their crap everywhere.  They would get angry at the very notion that they should go home so the REST OF US wouldn't  get sick.  My boss thought they were just the cutest little hardest working angels.  Then of course the reverse was that if any of us did stay home with sickness, we'd get the guilt trip and third degree.  We had to mark down in four different areas where and when and why we were not at work.  Screw them!  This is where it starts!",
            "The sad thing is that part of school at this point is just teaching children how to be good employees, one\u2019s who can work 5 days a week and never call out sick.

            "Here's the reality: to be competitive in most high-end careers, you have to work when you're not at your best.  High powered lawyers, startup company leaders, public faces of companies: your work can't wait around until you're over the sniffles or you're done grieving for a lost family member; you make it happen, or you get replaced by someone who will.\n\nWhile we like to pay lip service to the idea that the world will wait if you aren't feeling well, we don't tolerate those excuses from the people we rely on most, and neither does the rest of the world.  Working while sick (or grieving, or injured, etc) is the norm in most careers that kids dream of, so schools are preparing kids for the economy that way (by telling you to stay home if you're sick, but then judging you if you actually do - just like the real world does).",

I've never heard of a student being academically punished for less than 5 or 7 unexcused absences and parents are only involved if the truancy is extreme. Additionally, students missing school is a burden on administrators and teachers who are responsible for being sure they don't fall behind as a result. Excessive truancy is illegal for good reason because its crucial to be sure that children get a minimum acceptable amount of education.

            "Schools make a big deal about attendance because chronic absenteeism in school has a major impact on someone\u2019s future. Students who are chronically absent are less likely to graduate and more likely to end up in poverty.\n\u201c Chronic absence, especially in the elementary years, sets the stage for academic achievement, future absences, and, ultimately, graduation rates (Attendance Works & Healthy Schools Campaign, 2015). Longitudinal research has found that achievement in reading and mathematics\nis hindered for students who are chronically absent as\nearly as kindergarten, and chronic absence in elementary school is linked to an increased likelihood of dropout even\nif attendance improves over time (Romero & Lee, 2007; Schoeneberger, 2012). Low-income students are the most vulnerable, with research indicating that the negative consequences of chronic absenteeism in kindergarteners is 75% larger than the impact of absenteeism on higher-income classmates (Ready, 2010).\nIn middle and high school, the effects of chronic absenteeism compounds. By the sixth grade, along with GPA, it is a top predictor of dropout (University of Chicago Consortium on Chicago School Research, 2014). In high school, chronic absenteeism is observed at its highest\u201425% of the nation\u2019s 9-12 schools experience extreme chronic absence, where more than 30% of the student body is missing more than 10%\nof school days throughout the year (Attendance Works & Everyone Graduates Center, 2017).\u201d Source-\nhttps://www.cresp.udel.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/P18-002.5_final.pdf",

Yet a bad cold that had her struggling to even stay awake, she was feeling so yucky.\n\nI let her stay home for two days to rest and recover. I did not take her to the doctor because there was nothing they could do for her and she'd likely just pick up something else waiting in their waiting room with all the other sick people.\n\nRequiring a doctor's note for every illness will cause FURTHER ILLNESS by taking kids with a minor illness to a doctor's office unnecessarily and infecting them with other stuff.",

Where I used to work, you were allotted 40hrs a year for paid sick time (state law), but you earned it throughout the year. It worked out to about 2.5hrs of sick time for every 40hrs worked. So, if you were puking your guts out, and needed let's say three days to rest and get better, but only had 8hrs of sick time, you would get occurrences for the other two days. Even though it is literally against the law in my state to work while sick. If you get stuck with bad management, they will give you occurrences. They say \"well, you shouldn't have used your sick time up already\" which is just ridiculous. It never really affected me because in the three years I worked there, I missed two days because my nephew came home with head lice and passed it to me before we realized and got rid of it. Can't work near food with friggin head lice. But I know not everyone goes to work no matter what, and it's not realistic to expect every person to do so. While I do think that if you just have a common cold, you *should* go to work, I don't *expect* anyone to.

Several of my friends have certain forms that would cater to their mental health needs, in class and in cases of absences. In the US, it's rigid but the school lunch debt is a more pressing matter than making sure children attend school.

When my family moved to our current city, the air didn't sit well with my lungs and gave me my first full blown asthma attack at 12. My mother was a director for a large financial form so going to the doctor wasn't a huge financial stress. What was the worst stress of all was getting letters claiming truancy because I got so sick that I had to stay in bed for over a week. After that, if I had a cold, tonsillitis (etc.), my parents didn't really have a choice but to force me to go to school sick because they were being threatened with legal action from the district. All this fuss over missing 10 days out of a 180 day school year.   \nCollege is worse because after 3 absences or so, that's an automatic fail, combine that with way more stress and academic expectations, it's no fucking wonder why so many students nowadays have burnout syndrome.

By the time an adult emerges from the school, they are used to \"shaking it off.\"\n\n\nThey should be taught that, because IT IS expected of us our whole lives.  If I called out sick every time I felt terrible, I'd be out of a job in no time.  We are expected to work when we're sick.  When we're VERY sick then it's understandable, but if you're sick but still physically able to work then yeah, you're expected to tough it out.  I'm not saying that's good, but it is the reality so I don't think it's bad to teach kids about it.",

I either needed to have a temperature or be throwing up. And Now that I\u2019m older, I\u2019m glad they did that. The reality is in the real world sometimes you have to push through and still work hard even when you feel like shit.

It doesn't matter what the reason is. If that worker is valuable to you, you should recognize that allowing them that freedom to come in when they choose actually raises their morale and makes them feel better about the company, so counter intuitively it will make them want to work *more*. Forget about attendance on a small scale, look at the big picture. If in the grand scale of things, a worker is extremely valuable to a company, it shouldn't matter how many days they come in. I'd rather have a worker who's only there 20 hours a week but makes a big impact on the company than someone who's there 60 hours a week but doesn't add anything meaningful.",

Problem is, if school isn't available, it's difficult to find a child minding alternative on a short notice. At the very least, it's also expensive on a one off basis. People have to work. At the very least, parents could lose a day of pay. At the very worst, children left alone is a CPS wet dream. \n\nThere are a lot of factors at play in the \"perfect attendance\" game.

What if you were out of town for the weekend, your child got the flu, and you took them to the nearest doctor? Would that be inadmissible. Forgive me if I'm being semantical, but those were your words.\n\nAlmost every parent of school-aged children has taken their child to a doctor at some point. You can call the doctor's office and get an immediate emergency appointment and explain the situation when you get there. If the kid is truly sick, a doctor will write a note. Most poor and low middle-class  people have the affordable health care act insurance, which is based on income.

Back when I was younger my mom would get angry if I didn't come immediately, while I played a game where the games couldn't last longer than 15 minuts and lasted 6-7 min on average. Even if it just took 2 min I got in trouble. I usually committed suicide in the game on purpose so I wouldn't get banned for being afk (inting didnt really ban you) and come as soon as possible to dinner, and even then my mom was mad.

            "This is harder than you think.\n\nDinner typically isn't prepared at EXACTLY the same time every night, it can be +/- 25 minutes typically.\n\nThis is hard to work with because if a game can take an hour to complete (sometimes 30 minutes, sometimes 60 minutes), predicting when a good time to start playing is hard, securing a time to play with your other teammates/friends this can be hard and if you keep going \"nah I can't play, dinner is soon\" and 40 minutes passes because you didn't wanna risk dinner being early and the match taking longer.\n\nSure this mentality might work for games which take 5 minutes to play, but not when CS matches average 40 minutes.",

            "Regardless of what hobby I'm doing I expect some planning from everyone involved.\n\nIf dinner is anywhere between 16-22:00, I'm not sitting around waiting for exactly all my spare time just because someone gets mad if you don't drop everything you do to come eat. \n\nWhoever is cooking food can easily communicate a time frame to be ready. They probably have a good estimate hours before it's ready, maybe even days.",
            "Problem is, many parents don't really have a set time.\n\n\nSometimes my Dad had dinner ready at 3:47pm or sometimes it wouldn't be finished until 9:39pm. He never started at similar times either. Really, the only indicator that dinner would be done is if I knew what's being cooked and about how long it takes for it to be made. \n\n\nAnd it's funny you pick dinner as your example.

            "While I'm sure there's lots of people who do just forget to pay attention to time and are being inconsiderate, I'd just like to say that I'm someone that plays the kind of online games where predicting how long you're dedicated to a match can be really difficult. Some games are five minutes, others 45 minutes, and it can be the exact same game; knowing how much I've committed to really depends on the other players in the match, and sometimes I think it's going to be an easy 15 minutes and then whoop it's twice that or more. \n\nIf I chose 'not to play before dinner time', I'd basically have to commit to stopping playing any kind of online game 45 minutes before dinner, and as someone who only gets about three hours to myself a night that's basically asking me to give up an hour for nothing, and I'm not gonna do that. \n\nThen again I don't have an issue quitting games if dinner is ready so it's not a problem in my household, I just wanted to present the facet that sometimes it's hard to predict just how long a match will run and a little understanding of that can be nice.",

            "So, I have a couple thoughts on this.\n\n- First, I agree that jumping on a game when you know dinner will be ready in X amount of time is setting yourself up for failure.\n\n- However, I would argue that usually this situation doesn\u2019t occur with anyone over the age of maybe 18 at the most, but more likely 15 and under. I haven\u2019t ever heard an adult get mad over this situation, and I\u2019ve been gaming for well over 10 years in online lobbies.\n\n- I also agree that it\u2019s rude to the people who cook for you to be angry at them for interrupting you.\n\n- However, on the flip side, if their food gets cold then that\u2019s their problem, and you getting mad about it will only make you mad and lead them to get into an argument with you. If they are so concerned about their game that they let their food get cold, that\u2019s on them. Maybe it would be easier for you to spend your energy on something more productive than getting mad over their choice.",

            "For me it's not about the fact that they want you to come to dinner I get that especially in families where the family wants to wait for everyone before eating. It makes sense to want someone who's only playing a game to respect that fact and go to dinner instead of finishing whatever they're doing. However imo it's more about respect than the thing that I'm being asked to do. For instance if I needed help with something and they were watching a movie or doing something I'd say \"hey whenever your done with that can you come help me\" not demand that they come help me now. \nYes taking the trash out, doing laundry, washing the dishes, etc. All are important and should be done but they're also things that can wait the 5-10 minutes it'll take someone to finish most games or get to a stopping point. Dinner is different because as I said earlier some people.like to eat with you or wait for you to start eating in that instance you're holding someone up, but again that's also about respect. You should stop what you're doing and go eat dinner because if they respect you enough to wait you should respect them enough not to make them wait.",

Even if these playground did exist, I think you'd find it's not as fulfilling as you remember it.

Part of a happy childhood is having most of your needs met and being adequately stimulated by the novelty of life. You can't really recapture that in a meaningful way, and dwelling on it just leads to mopey adults who don't know how to find value in life. Society glamorizing childhood is usually at the root of most of my clients' problems because nobody wants to put on their fucking big girl panties and deal with the real world.\n\nJust play organized sports or get involved in a club.

            "Treating employees badly is a legitimate reason to hate Disney. But putting unrealistic romantic expectations on young girls is a silly problem to have. It\u2019s just for fun. Disney makes kids movies that are supposed to be fun, a lot of them based on stories that have been around for generations. Why can\u2019t people have fun? Why does everything have to be \u201crealistic?\u201d Should we toss out superhero movies because nobody actually has powers and it makes them feel bad about themselves? That\u2019s just silly. It\u2019s okay for fantasy to exist. It makes kids\u2019 lives fun. \n\nIf there\u2019s one thing kids do not need, it\u2019s more adult realism to seep into their lives. Do you regret the fantasy that made your childhood magical? Should we not tell our kids about santa, because it\u2019s not realistic for a man to bring presents to all the kids in the world? It gives them unrealistic expectations? I liked Christmas better when I believed in santa. There\u2019s nothing wrong with santa, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with cute princes or love or talking woodland creatures. Let the kids have a childhood. If nice princes are such an unrealistic expectation, then maybe men need to be better partners. I\u2019m happily married and I don\u2019t think those princes\u2019 love is unrealistic at all.

            "Disneyland doesn't place stereotypes on people. To be honest, anyone can write or perform anything they want. It is up to the audience on how they perceive what they are given. Plus, no one is forced to watch or read anything.\n\nAs a kid and even now, at 16, I never based my ideas of romance on Disney movies. I based them on the many stories of film (not Disney, both cliche and not cliche), but never Disney. And maybe it was just me, because I was a very aware child and still am very aware, but I always knew, even at 7 years old, that romance isn't a pattern. Everything changes and moves depending on multiple factors.\n\nI know there are a lot of young children who are subject to change and are influenced easily, but that's half on the parents and half on the kid. The way you raise a child helps determine how easily influenced they are. The other factors are their environment and own opinions. Nothing can force an opinion in someone, even if they're 6 or 7. It's the way of thinking you promote to your child that helps ward off x, y, and z.\n\nInstagram isn't at fault for girls hating their bodies. Those girls decide they want to look like those Instagram models. No actual model tells them they need to look like they do. It's cyber bullies and propaganda that influence them into wanting to look like Instagram models. At the same time, they decide beauty only has one image.\n\nBasically, everything is a round circle. Everyone is and isn't responsible for themselves and everyone else. The mind is complex, and thought even more so. Influencing factors change, but it's each individual that gives them their meaning. There is no system to media or the mind. You simply cannot pinpoint x, y, or z on something because statistics may be true, but the factors that have shaped their way of thinking cannot be tracked and documented as well.",

            "I think several people commenting in this post are rather delusional about the state of Disney, or don't really understand how business really works. The stock price is not the value of the company. The stock price is the value of a share of the company on the open market. That the stock price is at a certain level does not mean the company isn't hurting, it absolutely is. You've got people claiming they've got enough cash on hand to fund the company for years while the fact is that Disney is borrowing double digit billions of dollars to keep afloat and is laying of tens of thousands of people. The people who look at the latest Star Wars movie having a gross of $1 billion and think that is pure profit, ignoring that it is probably 1/20th of that if not less after taking out the cost to make it, distribute it, market it, etc... The company acted like it was invincible and it banked too much on acquisitions, when many of them (FOX, Star Wars, ESPN) are now flopping or costing them money.\n\nUltimately Disney is not going to go out of business, it has acquired so much of the industry and has so much assets it could sell off that it is not going to get to that state. But they are going to be hurting for a while. It is going to take an extremely long time to return to being as profitable as it once was.\n\nAs for one of your other points, in terms of young girl's expectations of romance, as with many things, it is not the cause, it is the effect. Women are biologically wired to have higher expectations of men and to be far pickier towards men than men are towards women. That reflects itself many ways in our culture. Its not that girls want to be treated like princesses because of Disney, its Disney reflecting the fact that girls want to be treated like princesses.",

This is *especially* true when your entire business model is about mass producing the same superhero movie 20 times.\n \nThe reality of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of all Marvel films are shot in the same cookie-cutter manner. The framing is acceptable, the symbolism of shots is very, **VERY** heavy-handed at *BEST* - oh my god guyz, look, the 3 good guyz are in the light bit of the sky and the evil baddies are down in the dark bit wif the clouds behind them!!!! woaah!!!! good symbolism guyz!!!! - and a good 99% of the soundtracks are forgettable as all hell. Marvel's movies are fun action flicks, and that's totally fine, but I see so many people trying to peg each new MCU film as a visionary piece of cinematic art, and they really just aren't.\n\n \nIt's annoying, because it's not even like the superhero format invalidates a film as a medium for art. Like, look at Into the Spiderverse. That movie is absolutely pornographic. So is The Dark Knight. So is Man of Steel, arguably. So is Joker. But Marvel movies? Sure, they're good films, **but people need to stop pretending like the MCU is artistically significant or visually exceptional, because none of it is.** In my opinion, anyways.\n \nThis is coming from someone who *likes* Marvel films and grew up with/watched the *entire* MCU.

(Iron Man 1 Still looks amazing today and isnt shot half bad either).\n\nCivil War Ending: The shot of Tchalla and Zemo talking to eachother.

And the Shots of Odin and his two sons sitting next to him before he Dies is amazing.\n\nSpiderman Far from Home: Shot of Peter creating his new Suit after being picket up by Happy. The joy and wonder in his eyes together with the same Tech that tony used is an amazing picture.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy: First shot. We see who peter is. What he likes.

Its not because of the arty cinematography or the intricate plot. Its because they are fun. I'm not going to pay \u00a315 to go to the cinema to watch a film because \"the cinematography is good or it has good symbolism\" I'm watching it because a man in robot armour, a giant green roid head, a frozen WW2 super soldier and a norse god all kick the shit out of space hitler. \n\nYour comparison to caviar is quite apt about the elitism amongst cinema. Caviar is actually pretty shit. If they just called it \"fish eggs\" and sold it for 60p in Aldi nobody would want it. However the elite have hyped it up. Its the same with cinema, the films that get hyped up by the \"film snobs\" are to be brutal honest boring as fuck.

            "Hating Marvel because it's not Lord of the Rings or Apocalypse Now, is like hating non-theater music because it's not an orchestra performance or an opera. \n\nI suspect that a lot of the complaints about Marvel fans are exaggerations.  Are there *singular* shots that are absolutely beautiful examples of cinematography? Yes, there are, and when you do a color pallete comparison between Marvel, DC, and other young adult hero films, Marvel obviously comes out of top, and this is the playing field Marvel fans are talking about. No Marvel fan is arguing that Endgame is greater than Apocalypse Now, or any other film outside of the playing field Marvel is operating on. But Marvel cynics are taking the Marvel-fan claims to mean as a comparison to *all* films.\n\nEveryone knows somebody who has a specialty dish that is always a favorite and are dying to have the recipe because it's the best shit ever - *in the playing field of amateur chefs.* I have a friend who is a wonderful pastry chef, she is absolutely fantastic, until you compare her to say, Gordon Ramsay, in which case she's little better than the grocery store bakery, which isn't a fair way to evaluate the deliciousness of her cupcakes.",

            "I'm a pretty big MCU fan and I have rarely thought of the movies being particularly well made as stand alone movies; and, for the most part, the movies are impressive in their entirety.\n\nWhat I mean by this is pretty simple, the vast majority of movie franchises need to be rebooted or remade by their third movie. The creators fundamentally misunderstand their audience, or disrespect them, and they produce movies that alienate their fanbase. \n\nMaking 20+ movies with an engaged fanbase, having them all tie together in a satisfying way with callbacks and fan service, and having a coherent high level story is remarkable. \n\nIn my opinion the core success of Marvel has been developing characters, and with the exception of a couple (primarily Captain Marvel) you want to see how these characters interact. In contrast, the DCEU has produced soggy cardboard characters (exception being Wonder Woman) and you don't really care how these characters interact.",

At what range would everyone truly like going, with being too old, you can gradually get tired of going to amusement parks with family.\n\nPlus just because you won\u2019t remember, doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen as long as you have pictures, videos, etc. some people can\u2019t even remember what they\u2019ve done as an adult, so I\u2019d say that argument falls flat. Plus it\u2019s an amusement park based on Disney/different franchises that cater toward family audiences. It\u2019s probably going to cater more towards children, even if it does have some adult activities. Honestly the magic may be more vibrant as a young child and I feel like this is somewhat out of dislike of young children. \n\nKids scream, that\u2019s life. Some are better behaved than others, and if you take out the young kids, yeah everything will probably be quieter and the lines will be shorter, but why does the target audience shouldn\u2019t go for things mostly targeted towards them? \n\nAs an adult, you can enjoy places like amusement parks, but some of them are obviously created for kids, so if it means they don\u2019t remember, it\u2019s okay as long as whoever\u2019s taking them is willing to deal with them. Just because they may not fit in certain rides, doesn\u2019t mean when they look back at pictures, they can\u2019t feel happy about spending time with family, the most important part about those type of amusement parks.",

            "I worked at Disney World and second this. Some parents can do it and are great at it! But many put so much pressure on their little kids it becomes a horrible experience. They forget their kids are just kids and can be overstimulated and the heat wears them out faster. If you have little ones, you have to take it in strides, few hours there, take a break at the hotel, and then a few more hours. \n\nPlus, the stroller situation is completely out of hand. When I went to Disney as a kid, parents brought those flimsy cloth ones that you fold up or rented the ones they had there. Now parents bring these massive things. It has gotten so bad it\u2019s literally peoples job to organize the strollers outside of the rides, which angers people that someone is touching and moving them.\nThey already made a size limited but I wouldn\u2019t be shocked for a minute if they don\u2019t find a way to make stronger restrictions and forcing people to rent from them (which would hopefully decrease the number of people who use them.)",

We did the Winnie the Pooh ride... other \"show\" rides. And then while the kid napped in the stroller my wife and I took turns riding the big rides. BUT ANYWAYS - NONE OF THAT MATTERS because we had a blast doing all the character greetings! At Disney, you can meet all the characters and princesses at designated areas.

There's stuff for toddlers, tons for like 6 year olds, 10 years olds and then yeah teens. Babies, I kinda get. But toddlers can get A LOT from disneyland.

The last time my boyfriend and I went to Disneyland together (just us, we don\u2019t have kids and no family came with us), we saw multiple families with very young children throwing major motion picture tantrums and 9 out of 10 times I would overhear their designated adult say \u201coh yeah he/she didn\u2019t have a nap today\u201d (then what made you think they could handle an entire day at an amusement park without any hiccups?), usually while chuckling in that kids-will-be-kids sort of way.\n\nI also once read an article that stated kids that young see literally everything as one great big magical adventure because that\u2019s how they perceive the world at that stage of their development.

She's almost 10 months, and our attention span for stuff like that is about an hour before she's just done and needs a nap. I can totally see taking her to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk (we live nearby). You can buy a few tickets, ride one or two of the kiddie rides with her, then head home. It's not an all-day commitment and the park is super easy to navigate with a stroller.",

            "While I agree they can be annoying, you are missing a very important fact about child development. Even the times we don't remember, they are extremelly important to your development as child. What you are at 5 years old (when most people start to retain some memories that last a lifetime), the way you are that time is not some sort of roullette of destiny where you suddenly have a personality. This is all build up from the very beginning. So experiences you don't remember are really important in making who you are at the point you start having long term memories. And it builds up more from there. So, sure, you may not remember, but the difference of some experiences you don't remember can be a defining factor of who you are down the line, even as an adult.",

            "Back in the mists of time I had a gap year in the US and spent the summer working at Six Flags Great America. My main ride was Raging Bull which was a huge roller coaster, I forget the height restriction but it was a big deal for preteens when they were finally tall enough to ride! Anyway, I remember this one guy getting on the ride with his 3 really young children,  even the eldest was at least a foot too short to ride, so I explain that he's welcome to ride but his kids will have to wait on the exit ramp for him. And he refuses, forces the kids back into their seats and tries to lock the restraints, starts screaming at me that he's paid hundreds of dollars to come to the park only to find his kids are too small to ride any of the roller coasters, and he's determined his kids will have a proper theme park experience. Pointing out that his kids are too small for the restraints and if we sent the ride they'd fall out and die didn't dissuade him. I'm not kidding, his children were terrified. Even though there were a range of rides aimed at young children (looney tunes national park!) he wasn't interested in that because for him going to six flags was all about the big roller coasters. So I think kids of all ages should be able to go to theme parks, but I think parents need to have realistic expectations for what the experience will actually be like, and should plan their day/holiday around what the kids can do, and recognise that they might not have the same experience as they would if their kids were older.",

A person can be a phenomenal singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, but unless they have that drive to connect, to make amazing music, it's useless. \n\nAt the same time, a person can have that drive, and be unable to reach the skill threshold required to succeed. Or just be unlucky enough to never get noticed. But those that are driven, are automatically more likely to be noticed, because they seek out the situations that would maximize the chances of that. Which largely I would guess is what contributes to the image vs talent thing you see. They WANT it, so they make sure they get it. And the companies\n\n\nAs an industry though, music in particular is very marketing focused. And in marketing image is EVERYTHING.

There are some exceptions, but this seems to generally be true. I also think rap has a unique spot in music since it\u2019s more about musical poetry than musical expression or instrumentation. A lot of musical elements like timbre, dynamics, pitch, and tune are either completely devoid or not as prevalent in the rap genre. Not to say it\u2019s not music. It just has an abnormally high focus on lyrics and rhythm than other genres. Because this causes rap to be music of fewer dimensions, it\u2019s easier to be good at rap and thus there\u2019s more room to build and popularize image rather than the music itself.

People also get this idea that they\u2019re going to blow up because of their ability to rap. The fact is that most young people don\u2019t want to hear predominantly lyrical rap anymore. \n\nLook at artists like Lil Baby. He came up out of the \u201ctrenches\u201d in Atlanta and had connections to Young Thug. He has street cred and was already hustling making bands before he was famous. His music started out professionally recorded. He raps about his life story and topics that go along with that and though his raps aren\u2019t technically profound and his wordplay isn\u2019t out of this world, his songs go hard.

            "Hate to hit you with an \u201cUhm actually\u201d...TL;DR at the bottom\n\nUhm, actually...to be a famous rapper used to be way more difficult before technology, the culture, the internet and social media made it what it is today. Let\u2019s take the Detroit scene, since I\u2019m most familiar with that. If you wanted to be a rapper, first you had to rap, but in the 80\u2019s 90\u2019s if you could not ever sound like anyone else or you were immediately out. Then you had to make a song. If you knew a party DJ you could work with them over a record they live mixed, which is where specific skills like freestyle ability became important. Then you had to get the song recorded and there were only a few studios because the technology was amazingly expensive and studio time was usually hundreds of dollars an hour. This is why a lot of drug dealers got in, or why a lot of rappers sold drugs which started another culture issue I\u2019ll come back to. Next, you had to develop a local buzz. Talent shows, open mics, battles, cyphers, etc. anything to get people familiar with your rap name. Next you had to try and get on the local radio to widen your audience by getting your tape to a record DJ. If people liked your song, you could take it to a label who then got control of your image. Then to become famous, you had to have appeal to the many gate keepers. You had the radio stations which usually involved bribery, labels who wanted to know they could make money off you, the club owners so you could get booked for shows or open for bigger acts, the other rappers which had to certify your talent and might collaborate with you which also cost money. After all that hustling you had to finally prove you could be accepted by the tv audience which is where the international fans came in and the real fame started. Anything related to MTv...was the standard for fame.\n\nA quick note about street cred. It was about your hustle and about money, just like politics. If you already had money you could skip some steps in the grind but you couldn\u2019t get the respect of the OG\u2019s who did grind. This meant less collars and less credibility. This is also where drugs and crime got married to the rap game early on...if you didn\u2019t have money the fastest way was to hit a lick, or sell something to get the cash quick. This became an expected but not necessary part of the grind and therefore street credit. Also, if you got caught, it might become a local story, which adds to your name recognition. If you had an in with criminals, gangs, whatever, it could be an easy way to get fronted the money, then add to the street cred without having to commit crimes, but, sometimes you had to commit crimes to get in with those types too. All this led up to your image and also why rap was easy to paint as a criminal culture and the denial of skill based artistry. Truth be told, if you didn\u2019t have skills, you couldn\u2019t even get in the door. If you had musical ability, you understood your place in the song and it was easier to develop a style or rhyme pattern. That\u2019s why in old songs, rappers only had one or two rhyme patterns in a song and the first commercial songs would sound similar because the labels didn\u2019t care about the skill it took to get a foot in the door. \n If you didn\u2019t understand music you couldn\u2019t rap. If you didn\u2019t understand poetry, you couldn\u2019t rhyme. If you didn\u2019t develop rhythm you couldn\u2019t innovate. If you couldn\u2019t innovate/ freestyle you couldn\u2019t battle. If you couldn\u2019t battle, you might get your mic snatched and not be able to perform. Etc and so on.\n\nThen the fire nation attacked...technology caught up to music. \n\nFirst synthesizers changed music, then the tools of hip hop (turn tables, mics, and speakers) got into an arms race with computers and mpc\u2019s etc. The digital music age meant that records were easier to produce and record, sampling was easier, storage medium became cheap. Home recording just got cheaper and cheaper. The internet especially once search engines and video compression changed things again by making radio and eventually record labels and studios obsolete. Tv was next to go. Sites that preceded YouTube would play music videos. Then Streaming/file sharing technology changed everything again. Then social media changed everything again. I probably missed some steps but this is now way too long. Lastly the Instagram age mixed with SoundCloud has made it so that people can disregard the entire grind and develop a following without ever leaving their house or performing live. It\u2019s also why the culture respects artists that still grind, more than SoundCloud and mumble rappers.\n\nTL;dr:\nI\u2019d say the main thing you needed was a lot of hustle, skill, and money to get famous. The image consideration is a result of easy access to technology, social media, and the internet trumping skill and today it seems like it\u2019s more about image than talent but the talented are the only ones who enjoy longevity.",

And I think it's a lot worse on your psyche to lie to yourself that you're this Adonis so it doesn't make sense that nobody's interested in you, when you should be focusing on the positives.\n\nHonestly in that regard body positivity has quite a lot to answer for. The fact of the matter everyone isn't hot, that's just not how it works, but you as a *person* are no doubt beautiful to *somebody*, and the thing that's most important is having a realistic view of yourself in that vein.\n\nBam, mental wellbeing while still being grounded in the real world.",

By focusing on the physicality of it, they're almost certainly just making people more self-conscious overall, and essentially causing an effect opposite to what they claim to want. (Eg it's similar to the way they get everyone to talk about race constantly in very superficial ways, by having people literally talk about blackness and whiteness incessantly, which ultimately just reinforces racism. Or how they claim being LGBT is just one facet of a person and independent of other associated personality qualities, political agendas, etc, but clearly in the way that they claim this, they are showing that being LGBT really does often come with such qualities, political agendas, etc. Basically in their words what they claim to uphold is generally reasonable, but their actions tend to betray such words, actually suggesting the opposite of what they claim may be true.)",

            "When I got out of highschool, I found that there are different types of pretty. Beauty (for me) isn't something that's only on the surface. It goes deeper than that, how you treat people, both friends and strangers. It also doesn't have a certain \"look\". There's mature, athletic, intelligent, unique... Just because you don't fit into one specific category doesn't mean you're not pretty, because there's different types of pretty. It's also subjective, who I find attractive might not be your definition of attractive. Also, confidence can make a difference. If you love yourself for who you are, people can see that. Confidence is attractive, because we all want to be happy with ourselves. Instead of looking at yourself negatively, just accept what is. It can be hard because that's not how most of us are taught, but it's a big step in learning to love yourself. \n\n\n\nTldr; different types of beauty; beauty is subjective; love yourself; confidence",

But most of us just kinda... Are.\n\nI have my days where I think I look pretty good. I tell my bf all the time how gorgeous he is. I find him physically attractive because of who he is. If he were a terrible person, I wouldn't. He's also very smart and kind and extremely sweet and gentle and funny and that fun kind of asshole sometimes... He's a great cook and self sufficient. He doesn't take shit from anyone. He's generous to the point of detriment to himself sometimes. I love being around him. He has a body type I happen to find attractive, but everything else in this one package is just so beautiful to me.\n\nI guess I'm also trying to say that if you're with an SO and they tell you that you're beautiful, it's likely that they are looking at the whole package. The body positivity stuff can be really annoying. But hearing it from close friends, family, an SO, pretty much anyone that you actually trust... Know they *are* looking at the whole you. It's everything about you. :)\n\nAND *that* said... You don't have to think you're beautiful. That's ok. Most of us are pretty average.

If that's what makes people feel empowered, okay, but I know I'm not super hot and that's fine.

The women I find most attractive are often not the ones who you'd call \"model pretty\" or \"classically beautiful\", but I find them MORE beautiful than the supermodel types. For example, I think every single Kardashian is ugly. Every one. Even the Jenner twit. \n\nMy point is that maybe you think you're not pretty by *your* standards, or even by \"model pretty\" standards, but I assure you there are people out there who find you more attractive than a Bella Thorne or Gwen Stefani or Zendaya because they genuinely, honestly find those people boring or unappealing and find you attractive. \n\nYes, yes, we're supposed to focus on the whole package. Of course we are. But when you're meeting someone for the first time they can't see your mind, your soul, your personality, or really anything besides your physical appearance and your sense of style.\n\nDon't reject someone's expression of appreciation for your physical appearance. It is every bit as much a part of you as your mind is. It is every bit as deserving of admiration as your soul may be.

I was so unhappy. And wasted my teenage years obsessing over how I looked.",
            "Ugly but with high self esteem. You go girl!",
            "Everyone on TV looks like a model, I'm pretty sick of modern film valuing people's looks over their acting ability. The world puts so much emphasis on looks that now the only faces you see on TV are so far away from what the average person looks like. The OBSESSION of getting a poreless, emotionless, no lines, no wrinkles, ''PERFECT'' face is just ridiculous, and so fake. It makes me want to move to Alaska and live in the wild by myself with nature, away from this fake reality we as humans have created.",
            "F i n a l l y s o m e o n e a g r e e s .\nI don\u2019t find myself too attractive but I still don\u2019t have low self esteem. Instead, I laugh at myself a lot with others.",
            "I agree on the \"everybody is beautiful\" is bullshit, hate people calling someone beautiful when they are clearly not, just sickens me.",
            "This is the key to stop feeling awful about yourself. It's really pushed that you need to see yourself as beautiful in order to have self confidence but you can see yourself as average or even below average and be perfectly happy.\n\n I consider myself to be decently attractive but haven't been dating many people. This used to bother me a lot as I saw it as something wrong with my personality but ultamitely realized that it literally doesn't matter if I have the personality to date a bunch of people or not. It has no real affect on me because I'm perfectly fine with being alone like everyone should be. It probably is my personality that causes people to not see me in a romantic way but that's perfectly okay because ik someone will find it that way and just because most people don't doesn't mean it's bad. I'm just not that kind of person and it's fine. \n\nThars the acceptance I think everyone should come too. Now if you have a flaw that's actively driving people away from you, then you should definitely be aware of it and try o fix it but sometimes you're just trying to shove yourself into something you're just not and that's okay. That's what makes life so special. The variety of people being their true selves is amazing and what makes life so rich and interesting. As much as society tries to shove dating down people's throat, it really isn't that important to your mental or emotional health. It's usually even detrimental. People just need to learn to love themselves before trying to get with others.",

You might also think you're a 5/10, others might think you're a 10/10, a 4/10 or a 1/10. Let's stop categorizing, it shows how insecure people really are when they say they're not..",

So instead, let's just drop the whole idea that a person has to be beautiful in order to feel valid and loved.\nA person who thinks of themselves as ugly, should still receive the same amount of respect as someone who feel like a \"perfect 10\". \nAnd when someone tells you \"I look so ugly today\", the respons should sometimes be \"and thats okay!\" instead of \"noo that's not true you are beautiful!\".",

As discussed elsewhere there is the issue of proof but to me the over-riding concern is the welfare of the child. Once born, planned or not, the welfare of the child is paramount and over rides any other concerns. There are also cases where the man nominated as the biological father turns out not to be, sometimes after years of child support. Again,  tough as it may sound I believe the child is the priority, irrespective and dispute  between the nominal or actual parents. Men need to take control and responsibility for contraception and if pregnancy ensues then paternity must be established immediately. Its a cheap and easy process these days. The sooner the child's true father is established the less potential for heartache and bitterness. The new innocent life needs consistent support, emotional and financial, from as early as possible and to my mind the childs needs prevail over all other considerations.",

            "Child support will never take the man's considerations into the equation. \n\nSucks to suck, keep it in your pants next time.\n\nSince the kid wasn't aborted, it needs support to not become a piece of shit drain on society - like the kind of men that want out of child support.\n\nIt's why it's not comparable to abortion.\n\nWoman removes her responsibility by removing the future societal burden\n\nMan removes his by removing support once the kid exists = now the governments problem when the bastard contributes nothing and costs  tax payers.",

            "Sorry, but if you don't want to get a woman pregnant then *you* should take responsibility and prevent it yourself.\n\nDon't blame her for not looking out for your interests.\n\nI don't know if she lied, if she forgot her pills or if it just didn't work, and I don't care. I've never gotten a woman pregnant by accident, because *I've* always made sure it didn't happen.",
            "This would basically be impossible to prove in court, so it's not really a good law. We just need to have laws where men and women both get to decide if they want to have the child. If the man gives up his responsibility for the child the woman then gets to decide if she wants to keep the child and raise it on her own or if she wants to have an abortion. That's as equal as it can be."

That's disgusting. You're meant to be celebrating the fact you're finally making the bond with your loved one official, not disrespecting them and looking at other people.\n\nThe fact that many consider this normal is bizarre to me.

            "I know someone that was the groom and the stripper took his cock out (in front of everybody) and rubbed it on her bare vagina. That is cheating and disgusting. I wouldn\u2019t marry someone that would ever think that that\u2019s okay.",
            "Ok so\u2026 I used to dance and knew a lot of girls who did bachelor parties outside the club. \nI can understand the logic- last boys night out, whatever. \nI still love strippers and would probably want a joint bachelor/bachelorette party at a strip club tbh. \nBUT the girls who did parties\u2026 were mostly escorts. It is SUPER common for the \u201cstrippers\u201d at bachelor parties to f*ck the bachelor. this is INSANE to me!! \nI know so many guys who do this and their buddies keep it a secret and everyone acts like it\u2019s NBD, \u201cone last hurrah\u201d\u2026 I would cancel the wedding.",
            "Yea... It's really strange - I'm getting married, time for strippers!\n\nHow the fuck is that where your minds at? Lol",
            "I agree. \n\nI don't understand the whole concept of \"last night of freedom\" that people use for bachelor and bachelorette parties. You're not \"free\", you're still engaged. You're getting married. If you crave that freedom so much then why are you getting married?\n\nEDIT: I will say that I get the idea of wanting to have a fun night out with friends before you get married, since a lot of newlywed couples like to take time to themselves after the wedding. But the whole \"I'm a bachelor/ette tonight\" thing is just weird.",

            "As a dude who\u2019s taught and heavily surrounded by people who are in support of all that. I whole heartedly agree, I keep to myself but have always thought how WEIRD it is all because you still aren\u2019t \u201cmarried\u201d as if you haven\u2019t been doing things up until then to ensure loyalty and commitment",

            "These comments are why the divorce rate is 50%...",
            "As a former stripper, bachelor parties always made me feel so icky. So many of the guys who were married/about to be married would push boundaries with the dancers or try their hardest to get them to come home with them. It's one thing when married/engaged guys go out, lots of them either get one awkward dance or say \"no thanks\", but bachleor parties most of them were specifically on a mission to try and cheat with a stripper. It was so gross.\n\nThe only cool ones were when the bachelors and the bachelorettes would come in together and do a joint party, those were always a blast.",
            "Having been a stripper, I concur.  There\u2019s a time, place and vibe for that and a bachelor/bachelorette party is simply not it (unless of course both ppl agree).  \n\nToo frequently has the groom acted sexually excited and told me things his fianc\u00e9 would likely find painful to hear; too frequently have I seen trashed bachelorettes groping male models.  It\u2019s straight up disrespectful, let\u2019s not normalize this behavior.",

I'm sorry I didn't realize he's going to jail?\n\nGetting married isn't losing your freedom, heck if he wasn't game for \"losing his freedom\" he shouldn't have proposed. It was his choice to pop the question.\n\nStrippers and outrageous bachelor/ette parties are disgusting. Your supposed to celebrating the union.",
            "I agree that the entire point of a stripper is to turn you on. They're there to make you sexually excited. they'll get naked and grind on your lap until you get an erection. And what are you thinking about? How you want to fuck her. I think of both people in the relationship agree that's fine then whatever but using a Bach party as an excuse for one off time is weird. Like I wouldn't go to a restaurant and have a random woman do that and be okay with it. If I went to the club and started dancing and grinding with a non stripper girl on the dance floor while in a committed relationship that wouldn't be okay so why do we all act like it is on this occasion.",

            "I agree with this. I find it shocking what some people think isn\u2019t technically \u201ccheating,\u201d so they justify their actions as, \u201cI didn\u2019t have sex, so it wasn\u2019t cheating, right?\u201d \n\nThere are lots of ways to utterly betray your partner without sexual intercourse. Couples really ought to discuss such things early in the relationship to make sure they\u2019re on the same page. Unspoken rules aren\u2019t usually enough.",
            "Yeah if you fuck someone else there's not going to be a wedding, I don't give a fuck about some stupid midlife crisis wannabe frat culture that people seem to want for their bachelor/bachelorette party. If you're older than 17 and doing that shit you're acting like a child. \n\nYou know what my dad did for his bachelor party? Went fishing.",
            "From my experience as the bartender, people who have strippers at their bachelor/bachelorette parties are the type who would have cheated one day anyways. The sort of people who put on that cocky, \"Yeah I'm getting hitched\" type of attitude, but don't seen to actually live their partner.\n\nOn the other hand I've seen and heard about lots of bachelor and bachelorette parties which are just about the groom and bride having fun with their friends. Getting drunk, hanging out, etc. And those are the marriages that last.",

            "And let\u2019s not forget the whole \u201cone last night of freedom\u201d thing.\n\nIf you see marriage as a prison or end of your freedom, don\u2019t get married",

            "Guess what, each couple can decide for themselves where they draw the line when it comes to cheating. Isn't that great?",
            "It depends on the relationship. Every relationship has different boundaries and rules. Some of them may allow for strippers. Some may not. \n\nI do think it is silly the amount we normalize the bachelor/Bachelorette party as a place where it's okay to break the rules of the relationship because \"it's the last night of freedom.\" The last night of freedom was the night before you became a monogamous couple, not the party. Stuff that would be a no-no during the rest of your relationship is still a no-no during the event (unless your spouse says otherwise).",
            "If anyone orders a stripper to my bachelor party I\u2019m leaving. \n\nHell. Tbh if anyone makes me a bachelor party I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m happy to get married, I have no reason to go wild on my \u201clast day as a free man\u201d.

            "Bachelor parties are cringe, probably started off as some incel fantasy that became a cultural thing. If you're starting off a marriage by cheating, might as well prep for the divorce.",
            "Upvote.\n\nI'm getting married this December. I'm not sure if I'll be able to have a party, but I totally agree on the stripper thing. I want my bachelor party as a LAN party with my buds. I love my fiance. I dedicate myself to her. If some people will pull out that stripper card thing, I'm walking out.",

            "It\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s a setup. Just go fishing with the boys.",
            "Totally agree. I found out years later that my ex husband went out to the strip club THE NIGHT BEFORE our wedding. If I would\u2019ve known that then it would\u2019ve saved me years of heart ache because he turned out to be a total cheater and creep. \n\nPeople who have the \u201cmarriage is a trap\u201d \u201cstuck with one person forever\u201d mentality aalways end up divorced. If they feel like being with that one person forever doesn\u2019t sound good why the hell would they get married. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cone last hoorah\u201d, if they desire to be with other people before marriage they\u2019re going to feel that way after.",
            "I don't understand people who spend good money to sit with their mates and get boners together, but whatever, each to their own. \n\nI also don't understand this \"last night of freedom\" nonsense. Being married isn't a prison, and if you're at the point where you're getting married, you've been with this person for a while... surely what's acceptable before marriage and what's acceptable after marriage doesn't change. Getting married doesn't change whether sexual interactions with other people are okay or not - they're either okay in your relationship, in which case there is no \"last night of freedom\", or they're not, in which case you don't have the \"freedom\" you're after anyway.",
            "A lot of these comments are just proving how common cheating is in American culture",
            "I agree. My best friend wanted strippers and wanted me to organize the party but he didn't make me best man. So no strippers for you.",
            "It is cheating to me. I talked to a guy about this before and I said you going to a strip club is the same as your wife making an only fans. They didn\u2019t want their wife to make an only fans and let other men pay their gf/wife to been seen naked but they think its ok to give strippers aka Naked women who aren\u2019t their wife money. They think its okay to have a wife on their fb page but be seen lusting and giving money from their home out of their childrens mouths to strange naked women. But that\u2019s just how I see it some people are okay with it. That is until they got a toddler and a newborn stuck at home while their husbands are still looking at new shiny 18 y/os and giving them money.",
            "Yeah, it's cheating when you're dating and when you're married. I don't see why this is somehow even kind of okay at a bachelor or bachelorette party.\n\nI was the best man at one of those parties recently, and we played mini golf, bought a ton of meat, had an art contest, and the groom-to-be shot the losing art pieces (that he judged) with a high powered rifle. It was something that he'd like, but it was also something he could talk about happily with his fiancee later. I think that's kind of the ideal situation. It shouldn't be a \"last day of being single do this while you can\", it should be friends sending their friend off to be married with a big party.",

            "Eh, it's tasteless and trite, and honestly if you're marrying someone so unimaginative that they feel like doing this old worn out nonsense, you probably have bigger issues.  But it isn't \"cheating\" unless there were clearly established relationship guidelines that were broken/crossed.   If looking at other people is \"cheating\", make sure you communicate that to your significant other, because, as you so rightly assumed, it is not a common (popular) viewpoint.",

            "This is exactly why I planned my own bachelor party. I have a twin brother but we couldn\u2019t be more different than each other. \n\nHe kept telling me and everyone else that no matter where we went for the bachelor party that he would get me a stripper even though I was very adamant that I didn\u2019t have one for all the reasons that were posted on this post.\n\nSo I planned for my boys to go camping\u2026. Out on a river on a canoe trip. Lol. We were 10 to 15 miles away from any road for 3 days. IT WAS GREAT!! Lol",
            "If you feel the need to have a \"last night out before being attached to the 'ole ball and chain\", perhaps marriage isn't the right move? My wife and I had bachelor and bachelorette parties, but it was more to just go out and do something fun in the name of the wedding, which was super stressful to plan and figured would be super stressful day of. So, my friends and I (best man dropped the ball and did NOTHING in the process so I planned it) went camping for a weekend. It was fun. No strippers. Just some drinks around a campfire and hiking and hanging during the daytime. My wife and her friends went into NYC, ate at a nice restaurant and rented a karaoke room for a few hours. I have no issue with strippers, though rarely enjoyed a trip to the strip club through the years. Nothing against the men and women who do their thing, but the clubs and regulars have always been off-putting to me. I think the current status too is that most clubs have strayed from protecting the women and all costs and seem to favor the girls who perform extracurriculars offstage. I have a friend who left the business a couple of years ago because there were too many in-club rapes, engagement of prostitution in the back rooms, and an expectation that all strippers are open to that for the price.",

            "The great thing about this is that you're both absolutely right and absolutely wrong. It depends on how the people involved feel - if it's cheating for you, it's cheating, full stop, and your partner should respect that. If a person doesn't feel like it's cheating, though, it isn't.",
            "i agree with this bc those are my boundaries. however, some couples don\u2019t see it as a big deal. as long as it\u2019s discussed beforehand and both parties are okay with it, then to each their own. live & let live! not for me but if others are cool with it then by all means",

Idk maybe I\u2019m the loser hahaha",
            "I dont think a partner seeing someone else dancing,being partially nude or naked is cheating. Is marriage supposed to be a person only finding you sexually attractive for the rest of their life? I can tell you that is never going to happen and is frankly unreasonable to try to mandate for another person. Cheating in my eyes is having a romantic relationship or sex with someone else. Im not threatened by my partner finding someone else sexually attractive,you cant take that ability from someone,even if you do love them. This sounds like a 'porn is cheating' type of standard and I cant help but feel that it's silly. You can have monogamy with someone without the side of insecure delusion in thinking outside attraction is something you can forbid or something that breaks a bond.\n\nAdditionally-Regardless of what the stripper was offering,I wouldn't marry someone who I feel like I couldnt trust around women;naked or otherwise. The idea is to trust him,I shouldnt have to sheild a man from the inevidable of coming across an attractive woman. I cant stop him from coming across a woman who might be sexually attracted to him,naked or not.The idea is to be able to trust your partner.The issue is so many women accept partners who they dont or shouldnt trust.

Even tried calling the fianc\u00e9 and giving her a whole rundown of the plans (which was supposed to be a surprise) but she was so worried it would get out of hand she just forbade him to go.

            "It's not cheating if you don't cheat. Just because your boyfriend doesn't like it dude.",
            "I disagree. It IS cheating if you go to strip clubs behind your partner's back or if your partner asked that you don't allow strippers to be a part of your stag/hen night (I've been to more bachelorette parties at strip clubs than bachelor parties at strip clubs). When I was a Best \"Man\" (I'm a woman), I asked the bride what were her hard nos for a bachelor party. She told me her boundaries and I made sure we abided by it (the only thing she was mad at was that her bridal party didn't plan her party they just figured they would show up and she'd tell them the plan. So, I had to call ANOTHER club and get them set up with VIP and paid for her lap dance). My boyfriend was the DD for the night and everyone chipped in for his lap dance. He was worried I would be mad but I didn't feel threatened or upset. He was a good, honest boyfriend. I asked him if he would be mad if I got a dance. He bought me one himself (the party then bought us a joint dance). We were not a polyamorous relationship. We were very committed to each other (we only ended because he didn't see me moving to his hometown with him. He's from a very rural area, and I grew up in a major city).   \nTo me, Cheating is a violation of what you and your partner (or in the case of polyamorous relationships, partners) agree too. I know relationships where everyone is allowed to sleep with other people but they are told not to HIDE their liaisons. The cheating isn't the sex. The cheating is the lying. The violation is the deceit.   \n\n\nFor your scenario, since you do feel this way about strip clubs, if YOUR partner did this, they would be very much disrespecting you and cheating on you. \n\nI guess I'm saying: to each their own.",

The water was coming in, so he ran to the second floor. Once on the second floor, a person in a row boat came and said, \"Get on, we can escape.\"   \nThe man replied, \"No thanks, God will save me,\" \n\nAnd so the row boat left and the water started coming up onto the second floor. The man then ran up to the third floor. While there, a rescue boat came. Someone on the rescue boat yelled out, \"Come here, we'll get you out!\"\n\nThe man replied, \"No thanks, God will save me,\"\n\nThe rescue boat then proceeded to leave and the water began coming up to the third floor, so the man ran up and onto the roof. When on the roof, a helicopter spotted him and dropped a ladder. The helicopter operator yelled down, \"Grab the rope and I'll pull you up!\"\n\nThe man replied, \"No thanks, God will save me.\"\n\nThen, the helicopter left. Eventually the water got to the roof, and with no where left to go, the man drowned. In heaven, the man approached God and asked, \"Hashem, why didn't you save me?\"\n\nGod replied, \"What do you mean? I sent a row boat, I sent a rescue boat, and I sent a helicopter; yet, you ignored them all.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs much as a hate religion, religious people have a right to thank god for anything in their lives because if you think about it, god can involve themself in virtually anything.

Bad things teach humans lessons as well as the good. Such hypocrites that truly don't know what it's like to live in reality and judge others for not believing like they do. I await the glorious day I rejoin the source and tell all those who doubted my words in this life \"told you so\", although they'll learn that the moment they rejoin as well.

In that God creates and sustains the entire universe the recipient of a good thing thanks the maker of that thing. Bishop Robert Barron explains this quite well using the analogy of the bike. When fixing a bike one doesn\u2019t come up with a list that says \u201cchain, oil, God\u201d but rather, after a good day of work with a favourable outcome, one can very rightly thank God.

You still have to do it in order to be completely accepted (I mean not given a critical look by others).\n\n-Men's facial hair: it's considered completely normal for a man to have hair on his face. The neckbeard is just a style of facial hair. If you make fun of someone's neckbeard you're just unpolitely criticizing their personal aesthetic STYLE. That's wrong obv but different. You making fun of a beard is not a consequence of sexism/patriarchy/machism.\n\nA perfect comparison would have been with men's long hair. If you said \"If you support women not shaving then you can't make fun of men with long hair saying they look too feminine /men who shave and have no beard because they don't look manly enough\" I would have agreed with you.

It\u2019s mean spirited and unproductive and honesty I don\u2019t know where it came from. \n\nThe difference between making fun of a woman for her appearance and making fun of a man for his appearance is the fact that, culturally, a woman IS her appearance in a way that a man is not.

That's why athletes have to hide their steroid use.  Models don't have to hide their plastic surgery.",

There's more to being a \"good model\". For example, the walk. No amount of plastic surgery can give you a good model walk can it? Besides that, models aren't there to be the BEST model exactly. They're there to promote/advertise products. I think its fine for them to get plastic surgery. Athletes are always there to win, be the best, compete. It's not fair to enhance your body falsely to perform better in this case.",

Getting plastic surgery to enhance your look or present yourself in a certain way isn't like that. \n\nI try not to make slippery slope arguments, but just because it shows up on a list of fallacies in high school english class doesn't mean its illegitimate to be concerned about setting a precedent. \n\n\"Models shouldn't be allowed to work if they aren't *natural*\"\n\n\"Working out to change your body is *fake* when the magazine readers are mostly over weight.\" \n\n\"You're only allowed to be seen if I approve of your body and how you got it\"",

You need to be very tall and skinny with either very classic features or an exotic look that sets you apart. There are plenty of tall, skinny girls with faces ranging from ordinary to ugly, and plenty of heavier, shorter girls with lovely faces. Getting the the two things together is a rarity, hence the surgery. And of course, nothing totally stops the aging process.",
            "It's not even comparable. PEDs will increase performance. Not might, will. But plastic surgery is not guaranteed to get a model work.\n\nBesides, a woman gets plastic surgery for many reasons. She may have always hated that little lump on her nose, and now that she has the money, she has it done. Or she finds that little baby midriff isn't just snapping back into place.\n\nI think the best equivalent to plastic surgery for an athlete is Tommy John surgery for a pitcher. It's only recommended for complete muscle tears, but young, promising pitchers will occasionally treat partial tears with it. After surgery, the arm is more stable, and after rehab, it's stronger as well.",

Big brested, tall brunette is not better than medium brested redhead with average height.

Maybe not commercial modelling, but pageants for sure.\n\nA beauty pageant like Miss Universe is actually a competition, so in regards of that, countries that send women with evident plastic surgery to these kind of contests should be penalized if not disqualified immediately in the same way that athletes when someone finds they are taking drugs and steroids to improve their performances.

Part of the problem is that models aren't really the main example of this problem; I'd argue its really more pervasive in the entertainment industry;  I'd wager more Americans see actresses and pop stars than models.

You also have to understand that most of the clothing is like \"clothespinned,\" at angles the camera can't see. So if you see a fashion ad, and the model is looking straight at you. Her/his hair and clothing is usually trimmed up and basically taped down at weird angles so it looks better and fits more snug. If you have baggy clothes on camera it doesn't look good. Also you'd be surprised what people can do with makeup. Photoshop really is like the last thing that you do, at least in my experience, because it's sometimes only one guy doing it.

If it were more of a competition I could see that being enforced, but if a company is looking for a specific shape and for advertising then it will continue being the case. I would only want it to stop so that people who are affected by the ads don\u2019t see it as a standard or a requirement and get a negative sense of self."

My mouth triples its normal movement speed to spit out arguments, and I aggressively attack the position of the person I am debating. Don't get me wrong, I'm not argumentative. I rarely get into any sort of argument with strangers or acquaintances; I only get into heated argument with close friends and family who know to expect as much from me.\n\nI get genuinely fired up for a good debate, and routinely argue for viewpoints I don't agree with. So I would disagree with your statement that getting to a consensus is the point of debate. If that was the purpose of debate, I would never play devil's advocate. For me, my purpose for debate is because I enjoy shaking people's complacency in their viewpoints. I enjoy being argumentative.\n\nYou ask what it means to \"win a debate.\" If I am able to give an satisfactory counter-argument to each of my opponent's arguments, while they can only counter half of mine, I would say that means I won the debate. Naturally there's no objective formula to determine who won an argument, but if one person is consistently countering their opponent's arguments while having their own uncontested, I think it's fair to say they won. Obviously there doesn't have to be a winner. In fact, most of the time I debate someone, we end up coming to some inconclusive agreement that \"both sides have valid points.\"\n\nObviously my winning a debate doesn't mean that my side of the debate is factually correct. The facts of the world don't bend to my will just because I'm a better debater than my brother. No rational person would say that. But I think it is perfectly fair to say that since I made better arguments, I won the debate.\n\nDo I \"need\" to win debates? No. But when I get into a debate with someone, I want to carry it out until either I win, they win, or we come to a mutual compromise. There is nothing that makes me more frustrated then when I put a lot of thought into creating an argument against my opponent's position only for them to respond \"Look, I'm tired of debating this, let's just drop it.\" When I invest a ton of time and thought into a debate, I am naturally frustrated when someone dismissively drops it.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with someone aggressively arguing their viewpoint and not wanting to drop the debate, as long as they are respectful about it.\n\nI'm not some argumentative jerk who turns every conversation into a debate. I understand that there is a time and a place for argument. 90% of the time when I encounter a viewpoint I disagree with, I actually hide the fact I disagree rather than risk turning a conversation sour.\n\nBut when the time and place is right, yes, I do love showing off how clever I am.\n\nThe fact that some people are rude when debating online does not change the fact that it is goddamn satisfying to win a debate.",

Hence, you are better at arguing.\n\nNow it is unfair that you are discussing these things in a language that is not native to you, but if you are unable to express your logic and convince others of your argument, then I'm sorry, but by definition, you suck at arguing. It might make sense in your mind but if you cannot express it to others than it makes no difference. Of course, people should be willing to listen and help a person reach a logical conclusion in a way both parties can understand, even if by doing so you are helping the other person because the goal of arguments is not to win, they are to learn. \n\nFrom that, winning doesn't automatically mean they are right.

Ford can make, market, and sell cars, which also kill people both intentionally and unintentionally, but Ford cannot market a vehicle to civilians as being great for running people over, or as \"the ultimate civilian combat vehicle.\" Just like you can go buy a Jeep or Humvee, but the manufacturer can't market that vehicle by saying \"perfect for mounting your .50cal and vanquishing your enemies.\" Same reason people can buy and sell all sorts of potentially dangerous stuff, things as simple as gasoline, but can't do so while marketing that product for an illegal use. \"Chevron Fuels ignite faster when soaked in curtains and upholstery than our competitors,\" or \"ULINE Air Duster: it'll get you high as fuck!\"\n\nSo the argument essentially is that since Bushmaster (Remington) used images of combat soldiers and language like \"the ultimate military combat weapons system,\" \"mission adaptable\" and \"forces of opposition bow down,\" they were marketing their products for an illegal use. Whether or not you buy that argument is up to you, but that's the argument being made in court, and it's why the marketing matters.\n\nEdit: thank you for the silver kind stranger!",

They place advertisements in military magazines with cool catch phrases like, \"If it's good enough to kill silently in the darkness of wars, it's good enough to handle that school bully of yours!\" Maybe they even release a video game where you go around a school and use different Wartime Hammer to kill as many students as you can before you are stopped. You compete with your friends to see who can get the high score. Maybe your little brother even plays Wartime Hammers during recess, where it's kind of like the game Tag, but with pretend murder. \n\nObviously, this example is full of hyperbole.

Remington IS being sued because their \"involvement\" in the Sandy Hook shooting but they are not being sued because the shooter used their gun. The case brought against them is saying that Remington's ads and marketing portray their products as for combat and war to civilians. The case attempted to prove that this is irresponsible and *encourages* or *promotes* violent behavior to its customers.

In this case, hell yes. \nPerhaps there is a serial hammer murderer and the customer literally tells the cashier \"I plan to murder with this\" staring ahead blankly with cold, lifeless eyes. Yes, they should be sue-able. Perhaps some other knowledge shows danger in the sale.\nWe don't have this for guns. For guns we have suspicion of intent and documentation.

Pop artists and rappers can have up to 50 million monthly listeners meanwhile the biggest metal band in history has 16 million (which is still a lot obviously but in defense of my point, they hardly ever feature screaming in their music)\n\nOk with that out of the way, every time I see people hating on rock and metal, about 99% of people\u2019s complaints are \u201cthey\u2019re just screaming, it takes no talent, anyone can do it\u201d which is just plain false. People who can do that shit with their voice are extremely talented, and the people who can do that at a live concert for up to like 2 hours straight are even more talented. It takes talent, skill, practice, and technique to do it properly and many vocalists have to work their asses off for YEARS to learn to do it well enough to be in a band. \n\nI dare you right now to try to scream like they do in metal. Do either a really high deathcore scream or a really low death metal growl. Yeah sure you can try but I\u2019d be willing to be all my money if you just tried for the first time, it sounds nothing like it does in the music. \n\nThere\u2019s a video on YouTube where a guy goes in public and asks a bunch of random people to \u201cgive him their best metal scream\u201d. About 95% of people can\u2019t do it. But when someone CAN do it, he then asks them how long they\u2019ve been doing vocals, and the answer is always the same. Years. Many years.\n\nTL:DR it seems to be a common conception that metal screaming doesn\u2019t take talent however in reality it takes talent, skill, practice, and technique to do properly.",

Pretty much anything harder than Disturbed Sound of Silence is a no from me.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with how crazy the skills involved are. In its own way, it's every bit as impressive as opera.",

I haven\u2019t personally seen as many complaints about the actual difficulty of screaming properly, just more about what they think of the overall quality of the sound.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult, sure, but in my opinion it still sounds like someone just screaming down a microphone about whatever edgy topic they have this time\n\nEdit: Yes i am aware plenty of metal doesn\u2019t have screaming and that you guys have 100 different sub genres. But the post was about screaming, so i was referring to metal that does have it. I was also talking about how your average person sees metal, not my actual opinion on metal.",

            "The thing is, I don't think anybody questions the technical abilities behind this kind of singing.  I am a big fan of heavy metal music, but quickly change any song that comes with these growls, not because I don't respect the singer's skill, but because I feel it sounds completely horrible when compared to actual singing in heavy metal music.  I have not yet been presented with any context where I find screaming/growling adds anything relevant to a song or piece.  Where it should feel like a relevant creative choice, the style basically translates to a primitive display of the singer's inner caveman.",

            "most people underestimate the skill it takes to do lots of things (95% of people can't rap for shit for example), it's a problem with anyone who's not invested in a certain genre or art form, they tend to devalue skills they don't understand or respect\n\nI'd say there are other reasons screamo metal is unpopular (or rather, not as popular, it's still a genre of overall \"popular\" music), mainly that's it's not easy to listen to\n\nie: the volume is either very high or changes a lot, it's hard to put on in the background without taking over a room, the subject matter is often kind of dramatic, there's a lot of distortion in the sound which makes it stick out a lot and either grate people's ears who aren't used to the sound or just stand out a lot which is not why a lot of people listen to music, ALSO you can't really dance to it...",

            "Exactly. I'm not personally I to the growling, I think Kreator is the most of the growling type metal I listen to. But still it's a lot of talent \n\nI'm a huge fan of thrash and heavy metal. \n\nPeople don't seem to understand the talent it takes. It takes a toll on the vocal chords. \n\nI think it even causes cancer but I'm not sure if Bruce Dickinson and Dave Mustaine's cancer were because of the singing. \n\nBut still, it's a lot of talent. Screaming requires you to be loud while being at the right note. It seems to get more difficult as you get louder. In fact some songs have their best parts at the screaming. For example, So Far Away by Avenged Sevenfold, M Shadow has a lot of talent which is especially visible when you watch the live acoustic version. I think that one is even better than the studio version.",

A lot of the more popular bands do sound a bit trash IMO but if you dig deeper and find the very low range or high range, or even those who do both (Julien from Benighted being one I'd recommend, or growls and clean like Christian \u00c4lvestam although he doesn't do it live IIRC), that's where you find serious talent.

Try it - look them up and compare the scream songs to the ones they dont. \n\nThere are a lot of things that are hard to do. Doesnt make it worth it.\n\nPop music is easy to hate, but there is something to be said for making something a lot of people like. Metal screams are not that.",

You can see this behavior when people talk about rap music.

Soft vocals clean sounding instruments with a simple progression is great for a comforting experience. Its something familiar. You feel at home.\n\nBut what if you wanted to convey anger, frustration or despair? To me, nothing comes close to the aggression found in these metal vocalists.\n\nMy favorite tracks all combine screams and cleans. Being able to experience the \"ugliness\" and raw primal aggression from screams just make the cleans sound that much more uplifting in comparison. \n\nInstead of thinking \"wow this sounds terrible\", try examine your feelings when listening to it. \n\nIs it unnerving? Scary? Ugly? Chaotic? Chances are these are the exact emotions these artists are trying to convey through their songs.",
            "I agree that it takes a ton of work and talent to be able to sing/scream like that,  but I seriously doubt the only reason it's not as popular is because it's seen as \"easy.\"  Personally,  how much skill is required to perform any given piece of music is totally irrelevant to me,  and I'd bet a huge amount of --if not most-- people are the same way.   if they don't like it,  it's just because it's unfamiliar or dissimilar to music they already like,  and when being grilled about \"why\" they have the preferences they do,  saying \"it's just screaming it takes no skill\" is just an easy way to get whoever's grilling you off your back,  even if it's not the true reason you don't like the music.  I think a lot of people aren't willing to really listen to anything that's not at least a little familiar,  but if you say that to someone who demands to know why you don't like thier favorite genre of music they'll just keep grilling you and trying to make you listen to it.  \"it take a no skill\" is just an easy scapegoat to get out of an uncomfortable situation.",

Your name and other personally identifying information is never used, including on the results page.\n\nIf your trust in the person you're hooking up with is so low that you don't believe their response to the question of their testing status, you should find someone else to hook up with.

            "I agree that rough porn isn\u2019t the cause. Rather it\u2019s a lack of sexual education which leads porn to be the educator. We\u2019re almost all taught violence is wrong, but no one teaches us how to have sex.",
            "I'm sure the issue is that because sex ed isn't the best, teenagers learn about what they should do by what they see. If porn edits out condoms, people are less familiar with them and will probably use them less. If they see a dude choking a girl who consented behind the scenes, it's easy to go 'I guess women love that shit' and miss the importance of consent. This is different from video games because people don't learn how to interact with others through games, but porn is much more influential on behavior that way. The issue is that porn is much more real but hides many important things like consent (if it's there at all).",
            "A good counterpoint, I think, is that we're trained all the time that murder is bad. It's obvious. We watch violent movies all the time, but that's not where we get our firearms training from.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a general lack of good sex education, so porn becomes a heuristic when really it's more akin to movies. It might lead to confused ideas about consent and *possibly* rape. I have no data to back this up.\n\nPoint is, video games aren't the same as porn, though only because of the context surrounding each.\n\nEdit: To those saying I missed the point that people condemn rape: yes, we are taught that rape is bad. However, people regularly get away with that kind of stuff, and in many places people focus more on what the victim was wearing. Hell, r/unpopularopinion loves talking about how male sexual assault victims are ignored, stigmatized, or not believed.\n\nPeople *get away with rape*. I'm sure many of you have heard stories of families downplaying it or stories of popular (often male) perpetrators being shielded by their community.\n\nMurder is one of those fundamental precepts that everyone knows about. No person in their right mind would say rape is good, but it gets way less attention.",
            "I do agree in some sense, but I still feel like this type of porn and just porn in general are (for many people) their only source of knowledge when it comes to anything sexual. Not to mention that people who start watching porn start very young, when their minds are very malleable.This is a problem, because some of what you see in porn is not an accurate description of what really plays out during sex. Still,  you cant just assume that everyone watches the rougher stuff will turn out to be a sex offender,,",
            "Apparently some sexual assaults on pornhub are real . where in video games they are always simulations.",
            "The problem is in countries with little to no sex education. If people begin thinking it's normal to just bend a woman down and take her because \"she's a woman, she'll get to like it anyway\", then that is quite harmful in the long run. Most of these pornos don't promote consent between two partners and it normalises something happening between real people (unlike video games).\n\n I'm not saying it'll turn people into rapists, but if you have no knowledge on the matter, it might put wrong ideas in your head about how \"this is how sex works\".\n\nSo I wouldn't mind violent porn existing IF in real life, there were more proper education in schools etc. about how sex and consent works. And yes, I have literally had uneducated virgin men in their 20's ask me if it feels good to have my womb/cervix penetrated.....yeah...no, that only happens in Hentai, irl that would kill me and I'm sad you don't know this.",

            "I\u2019ll upvote because I disagree. But here\u2019s the big difference. When you\u2019re playing video games, it\u2019s fake and it\u2019s animation. In a game, you can go down the street shooing and killing people. In real life,a kid walks down the street and there\u2019s no one shooting and killing people.\nsex, on the other hand, is something that kids aren\u2019t doing on a regular basis and don\u2019t know how it works in real life unlike just walking down a street.\nSo if they are watching porn at a young age and all they see is violent, rapey stuff, thats what they think sex is. If they see a woman in a video saying no, but the guy keeps going, they may see that as okay because she \u201cmight\u201d be into it because thats what the people on the screen are doing. So when this kid goes into a real situation, maybe she says no, but he thinks that she still might want it. That\u2019s where I think the disconnect is. I think kids watching violent porn is not healthy at all and paints the wrong impression of what sex is. \nScientific studies show that violent games do not cause kids to become violent.\nScientific studies also show that watching porn, violent or non violent is directly correlated with the user being coercive and pushy towards women who don\u2019t want to have sex. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to believe one, you can\u2019t ignore the other.",

Ask any woman, myself included, who was hooking up with a partner thought it was appropriate to choke or slap or any other rough thing without asking first. People see this on the front page of pornhub and think that's what sex is supposed to be. \n\nSexual education is the key.",

            ">PLEASE stop mentioning that \"porn is real and games are not\". Most people who blame sexual assault on porn also are against Hentai and they think it promotes pedophilia. Well, Hentai isn't real. It's animated cartoons about tentacle sex monsters.\n\nThis is a fucking nonsensical argument from you. So what if some people also don't like the x rated cartoons? That's not what the vast majority of people actually are against. Most people against aggressive porn don't give a shit about cartoons, you're strawmanning.",
            "I agree. The caveat here is that far too many kids (and adults even)are accessing porn without real knowledge of sex, how the body works, what's enjoyable for both people, what negotiation looks like, etc. \nSo you get situations like what was posted on the relationship thread where a 19yr old virgin dumped his girlfriend after they had sex for the first time because her breasts didn't squirt milk when she came, so he thought she was lying about being into it. All because his experience with sex was hentai porn and talking to people who were into hentai porn. \nSo no, hard core porn doesn't turn you into a rapist. But if you don't have real knowledge of what real sex is you can ruin your real life.",

I can agree with that.\n\nThat said, it does.\n\nBoth porn and violent videogames can and do shape people's worldviews and help normalize certain ideas and behaviors even if the viewers/players don't engage in those behaviors themselves. For instance, the obsession many straight men seem to have in the past decade or so with deepthroating, facials, anal sex and perfectly hairless vulvas is an example of how the sexual expectations of an entire generation was shaped by certain types of readily-available porn. So is the unprecedented rise in the numbers of ED and anorgasmia in men under 25, to name another example.\n\nAs that Garfield meme would so eloquently say: **you are not immune to propaganda**",
            "I agree to an extent.

He had a difficult time staying hard with me because I didn\u2019t look as perfect as a porn star. He thought that anal wasn\u2019t going to hurt and tried doing it once against my wishes. \n\nNo, porn doesn\u2019t make people rape others, but it definitely skews their view of sex. Especially if the individual watching porn has never had sex. The only stuff they know is what they\u2019ve seen on pornhub, which is oftentimes unrealistic. \n\nThe thing is that people know that things like shooting others, rape, and incest is morally wrong, but they might not be very educated about sex. Porn (at least in large quantities) is unhealthy because it\u2019s unrealistic and creates unrealistic expectations.",

Even with thousands of hours of violent video game play, actual violence probably would not even occur to most of these people. Most people will likely be involved in sexual situations, and if they borrow from the pornography that they've seen, it often won't go well for them or their partner... Especially that vag slapping nonsense, or just above the butt without any kind of discussion.",
            "I think there is a subtle difference. The trouble with porn is that young people are exposed to it without having any previous knowledge on the topic, so they have no way to measure what is reality and what is fiction. Everyone knows that shooting people, beating someone up or stealing a car is wrong when they first play videogames, but a kid who is exposed to porn has no background or knowledge about sexuality, and porn is quite misleading in many aspects.",
            "Ehhh I disagree. Like some people have said before, it\u2019s a lack of education. Kids are way more likely to be taught that violence is bad and know they shouldn\u2019t go and murder people even if they do it in games. On the other hand, sex isn\u2019t talked about as much and they see rough porn and think that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s up to parents to teach their kid\u2019s but somewhere some kid is going to be educated by porn.",

Video games I know are fake characters, just competitive, fun, strategic, adventures too.

            "Eh yes and no. First lets make it clear that BDSM and being into rape porn is not the same. BDSM is all about consent. Being into rape porn however the appeal would be the explicit violent lack of consent. Also rough sex and BSDM are not the same. Its not fair to use all of these terms interchangeably. \n I could also go into the lack of sex ed all over the world and education on consent but other people have made that point so I won't rehash what they said.\n I don't necessarily think that everyone who has watched rape porn will sexually assult someone. But I definitely don't doubt that a lot of sexual assult perpetrators have watched rape porn. Regardless of the actual statistics behind it I also don't think its fair to compare porn to video games. I don't play video games for sexual pleasure, but porn is literally made exactly for that. At the end of the day I don't understand how someone can find something so vile and violent as rape arousing. Fictional or not. And I wouldn't be comfortable being in a relationship with that person.",
            "The difference here is that while games are not instructive about violence, porn *is* instructive about sex. Kids learn from a very young age that violence is not acceptable, but many, many people are going to encounter porn before they experience sex (especially in the modern internet age), and porn is going to shape what they think sex should be and where their sexual interests lie. Sexual practices that were once only common in porn are becoming normalized. We are not doing enough to make sure porn viewers are critical of what they consume, especially the ways it's completely unrealistic.",
            "I think this is misguided. The thing about rough porn is that it really does mislead people inexperienced with sex into thinking it's something that it isn't. Theres nothing wrong between more extreme sexual acts between consenting adults, but especially in america where sexual education is particularly bad, online free porn for better or worse does a lot of heavy lifting in teaching people about sex. Theres a lot of unsexy stuff that happens in porn before the shoot, like having consent and preparations for accidents. The problems come when younger people see hardcore porn and thinks that's what sex is supposed to be and then tries to enact it and something bad happens without consent or preparations.\n\nThis is really different from video games which dont really have an illustrative or educational makeshift function in society. People arent playing video games not knowing what war or crime is. They also arent going into video games thinking \"I am about to experience a virtual simulation of something that I have never done, but intend to one day do\".\n\nTheres strings attached to porn that just arent attached to video games that create appreciable differences.",

If people are into it, it doesn\u2019t matter how wrong it\u2019s seems to the rest of us.   When a 14 year old boy watches porn where the girls is getting choked and DP\u2019d in her ass at the same time, But she appears to like it.... than thats it. It\u2019s ok if they like it right?    \nHere\u2019s a perfect scenario why abusive porn can be made to seem ok even if its clearly violent.    A guy chokes a girl, she gags, she vomits...all that.  A kid sees it.  He thinks one of two things.  \n1. She\u2019s ok with it, so its ok to choke girls.  2. She\u2019s not ok with it, but its being done anyway.  So it\u2019s ok to do even if she doesn\u2019t like it.    Kids have access to extreme porn (stuff that we take for granted these days) long before they have their own actual sexual encounters.  These kids may not know that real girls dont like the shit they see in porn.  They don\u2019t know what a real sexual encounter is supposed to be like, because that is not whats depicted in porn.  I can guarantee you that there are two 15 year old having sex for the first time, and when its time to finish the girl is going to get on her knees and assume the facial position.  And the guy is going to know just what to do.  Because this is what is depicted in literally every porn scene.  Can it be wrong if its done in every single porno out there these days?  He may not be realizing this is not what normal people do in real life.  They will do what they\u2019ve seen done.\n\nSo......... will people rape because of porn? Maybe not.

Yes this isn't rape, but not even thinking about the other person's consent is still a big issue. I'm also specifically talking about sexual encounters that were consensual. \n\nThere is also a pretty huge part of the male population(US) who is just absolutely shit at sex and pretty much try to use porn moves that are not at all pleasant. On top of this, most of them take it personally when you let them know that sex without foreplay is painful, or that jackhammering isn't doing anything useful. Once again, every single woman I have ever known closely in my life has a story about \"that boyfriend\" who thought they were great at sex, but that they had never orgasmed with and who wasn't even open to the idea of mutual pleasure. There is a reason that this is a stereotype. \n\nSo yes, while violent porn doesn't produce rapists, porn in general is detrimental when it comes to realistic sex and actually having something enjoyable occur with the woman. I personally think there is a level of desensitization that goes on as well when one watches too much porn, as in they don't find vanilla acts enjoyable or enough. Sensuality, romance, even the eroticism of the moment, get forgotten, and instead replaced with a sick one sided race to the finish. It's disappointing and sad.",

            "No, porn doesnt cause sexual violence, but I do think there is a bit of a difference between porn and games. We are all taught from a very early age on up that violence, theft, and other crimes are not acceptable. Even a 10 year old can play GTA and separate the on screen violence with real life acts.\n\nWith sex though, at least in the US, sexual education is often completely lacking. You might be taught the mechanics of sex and pregnancy, how to wear a condom, and about STDs, but little to nothing about lovemaking itself. Young people often have no template to work off off, except porn and sexually explicit media. Throw in social norms that are often very misogynistic, and there is a great deal of confusion about what is and isn't appropriate. So, while a sexual predator is going to assault someone pretty much no matter what, there are a lot of men (and women too, albeit less often) who overstep bounds more out of ignorance and than malice. Again, that isn't porn's fault, but more that porn as a template is a symptom of a society with an unhealthy approach towards sex.",

If the media you frequently consume paints women as inferior/objects/abusable then that may translate into you viewing your irl relationships with women in a different way.  You might view women as lesser irl, and valuing people lower than you (dehumanization) is what allows people to be violent.\n\nVideo games don't typically focus on one type of person being the bad guy and so aren't as likely to influence your perceptions of particular groups. I would however, expect a person whose porn consumption is entirely rough sex on women to value women less then the person whose porn consumption is entirely free of degrading sex. Similarly, if you only play games where to violence you enact is on a specific minority group, I would expect you to be desensitized to violence against that minority group in real life.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't say that any individual piece of media has the power to push you over the edge and do something dangerous. Of course, what I said above about women would ring true for porn featuring men too. I don't think porn should be illegal unless the production of it is nonconsensual.",

Enjoying minor porn, drawn or not, is immoral, illegal and just messed up altogether. \n\nThere is a huge difference between enjoying fun gameplay of a shooter or a gripping dark story, and between getting sexually aroused by (drawings of) teens/children having sex. That\u2019s really messed up and you need serious help if you don't see what is wrong with that. Plenty of movies/games are banned too.

We just don't know, but the assumption that inundating the culture with violent images has potentially negative side effects is perfectly reasonable.",
            "There is a known and strongly positive correlation between heavy use of hardcore porn, and rape.",
            "Video games and porn lead to desensitisation, which when introduced at a young age can lead to children developing into adults that don't see violence etc. as horrifying or are okay with violence. This doesn't mean people will act out anything they've seen but the act doesn't shock them as much as if it was a new stimulus.\n\nThe issue with porn is that it leads to a positive physical response. And you can train the body to only respond to certain stimuli. For example, some people can only get off when there is porn and struggle with maintaining erections when it isn't there.\n\nTherefore, somone who only watches rough porn may train themselves to only be able to get off successfully with rough porn. Though very unlikely, as humans like sex and are turned on by more than one sexual stimuli.\n\nAlso, if shown to younger more vulnerable minds, it might socialise them into believing that rough and violent sex is appropriate and everyone likes it. It only takes one violent or rough session to cause an issue, even though the person initiating the rough sex may learn later it is not what everyone likes, the first person they got it wrong with is damaged by that encounter.",

            "It's not rough porn. The entirety of porn itself causes sexual assault. To say nothing of the countless numbers of porns that feature real sexual assault, nor of those which are produced through exploitation and coercion, regular porn use has conditioning effects that video games do not.\n\nFor one, the dopamine porn releases is many orders of magnitude higher than video games. Video games are undeniably dopamine agonists, acting on the sophisticated motivation pathways. The sex reward pathways in the brain are disproportionately visually stimulated, calibrated to a situation that is \"rare\" in an evolutionary context (rare when you compare the overall time opportunities are present in an average male's life), based strongly on anticipation, and deeper and older than any other pathways except possibly self-preservation and eating. For these reasons, the dopamine response, and thus the conditioning potential of behaviors that stimulate this pathway are far greater. That the conscious mind is aware that sex is not really happening is of very little consequence in the face of this neurochemical cascade. The cascade has powerful myelination effects that are going to reshape the brain regardless, which is why decoupling the visual stimulus from the event is dangerous. Worse still, porn is a superstimulus. The number of sex acts - all novel, visual-centric, and partially tailored to the taste of the individual - that a regular porn user can and will expose themselves to in an hour exceeds the lifetime total of novel sexual excitement that maybe 95% of ancestral males would witness in a lifetime.\n\nSecond, video games construct a context (of varying levels of sophistication) in which a player performs. Pornography is not performative. It's voyeuristic. The experience of porn does not involve participating in the porn. This is speculation on my part, but I think it's important because the voyeurism creates an open loop that the performance does not. In a game, you have \"motivation to kill > perform the virtual killing > motivation is met.\" In porn, you have \"motivation to have sex > watch virtual sex > motivation is relieved, but not met.\" Healthy sex is of course a loop too, but sex is deeper than simply relieving the motivation to have sex. It also provides connection, intimacy, and validation. Pornography provides none of these, creating a deficiency. There are other sources of these that might be meeting the needs of the individual, but in hyper-individualistic, narcissistic modern society, that would not be my personal default assumption.\n\nThird and most relevant to your particular opinion, apart from the open loop, another consequence of the voyeuristic nature of pornography is that it functionally objectifies women. Every time a man looks at porn, the woman is functioning as an object of arousal. There is no feedback. Every second the man spends watching porn, he is only hoping the woman does what will arouse him. No part of her inner experience is found anywhere in his thoughts, except for insofar as it intersects with his arousal.\n\nHer multi-dimensionality as a person is completely lost, although this is not itself a problem. Simplifying people to roles is natural. It's only when there is an inability to move between low-resolution simplified concepts of people to high-res complicated concepts of people (let's call it scaling) that a problem is formed. Pornography does nothing to facilitate this ability. It habituates the objectification. Video games have this effect offset by the fact that the general category of \"person\" is one where scaling is facilitated by real-world experience with other people.  There is no equivalent offset for the category of \"sexual partners.\" Obviously sexual partners is a subset of people, but they're also an exceptional subset. You might take the behavior some men exhibit towards dating, relationships, and sex as further validation that sometimes there is a disconnect between how men treat people and how they treat potential or actual sexual partners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary, porn is a supernormal stimulus that transforms the brain at a time when the user is functionally objectifying women while leaving the user with great dissatisfaction and unmet needs over time. It's perfectly reasonable to think from that that pornography might incline the most sensitive men, a small but not trivial percent of the population, towards violence.\n\nYour opinion basically holds that these two beliefs are of a similar level of credibility because of what they have in common: indirect experience of reality motivating direct action. There's no denying they have that in common. But it's the set of their differences that makes one belief far more reasonable than the other.\n\nPlease bring any and all objections and criticisms to me by reply or PM. I am very serious about the truth of the matter, and I am willing to put ego aside to enter into dialectic with anyone who thinks they might know better.",

For 99% of BDSM and 100% of safe and sane BDSM (the kind the community doesn\u2019t frown on) safety is paramount and discussed beforehand, and the sub is never actually in any real danger, it\u2019s just a game designed to make it feel like real danger, because that\u2019s what they want.",
            "It's not a direct cause of it but it definitely desensitizes people to it.",
            "First of all I just wanna say in response to OP\u2019s edit porn is not real. It\u2019s a staged scenerio. \n\nSecond of all I agree. I actually am a fan of BDSM and rough sex and the idea of non consensual sex completely turns me off. That\u2019s what the safe word is for. If it feels non consensual then I don\u2019t wanna do it either.",
            "No it\u2019s not sadistic porn that\u2019s responsible for sexual deviants, it\u2019s really the other way around sexual deviants are the cause for sadistic porn. The porn isn\u2019t creating sexual deviants it\u2019s the sexual deviants that usually seek out sadistic porn or get pleasure from hurting there partners during sex. If you get off to people having sex with children and animals it\u2019s not the videos which have done that to you.",
            "Oooooh, for a change this is actually good.",
            "Response for the edit 1: finally someone who understands me!",
            "Both can be dangerous fantasies true.",
            "I watch a lot of violent porn and I\u2019m not interested in sexually assaulting anyone. (I\u2019m a woman).",
            "This will prob be removed",
            "Very good point. I mostly agree, although it is worth considering that it's probably more appealing to a lot of people to commit rape than to commit murder. Whether that means a lot I don't know, but it might be worth considering",
            "I don't think you phrased that correctly. The two things are opposites.",
            "Is it not boomers that think both of those things?",
            "Wow, everything on this sub is either popular opinions about heated topics, or unpopular opinions about random personal preference garbage. This is actually an unpopular opinion about an actual topic that can be discussed and has relevance to anything",
            "Finally someone said it.",
            "I think the distinction should be made in terms of exposure. If video games and other media were your ONLY way of learning about social interactions while your social skills were developing, you would probably end up skewing more towards the sociopathic side of things. However as children (and sometimes as adults), we often have much more real experiences/lessons that teach us otherwise during development. The same cannot be said about sex, as much of American society either passively or actively discourages frank and open discussions about sex (be that in school, church, or otherwise). Combine this with young people also being taught traditional gender roles from an extremely early age, and it\u2019s perfectly possible, not to mention logical, that one could grow up never knowing any other type of sex than the one that they saw in porn. If no one ever told you that soldiers don\u2019t come back after you shoot them in Call of Duty, you probably wouldn\u2019t hesitate in shooting your friends if given some guns to play with. Then again, this is just how I see it, I\u2019d love to hear your rebuttals :-)",
            "I think a far bigger issue is that porn reflects gender issues. As we\u2019ve seen the growth of things like the Incel movement we\u2019ve also seen an ever increasing degree of violence and subjugation in porn. It\u2019s a product primarily designed for male consumption and it\u2019s becoming a more violent reflection which should make us all ask serious questions about what\u2019s happening with men in our society. Additionally, unlike violent video games or movies, porn depicts real people having real sex. For many young people, porn is the closest thing to sexual education they ever receive and way too many believe it to be a reflection of real life sexual scenarios and desires. Adult men often emulate porn in their private lives, much to the displeasure of their partners.",
            "ok so it isn't me who's just the weird one",
            "As a woman who is into rape play, dominantion, choking, bondage etc., I completely agree.\n\nIn fact, the r/BDSMcommunity is probably the most educated place you will find on safe sexual practice.",
            "I don\u2019t believe in either of those they\u2019re both ridiculous. Humans have free will and do stupid and or horrid shit of their own volition. Some people is just fucked up.",
            "I don\u2019t like either.",
            "When\u2019s the last time you hid your GTA addiction? Having a violent fantasy is not even taboo. Beating up a boss or ramming your way through traffic? Normal people thoughts. Having a rape fantasy? How many people in your life would you open up to about watching rape porn?\n\nIt\u2019s viewed differently because it\u2019s different. When you\u2019re shooting newbs in the face you\u2019re not staring down into the hole you made and getting visceral excitement. At least you better not be, weirdo.",
            "Not completely disagreeing but video games are different than porn. You play video games because you want to have fun and you do that stuff in the game because you know it\u2019s fake. You watch porn because your brain wants to see the other/same sex naked because you have the biological urge to. So you watch porn to get the high and also it is actually happening. \nNot saying rough porn does or doesn\u2019t cause sexual assault, just that it\u2019s not fair to make that analogy.",
            "Not the same thing",
            "The difference is murder is without a doubt a evil/wrong thing to do. Rough sex is all about consent which isn't cut and dry  just because someone verbally consents to something doesn't mean you're good to go. The issue is that young people are introduced to porn and for them that's their first expierence to sex and consent. Porn rarely if ever shows the consent of sex not to mention that rough sex isn't something many woman/men enjoy.",
            "Not everyone sees rape in porn and immediately wants to do it though...that\u2019s all I had to read to know the rest is garbage",
            "This is actually kind of interesting but I think the reason is because the phrasing of this conflates a couple of distinctly separate issues. \n\nSo violent video games shouldn\u2019t be blamed for physical violence and rough porn shouldn\u2019t be blamed for sexual violence. That is principally true as long as we assume nobody is harmed in the making of the content. If people are actually harmed in the making of either, the principle no longer applies. \n\n\nIf we consume content in which people or animals are exploited, it cannot be for the sake of entertainment (important to distinguish \u201centertainment\u201d because there are a few legitimate reasons one might consume such content but none of them are for the purpose of entertainment, and I don\u2019t want that to be the first thing contrarians point out). The primary ethical reason for this is that by consuming exploitative content, you reward the creator of it and thus encourage more sexual violence inflicted on others. So if there\u2019s any question about whether or not the people in porn are consenting to it, then it\u2019s no longer accurate to compare it to video games. Consuming such content would encourage others to create similar content and they\u2019d have to inflict sexual violence on others in order to do that. Therefore, consuming it does actually cause more violence unlike video games where it\u2019s safe to assume nobody is being hurt to create it. \n\n^ I think there\u2019s actually even more to it than that but thats at least one logical objection.",
            "I think people who watch BDSM porn have the desire before they view the it. The porn doesn't cause it.",
            "Cause and influence are two different things.\n\nPeople who say cause are either dumb or leading the narrative",
            "I strongly believe the biggest issue is lack of sexual education. However, many girls and boys out there are learning about sex through porn. You don\u2019t learn how to drive through GTA (if you do, please never get in a car again).",
            "Wait. Wait, wait... people think porn is real?! Hahahaha",
            "Wonder why vaping and cigarettes once upon a time became cool with kids.\n\nPorn doesnt cause sexual violence IMO (mind is open to be changed if data say otherwise) but it fucks you up if it becomes an addiction (and its absolutely addictive) like video games and nicotine both are in different ways.\n\nReally anything that gives a huge dopamine response without any effort or meaning/fulfillment behind it fucks you up over time",
            "Tentacle sex monsters lmaooo",
            "I think people upvoted this ironically.",
            "i belive neither",
            "I mostly agree but I think there's a difference in that rough porn could be an issue as without sex education a growing teen could believe that sort of bedroom time to be the norm and to be realistic, leading to sexual assault. In comparison we are all taugh from a very young age not to murder and steal, these are common laws that are enforced to us so despite seeing them in video games, we (mostly) Inherrently know we should never bring it to real life.",
            "Is there are large crossover between people who condemn hardcore pornography, but also defend violent video games?",
            "I respect the unpopularity so here's my upvote\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that you're coomerbaiting by comparing things that have nothing to do with each other",
            "I also say this applies to people who say rap music causes gang violence",
            "I'd do GTA IRL...but getting rid of 5 Stars IRL isn't as easy as ducking into a Pay and Spray",

            "I agree with everything you've said. However, I want to talk about potntial eating disorders/bad relationships with food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I suspect he has ARFID. It's an eating disorder characterised by 'picky eating'. He'll happily eat meat, carbs, dairy, and sugar, but he won't touch 99% of veggies or fruits. He has tried multiple times to eat vegetables and fruits, but the mental block is so strong he physically can't bring himself to do it, despite WANTING to do it. The texture/colour/smell makes him feel sick. ARFID is most common in kids, and it can be lethal. Some people go blind from malnutrition. Most people don't develop properly as they age because they don't have the energy. Somehow the lucky shit managed to dodge all these health issues. My partner has considered seeing a nutritionist/therapist about his eating habits, but because it doesn't seem to be affecting his health he doesn't feel the need to do it. He's 27 and he's pretty healthy... somehow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't rub it in people's faces like an asshole, but people always comment about his plate at restaurants and social events, so he has to explain to people regularly 'I don't like vegetables/fruit'. I know this makes people judge him quickly, and people think he's some kind of manchild. But that's not a fair assumption. He's perfectly normal in every other way. He'll happily try new things, but when it comes to food it's much harder for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish he'd see a nutritionish or therapist. It would make things much easier for him. But he is more worried about money than his health (we can't really afford to be seeing a nutritionist right now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do agree with you. Some people really are pathetically childish about trying new things. Having a tantrum because someone ordered pizza with mushroom is ridiculous. Loudly exclaiming that someone else's food looks 'gross' is asshole behaviour. People who act like this SHOULD be mocked, because they're just being dickheads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to remind people that sometimes disliking vegetables/fruit/healthy foods isn't always a case of being childish. Sometimes people have underlying issues that contribute to what they can and cannot bring themselves to eat. If you're worried about someone's eating habits, the worst thing you can do is mock them. Instead, gently encourage them to try healthier foods. Even if it's just a nibble. Even if it's smothered with tomato sauce. Just encourage them.",

            "The best players in the world come to the USA for those sports for a reason.  Football, basketball, baseball, they may go home during world events, but they play here.\n\nYour example of basketball is just ridiculous though.\n\nIn the Olympics, the USA has more gold medals in basketball (16) than the next 3 countries have medals, period, combined (Soviet Union with 9, Yugoslavia with 5, and Argentina with 2).  The USA has an overall win/loss record of 143-6.  They have only not placed on the podium a single time, and that was the 1980 Olympics, when the USA refused to participate due to the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan.\n\nThere is not a team outside of the United States who could compete with the Warriors, Celtics, Mavericks, or Heat (the NBA final 4 this year).  Any of those teams would win 99 times out of 100 against any country's team that faced them.\n\nAs for the FIBA titles, the average NBA player couldn't care less about that, so they don't compete.  That said, they are still tied with Yugoslavia for the most titles with 5, and lead the most medals with 12.\n\nIf you're complaining about the USA calling themselves world champions at something, basketball is probably the worst example you could pick.",
            "You picked the worst example buddy. I am proud of my birth country's status as a basketball giant for such a small nation, but it could still not come close to US basketball. That's why our top prospects go to the NBA, not the Euroleague (still a great league but you couldn't seriously consider any Euroleague team beating an NBA team). The best team in the NBA, the champions, are effectively the best team in the world. What you're arguing is basically semantics, if it wasn't then the FIBA World Cup would be more watched, more culturally intertwined (inside and outside of the US), and more present.",
            "The rational is that the best players in the world, leave their countries and go play in the US, in those particular sports.\n\nIn baseball for example more then half the players are from other countries.

Not going to win an awards or become \"cult classics\", but they fit in during the time they were produced and there's a reason they stayed on the air for as long as they did (they were popular). \n\nEarly *That 70s Show* is pretty great, especially when it is leaning into its 70s setting, the antics of the shows characters as teenagers of that era (and how similar, relatable they were to teens of the 2000s), and some of the realities of living in that era (Red's tenuous position at his auto-plant, Kitty's difficulties with being a good nurse in a field dominated by doctors who don't think much of her, Hyde's difficult family life, etc). There's a surprisingly tasteful story about Eric making friends with a gay, in-the-closet- classmate. Tame for today's standards, but pretty amazing for 2000. \n\nEventually, though, the cast aged out and the plots became more about the personalities and not everything else around them. Character relationships are important, sure, but the various couplings of the core cast and the inner workings of their relationships soon dominated most of the plots. Progression grinded to a halt as Fox continued to renew the show way past the time where it made sense to continue.\n\n*How I Met Your Mother* lives and dies by its \"future narrator\" conceit. Without it, it's just a mid-2000s version of *Friends.* Not a bad thing by itself, but it makes it less memorable. The best stories on *HIMYM* revolve around Ted being an unreliable narrator. I think even Barney's antics can be summed up to just being how Ted remembered them, not necessarily how they really happened (if they did). \n\nSimilar to *70s Show* though, *Mother* eventually outgrows its premise. While it's funny to think that Ted's kids are still sitting on the sofa listening to this story, at some point it is going on for too long. Ted's love life starts to take a back seat to everything else going on and the later seasons start to drag. There's still some solid stories here, but the feeling of \"where is this going?\" starts to set in. Then, of course, there's the series finale, which is its own can of worms depending on who you ask.\n\nIn the end, though, both shows are a product of their time. A sort of \"*You had to be there*\" effect; as in, you had to be watching as it was airing. New audiences might find them hard to get into (especially due to their length) but they are general decent highlights for the time periods they originally aired.",

Even a very peaceful area has the potential to become suddenly hostile. \n\nIn the US, there are a minimum of 1.2Million violent crimes in the US every year. That's about a 1/200 chance that an average person will experience a violent crime each and every year. Over 10 years, that number is closer to 1/20 chance that the average person will experience a violent crime. But that doesn't account for environmental conditions. For the people that live in a more violent area, chance is an absolute certainty. \n\nThere are 500,000 - 3,000,000 defensive gun uses per year in the US alone. \n\nIf you believe that the world is not a hostile place, you almost certainly have lived a very privileged life.",

He complimented my pistol, but moments later I came across him again telling another man how cool this was, and you could see it was a power thing for him. I've carried for years after nearly being attacked with a box cutter, the only thing that saved me was paying attention and being worried. I dodged that thing by an inch.

            "Threesomes are a single persons game. And even then, they are not all they are caked up to be. More isn\u2019t always better.",
            "Most people only think about threesomes in the sense of being titillating. They're not thinking about the logistics.\n\nIf you want to \"spice up\" your relationship, a threesome is not for you. If you're having relationship problems, a threesome won't fix them. A threesome will never fix something broken. You have to already have a really excellent sex life and an incredibly solid relationship. \n\nA threesome doesn't turn burnt toast into ice cream. It just adds sprinkles to ice cream.",
            "I have been in many threesomes, they work if you have realistic expectations, little jealousy and everyone is actually attracted to everyone else. It really helps if no one is in a couple",
            "I agree. It makes no sense in a relationship. If it's just 3 single people having fun then why not but bad news for relationships",
            "They're like toupes, you only hear about the bad ones. People that have threesomes that don't affect their relationship don't go around advertising the fact.",

I know plenty of people who have enjoyed threesomes (as well as people who enjoy all sorts of things much harder to understand than threesomes).\n\nI think threesomes are a terrible idea if anyone involved has any hesitation at all.  They are a terrible idea if people who are insecure in their relationship are trying to reignite some spark.  But a bad idea for anyone?  That is an incredibly narrow way of seeing the world.",
            "It\u2019s like having two TVs on and being unable to enjoy either of them.",

            "Agree 100%. I\u2019ve had 2 threesomes and hated both. \n\nOnce it was as a couple, and once with me as the guest star. On both occasions it felt like plate spinning and uncomfortable as to know where to direct your attention. I only did the second threesome because I thought I might enjoy it for a different perspective. I didn\u2019t. \n\nSome things are better in the mind than in reality.",
            "I just think its hurtful to suggest to your monogamous partner for them to watch you fuck someone else in front of them. And a lot of them just assume their straight partner would be down to try bi stuff, when they're not bi. And they wouldn't tolerate the same sex themselves. Like the guys who only want FFM with their reluctant female partner.",
            "If you ever do a threesome, make it with someone you don't know, and make it a one time thing with them, just casual sex.  I was in an ongoing threesome with one of my best friends and his wife.  It pretty much ruined the relationship with both of them, and I haven't talked to them in over 15 years.  I was the one who walked out on them because the friendship dynamic changed and it got too wierd for me.",
            "As one other person stated, many people that are swingers and/or engage in threesomes don't typically disclose this to their vanilla friends for fear of being judged by people like the OP. \n\nThe key to threesomes or swapping being successful is being in a strong relationship, not one that is unstable and trying to fix it with sex. That's why you never hear a good ending to it, it wasn't a stable relationship to start off with. \n\nThreesomes/swinging/open relationships are a magnifying glass on a relationship. If it's a strong relationship, it will show you truly how deep and strong it is. However if it has cracks in it, they will look and become much bigger after including others in your relationship.",
            "I think straight couples have to approach threesome situations differently from gay couples. Since straight people are attracted to the opposite sex, of course either partner is going to have less fun than the other when you bring another woman or man into the bedroom. I suppose it\u2019s why swinger couples are a thing.\n\nJust my perspective as a gay man. I am more than happy to bring a third into the bedroom in a relationship, but that\u2019s also because we\u2019re both attracted to the same sex.",

            "Me and my SO have them and have been happily married for years. I think a lot of it boils down to respect and maturity. We slept with a good friend casually for months. She got a boyfriend, we moved on to pursuing other casual thirds, and we still have had no issues. We are both still good friends with her, and in a very happy marriage. A lot of people use it as a bandaid, which is no more effective than having a baby to try to save your relationship. If you aren't happy, don't drag other people into it to try to fix it. It doesn't work. However if you are stable and both into it (the \"I am doing this as a treat for my SO\" or doing it to make them happy when you are not okay with it is a whole other toxic can of worms) then I think it can work in certain relationships.",

You need every member to be entirely without romantic attachment to anyone else, and also strong enough friendships that the complexities of sex don't tear the whole thing down. Either that, or complete strangers who you never see again, and that's almost impossible to organize.\n\nOn top of all that, only threesomes are as fun as you imagine they are.

It didn't blow my mind or anything but it was cool, especially at the time.\n\nI ended up dating the one girl for a while and then lost touch with both of them.\n\nThat being said, would I have a threesome with my now wife?

            "If a dude is pressuring his girlfriend into an unwanted threesome with her bestfriend or some random chick (which is the case a lot of times) then it's gonna end badly... \n\nHowever, in my experience, if your girl is bisexual and is the one to orchestrate the threesomes - you're gonna have a good time...",

One partner who's not really  into it, and is just doing it to keep the other partner who already has a foot out the door.\n\nIf you need more than your partner to maintain your relationship, you're with the wrong person or you are not emotionally able to connect with just one person...which is painful for anyone who falls in love with you and wants a true emotional commitment. I don't know anyone who really loves their partner that would suggest bringing someone else into their intimacy.",
            "I've had a number of threesomes in my life, none have been exactly amazing. Porn has weird choreography wherein all parties are actively engaged at all times, in my case it was more like \"imma do you, then you, then you do you, then we all get waffles. Yay\". It wasn't bad except that one time there was another guy, which was mostly just awkward, as I'm straight. Mostly it just boiled down to me thinking it would have gone down better if we all just took the time to schedule appointments with each other.",

I would literally die for my friends tho and constantly joke flirt/hit on them. No one seems uncomfortable bc I\u2019ve never overstepped boundaries. It just naturally happened since I\u2019m not at all interested in relationships. Idk if it\u2019s effected any of their relationships but it still seems comfortable and fun for everyone so idk",
            "really very curious as to how many people are in poly relationships right now. thinking \"it's wholesome & I love it,\" When in a few years they'll be looking back in therapy, realizing it was a decision based on trauma...\n\nYes,  some do the poly thing and can/want to keep it up for their whole life- but from what I've seen, many are easily taken advantage of and many end up getting hurt because it's not truly what they want.\n\nIt can be very toxic -but there are some people who are genuinely very happy w/ it.

            "Most awkward time I have ever spent with two people in my life.  When I finished the other people just sat there and said, \u201cwere you just wacking off in front of us\u201d?  The conversation in the lunchroom got really weird after that.",
            "The only time to do it, if you want to, is if everyone involved is 100% single with no attachments to eachother. That's really it. Otherwise it will always be messy.",
            "If the woman jumps on the idea of doing a threesome and immediately has someone in mind, or repeatedly asks you for a threesome until you agree, then she\u2019s just looking for an excuse to fuck someone else. \n\nIf it\u2019s one of her girl best friends, especially if that friend is out as bisexual, then it\u2019s even worse. Chances are your partner wants to experiment or maybe she thinks she might be gay/bi but doesn\u2019t want to \u2018cheat\u2019 and risk you finding out. \n\nIf it\u2019s a male friend from work or a club, especially if it\u2019s one you don\u2019t have much contact with or one where they call each other \u201cwork wife\u201d and \u201cwork husband\u201d then she\u2019s probably been fucking him at work or whilst you\u2019re at work, and she just wants an excuse to fuck him with your permission so she can leave without being accused of cheating. \n\nThis can work just as well if you switch all the sexes in this argument. Except it\u2019s less common for men, because they\u2019ll just cheat and get away with it for a while, or just dump their partner. It\u2019s not necessarily as common for men to try and find a \u201cjustification\u201d for dumping their partner, they\u2019ll just do it",

A voice note is something long and meandering which doesn't fit in a text but can wait until you have time to listen - no need to rush to a quiet place to listen, just whenever. I think maybe the people messaging you are doing it wrong, or you just need to wait for a better time to listen.",

            "It was different than most sitcoms that came before it. It's not centered on family or work and after Cheers made the \"Will they, won't they\" plot thread a staple of the genre Seinfeld completely rejected it. People call it a show about nothing, but that's an exaggeration. The important thing is that the main characters do not have traditional character arcs in that they learn nothing and don't become better people. Generally speaking, it makes more sense to try to get audiences to root for likeable characters. But for Seinfeld most of the humor comes from watching their ridiculous schemes blow up in their faces. You're supposed to enjoy the schadenfreude of watching absurd things happen as a result of their own stupidity and pettiness. That's why it gets compared frequently to It's Always Sunny.",

I\u2019m not sure how old you are, but I can imagine people under 30 might not like it, seeing how almost every misunderstanding that drives the show could be solved with a simple text message. \n\nAlso, I think many today expect a \u201cpunch line\u201d every 30 seconds.  Seinfeld is great because it really is about nothing. It\u2019s about the little quirks in life.  \u201cI like this guy and he\u2019s great in bed\u2026but he paints his face for hockey games. Do I want to deal with that.?\u201d\n\nI also think it\u2019s better if you k ow more about it.

If your teachers cannot explain it, figure it our yourself.\n\nIt might come as a surprise, but many school math teachers don't know math and don't know what it's for. The entire system is built around standardized tests, which have very little to do with the subject.",
            "Thing is, they don't explain what the application for certain maths is, meaning you feel like you're learning it for the sake of learning it, which is pointless to a teenager. \n\nI remember finding out that trigonometry is often used in blood splatter analysis to find out the origin of the blood spray. Bit morbid, but there's a great example of why trig can be useful, and explaining the application of maths will likely make people more willing to learn it. \n\nQuick addition is great to make sure you're not getting overcharged when you're buying something, or when you're budgeting. Percentages are great for calculating tax or \"25% off offers\". Circle theorem is useful for... I genuinely don't know, and that's why I struggled with it, despite being a top maths student in school. \n\nIt's bad enough trying to teach kids stuff they don't (currently) understand, but if there's an extra level of \"I don't understand why I need to understand this other than for the exam\", then why would they put the effort into trying to understand what seems like useless information. \n\nThere's a reason maths books use practical examples, and that's because relating information to real life scenarios makes it easier to learn. If you cannot relate that info to a real life scenario (one obscure job, or advanced academic scenarios don't count) then that info is probably not worth learning over the masses of other important real-life information that schools miss out on.",

And hey, if you really like math and working with numbers, more power to you. But if you're more responsive to another thing and more passionate about a different subject, then that should take precedent over the more in-depth aspects of math.\n\nBut I'm biased because I fuckin hate math. I am able and willing to learn  anything, I mean I believe everyone is, especially if it's something I'm interested in. But on the other hand I know a shit ton of people who are just insanely unwilling to put any effort into learning even basic things.",
            "I think algebra and geometry are important math subjects for high school students. However, I think students that are able to take advanced maths like trigonometry and calculus are serviced far less by learning those subjects that few of us will use outside of specific careers. I think probability and statistics would be far more useful to the majority of high school students as they will encounter statistics and probability far more often throughout their lifetime. I've not used calculus once since the end of my undergraduate courses and I'm nearing the end of my PhD, but I used statistics damn near everyday.",
            "If the purpose of algebra was to teach abstract thinking and problem solving, then they could teach many other subjects in it's place, or design a new subject that is more focused on those goals.\n\nSo, the reason math is the subject of choice is because everyone should know up to algebra and geometry. We live in a world where exact values are not always known, and we live in a 3D world at that. People say they don't need these skills, and no doubt they could survive without them, as you could survive without any schooling, but you really gain an invaluable understanding of the world from these subjects.\n\nMaybe most people don't need to learn more-advanced algebra, advanced trig, or calculus, but basic algebra and geometry are kinda just necessary to not be ignorant of your world, and not be dependant on others for simple answers/solutions.\n\nPlus, STEM students need to go farther in math anyway, so just keep all the kids in the same classrooms. No need to invent a new (probably less-useful) subject to teach problem solving and abstract thinking.",

Why do we have people graduating that doesn't know how loans are supposed to work and what it all means to have one... And the next step is going to be college? Where dept goes hand and hand? I just think we need a re-balancing of what subjects are supposed to be in school because if you build a house, become an architect, computer programmer etc, yeah you need math, but figuring out how loans work and stuff like that is no where near algebra, yet it's not in the curriculum outside of maybe a very tiny portion of economics class..",

The problem is that the specific things about how American public schools are, by necessity, means its simply teaching you the formula and how to get the answer, and it barely does that, but it doesnt teach you how to apply it, why it works that way, what the quadratic formula actually does or where it would apply in your real life.\n\nAnyone can look at algebra and go oh this is a way to categorize common problems, its why word problems are effective. When people can see something like \"Oh so and so is building a house and he needs to know this angle and that one and wha'ts going to be the volume of the pool in the back\" they can apply it. \n\nBut when you get into the abstractions and theoreticals of it, like log rolls or some shit, thats when a lot of people go 'wait Im confused' and the teacher cant spend days trying to push it home and thats when people get frustrated and upset that they arent doing well and fall off with it.",

Like no, you\u2019re in a field notorious for members being unable to communicate, you are contributing to the problem. And now you\u2019ve also shot yourself in the foot from ever contributing meaningfully to the tech industry because frankly one of the good things (in retrospect) of structured education at universities and the like is that you get forced to learned topics that you may not value or even know exist, but which come in handy later. \n\nThere\u2019s this societal push to be super specialized nowadays which I don\u2019t agree with. While some amount of specialization is needed in the modern day (and this need has only been getting stronger since the advent of communal living), anyone who knows about evolutionary ecology knows that in the face of huge climate shifts (or cultural shifts in the human side of this analogy), it\u2019s the generalists that survive while the specialists die off. The difference here being that unlike evolution, humans can guide our development with intent so rejecting a generalized skill set and not building a well rounded worldview is just idiotic."

            "Cashless does have a lot of benefits, but I think what also shouldn't be ignored is how people kinda lose track on how much money they spend. I realized that in myself, at least. You just hold your plastic card or smartphone to a machine and some numbers disappear from your account. Then maybe you don't check your account daily and then forget what stuff you bought and how high your expenses are. This is even worse due to online shopping because then the shopping is just a click, so you are even more likely to forget it. \n\nGermany still uses quite some cash, and I am glad I grew up when cashless payments were mostly a thing for big expenditures. I remember people looking at you weird if you paid with card in the supermarket for some groceries. But if you grow up in a completely cashless environment, I don't think you have such a good understanding of how much something is. You see this when you look at kids spending a fortune on microtransactions in video games.

            "The Bank of America became such a superpower in American banking because it was initially the Bank of Italy, and consisted of a single branch in San Francisco whose owner failed to deposit the day\u2019s takings one evening, and decided to keep the cash overnight and deposit the next day, which was the 18th of April, 1906. \n\nFor those who know their history, you\u2019ll recognise this as the date of the San Francisco earthquake, which caused buildings across the entire city to collapse and massive fires to burn. Many of those buildings were banks; so you had a bunch of banks unable to physically access their cash reserves because they were either buried under rubble, or were in buildings that were kind of on fire a little bit. \n\nThis allowed the Bank of Italy to corner the market as they had cash, and the owner, Amadeo P. Giannini, made a bunch of \u2018hand-shake\u2019 loans, which also helped the city recover that little bit faster. But thanks to that initial business, the bank grew and eventually became the Bank of America.\n\nMoral of the story: OP\u2019s right. Until we evolve (or devolve) into currency-less societies, we should always have some form of tangible legal tender to represent our imaginary points system of currency, because we never know what the universe is gonna throw at us, either as individuals, countries, or the entire planet.",
            "I suspect that the popularity/unpopularity of this stance will be heavily skewed by age.  As an older person who has had to up sticks for her self-protection, I happen to agree, not only for all the reasons OP mentions, but also due to the potential for *massive* privacy invasion and/or tracing by any organisation that has or can get (like most governments) access to the data trail.\n\nSure, it's very easy to use a credit or debit card, to conduct life online, and I do, on occasion, make use of those conveniences.  But I prefer using cash -- good old, anonymous cash -- for most purchases.  Also, when you stick to cash, you are far less likely to end up spending yourself into a deep hole.\n\nHowever, I understand that privacy concerns are *way* down the list for younger people who grew up in the social media space.

I used to be a friend with someone that basically did old animated commercial vvoices then did some great animated spots in some cartoons but nothing that made any big box office money but it just took two small spots in animated films with well known actors that he started getting more serious spots in other films and was recognized for his work alone more so than being the one with that great so and so. The thing is many times people will first be drawn to an animated film by if someone they know and like is in it. For example my parents would probably not have taken their kids or grandkids to like Toy Story just for the story line especially if it just said John Doe as BuZz and Doug Doe as Woody. My dad loved Tom Hanks way back then and said it has to be great because Tom Hanks is doing the voice for this one character we need to bring the grandkids. He loved a lot of the characters then looked up other people who played parts and looked up movies they did. I agree even for costs they don't need like even 70% of the cast be well known but even just a couple enough not just to attract people to check it out but as my friend spoke of a couple comedians he had worked with, it was great to also have that resource that could put in a word or give feedback.",

That's never going to happen.\n\nHonestly this whole post is kind of setting up a bunch of inaginary problems and then complaining about them.\n\nThere's more voice acting work now than at any time in the past and it's because adult animation is succeeding. Headline actors bring in *the money* which is used to, you know, pay those voice actors and to demonstrate that these projects were successful. Disney has been doing this for decades, did it destroy the animation industry? Of course not.\n\nWhat's happening is that *there's more work in animation*.\n\nLook at Arcane. Jinx was played by an A-level actress, most of the remaining actors weren't. She did a great job, but also drew attention to the film and looked great on red carpets and during interviews yadda yadda. Arcane's success was a landmark, I *guarantee you* more video game stories will see adaptation because of it.\n\nYou're just inventing a non-existent problem to justify complaining about having to imagine the actor when the character speaks.

You have fantastic actors that have been voicing iconic characters for a long time, this is because they actually have training in this department, like Mark Hamill.\n\nThe big issue is when studios go out their way to use famous actors with barely any voice acting ability to promote their movies. Disney and Pixar don't do this for example. This method of promoting a movie, specially when they keep mentioning that X actor will participate, just doesn't sell the idea well enough to me, it throws me off.",

            "Are you saying voice actors can't be famous?\n\nAnd why would you make a distinction between \"voice actors\" and other actors? In many cases today voice actors are actually filmed while doing the voices, and that video is then used by character animators as reference. Transforming your voice is often a case of transforming your whole physical being towards what you portray in the voice. Andy Serkins' Gollum is one of the obvious go to examples of the embodiment of this.\n\nCheck out the the youtube show Critical Role \"where a bunch of nerd-ass voice actors play dungeons and dragons\". You'll see that doing voices is far more than just making sounds with your mouth. See the difference in body language between the player's different characters in campaign 1-3. Not to mention the body language of the DM while doing all different NPCs.\n\nPersonally I think that you can't be a good voice actor unless you're also a good actor in general.\n\nSo I think that the problem you actually have is the casting of people who are shitty actors, but who gets the role because their name is a marketing strategy. I.e. it's not that they are famous that is the problem, it's that they are not really famous for their acting skills... And in this group I'm savagely including the people who are famous for \"being in movies\".",

When the dance floor is packed, lights are trippy, and the song is hitting,  the crowd starts to move in unison. Everyone\u2019s got their own erratic dance moves but the beat syncs everyone together.

It\u2019s totally fine to not like going to the club, but not liking going to the club and thinking people who go clubbing are shallow and pretentious are two different opinions. It seems to me that OP looks down on club goers because \u201cwhat they do is shallow and what I like to do is deep, so I\u2019m better\u201d.\n\nSide note: I can understand if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s your thing but if you decided it\u2019s not fun before you go out to do it you\u2019re never gonna enjoy it. You gotta be open and let go of yourself to the experience sometimes. Intimate conversations is real life and real life gets exhausting.

Shrimp, in moderation is okay...much like scotch or Heroin...Just kidding.  Never tried heroin, and just had tuna forced on me as a kid.  I imagine the results on me would be close to identical.

I nearly threw up after the first bite.  That was all I ate.  The rest was tepid water for nearly an hour while my friends enjoyed their meals.  Since then, I've had friends who love crab (even fake store-bought crab) and Lobster.  The one time I had lobster was on a trip to Japan, during a family dinner and I hated it.  Strangely, Salmon, salted and peppered, and served with Arbiora rice was an excellent meal even though I didn't like fish.  \n\nI still don't like fish and I stand in solidarity with you.  But later, traveling to China, they served us Eel or some sort of snake.  Later they served us what I can only assume was dog.  Both were well cooked and served in a nice tasting sauce.  When the waiters brought out the (I want to assume) eel, they stood watching to see if anyone ate it.  It tasted more similar to beef than chicken.  I was the only one of the 10 of us who ate it.  I learned a lot about food while in China, Japan, France, and throughout Europe (Belgium being the best)...no shellfish there, but the main dish of a 7 course meal was...wait for it...Pidgeon, and it was amazing.

A small percentage of them know that they have it. An even smaller percentage are actively seeking help for it, whether it be through prescription drugs or therapy/behavioral methods.

        "selftext": "There is a kind of post I see occasionally on subreddits like AITA, AITAH, relationshipadvice, etc. that fits this basic structure:Man finds out the mother of his child/children cheated on him around the time their child was conceived, gets or wants a DNA test to find out if child is biologically his, finds out they are not, and leaves that family. There are variations of this but that's the basic premise.Every. Single. Time. that man is torn apart in the comments, saying that blood does not matter, the child is not at fault, how on earth could he leave them etc.Frankly, I think this is nonsense, through and through. The narrative of these comments always focuses on the man being horrible for leaving and that the child is his because of the time they spent together and not that he was a victim of a lying spouse that deceived him for years.  And for a relevant bit of background, I was adopted as a child and I absolutely believe blood/genetics do not matter in making a family at all. But the big thing there is that for my parents, there was a choice. They made the informed decision that they would accept my as their child, it was not forced on them.Now don't get me wrong, I don't think the men in these examples are saints at all, but so often they are accused of never even caring for the kid(s) and that they must be terrible for being so ruthless. What never gets mentioned, or is at least glossed over, is that the man in question just had his whole life upended by finding out that his partner in life cheated and deceived him for possibly years on end and his life is going to be turmoil. And if this occurs in the US at least, the man is still going to be on the hook for child support even with the proof the kid is not his, meaning he doesn't even get to go restart his life if he wants to, but instead is tied to the situation where he was the victim.You can hope that the man's love for the child might break through that, but it's unfair to attack him because he isn't strong enough to overcome what was done to him. To him, that child will be the living embodiment of the mother's deception and cruelty and to ridicule someone for not wanting that to be part of their life is absurd.Lastly, for the people who say something like \"I could never leave my child/I wouldn't do that!\"... well good for you, but it's easy to say that sort of thing, and even if its true, that doesn't mean someone who can't handle that sort of thing is a monster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: You know someone is mad when they report you to RedditCareResources... Thank you for what I am sure is completely sincere concern, but I'm doing great.",

            "Fully agree. \n\nLying about a child\u2019s father is so spiteful and fraudulent. \n\nNot only did their partner cheat but they continuously deceived their partner after. \n\nHowever, I do feel very sorry for the innocent child.",
            "My ex wife got pregnant a year into our marriage. I found out that the child wasn\u2019t mine when he was seven.\n\nI immediately filed for divorce but offered to be a part of the child\u2019s life. She absolutely refused but still tried to get CS from me claiming that I had accepted *de facto* fatherhood and was responsible for his care.\n\nJudge laughed her out of the courtroom.\n\nI talk to the kid every now and then but there\u2019s no father-son dynamic.",
            "it's important to understand that in this kind of scenario, there are three victims of the mothers lies.\n\nThere's the \"not the father\" who has been cheated on, lied to, and defrauded into raising someone else's child.    \n\nThere's the child, who has been placed into the middle of this situation, and denied the right to know his actual father and family.    \n\nAnd the actual father is being denied his own child.\n\nthe amount of pathologically selfish behavior displayed in this situation is stunning, yet society blames the defrauded fathers, not the mother.",
            "\"But the child needs a father.\"   \n\n\nThat child has a father and the mother knows who he is. Imagine the hurt knowing that your wife cheated on you and then kept up another huge lie for as many years as the child is alive. That's a mad level of deception there.",
            "\"But the big thing there is that for my parents, there was a choice. They made the informed decision that they would accept my as their child, it was not forced on them\"\n\nTHISSSS. Its not fully about blood, its about the informed decision",

            "It's disgusting that people are comparing this to adopting kids. Adopting kids is wonderful. I think it's one of the best things anyone can do in this world. Guess what? PEOPLE DO IT WILLINGLY. If someone fucks your partner and you find out about it many years later it's one of the worst things someone can hear. If you find out the kid that your raised all these years is HIS KID not even yours, it's a thousand times worse. If a women got raped and was forced to raise that child by the government or her family, despite her wanting to abort it or get rid of it, 5 years later, she finally gets free and she can do that. Are you going to force her to keep it? No one would.",
            "I'm a women and this shouldn't be an unpopular opinion. She cheated and lied for years. I'd want nothing to do with that situation either. \n\nFunny story, but my husband's parents both have dark hair and dark eyes. And he also has dark hair and dark eyes and so does his sister. But after them his mom had twins that are both blonde and have blue eyes. And right after they were born his mom was very shocked and told her husband, \"if you want to do a paternity test, I won't even be mad.\" Lmao. But his dad's grandfather was super blonde and he has a lot of blonde relatives. ANYWAYS, that always made me laugh.",
            "Agree. Blood, trust, and honesty all matter a lot.",
            "Not only should the father be free and clear to leave without hassle, he should be free to divorce the mother without any financial obligations and be free to sue the mother for fraud, child related expenses, mental anguish, and a myriad of other counts. She obviously would've had no qualms about enslaving him to her financially with her lies and deceptions regardless of how it destroyed his quality of life, so he should get to nail her to the cross financially regardless of how it affects her.",
            "I think it\u2019s fine for a man to leave if they find out the kids aren\u2019t his. You are not under any obligation to raise some else\u2019s kid. If you want to leave, leave. Anyone that says otherwise is fine to step in and pay for all that shit.",
            "There should be a paternity test for every birth and that should be straightened out from the start.",
            "I guess the solution to paternity is to  automatically have DNA testing done at child\u2019s birth. Remove all doubt.",
            "Personally I think mandatory dna tests at birth before signing the birth certificate is the best option\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly unfair to say it\u2019s shitty to abandon an innocent child you have raised\n\nBut I also don\u2019t think men should have to raise children that aren\u2019t theirs\n\nThe perfect solution would then be to do the test before the raising so the child doesn\u2019t internalize the blame",
            "I have a child. Raising kids is expensive, time consuming and stressful. If I found out that the child I had spend all that effort on was not mine I would feel so incredibly betrayed. Someone had made the decision to become a parent for me. It\u2019s like paying a mortgage and finding out the house is not in your name.",
            "I do think the age of the child matters a lot. Finds out at birth is very different from walking away from a 16 year old. My kids are adults, and if it came out that there was a switched a birth thing and they were not genetically mine, they would still 100% be my kids.",
            "This is one of those things where I can *never* experience it, as I\u2019m not a man. So I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like to not know if a child is mine, and can\u2019t imagine being in that situation because it could literally never happen to me. \n\nSo, I stay in my lane.",

            "[deleted]",
            "I think a lot of people just totally discount how it emotionally destroys men. It\u2019s years of lying while hiding the cheating that resulted in the child. No one expects a woman to take in and raise her husband\u2019s affair child because it would be too traumatizing. So how can they not see it\u2019s just as traumatizing for a man?",
            "I agree.  In this situation, it's the woman who is at fault, not the man. She knew she slept with other men, and so, (no moral judgment on sleeping with different people) but even so she should have said, let's get a DNA test.  I also don't blame or judge people who want their own biological child and don't wish to parent someone else's.",
            "It's terrible for the cheated on partner no question. And if the child were under a certain age it is probably wiser to leave the situation. But at a certain point you've got to accept that leaving a kid that knows you as the father, is abandoning that kid. And abandonment will destroy a child. If that sounds like an awful thing to do to a child it's because it is. \n\nLike people would think it fucked to abandon a dog.  Imagine abandoning a child? \n\nAnd all of this is definitely a consequence of the woman that cheated. But there's consequences to the action of leaving too. If the guy doesn't like those consequences-being called out for it, then they shouldn't do it.",
            "Women\u2019s opinions on this topic are entirely invalid for the same reason that men\u2019s opinions on abortion are invalid.",
            "I like think I'd keep in touch with the kid if I'd had a hand in raising them long enough for a bond to form, while avoiding/shunning the mother as much as possible. But I've never been in this situation (or had kids in general), so I can only speculate and pray I never have to find out",
            "Paternity tests should be automatic at birth.  Faithful wives would welcome third party validation of their fidelity and cheating whores will object.",
            "From what I can tell this is mostly an American culture thing which is backed up by their laws. \n\nAmerica don't give a fuck about paternity and their laws actually support paternity fraud instead of punishing it. If your name is on the birth certificate tough shit. If you leave you're still paying child support for another man's kid. \n\nIt's extremely misandrist to be honest and anyone criticising the guy is victim blaming and shaming. The fault is 100% the mothers.\n\nPaternity tests should be mandatory. If people have privacy concerns they could easily make it law to destroy the data and/or not pass it on for any other use. Not even just for this either.. like what happens if the real dad has some nasty inheritary disease or some shit.",

I have only ever spoken to my biological dad once, which was how I found out I was even his... as part of some 'I 'm getting old and wanna make peace with my sins' shit... I told him to go thoroughly fuck himself and ask forgiveness from whatever mythology he's desperate to be real right now.\n\nI can't say that I'd be as good a man as my father was, to love me unconditionally as if I were his own.\n\n\nI just think that, to do so, makes a better man than those who can't. \n\n(Circumstances obviously matter, don't come at me with what-aboutisms)",

Even if he stayed, news like that doesn't just go away, it sits in the back of his mind, effecting everything in relation to both the child and other parent.",
            "I actually haven't seen someone get criticized for doing this, even though I wouldn't put some people past it. Because why tf would I stick around after you cheated on me and had another man's kid? This is a sickness.",
            "It\u2019s funny because Reddit hates men who have been lied to and cheated on and he deserves to be a slave in that life.\n\nBut the man who nutted inside a married woman multiple times? \n\nNowhere to be found and not vilified.

            "I would probably stick around but start a process of distancing. I would be *brutally* honest with the child and express to them that neither of us chose this. I would also provide the option of sticking around in their life, but to a much lesser extent\u2026 like *hey if you ever want to get lunch and talk about how life\u2019s going for you, give me a call.* But the parent-child relationship would have to be pared down. The emotional trauma would take years of therapy to repair, and it\u2019s a big ask for someone to just keep on keeping on if you have even an ounce of empathy. If you don\u2019t, well, fuck you and your opinion.",
            "I honestly find it bizarre. You could/should, of course, hate and dump your partner for the cheating and the lying. But how can you erase your feelings for your kid? If you are able to dump your kids, you couldn't have really loved them when you thought they were yours. And what kind of psycho doesn't love their kids?? \n\n\nIf somebody told me my 3yo. is not mine (I'm the mum, so maybe they made a mistake at the hospital)... I wouldn't give her up for anything in the world. I wouldn't care if my genetic daughter was out there being somebody else's daughter. My daughter is this tiny person asleep next to me. The same person I have been loving with all my heart for the last 3 years.",

The child has a biological father with whom they may want a relationship with.\nSecondly, the women in these situations need to be charged with crimes.  Sure you can't charge them for the lie itself but she is taking money on false pretenses.  Alright thief.\nLastly, some seem to think the non bio father should stay  with the child and that's fine but the lying cheating whore needs to leave.",

Being angry at the man is an avoidance of accountability then turning to blame shifting. It reminds me of the acronym DARVO which is used by clinicians.",
            "Paternity tests should be mandatory FOR ALL BABIES! \n\nThis will stop any and all future problems. \n\nA man shouldn\u2019t have to raise a child he\u2019s been duped into thinking was his.",
            "Thank you for posting this!  It makes my fucking blood boil at the lengths people will go to make the man the a**hole!  Like the mom knew and deceived everyone for fucks sake.  If the man had known at the time of the birth or if he was told about the cheating beforehand, then it probably wouldn't be years into the childs life before he bails.  To also think that it doesn't hurt the man in this situation is also crazy.  Him walking away is better than all the possible years of mental anguish the strain of maintaining  relationship built on a betrayal.   The women in these cases should be forced to pay back all support given by the betrayed partner.  This is why DNA tests should be mandatory at birth!\n\nJust imagine if a man somehow used his wife as a surrogate for him and his girlfriend, and when it came out years later that she wasn't the bio mom.  No one would be trying to shame her for walking away !",

I'm of mixed feelings, mostly what the emotional impact on a child will be. some might welcome it. others may well have their world destroyed. but I'm not going to get annoyed at a guy if they walk out. at the very least I'd sleep in another room and not touch mommy again",

Every time I said 'I love you\", before I tucked you in? Lies, since I didn't know you weren't biologically mine. My love is conditional.

But it could result in many, many problems, and so they do regret it. STDs; how they are viewed; finding a partner; self-image issues or self-worth issues, etc.; and more.

Is it going out on the weekends and having a few drinks, or is it getting shitfaced every single night? \n\nAnd the ones who do get married usually have positive behaviors that lead to that, like focusing on forming relationships in addition to enjoying sex. I've known a few like that, I've also known a few that pretty much used people and treated anyone that wasn't constantly trying to make them happy like dirt. Spoiler alert, they didn't end up married. Which is fine if that's what they want, but that's usually not what they want. They ended up frustrated that they were middle-aged and not even in a long-term relationship, much less married and working towards a family. Like it never occurred to them that building relationships takes work and they couldn't just flip on a switch when they decided it was time to settle down.",
            "Agreed I think it we should still be worried though. STD and SA are pretty big problems and those behaviors see increased occurance in those. Also its probably just men being jealous.

She was 40, stuck with teens as a single mom, had addictions, never really matured or grew up, and failed to gain the respect of anyone or contribute anything to the world. She didn't know how to be an adult and eventually she was fired.",
            "As a 44 year-old woman. My baddie days were not posted on social media. And I don\u2019t have to regret them.\n\nI once went to an all-night party, which could be heard from 3 to 5 miles away.\n\nThis happened in a leafy suburb of London. Somebody decided to take the toilet apart. The damn thing leaked and short water out, and it dripped through the ceiling to downstairs. \n\nIt started off as a barbecue, I bought a load of meat round that was yellow stickers and reduced to 5p. My friend was pleased and said i \u201csaved her barbecue \u201c. The men decided they were going to do the primal thing and cook over an open flame.\n\nI had to walk down to the petrol station to get more charcoal with some people who were clearly stoned. \n\nWe put jacket potatoes in the oven and forgot about them and come 2 o\u2019clock in the morning we were walking around the tray of jacket potatoes.\n\nSome people tried to crash the party and got beaten up. Someone semi famous joined the party for a few hours. (I don\u2019t know who but they were with an indie band).\n\nNone of this was posted on social media. No one knows the brilliance and energy of this party that happened in the late 1990s on a bank holiday weekend. \n\n\nNow everything is posted on social media. Which means your kids and your grandkids can actually look up your baddie days. And judge you  on it. You can\u2019t sugar coat it. You can\u2019t wash over it. If there exists a picture /video of you puking up and collapsing then it\u2019s there forever!",

And overall being careless with the feelings of others and my own health. \n\nThere are also tradeoffs of every choice. With age and time away from that lifestyle I realized how empty it can feel.

            "TLDR: You've cherry picked your data and grossly oversimplified the situation in order to draw conclusions that are either not relevant to the information we have, or are not representative of the human experience.\n\n\n\nYeah, I don't know that your specific experience has anything to do with the average experience. \n\nI assume most people who regret their baddie days aren't saying, \"Damn I regret my baddie days.\" More likely they'll lament the consequences of that behavior, rather than the behavior itself. \n\nYou'll never hear someone say, \"I regret that I was a baddie for 7 years and all I did was sleep around and party and not improve myself.\" It's much more likely you'll hear them say, \"Man I wish I had focused more in college.\" Or, \"I should have spent more time with my family.\" \n\nYour lack of experience with people not explicitly stating that they regret that period of their life does not mean that they don't, it simply means they're reporting what most humans do, the consequence. \n\nAlso, another huge hole in your argument is that it doesn't recognize different levels of positive outcomes. Youre points are all black and white, good and bad. I'm not saying we should prevent anyone from making a decision that makes them happy or feels good, but we can all recognize that someone doesn't have to regret their life choices while also appreciating they would've been in a much better position had they invested in themselves when they were younger. Should we not be pushing young women towards self-improvement, even if it means their life will be more stable and fulfilling in the long run, the same pressures we put on men? I imagine if we didn't women would complain they weren't given the same opportunities because they were allowed to just run amock in their 20s. \n\nAlso, while they're in those \"baddie years\" who's paying for them to be baddies all the time? Who's bankrolling the partying, the drugs, the alcohol? Most likely it's a dude who thinks you're hot. So even when you're a strong independent woman you're still reliant on men to make that lifestyle possible.\n\nThis isn't even fiction. Bars and clubs have known about this and have been reliant on it as part of their business model for decades. That's why chicks get in free. It's good for business, and it attracts men, and men are willing to buy women A LOT of drinks.\n\nIt's not that anyone is saying you can't do these things and be happy. They're saying you're much more likely to find stability and success if you avoid them. The regret doesn't come from some arbitrary morality; it comes from tangible consequence. You simply don't spend time with people who experienced those consequences. Go donate time at a soup kitchen and ask some people there how they spent their 20s and you'll get the full picture, not just the perspectives of your financially stable friends.\n\nEDIT: I regret wasting my time typing all of this. You don't want to engage in a discussion about this topic, this is your pathetic attempt at justifying your own behavior to yourself. Grow up. You're 40 years old and are an alcoholic who has no relationship experience and can't handle the pressures of adult dating.

They tend to feel used as a glorified masturbatory aid, and they're 100% correct. Just because some women don't feel that/are dulled to that reality doesn't change the reality. It also makes it difficult to find a real partner later down the line. The sorts of people who value long commitment and real love will be largely repulsed by the sort of person who was/is comfortable with screwing any random stranger. This is what leads to the much lower happiness rates among women when compared to men."

Go watch \"Meru\" by Jimmy Chin.

At the start of the climbing season, sherpas have to make the climb and prepare the infrastructure.\n\nFor example, there's a gap in the trail that needs a bridge to cross, but they need someone on the other side to set up the bridge. So they tie two ladders together with some rope, drop it across the gap, and have a guy traverse a rickety ladder that isn't secured at all, so they get to the other side and help set up the bridge. It's super fucking dangerous.\n\nThen when the tourists show up it gets worse. Most people who boast that they climbed Everest did about 5% of the work involved. The sherpas carry all the important equipment, over 100 lbs worth, ahead for the tourist, set up camp, make the food, and overall do literally everything for their tourist except actually carry them. These tourists aren't actually overcoming the challenge of climbing the world's tallest mountain, they're on an amusement park ride, a guided tour with plenty of photo ops while employees do the real work of making it happen.",

They do it as part of their regular work guiding on the mountain and get paid for the waste they remove. There are also several charity programmes run by foreign climbers who collect money to fund clean-up climbs most years. The real problem is, to me, the bodies. Chomolungma/Sagarm\u0101th\u0101 is a sacred mountain to both the indigenous peoples who live near it in Nepal and Tibet. The garbage is bad enough on a sacred mountain but the people involved are working on that. The real defilement religiously/culturally speaking are the bodies that are left on the mountain. Recovery is almost impossible for almost all of them and the current solution (moving them into a crevasse or down an inaccessible face of the mountain) still obviously leaves the bodies where they shouldn\u2019t be. \n\nBut the people who this really matters to, the people for whom the mountain is their mother goddess, have decided that the current solution is the best one because most of them now rely on the mountain for their livelihood. Climbing has almost completely transformed the Nepalese mountain peoples\u2019 economy. This is their choice and this is what they decided. A bit of a Hobson\u2019s Choice scenario because climbing has essentially obliterated their other options for earning a living, but it\u2019s their choice nonetheless.",

Should be more strict on who actually gets to climb, and should take steps to stop sensationalizing it just because of its height too.

Whether the excuse is poor time management skills or procrastination, ultimately what you are saying to other people that wait is \"hey, you'RE time doesn't mean that much\".  \n\n   Some people tolerate this with sayings like \"Well that is just him/her\", or \"It's in their nature\" and quite frankly those people are equally as irresponsible as the former mentioned.\n\n(This is my personal opinion, maybe it has been mentioned here before and I think it's unpopular due to me constantly seeing this throughout life without being addressed as an issue)\n\nEDIT:\nHi guys, thank you all for joining in the discussion, i would like to comment on and apologize for some things:\n   I was a bit short-spoken on the whole thing. To clarify my thoughts: being *habitually* (big thanks to the +200 comments pointing that out, as well as the \"you're\" mistake) late means over 30-n/a minutes on most occasions, of course I do not expect everyone being punctual constantly, nobody is.\n   I am sorry for not including any mental/physical difficulties as an \"adequate excuse\" (ADHD/IBS/EFD/OCD etc.) and did not mean to sound ableist, hope i did not ruin many of your days with this and i have nothing against neurodivergent people (Still, big shout-out to the few ADHD/other comments striving to be punctual even though it's difficult, i have nothing but respect for you).\n  Secondary: Having kids/Overworking/Traffic/Weather/other miscalculations are also, of course, a proper excuse. Culture (as a lot of you pointed out) is also very common and i have an opposite personal example: I studied Cooking and got sucked in the whole Kitchen Culture in which being late/calling out is considered unprofessional and immature. And uncounsciously i became punctual with my everyday life (and thus manage it better).Culture is a double-edged sword, it gives and takes.\n\n\n   Bearing all of this in mind i still hold my initial stance: If you have no diagnosis on a mental/physical issue or some of the secondary problems mentioned above that we all experience in day-to-day life, if you're constantly late because you genuinely don't care about other people's time or just do it for the sake of being late? Then you a mental midget.\n(Answer for the people saying to just drop out the person/people and get on with life: good luck when it's a Relative/sibling/childhood friend, Detachment is petty and you're in a check-mate)\n...wow, this really is for r/rant",

I get out, knock on the door, no answer. So I call her and she tells me \"yeah, I'm still at the store, but I'm coming back now\". Right then, something in me just snapped.

I'd get to the airport earlier than necessary, get the the client site earlier than necessary, etc.\n\nEventually this evolved into a very \"no rush\" lifestyle.  My co-workers would fly back home on Friday evening and be in a hurry to get everything done so they could be on time...I'd fly out Saturday mid-morning so I didn't have to rush.  And that's how I roll across the board...weekday alarm goes off way earlier than I need so I can leisurely get out of bed, I leave for appointments far in advance of need so I can chill, etc.  I keep my phone full of music, earbuds charged, kindle in the backpack, etc - all so I've got something to do if I get to the event too early.\n\nAnd I adore it.

            "The issue with biological Web is it's hard to write him into a negative situation if he doesn't have any kind of limit to what he can do. The web shooters kind of put him on a time limit and mean that he can't just fight infinitely. it just makes for more interesting action choreography if there are times when he becomes limited and unable to use one of his abilities.",
            "They were definitely going to go that route, but the entire world collectively made a cum joke so they changed it",
            "One thing I like about bio web shooters is that spider man doesn't need to be a super genius for the web shooting ability.\n\nMaybe it's just a oversaturation of super-geniusses in the MCU",

Also, it's essential to a good deal of Spider-Man plots that the web canisters can run out, get jammed or be damaged.   \n\nThose movies really weren't that good, especially the crap where Doc Octopus is a good guy and one of Peter's mentors before he becomes a villain. That was fucking stupid, having every villain being somebody that knew Peter previously.",

            "Except most spiders don\u2019t produce webs thus no, it\u2019s not the most important ability biologically.  Not to mention that if you wanted it to be biologically accurate, he would have to shoot the webs from his ass.",
            "I am so glad to see someone else with this opinion",
            "I mean, I think him having to actually use an engineering degree to become a superhero, is more interesting than just magically, gifted Powers by a spider.\n\nSome of us prefer multi layered storytelling over, always getting the easy option . Besides, Spider-Man is easily the most fucked with superhero ever.",

            "Well I always loved the drama resort ofnthe canisters runnin low on web, malfunctioning, etc. for me it always adds a suspense element that is a nice touch making Spdey vulnerable, and also the brainy aspect of him being a messy genius strugglin with everyday life, then Raimi came along, and I said yes, cool, but shoula been from his butt tho.",
            "I like the webcanisters. He build different ones like stun web, invisible, extra strength, sound webs, etc.",

            "Yeah always preferred the webs being organic. Just cooler that way, plus it allows Peter to be more relatable since he's not building freakin' high tech shit in his bedroom.",
            "\"it ain't that kind of movie, kid\"\n\nSpiderman has always been a battle of \"good vs evil\" through the lens of technological advancement. Nearly all of the Spiderman villains were created by, or use some sort of advanced technology for evil. Peter is just the flip side of that. Sure he has super human abilities, but they are given to him through science and technology, as well as the tech he made for himself. The thesis of the comics have always been the morality of using scientific advancements.",
            "The Web shooters are a testament to his intellect. Peter built his powers as much as he inherited them from a radioactive spider.",
            "Sadly, looking at the responses, I don't think your opinion is that unpopular. To me, having him make his own shooters was part of what made him a better superhero. Because he was smart in a crafty  way, that made him punch above his weight.",
            "Well thecthing is, even if it makes sense for him to make web it makes zero sense for it to come out of his wrists.",
            "three reasons I like the web cartridges:\n\n1) it's how he was originally. no need to change what Lee and Ditko came up with back then. heck, it's actually astonishing because back then they wouldn't have realized how good of a crutch \"oh no, I'm out of web catridges!\" would've been for future writers that sometimes needed him to not be able to shoot webs.\n\n2) the \"web block\" thing in Riami's trilogy was kind of dumb? wasn't his only power that just stopped working, but still. when your powers stop working there has to be a good reason.\n\n3) if it's biological webs, then they have to be stored somewhere. for Riami's Spider-man (and Spidey 2099 IIRC) it's web generating sacs in the forearms. Spidey as-is can go to the hospital and get X-rays: maybe getting blood drawn isn't the best idea, but he can go get a broken arm fixed. Riami's Spider-man would have to explain why he has websacs in his forearms and a little hole in his wrist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnot saying they can't do the \"oh no out of webbing\" trick without it being cartridges, it's just easier to do that way and doesn't lead to comic nerds being like \"how come in issue #461 he was able to use so much webbing but in issue #190 he ran out after doing X\"",
            "I never understood why people were so weird about that change. He's *Spider*\\-Man - it makes sense to me that he'd have literally **\\*the\\*** ability that people associate with spiders.",
            "Except that it was established canon LONG before Sam Raimi even got his first case of morning wood. Peter Parker, as a brilliant young student, made his web shooters. Seriously, Raimi was 3 when Spider Man came out. It was already established by that point, regardless of whether or not it makes sense.",
            "I have always shared this exact sentiment. Kid gets bit by a magic spider and gains the power to\u2026\u2026 climb on the wall? Coooooool\u2026.",
            "After growing up on the Raimi movies I remember watching Spiderman: Homecoming in theatres and being appalled that Spiderman had to make his own web-fluid. After the movie me and my friends all agreed it was stupid and that Spiderman should produce his own webs from his body, it was way cooler.",
            "Yes, thank you! The whole point of Spider-Man is that he's radioactive, so give him weird biological webs! Web shooters are fine, but for a character who specifically was bit by a radioactive spider and not just some guy who augmented himself to be like a spider, I feel like biological spider bits are cooler.",
            "Glad to see that i'm not the only one that finds the Mechanical Webs to be stupid, not only does it not make sense that he somehow doesn't get a Spider's coolest ability but also he's poor and somehow can build these canisters and keep on buying more webs.",
            "If you want to make the argument that he should have biological webbing instead of mechanical because it makes more sense, then you also have to agree that Spider-Sense is a power he shouldn't have, since a sixth sense that detects incoming danger has nothing to do with spiders. He's not Spider-Man because he has Spider powers. He's Spider-Man because his powers came from a spider.",
            "I've always found the organic webs ultra-lame and gross, and I've always likes how the web-shooters are creates by Peter since he is a scientific genius, basically one of his Powers.",
            "Probably not unpopular opinion",
            "Why do you think there are different versions of the character?",
            "It's all good and fine until electro grabs his web and shocks him and he can't escape it. The webshoters are at least removable so he can survive and upgrade the webs. \n\nWith the wrist, you can't upgrade the quality of web to keep up with the villains. \n\nOriginally in comics they went for shooters because folks would be grossed out by webs shooting out of people. \n\nAnd then it raises questions about sex. If he expels web fluid, then it stands to reason it affects his semen/sperm too.",
            "Totally agree! And the Aquaman comparison is genius.",
            "It mainly upsets me because logically if I obtained sticking to walls and super strength, designing a web system wouldn't be my first thought. I don't know if he'd already designed the web system or not",
            "Also people love to use the argument that Peter Parker has mechanical webs because he\u2019s a genius but I say why have a character rely on their intelligence and gizmos just to make use of their powers? I think having a spider man with organic web shooters and not too many gizmos could showcase him being a jack of all trades since he\u2019s already smart in college so he clearly demonstrates his intelligence there I think having his powers not rely on technology illustrates that\u2019s he\u2019s both BRAINS and BRAWN.",
            "I agree with this 100%. I always thought Spider-Man having to use fake webbing was dumb.",
            "The point was to converge the ideas that he's a brilliant scientist in the making and has spider traits",
            "I agree. It always seemed crazy to me that the guy that happened to get bitten by a radioactive spider also happened to invent a web formula and web shooting device. What are the odds?!",
            "Wait, before the Toby movies Spider man used canisters to fire webs? Those movies were the first time?! Lol that is dumb.",
            "tom hollands spiderman isnt even a spiderman really. sure he has the strength-weight ratio and flexibility but nothing else about his character says spider. he uses a suit made by iron man thats aided by an AI system and has fake webs. doesnt fight like a spider either and by that i mean he doesnt crawl like garfield did in the amazing spiderman fight against the lizards",
            "I agree, OP.  What is one of the first things you think of when it comes to spiders?  Making a web.  So it stands to reason that anyone gaining the powers of a spider would get the ability to spin webs and since he wanted Peter to remain human, he can't be shooting webs out of his butt so the wrists make most sense.\n\nIt was a super smart, natural evolution done by the Raimi team in those films because it just makes so much sense.  Just like Batman using his cape to glide.  Does it make more sense for him to swing around on a rope like Spiderman or glide around LIKE A BAT?",
            "Yeah, I watched the first of the Tom Holland movies, and even as a non-fan of spiderman and comics in general, I felt offended by what they did to the character. The whole movie was horseshit, too.",
            "Yeah, I always liked the biological route on his web shooter. Though sometimes him \u2018running out\u2019 adds interesting tension to the story, but overall I much prefer the built-in web idea.",
            "Yeah, seeing Peter sling webs out his ass would have been much more in line with a real spider.",
            "It was a plot point to create drama in the story telling. Stan Lee said this multiple times. Spider-Man often runs out of web fluid during tense moments.",
            "I dunno man, he would have to essentially grow a new organ inside of his body to create and then excrete webs (and to do it forcefully like a projectile would likely hurt with how sensitive human skin is).\n\nThe biological web never made any sense to me, if anything it makes more sense that a guy who can stick to walls and jump insanely high would want to create a mode of travel that maximizes those abilities and that they would create the webbing to play into the spider man motif"

A slight change that I think would make the sport better would have been time limits like other sports and the snitch just being something still worth 150 but didn't end the game. Remove the seeker position and it's just something everyone keeps an eye out for but would probably rarely be caught",
            "People are pointing out solving the points issue but not OP's other point (described hilariously btw) that the snitch chase usually happens out of view of the spectators\n\nIn the 3rd film the snitch goes and hangs around in the fucking stratosphere lol",
            "I feel like if they made the points awarded less, like 50 maybe it would be okay, but 150 basically always wins the game and defeats the point of any of the other players lol",
            "The snitch shouldn't have points awarded. It should only end the game. \n\nThat would add strategy. You have to stop the other team from catching it if they are ahead in points and they do the same to you.",
            "I think it would work if the golden snitch was only like 30-50 points. If they don\u2019t time it right, your team could get the snitch and lose the game. Then it\u2019s still a team sport and you have to coordinate.",
            "Literally just had add a time limit or point limit and show us that a vast majority of games don't end with the snitch, like it's so slippery and hard to track down that only 5% or less of quidditch matches have one caught, would make Harry catching one super important and special",
            "I've always thought that this was a result of an old game being messed up by modern technology. The wizarding world is hundreds of years old, but they're still making new brooms with fasters speeds each year. I think it's entirely reasonable that the snitch being worth 150 points and the only way to end a game was quite balanced when all the brooms were less than half the current speed and games lasted hours and scored hundreds of points. \n\nThere was also that line about a Quidditch game that lasted months, when I read the books the first time I took that to indicate that maybe the short length of games we see in the books was a recent and weird thing. All the snitches are caught very fast in the books when you look at it that way.",

            "It would have been much, MUCH, better if there were two halves/periods in each game, and catching the snitch had resulted in X points **and** the end of each half. Then there would have been a point to the other players scoring goals, and you could have had more \"tension\" built into the game if the other team caught the snitch in the first half and had a huge lead going into the second, etc. Now there is basically no point to other goals, since catching the snitch gives so many points AND ends the game completely.",

            "There was fan theory that said that it is kinda stupid now because the brooms keep getting faster (a new nimbus getting released often), so it was basicaly impossible to get the snitch before, giving the other team time to even the points, thats why in the books it says that a game could last for days, the brooms were slower. Now you can catch it in like 30 minutes of game",
            "Quiddich as a whole is fucking dumb and I couldn't wait to be finished anytime it came up.",
            "I think it's weird how the seekers are basically playing a completely different game than the rest of the team, but due to how commonly the snitch is caught in the films and books, it seems like the actual game, is pointless. Why bother sending a whole team out if all that matters is who catches the golden snitch. \n\nIf the golden snitch didn't automatically win the game, and the seekers weren't only focusing on the seeker (like hookers in rugby, they're not on the sidelines hanging around waiting for a scrum, they are involved in the whole game) if the seekers were just the guys better trained and more likely to catch the snitch out of the team, but other players were also allowed to catch it but rarely would or would even bother (like a CB in football doesn't score from open play often) and the golden snitch wasn't caught so frequently, it could be an actually feesible game (atleast within a fantasy world where flying brooms exist)",

            "While I'll agree the execution in the book is awful, I do believe adding a high-value ball that is far more difficult to catch and control that is secondary (and, preferably, distracting to the core players) to the main game does make for some fun gameplay.\n\nIn your scenario, I'm imagining a ping pong ball that gets shot out of a T-shirt cannon and two dudes in those inflatable t-rex outfits have to invade the court to catch it for an extra 20 points. Doesn't win their team the game, but definitely makes it valuable strategically.\n\nWhat about baseball but every once in a while, after a pitch, an outfielder is given a water balloon. If that water balloon makes it safely back to the umpire, without breaking, before the inning is up/teams switch sides, that team gets a point.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the \"spirit\" of the snitch, but with a little more oomph to make sure Harry is the special boy.",
            "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but the snitch doesn\u2019t guarantee a win, technically.  Catching the snitch ends the game and awards 100 points to the team who\u2019s seeker catches it, but if the opposing team is at 120 points and your team has 10, catching the snitch guarantees a loss, does it not?",
            "If the point value of catching the snitch was a little bit lower I would say the game would be perfect",
            "Lol",
            "I have found quidditch to be very similar to boxing and MMA. The contestants focus on gaining points the standard, reliable way (i.e. outperform your opponent and score more points in each round). On top of that though, the chance of a TKO/KO allows either opponent to suddenly end the game and win. This is quite similar to catching the snitch. This adds a very exciting component to a match and is quite exciting to experience. I think an actual quidditch match would have quite a similar experience, especially if the team that had been behind was suddenly able to pull off a win.",
            "This post kills me. Not sure if i think its too unpopular as i also made the realization unless the team scored a huge amount of points prior to the golden snitch being caught it basically was auto win. But either way your parking lot frog thing gave me a good giggle",
            "It's an interesting rule that could work if the snitch wasnt worth so many points. Like, 30 points would be ok, it could and couldn't be a game changer, would add a lot of tension to the game.",
            "The fact that you can score literally 1 million times and the game still wouldn't be over until the snitch is caught has always made it a terrible sport to me. The entire game is meaningless except for catching the snitch, might as well just be a 1v1 race to catch it",
            "Everyone thinks this",
            "The game ending from catching the snitch is a good idea.  But it shouldn't award points.\n\nThe strategy changes from the snitch almost guaranteeing victory to whomever catches it, to instead stopping the team that is ahead from catching the snitch.",
            "In the supplemental Quidditch book it was mentioned that many matches go on for hours/days of continual play. 150 points isn't too big of a swing if the teams have been scoring nonstop.

It doesn\u2019t matter\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a little better once you realize it\u2019s not an instant win button but rather 150 points and each regular goal is 10 points. So in theory if the game is 170-10 then the other team gets the snitch they still lose, but that point margin is waaaaay too big. It should be like 50 points and the game is over. That would make it tighter for the regulars to play well and then even if your seeker has a line on the snitch if you\u2019re not at least within 5 goals/50 pts of the other teams score you might not want to catch the snitch at that point. \n\nBut yeah, 150 points is stupid, but at least it\u2019s better than an actual insta win button? But functionally that\u2019s what it is.",

            "Catching the Snitch **does not** automatically result in a victory for whoever catches it. The rules for the game, as outlined in the books, is that catching the Snitch ends the game and gives 150 points to the team who caught it; it's entirely possible to catch the Snitch and still lose if your team is that far behind in points.\n\n\nPerhaps people should make sure they actually *understand the fictional thing they're bitching about* before bitching about it.",

            "That's not an unpopularopinion by any means, most HP fans agree that this is a dumb deus ex machina.\n\nIts ok if they want to have a snitch system but don't have it grant an insane 150 points (piint equivalent of 15 goals) AND end the match wtf\n\nOr at least if its going to end the match have it be worth less like idk 20 or 30 points at most, its enough to turn the tide making it worth 2-3 goals but its not such an overwhelming difference that if the opposing team plays well, they still lose automatically.",
            "Quidditch is a sport meant to value both teamwork and individual excellence. \n\nMost team-based sports like basketball can be individualistic sometimes due to the excellence of a few players.

            "I agree! like there is almost no point in the rest of the team with the snitch! the only point to the other players is to get 150 points ahead, and if the enemy team is over 150 points ahead, then the catcher become useless, because if he catches the snitch the other team will win! also its P2W and overall a shitty sport. Also I kinda get r/popularopinion vibes here.",

            "The majority of unpopular opinions on here aren\u2019t even unpopular. Its just no one has ever thought of them before.",
            "The snitch is only worth 30 points, not 150. There's significant Strategy that goes into catching it at the right time. First you gotta find it, then you gotta know the score, and then you gotta catch it before the score changes.\n\nOr, you force the other seeker to catch it at the wrong time.",
            "It was written by a woman, what do you expect?",
            "But you don't get it! The golden snitch is an allegory to being trans because it's golden and special and different! Harry catching it is the equivalent of a random person catching a drag queen reading a book on equality at a library while all the other cops are outside stopping a BLM parade ... and therefore winning The Game. \n\n/s",
            "The Golden Snitch is charmed to stay within the court's boundaries, no parking lot frogs for you. Also Seekers tend to stay high and keep out for the Snitch rather than flying around (lest they get Bludgeoned) so when they dive for the Snitch I assume it's super exciting.",
            "Its not for the win\u2026\u2026 omg you cant even get something that simple right",

            "You're whining about a competitive aspect for a sport that is entirely scripted.  You aren't having an opinion, you are having a fantasy.",
            "Quidditch doesn\u2019t keep track of wins and losses though. The championship team is the one that has the highest cumulative points in the end, so every snitch caught and every quaffle scored counts.  In the third book, Gryffindoor could only win the cup if they beat Slytherin in the last game by 210 points (cause Slytherin had scored 200 points more than them in the entire season). You can definitely argue that the seeker is the high profile athlete like a pitcher or striker or quarterback, but the rest of the team still counts. \n\nAlso your analogy of the catching the frog in the parking lot is flawed cause the spectators can watch the seekers along with the other players."

Letting them walk around where you sleep is disgusting, no matter how often you clean the sheets, and letting them walk on counters and tables is extremely unsanitary at best. \n\nI've had cats my whole life, still do, and they have never been allowed in my bed, and I close the door to the room when I sleep. They never jump on tables and counters because I've trained them not to, and I've never had a problem doing so.\n\nSince people keep acting like it's absolutely impossible to train or condition cats, despite the fact that it very much is possible and you look silly, here's how to do it:\n\nStarting young is best, obviously. Start by putting tin foil, and if that doesn't work use sticky tape, on your counters. They'll hate being up there. This way you're training them to not like the action of jumping up there, instead of the fact that they get disciplined. If you're only conditioning them with discipline they'll only learn that it upsets you, not that they shouldn't do it. A lot of people have said some variation of \"they just don't get up there while you're looking\" because they don't understand WHY my cats don't go up on my counters. They don't go up there because THEY don't want to, not because it makes me mad. Also, if you ever do have to scold or discipline your cats, make sure you do it right after the action, and please don't apologize to them afterwards. When I do have to scold my one cat for something he then tries to rub up against my leg, and I avoid letting him do so by moving my legs out of the way when he tries. He's not trying to apologize when he does this, he's trying to smooth things over, you need to show your cat it's not ok by not letting them do that. \n\nEdit: It's always hilarious to me that this opinion upsets people to such a degree that they post angry comments. Do whatever you want with your cats as long as you're not harming them. That's your business.\n\nEdit 2: People calling me cruel for not letting my cats sleep in my bed look, and are, ridiculous.\n\nEdit 3: People train tigers to jump through flaming hoops but seemingly 99% of you think it's inconceivable that you would be able to keep your 9 pound housecat off the countertops? Guys, you're just lazy and haven't even tried to train them, and that's ok, but get a grip.",

They are allowed on the couches though. There's no malice in these rules, just common sense and a desire to keep breathing. Also, no humans are allowed in my bed in anything other than clean clothes (or no clothes) and having been freshly showered. I don't understand how people can sleep in filth.\n\nEdit: No dogs in the bedroom or on the bed either.",

I've trained one of my cats to enthusiastically accept an inhaler. My cats respond to their names and will fetch specific toys when I ask for them. But counters? Meh. I mentioned in another comment about I previously had two cats I tried to train to stay off the countertops -- one learned to not get caught, and the other learned to like getting sprayed with water. With my current bunch, really, only one of my cats gets on the countertop because she's the only one that cares to do so.

If it\u2019s anywhere uncovered, you\u2019re brushing your teeth with fecal matter. \n\nLack of simple dusting practices could be considered disgusting. Wearing your shoes from outside inside.

        "selftext": "I see a lot of people talkong about how kids don't play outside like they used to, or how they're spoiled on their phones, making posts like \"What did people do all day without the internet?\" People treat that as if outside is somehow now a foreign concept to younger generations, and often the blame is put on phones phones phones, the big evil cellphone. \n\nNow for context, I'm 21, and I grew up in the midwest, so I didn't have a smartphome until like 14 years old, and it was barely even a smartphone. Now, I personally think that blaming phones for the issue of less kids outside is just plain ignorant. I have two completely separate reasons for believing this.\n\nThe first being, the way I grew up. I grew up throughout the 2000s amd 2010s, the era most point to as \"the last time kids went outside and weren't distracted by those dang phones\". Now, I didn't have a phone for a very long time. But I did have movies, a PS2, and the internet. I have very fond memories of all these things, but I also know that among these things, I constantly went outside with friends. These were good distractions too, YouTube, and Newgrounds content. Still, we went outside a lot, and had to knock on eachother's doors to see who was available. \n\nThe second reason is that people assume kids don't want to go outside. Personally, I see kids playing outside in my neighborhood all the time.. well, when it's not 105\u00b0F outside. Not even just in my neighborhood, I see kids and teenagers walking, biking, or skating all around here when I'm driving. People assume phones are some evil thing that's killing outside, but kids are drawn to the outside still. Outside has just become infinitely more uncomfortable, mean, and dangerous since I was a kid. So I don't blame them for staying inside a little, especially when they have the convenience to just text their friends to see who's available right off the bat, saving them a trip. \n\nSide note: I'm not trying to gloss over the addictive nature of apps like TikTok. I just know YouTube held a similar status in my childhood, and similarly, Vine did too. So I figured that's still kind of comparing apples to apples.\n\nI suppose overall, the point I'm trying to make is, I don't think it's phones making kids not go outside. Technological distraction is not a new thing by any means, and kids still always went outside despite it. I believe there's just less necessity to go outside to see if someone's available, and outside has become increasingly hostile to young people. Thus, young people are going outside less frequently.",

            "Well right off the bat I'm gonna tell you that KIDS DO GO OUTSIDE. I know this because they are outside my apartment all day and night hootin and hollerin",
            "I wanted to go outside a lot as a kid but it just got boring bc a) stranger danger got a big hold of my mom and she wouldn\u2019t let me leave the street I lived on, as opposed to the older generations who got to bike around the whole fucking town and had to just be back for dinner. Then b), we have no 3rd places anymore. There was never a place I could just chill with friends after school. Then finally c) sports are privatized. Back in my parents\u2019 day, they could wander onto a variety of public fields to play whatever sport they felt like playing: baseball, soccer, basketball, etc. Now? Somebody owns the baseball fields around here and will kick you off. They\u2019re probably locked behind a gate anyway. If you want to play sports as a kid now, you have to convince your parents to fork over a ton of money (both to join a team and to get equipment), take you to practice and games, then if you suck you don\u2019t even get to play and your teammates get upset with you bc you cost them games. No fucking wonder kids would rather just stay home and play video games. Being outside now sucks",
            "I think electronics are *part* of the problem.  But there's more to it than that.  The monetization of public spaces / disappearance of third spaces along with helicopter parenting have been contributing factors.\n\nAlso, what is actually allowed by society has changed.  I remember walking 1/2 mile to school when I was in 1st grade.  That would probably not be allowed now.  Allowing kids to roam or w/e is \"bad parenting\" or neglect.  The age where it is permissible to leave children unsupervised (e.g. outside) has increased.",
            "Our neighborhood social media pages are full of nasty old people complaining about kids playing outside, making noise, hanging out at our subdivision playgrounds and common areas (we have 4 playgrounds for 400 houses, blacktops, basketball courts, trails, and TONS of open grassy fields).\n\nThey are the same people who later complain about \u201ckids these days\u201d not being active.",
            "In my city, in the south of Brazil, I think it's both because of eletronics, and that there's no more kids to play with.\n\nWhen I was younger, my neighbor was the same age as me, like 14 days olders or so, and we had some friends that we occasionally played with who were 2 years older or younger. I did have other friends to watch tv with, or play in our shitty computer, or even PS2, but we did hang out outside with neighbors, playing soccer, riding a bike, stealing oranges, whatever.\n\nsome years ago, my cousin who lives nearby and is 8 years younger than me, didn't really grow up playing and doing stuff outside. She also didn't do much inside with eletronics, she just didn't do much at all, but there's only one girl of her age in the neighborhood. She only really interacted with people her age at school, and we only go to school either in the morning or afternoon.",

            "Where the are kids even supposed to go without money? Sit on a curb? There isn't a park or playground within walking distance from me. And you'd need to drive if you're in the suburbs. Kids sitting at home playing Roblox sounds better than hanging out on street corners.",
            "The main reason is that if you let your children go outside in many parts of the country, some well meaning person will call child services if they see a child without a parent right next to him or her, and child services has to take every call seriously.",
            "It\u2019s the rise in helicopter parenting too. \n\nIn the 1990s, kids were mostly allowed to go out with friends unsupervised by 8-10 years old, once they were old enough to know basic common sense safety like that you shouldn\u2019t play with the stove, accept a ride from a stranger, or jaywalk. \n\nBut now, due to the fact that there\u2019s instances of gun violence on the news every day, parents want to know where their kids are 24/7. So a lot of kids are now spending their childhoods on house arrest, with parents convinced school and being dragged to essential errands is sufficient social interaction. If they complain, parents either fearmonger about gun violence, or use the kid having less than perfect grades as an excuse to keep them home. A lot of kids don\u2019t see it as worth the effort to fight it, so they don\u2019t go out.",
            "There's a mall here that doesn't allow children unsupervised. That's supremely fucked. The lack of outside spaces is the largest problem.",
            "They blame the kids, but it's the helicopter parents that create this. Some parents are so afraid of everything they don't let their kids out much. Others hover, but are too lazy to actually care for the kids, so they set them up with a screen and keep them inside. Active parents with healthy minds make active kids with healthy minds.",
            "What always seems to be missing from these conversations is how parenting has changed in the last few decades. \n\nWe act like kids are perfectly autonomous beings who always do exactly what they want, as if they aren\u2019t subject to whatever rules their parents feel like enforcing. There is an intense culture of fear and paranoia that started in the 90s and has increased significantly since then. I would bet a pile of money that the beginning of the \u201cstranger danger\u201d era was also when you started to see fewer kids playing outside. Throw in the fact that anxiety and other mental health issues are growing more prevalent and you have a perfect recipe for parents who never let their kids out of their sight.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m projecting here because of the helicopter parenting style that my mom favored, but I would have LOVED to be a free roaming kid. It just wasn\u2019t allowed in my house.",
            "It's not only phones. It's people teaching their kids not to go outside because they can get kidnapped, it's not safe, etc. They instill fear into their kids based on what they see online and make it their reality, as well as their kids' reality.",
            "All these people blaming phones and video games are missing the biggest reason, imo. \n\nPeople LOVE to call the cops/CPS on children. Imagine letting your 12 year old walk to the park, if you have one, and losing custody of your child because your neighbor called the cops on your kid for existing without a visible parent.\n\nNot to mention, at least in my small town, there's nothing for kids over ~10 to do. Everything is privatized now, and just walking around/riding bikes will get the cops called 90% of the time. \n\nFfs, even the corpse of my local mall has no loitering signs inside, unless you're 60+, you can go walk laps around the mall, and security won't care. But a small group of pre-teens wandering around will get locked in the office until parents come get them, and they'll leave with either a ban or a trespass warning.",
            "I grew up in the 80s and 90s. It's VERY evident to me that kids are less driven to spend time outside and with each other than they were when I was a kid. It's not JUST the phones, but it's the fact that kids can hop on a phone and text a friend and instantly engage with people without needing to even step foot outside. \n\n>Outside has just become infinitely more uncomfortable, mean, and dangerous since I was a kid. \n\nThere was way more crime in the 80s and 90s than today and yet kids were outside.\n\nIt's a lot of things: \n\n* Shitty urban design makes us lonely. The decline of third places has led to a decline in ways to socialize. \n* A culture of fear has led to helicopter parenting and the social banning of even letting kids take minor risks. Parents don't want to let kids go outside unsupervised lest they be shamed by assholes who want to call CPS on everything that moves\n* Social media and tech have allowed kids to not feel as driven to go out and spend time with friends and playing in-person. Why do couch co-op gaming when you can hop on PSN/XB Live?\n\nThere are other factors, but that's a few of them.",
            "It\u2019s hard to point a single cause for this phenomenon. At least in my case,I grew up in a small town which gossip was basically a religion. And privacy was a bad word,I also lived in a relatively large house,we weren\u2019t rich or anything,but for a place with 30.000 people,got a lot of attention.\n            I received those \u201cfat rich jokes\u201d in middle school and other places,the town also had some violent places,my parents didn\u2019t exaclty banned me from the outside,but I was already very risk avoidant while younger.",
            "I got my first cell phone (flip phone) around age 16. So I had plenty of childhood before phones came around, and I can tell you it's not just the phones. Most of my friend group were also home-bodies, we'd do some outdoorsy stuff, but a one hour game of hide and seek was enough outdoors time for a weekend sleepover, and we loved video games.\n\nWhat did we all have in common? We were too young to drive and we all lived in exurbs miles away from one another. So we had two options:\n\n1. Go outside and throw stones at trees until we got bored.\n\n2. Go online and play Command and Conquer with my best friends.\n\nMy parents' generation weren't outdoorsy because they didn't have cellphones. They liked going out because they were in biking distance of friends, fields, and diners. With the explosion of the suburbs, so many kids just don't live in a place where they can freely explore outdoors without risking death-by-car or literal arrest by the police.",

It\u2019s much easier to just let the kid stare at it all day than it is to interact with them and be active and/or dealing with them potentially getting hurt outside.\n\nBack in the 80\u2019s and earlier, being outside WAS the babysitter.  Parents locking the door and making the kid stay out till the street lights came on is no different than sitting them in front the TV or phone/iPad, it just has a MUCH bigger upside (social, activity, learning mistakes on your own, etc) being outside.",
            "Parents are way too scared nowadays. I dont know what its like to have kids but I would probably have similar feelings.",
            "I am 36, and people around me are a lot more anxious about their kids than my parents were when they were my age.\n\nMy own wife, along with tens of millions of Americans, believes there're pedos lurking in the bushes. Our daughter has blinds, those gauze type curtains, and blackout curtains on her window, and my wife still sleeps with her bedroom door open so that when there's a home intruder she'll hear. We live in an upper-middle California suburb, btw.\n\nNeedless to say, our kid doesn't feel like going outside. I'm sure neighbors would call CPS if they saw her outside, because, y'know, pedos.",
            "Also, have you seen outside, lately? It's all just fucking cars and pavement as far as you can see.\n\nIt feels like we're hardly allowed to be outside anymors.",
            "We had a very bare park in the 70s and 80s.\n\nOver time there were attempts by council to plant trees, which were always smashed by bored kids over school holidays. \n\nThen came the Christmas when Nintendo and Sega were big, apparently a lot of kids got consoles and remained inside.\n\nThe Council planted trees again, they lived, we now have a park full of trees thanks to computer games.",
            "It's the shitty urban planning and dangerous environment created by America's car centric society. Kids need to be driven everywhere by their parents for anything. They can't ride around the neighborhood on bikes because the roads are filled with distracted suv drivers going double the speed limit on roads without sidewalks or bike paths.",
            "I'm gonna be honest, sometimes it's my fault my kid doesn't go outside. He's only 5 so he needs direct supervision and sometimes by the end of the day I'm tired and it's too damn hot and I've got chores to do around the house, so we don't get a chance to go outside. If we had neighbors I could trust to watch him with their kids, like take turns watching the kids outside, that would be great.

            "As a teenager addicted to the internet, trust me I want to go outside, I hate staying on the internet all the time, but I don't have a choice. My mom never lets me go outside in the summer because she fears I will tan (she thinks darker skin is ugly because of colourism) and if I try to leave the house before 6:30pm, she gets mad at me. I live in Canada so 9 months out of 12, it's freezing cold and I can't go outside at all. \n\nI don't have friends that live in my neighbourhood except one girl and her parents are overprotective and they don't let her leave the house. So even if I do go outside, who will I hang out with?\n\nMy older brother never hangs out with me, I beg him everyday to play a board game with me or just sit and spend time talking together but he never listens. I want to spend time with him because we are family and I want to be distracted and occupied so I don't go on the internet. He would rather hang out with his friends or watch anime then spend time with me. I even told him 'one day, if I ever pass away before you, you might regret not spending time with your little sister' but he responded 'I don't gaf\". My brother literally does not care about me.\n\nMy parents are toxic, my mom is always picking out my flaws and my dad is always talking about his insane ideologies. They get angry so quickly and they are always fighting. There's always fighting in my house so to distract myself, I hole myself into my room and go on the internet. \n\nI used to love reading so much, as a kid I would spend all my days reading but my parents refuse to buy me more books (because books cost money) or take me to a library (because they are too busy to drive me there). The only books I have are children's books so I can't read those. \n\nWhenever I try to cook my own meals to keep myself off a device, my mom gets mad because she says either I'm wasting ingredients or I'm taking up space in the kitchen. My mom only eats meals that she makes with her own hands.   \n\nWhenever I try to spend time with my family, they always pick petty arguments. And even though my paternal grandparents live with us, my horrible mom doesn't let me spend time with them because she hates her in-laws (my grandparents aren't the problem, they are peaceful, my mom is just a dramatic awful person). \n\nMy maternal grandmother lives with us too but she is bedridden and she hates me because I'm ugly and not fair-skin like her other grandchildren. She tells me to go get r\\*ped everyday and she prays for my death (she had multiple strokes which is why she isn't very mentally sane).\n\nI always end up crying whenever I interact with my family for longer than necessary because I can't handle their bullying. So the internet is my safe place, it keeps my mind off my shitty family. I wish people would understand why I am so attached to my laptop. I tried so hard to break my internet addiction but I have nothing else to do.",

We\u2019d get yelled at for sitting on the sidewalk and talking for god sakes. Individualism has killed playing outside, boomers think they\u2019re entitled to the entire neighborhood and that kids are DEFINITELY being bad even if they\u2019re just hanging out lmao.

            ">I don't think it's phones making kids not go outside. \n\nI think it's mostly the parent's fault. Recently there was a post from a woman who asked \"Is it too early to let my 13yo daughter to go to the grocery shop which is 5 minutes walk?\". Many parents keep their kids on a very short leash and mostly at home and this is why kids get so attached to their phones.",
            "Far from the biggest factor but doesn\u2019t get enough attention is the playground. \n\nThe playgrounds up until 1994(arbitrary date in my head where I draw the line of current era vs yesteryears) were fun for older kids. They took all the dangers away (don\u2019t get me wrong, there is still plenty of risk, just a little hyperbole for the effect) and with it a lot of fun too. My 6 year old and her friends seem to get bored at the playground, we never had that issue. \n\nThe change in playground also had other negative consequences but the biggest impact (aside from physical fitness, because it\u2019s pretty much a gym for kids) is development of risk assessment and that has great implications outside of just bodily injury and the playground. \n\nOn a completely unrelated note, I am glad playground are no longer death traps, I get nervous enough as is when my kid is climbing, I don\u2019t know how my parents were ok back then.",

I would never let my kids do the kind of things I did. Idk. It\u2019s a tough situation, but there are many factors other than cell phones/video games.

There\u2019s (anecdotally) been a shift in what\u2019s fine and what\u2019s not, and with phones being able to track you and give you no reason not to be in contact at all times, it makes it harder to do the same things that made them stay out for so long\n\nThat and 200 other minuscule factors",

Run through someone's yard? Call the cops, get the gun, run out at them screaming, etc. Riding a bike/skateboard? Harass them and try to physically impede or steal their property. Getting together and hanging out/socializing? Threaten to get them arrested or harm them for 'loitering' and being 'hoodlums'.\n\nWhile these things did happen when I was a kid, it's nowhere near the frequency that it does now. We used to play games of tag and ghost in the graveyard across the neighborhood, through yards, etc, and most of the neighbors just watched out for the kids. Obviously, if you did something dumb it would come back around bite you in the ass but there were only ever a handful of the 'grumpy old man'stereotype neighbors and everyone just knew to stay away from them or out of their property.",

            "I grew up on a farm so \"outside\" is always mentally associated with hard labor for me. And to this day when I go outside, I'm going to work on/fix/do something. I'm not going to go outside and read a book or go out and look at the stars or whatever. This concept of \"Go outside and play\" must be a city kid thing to some degree. I'd go inside to play; going outside meant pick a task that needs done and do it. When you finish if you have daylight left, pick another and do it.",
            "People infantalize kids well into their teenage and early adult years now. I think it's a control thing from what I've experienced. My stepdaughter was 16 (16!) and we were trying to teach her responsibility by letting her set an alarm and wake herself up for school and get ready by herself without our assistance. My in-laws called us lazy because her grandmother is a control freak who wants everyone to depend on her and was actively trying to keep our kids KIDS as long as possible. My stepson was in his early 20s and she would call him every morning to make sure he was up, etc, etc. All so she could feel wanted, needed, whatever. It's extremely selfish when you think about it. \n\nWhen I was 11 yo, my mom had to be gone early for work, so my sister and I got ourselves up, ready, and on the bus all by ourselves. Kids are very capable if you don't treat them like helpless infants. It's absolutely absurd the helicopter parenting that's going on. They're handicapping and holding back their own children and it's disgusting to me.",
            "It definitely isn\u2019t phones, video games, or whatever else. It\u2019s the fact that there\u2019s NOTHING TO DO for kids. We have a million suburban hellscapes and no walkability for kids to go anywhere. \n\nMy parents and grandparents talk about how they\u2019d ride their bike to hang out at the movies or the mall. When they were teenagers they\u2019d all meet up at a local diner. Tell me how tf kids are 1. Going to get the permission from 2023 parents to go out in the town and 2. Where they would even walk or ride their bike when our current road system doesn\u2019t allow for that. 3. Have their parents take them somewhere when they\u2019re both working all the time. \n\nI think Kids value freedom over anything. I grew up in the early 00s and felt trapped in a house with no kids in the neighborhood with only video games and tv to entertain. I wanted so bad to just walk somewhere and I got in trouble walking 4 miles to the closest strip mall to buy something. My mom said on the side of the road \u201cI could have just driven you!\u201d That isn\u2019t the point!",
            "Italian here.\n\nIn my own experience, younger generations have busier schedules, meaning there's less \"free time\", as in literally unallocated, for them to go outside.\n\nThey finish school around 1 or 2pm, they go home, eat lunch and likely have some kind of practice, in addition to homework.\n\nSo it's not as if they have so many hours to roam around even those who don't live in cities where most open spaces are either off-limits (due to unsavory people having taken over), simply unattractive or monetized. \n\nTheir best chance is actually the schoolyard or a nearby playground if available. \n\nEven in the summer, most beaches are private resorts, so public beaches tend to be overcrowded and not that great. Meaning the best chance for kids is to have parents who can afford the season pass for the resort (~1500 bucks in average places).\n\nWhen I was a kid, we had the neighborhood playground and a nearby wood (we went with at least an adult, or there were arranged activities). But in general it was already normal to go at someone's house and play (videogames were still rare until the early 90s).",
            "There are no sidewalks, most malls are dead and the ones still around treat kids like their shoplifters, and even libraries don't want unaccompanied kids where are they supposed to go? Parks are smaller and farther apart. Highways are super dangerous to walk across. Yeah, the Weather has been horrible and will get worse, especially in cities. Heat stork is not a happy way to go. Then there's all the homeless taking up that little bit of public space we do have.",
            "The reason I don\u2019t go outside (I\u2019m 15) is because I literally don\u2019t have anything to do. I don\u2019t have friends that live near me. I don\u2019t have siblings around my age. And our basketball goal broke. There is no longer anything to do besides croquet and catch with my dad and that gets boring fast. If I\u2019m with a friend or my cousins then we go outside a lot but I spend most of my days at home so I spend most of my days inside.",
            "I used to hang out at the mall, those are shut down in my area. Unaccompanied minors are not allowed in some of the shopping centers I used to hang out in. A lot of general \"hang out areas\" like libraries and bookstores are gone. I used to hang out at the shopping centers with my friends, hang out at a bookstore and read all day, hang out at a coffee shop in my teens. Those places either shut down or are super crowded with homeless men who talk to themselves and have bikes blocking the seating.",

            "You make a good point. I grew up in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s and physically going to kids\u2019 houses was how we communicated, we did it in person. Using the phone as a kid wasn\u2019t really a thing we did. \n\nAdditionally I think kids are much more supervised by parents anymore, so outside play is more structured with play dates at parks where there\u2019s at least a patent chaperone present. Despite the world generally being a safer place by virtue of cameras everywhere, cell phones everywhere and near instant communication, parents don\u2019t allow kids to wander as far as we used to do. These are all good things in my opinion, but it does result in the perception that kids aren\u2019t outside as much or don\u2019t want to go outside, which isn\u2019t a necessary or direct correlation.",

            "I think it's more likely that hysteria around child abduction fuels a lot of this. Parents are getting in trouble with law enforcement for things like letting their kids take public transportation without an accompanying adult, ffs.\n\nAlso, climate change isn't helping. It ain't much fun to go outside and get some sunshine and play with the others if its' over 95F in the shade. I mean, the entire country of Iran just went on a 2-day public holiday because of temperatures over 120F. This is not going to go away.",

            "HEAVY on the lack of 3rd places. There are so many kids today whose source of \u201cfun\u201d is a Walmart parking lot because it\u2019s the only place available for them to go. Parks are gone, sidewalks have disappeared into freeways, and \u201cno loitering\u201d signs have effectively made \u201changing out\u201d criminal activity. So many kids can\u2019t safely walk to a hangout location because the closest one away is 15minutes driving distance and there\u2019s no public transport and poor pedestrian infrastructure - making it so they have to wait until they\u2019re 16 to drive their friends. Which is still unrealistic as the rising costs of cars have made it so families can no longer afford to buy even a shitty car for their kids. \n\nI remember growing up in the 2000s and dreaming about when I\u2019d be old enough like the big kids to hangout at the mall. By the time I got to that age the mall was barren and hostile towards unattended teens. Even today where I live near a pretty decent mall, the cost of items is way too high for the average teen to indulge in and the food court was cut in half. \n\nIf we want kids to go outside more then we need pedestrian-friendly zoning laws, to rejuvenate third places, and for gods sake get rid of criminalizing loitering because that\u2019s just ridiculous.",

            "I'd say it has more to do with parenting than phones. Phones are a contributor but not a cause. It's easier for parents to just hand the kids a phone or iPad and let them mindlessly watch YouTube, constantly flipping through videos and getting instant gratification than it is to take your kid outside and watch them. Then there's the helicopter parents who won't let their kids go anywhere. \n\nWhen I was growing up I didn't really have a phone until late middle school but we didn't have smart phones until I was in high school. As a kid I played video games, toys, watched TV, and went outside fairly equally. \n\nI don't think phones or internet is really offering anything different than tv or videogames did. It's more about the habits parents are teaching their kids.",
            "I blame it on climate change like you said, and the fact we built our cities to be unwalkable. Like what did everyone expect? Kids can\u2019t drive and can\u2019t go to their friends because they will get hit by a car",

Hot or cold rain or snow.\n\nWhen I was a kid you couldn't drive past a park without seeing kids, or biking in the neighborhood. Now it's one or two kids every once in a while.\n\nWe used to ride 10-20 deep and see other groups of similar size.\n\nThe last time I saw alot of kids outside was around the release of the Xbox 360. After that ghost town.\n\nThe reality is , and I agree with this, is video games and internet content is vastly more stimulating.\n\nAs a person from the generation affected, it was video games and social media predominately.",
            "You're in the Midwest. I grew up there too. I had no problem letting my kids run loose outside *in my hometown*. I live in California. My kids got limited time outside in the neighborhood because, like it or not Californians, California, unless you live in a very small town, is not as safe as a small town in the Midwest.",
            "This couldn't be further from the truth. I'm around the same age, and I can agree that we already had lots of entertainment technologically, yet we still played outside, that is true. \n\nBUT you are not considering the \"quality\" and availability of this technology. Back in the 2000's we didn't have tiny computers in our pockets, smartphones. And they weren't loaded up with the most addicting, damaging platforms known to man. Why go outside and have a random adventure when you can sit at home and have a genius, endless AI feed you new videos that you LOVE, specifically curated to your interests on tik tok for hours?? Why go outside and play with real toys when you can watch a millionaire child play with them on youtube?? Why go outside and kick a ball around aimlessly when you have unrestricted, unsupervised, 24/7 access to a tablet?? Why go outside when you and your friend could sit in a room for 3 hours making faces at a phone in hopes that you might make it big and be a viral celebrity?? It's literally an entirely different world. If you don't see that, something is wrong.",
            "Phones wouldn\u2019t do it imo. If anything, from my experience, phones made going outside safer and easier. That\u2019s how we connected. Its also how my mother tracked me to prevent herself from having a panic attack. If anything, video games would be the culprit.",
            "Kids are definitely still going outside in my town. I see kids on bikes all the time. They go to the waterpark near my house.\n\nTech is still a big problem though. I went to a friend's house to do laundry the other day and her kid (5) immediately sat next to me on the couch with an iPad, volume on, bouncing from one video to the next to the next. And I've gotta say man, kids' content on YouTube is fucking weird. I'm 27, so I'm only a little older than you OP, but I mean it when I tell you that the shit kids are watching on YouTube is going to fuck them up in the future. \n\nWe can extend blame for the lack of outside interaction to a lot of things. One of my personal gripes with \"outside\" right now is that, in my Midwestern city, everything is weeds, broken blacktop, and big gray bricks with products and services in them (fast food restaurants, coffee spots, nail salons, etc.). I like to walk through my neighborhood sometimes and there really is nowhere for kids to go. We have parks, but nothing for kids to explore. No bridges to hang out under. No hidden beaches. No breakwater or embankments. Just industry and commerce with the occasional residential sprawl or hospital. The main roads are huge and full of traffic. Not to mention, there's a slaughterhouse and an animal processing plant that both work together to produce some absolutely abhorrent smells and unbreathable air on a consistent enough basis that it's a problem here. \n\nWalking around outside is uncomfortable to say the least. Even right now, I'm curled up inside on the couch under a fluffy blanket with my AC blasting. I'm scrolling reddit and smoking weed. I can watch TV in here. I can take a nap in here. Outside is loud and oppressive most of the time. It's not even safe to take night walks anymore. \n\nSo, while I agree that it isn't necessarily the issue people make it out to be, I don't blame kids and teens for not being more active outside. I really hope they get the chance to appreciate nature at some point, like when they get older and can explore outside the city limits. But for now, in town, inside is better.",

            "When I was growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, I remember things like stranger danger, terrorism, anthrax, and drug scares were the leading contributors as to why kids were spending less time outside.\n\nI remember that anyone and everyone (who wasn't a \"trusted adult\") was trying to drug, kidnap, rape, or murder us. If they're brown-looking (or Muslim), then they were likely planning on blowing us up, or \"worse\"; forcefully convert us to Islam so that we may, in turn, blow other people up (seriously kids, the early 2000s/post 9/11 America was wild and actual Islamophobia was socially acceptable in a lot of places for quite a while unfortunately). \n\nNow that's not to say that kids didn't play outside at all, but for those that did, it was usually in large groups often supervised by a parent(s), which was super lame at times because you were pretty much not allowed to have fun or were forced to hang out with some kids in the group that you didn't want to hang out with in the first place (like that weird neighbor kid who kept eating his scabs) because \"safety in numbers\". Gone were the days when you could be dropped off and spend time by yourself because chances were your parent (or your friend's parent) was somewhere lurking/watching over you. The cooler ones were at least from a distance and I was well into my teens when I was allowed to hang out without any supervision. \n\nIf you had helicopter parents, forget about it.\n\nNow I'm sure there were parents who also thought that this was bs, but social pressures from their friends/the media made it so that they had to comply, or else be labeled as \"bad parents\".\n\nSo picture this: you have a kid who was told that the world was scary and that you must travel in groups just to survive. You're inside your house most of the time, but you have access to video games consoles, and cell phone technology went from being the size of a brick to the size of something that can fit in the palm of your hand, and the technology is readily getting better and more affordable every few months. You can talk to your friends without needing to be next to them, play with them without actually physically playing with them, and now see your friends even though you're not in the same room with them. \n\nAll in all, everything that you'd do in person largely went digital. \n\nEventually, those same scares migrated to the digital world, so instead of kids getting \"caught\" outside, they'd be lured to their demise thanks to predators online (I'd like to say this was around the early 2010s), but by that point, I had already grown up and was making my own decisions.",

They are all tethered to their devices.   \n\n\nWhen I was growing up back in the 80s and mid-90s, me and my friends were outside most of the time as long as the weather was nice. Again, as a much older person, the contrast is stark. \n\nAlso, you alluded to times being more dangerous now. That\u2019s actually incorrect.

            "Imo kids don't go outside because we a society discourage it. Some may think \"but we say why don't you go out and play\" all the time! Well sure, but what do you do when they're out? Do you insist they stay in line of sight constantly? Do you badger them about being safe? Do you instill a (very reasonable) fear of strangers? Do you make a massive fuss the moment they inevitably injure themselves? Do you yourself spend time talking to neighbours and going outside to make the outside and inviting place to be?\n\nMany people do a lot of the above without realising they're subconsciously discouraging outside play. Moreover, it's sort of an issue that has a 'critical mass' because we are social creatures. People are more likely to go out to places where people already congregate. And if enough people stop doing that then the rest will follow suit because the lack of people makes it less inviting.\n\nAnd so being constantly busy with work or other activities, and doing everything except just being outside in public spaces we collectively discourage being outside in public. And children that see this are then subconsciously conditioned to just not want to go out. A behaviour we reinforce every time we make a fuss over any of the negatives of doing so.",

            "I think it has more to do with the isolating of people. Smartphones and devices may be a part of why this is occurring. There just isn't as much community as there used to be. People don't get to know their neighbors as much as they used to. \n\nMy only child is 4 and he would play outside all day long if there were other neighborhood kids to play with but there isn't right now. \n\nPeople, at least that I know, don't just show up at someones house like people used to before cell phones  so even for me as a 40 year old, it's hard to socialize sometimes.

            "Parents not enforcing rules with regard to phones/tech is why kids aren\u2019t going outside. I grew up in the late 90s/early aughts and my parents let us have no more than 30 min of screen time a day.

As parents we can\u2019t be lazy and sit inside and watch tv after work all afternoon. Yes we are tired but we have to put in the effort to play with them and be physically active.

Now pocket change isn't enough. I never see ice cream trucks going around neighborhoods anymore either \n\nLately they've been removing playgrounds or just not building new ones, those used to be the main meet up/hang out spots\n\nParents aren't encouraging or trusting their kids to go outside now adays as well. Our parents used to relish the opportunities when we'd be gone all day outside just walking around the area and exploring. A lot of parents I talk to on a regular basis prefer their kids to stay inside and sit on iPads/phones or what not because they know for a fact that they aren't causing trouble and they're not bothering them.\n\nEdit: also running errands with parents used to be dope because they had play places. Those don't exist anymore",
            "Genuinely I think helicopter parents who won't let their kids do anything without them is more of the modern issue than cell phones. When I was 8 or 9 it was pretty typical that me and my friends could walk around the neighborhood and ride bikes during the summer on our own. Now I see parents who won't let their kids out of the house without them, and reality is that if you've gotta work and you won't let you kid go anywhere without you then I guess they're stuck inside.",

So where/how are they going to walk around outside? Parents are also increasingly helicoptery and are often the ones imposing device check ins on their kids so they can know where they are at all times.

            "I get what you're saying and agree that phones aren't the \\*only\\* problem, but I think they are a large part of the problem.\n\nFirst of all take my upvote for a well-thought out, unpopular opinion. There's kind of two sides to this. One side that I'm guessing you'd agree with, is that parents still have to parent. At the end of the day, parents need to take responsibility, whether that means not allowing a smartphone/tablet/computer until a certain age, limiting screen time, and/or blocking certain sites and apps. You can't just blame your child's failures on their phone.\n\nThe other side, as you mentioned, is that these apps are incredibly addictive. Sure, video games, tv, movies, etc. can all be very addictive to some people. I think that phones are just on a different level. At least video games require you to keep your concentration on the same thing, whereas on my phone, I can switch from youtube, to instagram, to twitter, to reddit, to a certain other form of entertainment (which merits a conversation of it's own, but it's a banned topic here) whenever I feel I'm not getting that dopamine hit anymore. I haven't read them myself, but I have heard that there are studies that show smartphone use is linked to increases in ADHD behaviors.\n\nI will say from my own experience, even as an adult, having a smartphone has caused me problems at times... scrolling or watching videos for hours at a time. Now, I've watched movies or TV shows for long periods of time (I think there is also something to be said about binge-watching on platforms like Netflix) and played video games for way too long, but there's something that just seems different about messing around on your phone for so long. I, myself, feel like I could be on my phone all day long if I didn't feel so guilty about it, where I don't think I could do the same thing with other types of entertainment.\n\nOne other thing to mention is that there aren't many people who just outright don't like smartphones. Pretty much everyone spends some amount of time on their smartphone or tablet, whereas this isn't the case with something like video games. Maybe video games are just as addictive, but it's not as prevalent of a problem since they don't appeal to nearly as many people as smartphones.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think phones are addictive and part of the reason kids aren't going outside as much. Sure, other things like video games are addictive, too, but I don't think they're as addictive or addictive to as many people. Finally, parents do still need to parent and take responsibility for their children's well-being.",
            "It's not the phones, it's the public's perception of safety of children since the advent of the internet and the 24/7 news barrage. Ultimately the public pressure to become a helicopter parent to \"protect\" your kid has eliminated most freedoms kids used to enjoy.\n\nSome of that is also thanks to the internet, other people think kids are a nuisance and ruin everything. Some Midwest grandparents are blasted with more gang violence news that plagues larger cities hundreds of miles away and just kind of assume the kids out and about are up to no good. I'm generalizing a bunch here, but basically it still comes down to 24/7 doom-and-gloom news. It warps everybody's perception of society differently.",
            "Lmfao outside is not more dangerous or mean....we literally live in the safest time period in history",
            "The anti-car urban planning communities have a LOT to say on this kind of topic. \n\nNeighborhoods are no longer safe for kids to play in because everything is cars. There are no third places kids can go to because small businesses can't survive because of parking minimums, and because residential zoning makes it impossible to have store near houses. More isolation means more cars means less safety means more parental oversight means there isn't anything to do.\n\nThe internet is the only way kids can do anything with other people anymore and we need to address to root of the problem instead of blaming technology.",
            "There is not enough free spaces and safe places to go play outside anymore",
            "If you're 21, how did you \"grow up in the 2000's and 2010's\"? You are BARELY a legal adult. You were CONCEIVED in the 2000's, not grow up in them.\n\nPhones and video games have had a HORRIBLE effect on children's personalities. Todays youth are very, VERY impatient as a result. If you can't swipe it on your phone, its too much effort and takes too much time. You put yourself into this rut of what real life is. Youth today in the U.S. and other first world countries have more advantages today than any other time in history, and they are PISSED at their circumstances because theyre not a model on a yacht at 16.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey will sit staring at a cell phone, while listening to a netflix show laying in their air conditioned bedroom complaining about being a victim of global warming. Read a book, think for YOURSELF and not what a \"influencer\" tells you what is moral or ethical. The lifetyle teenagers live today is the most unsustainable thing in history and they will throw a tantrum that theyre victims while being the most privileged living being in known existence.",
            "It also doesn't help that whenever the kids are outside having fun, there's bound to be some Karen-Asswipe, who, for some godforsaken reason, takes offense to that and starts attacking them either verbally or physically.\n\nBest example would be the skateboard kids",
            "One thing I haven't seen mentioned in the comments yet is the increase in traffic over the years. I grew up through the late 90s and early 2000s and remember being able to ride my bike to my friends' houses pretty easily, but now there are so many more cars on the road that it'd be pretty dangerous to try and make that trip without full understanding of traffic laws.\n\n\nAlso, as others have said, lack of public areas are a huge problem too. I remember being with large groups of friends sitting around in public areas in middle school (10-13yo) and having cops come and kick us out for \"loitering\", so I can imagine that's even worse now as policenumbers and budgets have increased, and public areas for kids to hang out have slowly disappeared. I read my police logs every now and then and almost always see something like \"12:30pm Saturday - Told group of youths to move along from the high school field\".\n\n\nSo it's more dangerous to try and bike around anywhere, and once you actually get there you have a good chance of having the cops come and tell you to leave. I'd rather stay inside too",
            "My 12 yo and a friend were riding bikes in the park a few weeks ago. Some old guy yelled at them for riding on the sidewalks and not in the streets. This is why kids don't play outside.",
            "I\u2019ve noticed that, at least on the neighborhoods I\u2019ve listed in, kids do spend a good amount of time outside. But adults are almost always inside so how would they know??\nIf I wasn\u2019t walking my dog 3-4 times a day, I would have no clue there were kids outside",
            "Anything that costs is too expensive. If there isn't a sidewalk which there rarely is in most of the us, you're liable to get stopped by the cops or hit by a car. Or both if the cop is having a bad day. Public transport is full of crackheads and downtown's are full of bars and homelessness, not arcades and soda shops. All these older folk saying \"why don't kids play outside?\" And \"why aren't products made like they used to be\" or \"there's just so much litter now\". Like they didn't create the world we're in. Kids and millennial were born into a world of single use plastics and designed obsolescence, created by a generation of people that didn't care about the effects or consequences of their actions and then blames them on the ones having to be responsible for it because they are now too old to do anything other than hold positions In office or congress where they blame the working class for pollution and laziness. Its absolutely infuriating and makes me despise old people that say that shit."

At first I was being ironic in joining the cruelty,but realized that my intentions didn\u2019t matter, I was truly hurting people, and saw myself in them. \n\nAs a kid, it\u2019s a shitty lesson to learn, that hurt people hurt people. But I say all this to hopefully point out that possibly the people making fun of others have huge insecurities about themselves. Without guidance from elders in any fashion on how to identify and manage complicated emotions like shame, guilt, insecurity, etc., lashing out in this primitive manner are common.\nThat being said, it doesn\u2019t lessen or excuse any pain felt by those bullied, all their pain is valid, and I hope everyone can learn to find their unique traits a gift in their own eyes.\n\nAll I can do is spread knowledge and hopefully it will click with some asshole out there to stop, reflect, take accountability, and apologize.\nI said sorry many times, but for me it wasn\u2019t enough, it still pains me to this day and that experience will haunt me for life. I wish I had never been mean, but what happened happened, all we can do is move on and do better.",
            "The biggest instance of this for me came in high school, when I went over to my girlfriend\u2019s house for the first time.

I remember parents of kids in my class and parents of girls I was on sports teams with commenting that I was lucky my hair was so bright because our uniforms were white and I was so pale that they wouldn't be able to see me otherwise. I did have a few older high schools do the whole \"carpet match drapes\" stupid shit when I was 12-13. I also always get asked/assumed that I'm Irish, which isn't bullying but it is annoying sometimes. \n\nThe worst case was when I was 14 my boyfriend's mom forbade him from dating me because she said me having red hair was a sign I was a child of the devil. Like, she legitimately believed that to the point of calling our school to warn them that I might open a portal to hell. \n\nNow I embrace and love my red hair. My mom and her 3 siblings are all redheads (extremely rare) and I'm the only one out of 7 cousins and my sister that has red hair. It makes me sad to know that this gene might die with me.",

            "You are absolutely correct. Several artists have used gingers as an allegory for race. \n\nThe idea of people being different races, including the idea of minority groups, is a social construct. That doesn't mean that races and minorities don't exist, rather it means that they only exists because we, as a society, agree that they exist.\n\n\nDepending on where you are from different race identitiers mean different things. For example if you say someone is Asian in the US that means they are from SE Asia, generally China, Japan or Korea. But someone described as Asian in the UK is a person from the Indian subcontinent, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc.\n\nSociety has not decided that ginger is a race. Most probably because it doesn't really match with our ideas of race. Generally speaking people are the same race as their family and, because red hair is caused by a recessive gene many gingers are the only ginger in their family.",

            "I agree to an extent, but I will say this. \n\nMy sister had a very similar attitude. She didn't like going out and partying. She finally 'broke out of her shell' when she was around 31-32 and suddenly enjoyed going out to bars and clubs and even hooking up with people, and she was having the time of her life. This came after she finally went to therapy and resolved some issues she had. \n\nAnd she absolutely *hated* that she spent the previous 15 years not doing these things, she felt like she wasted her entire youth simply because she was too socially anxious to enjoy these things. It ended up being another crisis for her, that she hated how much she missed out, especially now that we were at the age where people were beginning to phase out of partying and she was only just beginning. \n\nWhat you feel now is not how you will always feel. It is entirely possible years down the line that you will feel like you missed out on a lot of fun that you didn't even realize was fun. That is all I will say.",

While it is true that they could just decline to be in your wedding, you as the bride are asking because you really want these particular people in your party.

I think it was back or navy pants, white shirt, black dress shoes and he got them matching ties.\n\nHis thinking: virtually every guy already has that, if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s all staple stuff they should have. So nobody is wasting money on a one off. It\u2019s all timeless and will be good anytime you need it. All can be worn with other things, and all will still be staple mens wardrobe in 30 years. All that stuff is good for any wedding, funeral, job interview, etc. odds are everyone will be able to reuse it.\n\nWas a clever approach.

It\u2019s ridiculous to think that a bridesmaid should be expected to dish out hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars for bridal shower, bachelorette parties (elaborate full weekend trips is the standard now ??????) and the cost of their dress + hair/makeup of the day of the wedding. Yes, they could say no but I do feel this should be the brides expense.",

Just 2 on each side, but they didn't have to spend a single dollar on our account. \n\nI think it's really unfair that the general expectation is that people in the wedding party must spend hundreds of dollars to celebrate YOUR wedding. It's selfish. \n\nIf you can only afford to pay for 2 dresses and tuxes, then that's how big your wedding party should be.",

I'm not spending a dime so you can cosplay as a princess for a day.

Had dinner with the guests at a restaurant and went out with friends that night. Today weddings end up at some generic wedding venue, the foods always bland and awful, the DJs are too loud and dont know how to properly tune the PA system, and in texas its hot so the outside \"cocktail hour\" is miserable.

            "Me and my lifelong group of friends have all decided that none of us are gonna have bridesmaids at all. We\u2019ll have bachelorette parties, but we all agreed that there was too much stress on the choosing of the maid of honor between us (unless we had a family member in mind), and also that the tradition of mandating a bridesmaid dress code was an unnecessary cost to both the attendee and the bride. \n\nWhen it comes to bachelorette parties, we all agreed that the bride should pay for the lodging costs (Airbnb), and the attendees can pay their own airfare. Everything else (activities, food) would be split evenly amongst the attendees without the bride paying. \n\nWe have stuck to this model for 3 weddings now and honestly it\u2019s been the smoothest compared to other weddings I\u2019ve participated in. Less stress about hierarchal bridesmaid commitment because we tackle as a unit; and less overall cost all around.",

When it comes down to it they are doing me a favor by being in my wedding party. As I\u2019m typing this I\u2019m realizing I was probably a weird bride. All the women in my wedding party wore white.

She lives in California and I live in Texas. I have made one trip there for dress shopping and she has come here so we could do her bouquets. (I have a talent for putting bouquets together) so she asked me to do them. She is actually coming here to ride with me while I drive to California. Not only did I have to pay for my dress and shoes but I have to pay gas, stays, food, hair, nails, bachelorette party, makeup and anything else that\u2019s comes up.

            "I completely agree!  We had a wedding party of 12 - maid-of-honor, best man, 4 bridesmaids, 4 groomsmen, a flower girl, and a ring bearer.  6 we\u2019re family members and 6 we\u2019re friends from college or high school.  My parents and his covered the costs of the dresses and alterations, hair and nails, and tux rentals.  The only thing they had to provide were their shoes.  We were all recent broke college grads or soon to be (or just a high school grad, like my maid of honor sister!) who may have struggles with the cost.

It was expensive!\n\nI just wanted to make sure they didn't have any deterrents to attend.",

My first wife and I were going to do a themed wedding and rent madrigal dresses for the bridesmaids.   Her sisters threw a fit about wearing costumes, so she asked to go traditional.

We bought dresses, bags and shoes for our bridesmaids and hired full dress kilts for all the men who were a part of the wedding. No one should be expected to be out of money for attending a wedding, it's pathetic. Why is it it that America has stolen traditions from everywhere but left out all the good bits??",

We could wear whatever jewelry and shoes we wanted as she trusted us not to do something ridiculous. She had her hair professionally done but we did her makeup. All the bridesmaids did our own hair and makeup as well. The pictures turned out super cute and the bride didn\u2019t have to stress about micromanaging our attire.",

Just had to pay for my own other travel expenses and made a full vacation out of it since I had to travel there anyways, which I would definitely not have been able to afford if I had had to pay for every cost associated with being in the wedding party.\n\nShe decided to do it this way after having been in so many wedding parties herself that were too expensive, and just wanted her friends and family to have a good time and be there for her without the stress associated with the costs.",

All the Latino weddings I\u2019ve been part of we don\u2019t pay for our bridesmaids dresses, shoes, hair, etc. someone is there doing the hair and nails and our dresses are taken care of. \nHowever, my first experience with an American wedding - I was out like $200 for a dress and then the bride wanted us to pay for our hair and makeup and I said hell no.

            "Married in the early 90s, wedding party was very diverse in economic status and sizes so we asked all the females to wear their favorite black dress and black shoes and we gave them all matching necklaces and bracelets. We asked the men to wear a black suit & white shirt and we gave them matching ties and tie clips with their initials. The wedding party looked great and everyone was very happy to wear something they chose and didn\u2019t drop a bundle on something they were never going to wear again.",
            "This used to be the custom, at least where I\u2019m from. It used to be the bridesmaids got a dress, shoes, and a little gift, as thanks for being a major part of the day/the bride\u2019s life. Usually groomsmen get a nice suit and shoes and a gift. It\u2019s acceptable to make the outfit the gift, though!\n\nThe first wedding I was involved in as an adult, I was expected to pay for the dress, shoes, nails, hair, makeup, jewelry, etc. She tried to keep it cheap, but it stacked up for me as a college kid!",
            "This is not unpopular.\n\nLiterally everyone agrees except the fucking bride, lol.\n\nIf you can't afford to take care of the wedding party, either cut back on your spending, or wait till you're financially responsible enough to pay.\n\nI would NEVER pressure my friends and family to spend an entire weeks worth of pay just so they can be in my pictures. Pretty fucking selfish",
            "I also have this unpopular opinion",
            "My fianc\u00e9 and I are having a fusion wedding with Indian attire. Only 3 of the 8 people in the wedding party would even potentially have the ability to wear the outfits again, as such, my fianc\u00e9 and I factored the bridal party attire into our budget and are covering it completely, despite my maid of honor insisting she pay for it because \"that's how things are done\". Like, no, I'm not making you pay for something you are only going to wear once to my wedding.",
            "I used a tux service and prepaid for everything. I can\u2019t ask someone to meet my requirements and not cover the expense.",
            "I missed all the drama by eloping! Husband and I got married in the Caribbean by a local minister. Stayed in a lovely hotel. Still married 24 years later!",
            "I don't know if it's a US thing but here in South Africa I've never been to a wedding where the bridesmaids paid for their dresses.",
            "At least give me a heads up in advance that there is going to extra expenses. I agreed to be a groomsman in my friends wedding 6 months ago and he just randomly sent me a link to pay for the suit rental. Shit was around 300$. For something I\u2019m going to wear one day. I had no idea this was a thing.",
            "I feel like the divider here is mostly on whether or not people enjoy large parties.  Large party people are all \"no big deal, I'll pay as much as I can to support your big fun party\", and the people who aren't fans of large parties are more \"spending a whole day in an unfamiliar setting, parading in front of a crowd, and attempting to entertain your aunt is a huge favor.  Now you want me to pay for the privilege?  And, if I say no there is a 50/50 chance our friendship will never be the same?\"",

            "I was a bridesmaid in a friends wedding and she kept it beautifully simple. We were asked to wear a nice black dress (I used one that I already owned) and she provided everyone with the same color wrap/shawl.

            "A agree, but this is a very popular opinion. If you want a fancy wedding, then you should pay not your guests and supporting cast.",

            "100000% agree, it's insane how people will ruin friendships because of a 1 day spending purge that nobody else involved asked for besides the people getting married.\n\nA friend of mine is currently having a falling out with her childhood friend bc she can't afford to get a nice dress AND make sure it's a specific look AND pay to travel to the wedding AND chip in for the bachelorette party AND travel TO the bachelorette party that is on a DIFFERENT WEEK THAN THE WEDDING. Then she gave her shit because she had \"a year to save up\" and got the other bridal party girls to start texting her to make my friend guilty.\n\nAbsolute bridezillas some of these people are, it's fking insane. Like mf you invited her to YOUR wedding to see YOU get married, you fkin pay for it if it's that important.",

            "Yeah If you can\u2019t afford all the dresses you have to be okay when others don\u2019t want too. colour is a different thing though if it just has to be a colour that\u2019s fine since they can get it within they\u2019re budge",
            "I have a similar wedding gripe. My cousin is getting married at a fancy resort and they want all of the family to come stay at the resort and party together.\nThe room is over $600/night, are you kidding me?! I already have to buy outfits for my three boys, buy a gift AND it\u2019s a holiday weekend so everything\u2019s going to be out of control anyway.\nI told them I would not be purchasing a room and that we would just find a less expensive place to stay. I\u2019m sorry, but there are definitely ways to celebrate without breaking the bank.\nAnyway, rant over. Thanks for listening. I\u2019m just tired of being made out to be an ass because I don\u2019t have that kind of money.",
            "Agree 100%. I bought all the clothes for my wedding. You're spot on. The wedding party is doing you a favor, not the other way around. Getting to keep the dress isn't a good argument against it. It's tacky as hell to tell someone, \"I want you to wear this dress while doing me a favor, but I can't/won't pay for it myself.\"",
            "That is right",
            "If the bride wants her bridesmaids to wear a specific dress, then yes, they shouldn't have to pay. \n\nOn the other hand, if the bride asks her bridesmaids to choose their own dress, but just stick to a theme or a colour, then the bridesmaids can pay.",
            "Heck I'm a guy and not even in the wedding party, just the brother of the groom. First wedding I've ever been this involved in. And it's ridiculous. I have a black suit and multiple shirts. Oh but none of those are good enough. I have to have a very specific red shirt that matches the flowers. And my other brothers have to be in black and white and none of us can wear the same colors. WTF? And are you buying these clothes for us? No. We're not even in the wedding party! We're just going to sit there off to the side. Why does this matter.\n\nAnd then our mother has to be in some specific color. but not the color of the bride's mother. And she gets first choice of colors because 'wedding rules'. And it has to be 1920s looking. WTF is this garbage?\n\nGo to the courthouse and get a justice of the peace to marry you and that's it. It sure is easy to expect all these people to buy all this stuff we'll never wear again, for a 6 hour party when you're not the ones paying. Mine here is minor to others in here but it's still irritating."

Stop. Making. Plans. \n\n***\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who's commented! Even the assholes. Many of your criticisms are fair -- even enlightening -- and some I still disagree with. \n\nWhere the assholes and I agree\n\n- My original post was poorly written. I halfway expected it to drown in the torrent of new posts, plus the topic riles me, so I didn't choose my words carefully. Surprise, surprise: they didn't hold up well under the microscope of /unpopularopinion's front page. \n\nThis is how I would reword its crux: \"not feeling like it\" is a shitty excuse to flake on friends. \u201cNot feeling like it\" due to something foreseeable (you stayed up late the night before watching a football game, you had an important project due at work this week, you never liked the plans you agreed to) doesn\u2019t make the excuse any better. If you're unsure if you'll make it, tell your friend that. Otherwise, flaking isn't self-care. It\u2019s immature and rude.  \n\n- Shit happens to everyone, and especially to parents and people with chronic medical conditions. \n\n- How someone flakes is relevant. A sincere apology can communicate what a casual cancellation doesn't: the friend who is cancelling still values the friendship.\n\nWhere the assholes and I disagree\n\n- One said, \"We don't own our friends' time.\" No, but we do owe our friends the time we tell them we'll set aside for them, unforeseen conflicts excepted.  \n\n- Canceling because you don't feel like it right now can be shortsighted because how you feel can often change after you arrive.\n\n- To be angry at a friend who flakes isn't selfish. It's a reasonable response to someone whose poor planning affects you.\n\n- I\u2019d rather my friends stay home if they're too tired to enjoy themselves. But if they're tired due to poor planning, being \u201ctoo tired\u201d is a shitty excuse to flake.\n\nAlright, I think I've spent enough time on this post. Thanks again to everyone who commented.

This happened roughly 15-20 times in a row, way too often for it not to be deliberate behavior. \n\nAfter each instance of this, the other hubby will approach me, pulling this goofball routine in order to smooth things over. I realize now that he\u2019s only doing that in order to make himself feel better. To top it all off, after all this, I\u2019d get the occasional text or email from him whingeing about \u201cwhy haven\u2019t you had us over for a swim?\u201d (We have a pool and he\u2019s obsessed with them.)\n\nThe last straw was when we had a milestone birthday a while back and invited a bunch of people, including this couple. It was important to us to celebrate it with friends. Not only did they waffle til the last second and make up some BS excuse for not coming, they didn\u2019t even have the common courtesy to open the email invite and rsvp with a \u201cno.\u201d After this, I just stopped talking to them, or replying to texts or messages (which of course were comprised of the goofball / smoothing over routine).

They would carefully weigh up the pros and cons of each thing and the skip the ones that they didn't think were good enough for them and would only briefly attend the other lower level things for the perks and then ditch for the main event. They were constantly trading up in social circles as well. \"Oh you can introduce me to such and such who knows such and such I'm there.\"  Frankly a horrible manipulative person.

The sheer amount of guilt I feel when I cancel is awful as well. And this why I am very careful when making plans with others. I will commit to stuff that I am more than 80% sure I\u2019ll be up for. If I don\u2019t have that level of confidence, I\u2019ll just be honest with people and let them know \u201csounds good but I\u2019ll let you know closer to the date\u201d; and if they need an answer well in advance I just tell them to not count on me when I don\u2019t feel that sure I\u2019ll be able to make it.

People need to be honest with themselves when they\u2019re not capable of socialising, even when they really want to. Sometimes it\u2019s just not possible. It frustrates me more when people say \u201cyeah yeah count me in\u201d and then cancel last minute than the other way around. I rather you straight up say \u201cyeah I don\u2019t think I can make it\u201d but on the day tell me \u201ccan I still join\u201d. It\u2019s easier to cope with that.",
            "Flakiness is 100% one of my biggest pet peeves, if not the biggest. I've had so many friends who can't seem to comprehend that others actually go out of their way to set time/money aside for them and that we could be doing something else. I once had someone cancel two hours AFTER the time we were supposed to meet up, because they 'had a little breakdown' at uni and drove home.\n\nOne of my closest friends was a nightmare for this sometimes. She would always end up double arranging things and had a busy schedule that meant she had to cancel, yet somehow always had time to meet up with Tinder dates. \nThe worst was when she promised to come to an event six weeks in advance, repeatedly assured me she had set it into her calendar and even the night before asserted, of her own accord, that she would 100% be there. Day comes and she's a no show. The worst thing isn't that she didn't decide to come however, but that she actually went on a date with a man she had never met off Hinge instead! Apparently she was willing to go all the way into town for a stranger yet couldn't even take two minutes off (even on the way back) to walk down the road for me. \n\nI did forgive her because she felt genuinely remorseful and made it up to me, but it put a strain on the friendship for a while. If I ever have to count on a friend for something serious there are a number of people I would call first now over her.

Truth is, the more you flake, the worse those issues will get. I'm all for self-care, but there's definitely a line when self care just becomes selfishness. Losing friends, always being alone at home, and constantly thinking/regretting flaking on people I cared about exponentially made things worse. If you're like I was, make yourself show up. Your anxiety is gonna happen regardless of what you do. As the saying goes, either suffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret. Imo, the regret is FAR worse.",

She would say ok and then still not listen to it (she's a musician too, it's not an issue of not liking classical music). I couldn't figure out why it bugged me so much since she was also a busy college student, but this is exactly it.

They deserve fucking better.\n\nSome people just don't have a sense of foresight or consideration or self-awareness, I guess.",

            "Hard disagree. My bestie does this all the time. Very introverted and prone to overwhelm.\n\nThing is, I don't want to hang out if she doesn't want to be there, if she's too tired or burnt or peopled-out to have a conversation. I'd MUCH RATHER she tell me she only got 4 hours of sleep and cancel plans vs. forcing herself to socialize due to guilt or obligation.\n\nI don't feel hurt or disrespected when she honestly communicates that she's not feeling it. We'll do something later when we both want to be there.",

            "As someone who deals with a lot of social anxiety, and depression, has had to cancel/reschedule due to mental health issues, general exhaustion, etc.\n\nI agree with OPs post. Part of self-care is maintaining your relationships with other people. No one enjoys being in a friendship where the responsibility of maintaining it is completely on them- otherwise, it starts tanking *their* mental health that they aren't enough of a priority for someone to value or even respect their time.\n\nI have no problems with someone valuing themselves over \"entertaining\" me, but if they don't respect my time or effort in maintaining our friendship then they can get gone because I am no there to \"entertain\" *them*.",

I would rather my friend(s) cancel our plans than go with me but not enjoy the activity/event etc. I've been on the receiving end of friends who show up but aren't really present mentally/emotionally or are uncomfortable/not feeling well and it's no fun at all.

Things come up, unfortunately once in a while even last minute. That's just life, and if you're not willing to roll with the punches and be flexible people  then are going to be a lot less willing to put up with your own shortcomings.  The bottom line is that you are no more perfect than they are, and the fact that they have different flaws than you do doesn't change or negate that.",
            "90% of my friends have small children. We barely can keep a weekly gathering going. It's probably a 50% cancellation rate, due to work and kids. You sound young. Time is harder to find later on, especially trying to make your schedule work for both parties.",

Until we actually live in an equal society, which arguably might not even be possible because of biological realities, I don't understand how men think they're getting the short end of the stick because of their having to pay for dates. I'd pay that much simply not to have horrible period cramps every month... Being a woman is just way more annoying and painful across the board, men paying for dates feels like an offer to help carry that load and it just feels kind in this way.

Until that changes my viewpoint is whoever acts pays. Because I find it's very telling that men only care about 50/50 when it comes to finances. I imagine the reason so many men have an issue with paying for dates is not because they think both parties should be putting in equal effort but because they're tired of paying for dates and not getting sex in return. Because I statistic shows and generally do not put an equal effort in their relationships as they can't even pull their own weight in chores and childcare.",

I'd cook or he'd cook or we'd decide where to go and one of us would pay one week and the other would pay the next.

Many people still want traditional gender roles in their relationships and that\u2019s ok. I wouldn\u2019t call that freeloading. It\u2019s signaling what kind of relationship they are looking for.

And (particularly!) if you then don\u2019t tip or tip poorly. \n\nMaking complicated drinks is the fun part of the job! It\u2019s just *most* fun when it\u2019s for an appreciative customer who understands that their drink order is complicated and will take some time to put together, and when it\u2019s not at the height of the rush. \n\nIf it\u2019s last call and there\u2019s a long line behind you maybe reconsider the mojito. At that point it\u2019s not primarily an issue of being inconsiderate to the bartender, but to *the other bar patrons* who all have to wait for your complicated thing and may or may not even get through the line before the bar is legally obligated to stop serving (depending on jurisdiction) \u2014 and who are probably already intoxicated enough that some of them will decide to take out their frustrations at the wait on the bartender. But if it\u2019s dead on a random Tuesday evening, your bartender is probably thrilled to have something interesting to do and at least a few good tips for the shift.\n\nEdit to add: my personal favorite drink to make has always been Bloody Marys. They\u2019re complicated and fun, and I\u2019m good at them, and people who like them always appreciate my skills.",
            "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unpopular. I am a bartender, and have been for over 15+ years. If anybody\u2019s bitching about making any cocktail, or judging somebody for their drink order, they\u2019re not a bartender. Just a brat behind a bar. I don\u2019t care how busy you are; a good bartender understands how to control their guests expectations. If somebody orders five Mojito\u2019s and the bar is packed, it is the bartenders responsibility to politely let the guest know that their drinks will be out as soon as possible, but it might take more than five minutes.",

And then it stacks into them also not tipping because they think you take to long. Which stacks into more no tipping because they think you take to long.

It\u2019s a very pretty drink with the crushed raspberry, so everyone that saw it ordered one too. One bartender only muddled mint the entire night.

Then I\u2019ll gladly pour it unfiltered over soda water and top it off with extra ice just because I have respect.

            "It's a bit of a meme that's been blown out of proportion, but it generally comes down to the situation.  Like obviously you can order a mojito, if the bar doesn't make them they'll tell you so.\n\n\nBut if you're at some dive bar and the bartender is 6 deep and people are waiting forever for drinks, the considerate thing to do is to keep it simple. And it's not just for the bartender, it's for everyone. That doesn't mean you have to, but the definition of \"considerate\" when it comes to service workers is generally defined by doing things you don't have to do, but that make life easier for everyone."

Minimum wait times of 2 hours to go on a ride that lasts 3 minutes? If you look at the way these new rides are being built, 99% of the ride is just space for the queue.\r  \n\r  \nNow on top of paying nearly $300 for one day at the park (hopper pass), you have to also purchase $20+ passes to get on rides, otherwise you're going to waste your entire day sitting in a 3 hour line.\r  \n\r  \nWe purchased a genie+ pass was just enough to get us on a few rides, the one attempt we made to get on a ride without the genie pass, we waited in line for 2 hours only to have the ride break down (of course Disneyland doesn't do rain checks unless you have a fast pass...)\r  \n\r  \nThe nail in the coffin is that Disneyland doesn't really offer things that other amusement parks don't offer anymore. Their ride technology and themed areas are on par with places like Universal Studios (which is less than half the cost). Any edge they have on quality is completely diminished by the sheer amount of people and lines you have to compete with constantly. Its hard to notice all the details and work that was put into the park when you are just constantly in a sea of people.\r  \n\r  \nI just don't see the money or effort being worth it anymore.

I don\u2019t understand why people get the hopper pass, that is a waste, walking back and forth between parks is just a waste of time, just focus on one park a day.\n\nAs far as overcrowding, Universal was much more crowded than Disneyland, there we actually spent two hours in line for one ride.",

Then we'd go over to California Adventure get some fast passes grab a drink and some food then maybe ride one more ride and be out by 1pm. Getting off of work/school in the middle of the week and going to catch a ride and fireworks was also nice. You can't do those things now.\n\nA whole day at the park is a coin flip on whether it's fun or miserable. The reservation system makes short trips less fun. The cost of a day for a family is too much.\n\nI disagree that Universal Studios or Knott's is on the same level. Universal doesn't have as much to do there and this is only more true now that the FX and animal shows are gone. Knott's is too crowded because the passes are cheap and the lines are too long.",

So I had all these restaurant times and fast passes and none of them worked out becuase we just wanted a relaxing time at the park and not have to run back and forth to get to the timed slots we had. It sucked. I didnt want to have to plan every minute of the vacation. \n\n I also spent 2 days at Universal and honestly had so much more fun at Universal. I remember all of those rides vividly, but I really cant remember any of the Disney World rides I went on. and they had the single lines, instead of fast passes, so you can ride single rider. That was amazing. I went on so many rides in a row because who cares if youre sitting next to someone you dont know for 45 seconds. I probably went on the Mummy ride like 15 times and still did all the other rides too. and had plenty of time to shop and eat and just relax. It was nice.",

We'd enter the park near opening, and send a runner to get our fast passes from the \"big ride\" we wanted to go on, and organize around that.    We'd enter an area, grab the fast pass for the big attraction,  While waiting, we would go see all the other attractions, or wait in line for the smaller rides.  We would go on the fast pass ride when it was our time, and then head onto the next area.\n\nI felt you could do a whole park in a single day, and see everything you wanted to.\n\nWith Genie, I feel like I am just on my phone trying to see what rides are available and crisscrossing the park several times to get to them.

And then by the end of the day when the park is less crowded, I was able to circle back and hit my absolute favorites one more time.\n\nPerhaps I just went at a less busy time, but overall I had a great experience.

            "This is my biggest worry about ever returning. My very first job thirty years ago was at Disneyland, and in the years since (including a move to the east coast soon after I left Disneyland) I would visit about every year or so. Once I got married and had a kid things got more expensive but i was still able to visit about every two or three years. My sister still lives in Orange County so that saves us a ton of money on transportation and lodging. We haven't been since COVID, but the last two times we went (2019 and 2017) there was some kind of miracle drop in attendance because there were no lines in any of the rides, even the popular ones. We actually thought the Haunted Mansion was closed because there were no people outside of it. Turns out it was open and we just walked from the gate straight into the elevator and onto the Doom Buggy with no waiting. \n\nSeeing the ridiculousness that's going on now with these 2 hour+ waits plus additional charges for these apps if you want to guarantee a spot in line makes me worry that any future trips to SoCal to visit my sister won't include a trip to Disneyland because it just might not be worth it.",

            "According to the Disneyland site, a single adult day pass is $104, and an additional $65 for a park hopper. I'm not sure where the $300 is coming from. I'm someone who would go to Disney on a regular basis growing up (my parents were annual pass holders). Fast passes used to be entirely free, but I've heard this has since changed, which is definitely very disappointing. \n\nAs for crowds, going during the summer or a major holiday is always the biggest mistake that people make because literally everyone has the same idea, therefore, crowded as hell. Go during a quieter time, and the lines are far more manageable. \n\nAlso, another tip for saving money: stay at a hotel at the cross walk rather than staying at a Disney hotel. It's the same walking distance (if not closer, depending which hotel you pick), and much cheaper.",
