As someone who's never earned much money because I made the spectacular decision to do what I love rather than what was lucrative, I'm finally in a position in my late 30s where I can actually save up to buy my dream car.\n\nI get it if cars aren't important to you. I get it if you dislike the impact they have on the environment. I get it if you think sports cars are too expensive and a hassle. I get it if you see a forty something guy in a BMW M3 and assume he's compensating for something. But realize that automotive enthusiasm is a huge part of life for a lot of people, and can often be the biggest connection they have to family members or friends. \n\nAs a car enthusiast, I look forward to increased electrification for a lower carbon footprint (and ridiculous torque for better acceleration). I accept that my budget will have to increase for a cool exotic car and decrease for other pursuits. It's worth it to me. Just like you might enjoy collecting stamps or having a closet full of nice clothes. It's also the first thing I talk about when I call my dad since he used to race cars and motorcycles in the 70s. We bond over cars and car news.\n\nSo the next time you see some guy with graying temples and a widow's peak driving a Ferrari, understand it might be the realization of a dream from childhood and try to, you know, not crap on that dream because it's not YOUR dream.",

            "The important distinction here is age. I dont really hear this stereotype about middle aged people, instead more about people in their 20s. The reason is the means in which they could get the cars at such a young age, most likely through family connections like rich parents. Essentially cheating the system, they would be seen as not deserving such a luxury compared to someone who works towards it themselves. Another reason is the fact that 20s is seen as the irresponsible age and would probably not properly respect the car. For car enthusiasts im sure it would hurt to see such cars be neglected or even destroyed in drunken stupor",

I bought the car because of how much fun it was to drive and I only got rid of it because I got divorced and couldn't afford it anymore.\n\nI'm now in my mid-30's and I'm thinking about getting another one soon (Fiat 124 Spider) and people genuinely say to me \"Isn't it a little early for you to be going through a midlife crisis?\". And every time I say the same thing, \"I'm buying it because it's fun to drive and I can now afford it.\", and they always chuckle and walk away like \"yeah, right!\".\n\nNow I can kind of understand people thinking that if I was buying something way more expensive than I could reasonably afford (Ferrari, Lamborghini, etc.), but it's just a fun, semi-practical car that's less than the average price for a new car these days.

People see someone driving a Benz or a Porsche and think \"wow, bet that guy/girl is a prick\".  They see someone flying first class/business class and think that person must be the stereotypical asshole who stepped on the necks of good, hardworking salt of the earth people like themselves.  The truth is that most people with these nicer things work hard.  They sacrifice.  They were probably daring and suffered through a lot of failures and setbacks before their current \"success\".  If people can't get past their immature preconceived notions and choose to negatively view those of us who enjoy nice things , that's their own problem.  I could not care less as their opinions are worthless and will remain worthless for as long as they choose to remain petty.  I would encourage everyone to enjoy the fruits of their labor.",

So, they go without fancy cars or adult vacations to exotic places or other luxuries.  Then they push those kids out of the nest; send them on their way in life.

But p, right now, I have to play the cheapest courses, always play twilight/weekdays and sometimes drive a long way to play at bumfuck rural courses that have a \u201c$5 Fridays\u201d deal. \n\nSome people think it\u2019s asinine to spend $10,000 a year to be a member of a country club (I know it\u2019s not as pervasive as the car stereotype but still), and on paper, I completely get that view as it seems you do too. In the same way I would *never* spend real money on a car, you\u2019d never do the same on golf.

No more hard bunkers, indeterminate fairways, or massive patches of dirt, I\u2019ll be at a place that\u2019s lush, that has all the amenities and is close to my house, where I can sneak in 9 holes after work, or play marathon rounds of 36+ on the weekend and not worry about making rent.

I didn't buy a 'dad bike' either (I'm neither a dad nor into dad bikes), but rather a fairly sporty European motorcycle that has gobs of power - and I'm having a blast. It gets me out of the house almost daily, which will all the 'rona around, well... it's been really great for my mental health. I have a high stress job, and I often feel burned out and down; spending some money to get into a new hobby 'woke me up', and I'm enjoying life again.

Then you hit your adulthood and there's absolutely massive pressure to redirect time and energy to buying a house, \"settling down\" etc. In some ways you're absolutely right, after many of those major \"responsible\" expenses are finally in control, you can afford a better car.\n\nBut, I think it's also that through the last 50 years or so, that pressure to put away your own life / dad sacrifices for the family sort of culture would also eventually lead to a lot of men questioning if they had really lived their own life. And the most obvious thing is to snap back at that feeling by going back to something like a sports car.\n\nI feel like culture being more open about balancing personal and family life (especially children) will decrease sudden \"crises\" because men (and women!)

            "I'm probably going to go even more unpopular here, but to many people reading this, it will actually confirm that midlife crisis idea. You're describing finally fulfilling a youthful fantasy, and by doing so you're now the person you wanted to be when you were younger. And for some (in my experience) it tends to bring back memories and certain behaviour that is linked to that youthful period in their lives, making them feel younger in the process. That may not have been the conscious process, but it could very well play a subconscious role when deciding to buy a nice car (for instance when it comes to the model and colour).\n\nPersonally, I completely agree that buying a nice car for most people doesn't have anything to do with compensation for personal insecurities (especially the stereotype male 'length of appendage' thing) or filling a hole in their life, that part of the clich\u00e9 only applies to very few people I think. I understand wanting to buy a beautiful car for ages but never being able to until now. It's about appreciation of beautiful machines, and because it's such an expensive hobby, most people don't get to enjoy it until they're financially stable which usually takes time. But I think that for some (maybe only a few, maybe most) finally buying that dream car makes their inner kid/teenager/adolescent happy, takes them back to that simpler time of just being ecstatic over getting something you want, and does actually make them feel younger in a way. It's a different kind of feeling good than when you get/buy something you've developed an appreciation for later in life, in my experience. \n\nOur society is very weird in many ways, and the stereotypical midlife crisis idea shows that in a way: the ideal is your early adolescence (young body, low responsibility, but with the financial freedom later adulthood usually offers) but to be a responsible adult and accept that they have to suffer getting old, and if you do youthful stuff at an older age you're immature and in denial of your mortality. It's as if people are jealous of others living their childhood dreams because it's a confrontation with their own 'failure' to meet childhood expectations. The stereotypes to me feel like a 'sour grapes' situation: they can't have it, so yours must have a negative reason or result so they can rationalize the situation. I don't think that (wanting) to fulfill that childhood fantasy is bad, I don't think feeling like a younger version of yourself is bad, and even IF you feel like the clich\u00e9 of feeling younger might fit you a bit after reading this, you don't need to defend your honour or something because it's not something to defend: it's not a bad thing. \n\nAnyway, enjoy your car!",

I could have bought any car I wanted any time after college graduation but I have always had an efficiency mindset and went for what was practical.

You see a sandwich and think \u201clunch\u201d. You see a plate of raw vegetables and you presume that it should be eaten before dinner. But there\u2019s absolutely no reason for any of these things. \n\nJust like in Southeast Asia people expect a gruel made out of leftover rice to be served at breakfast, even in fancy restaurants and hotels, and they can\u2019t imagine any other way. Or in the Middle East they expect to see feta cheese, cucumbers, hummus and pita bread at breakfast even though Americans consider this \u201clunch food\u201d.

Dopamine is released _before_ doing a thing, it's your motivator, you see that dessert and dopamine will start flowing, then you take a bite and the dopamine levels off, because you completed the task that the dopamine set out to make you do. If you still want more cake, more dopamine is released and you take another bite, after which it levels off again. This is why depressed people can be hungry and still not feel like eating, there's no dopamine to motivate them. It's also the root of ADHD and similar disorders, deregulated dopamine can make you too impulsive or not motivated, or both intermittently.",

            "It used to be more like this. The original three over-the-air broadcast networks ABC, NBC, and CBS faced much stricter regulations in the early days of television. They were required to air a certain amount of news each day day and they were expected, if not required, to present both sides of an issue. Advertising was also restricted during the time slot when news was aired. But as the industry was deregulated, news time ad space became more and more profitable. The people buying your ad space are the same people buying our politicians and they want a narrative driven a certain way in order to buy an ad, the network is going to do it, and thanks to deregulation, there is nothing to stop them.",

When an organization can be entirely dismissed simply because they report the facts on a story that other sources have pre-emptively guarded you against, it becomes impossible for any actual news organization to present stories and facts without being called fake or biased.\n\nCovid is practically the golden modern example of this. Go to your local news station's social media page and select a story that just presents some numbers and quotes from officials. Then look at the comments. The amount of people calling them fake news, or accusing them of stirring up fear and lies, based on absolutely nothing more than that person's personal bias, may just give you some insight into just how unfairly the media in general is treated and expected to be.  The vast majority of your local news affiliates are going to be presenting very bare bones reporting on national events. A happened, B and C are saying D about A, and E is what we might expect if D doesn't happen. Etc.. just a simple example of the flow of information through most news organizations.  The amount of pure vitriol directed at news organizations is insane and I really think people who jump to criticize the worst of them are ignoring the vast majority that are caught up in the crossfire just for doing their jobs.\n\nPeople are -dumb-.

Any big news story will have dozens of reports from local to national.\n\nPeople's low opinion of news worries me. I feel like people who claim that news is not telling the whole story are really just upset that the story is not what they wanted to be. It is easier to blame big media for your troubles than to reflect on your own bias. And placing restraints on media will only allow the powerful to get away with more bullshit.",

            "I\u2019m a maths teacher in Australia. I recently taught my Year 9 class about how the progressive income tax system works here. A student asked during the class \u201care you going to show us how to fill out a tax return?\u201d to which I replied \u201cdo you know how to fill out a form on a website?\u201d The student said yes, so I said \u201ccool, you know how to fill out a tax return.\u201d I then elaborated about how tax legislation is always changing and that if you have a complicated situation like you run your own business then you would probably make use of a tax accountant. \n\nWe then talked about some of the fallacies in political arguments about progressive tax, in particular high income earners making false claims about the proportion their taxes make up of the income. For example in Australia, the top tax bracket is $51, 667 plus 45c for every $1 over $180 000. It\u2019s not unheard of to hear people in the media complain that they pay half their income in taxes if they\u2019re in the top bracket. A quick glance at the tax table shows that a person whose taxable income is $180 001 pays 28.71% of their gross income in tax.\n\nThis then lends itself to another interesting question: if you\u2019re a small business owner, should you pay yourself a salary to be taxed under personal income tax, or pay tax on profits? In Australia the small business tax rate is 26%, so clearly in the case that you earn $180 001 you\u2019re better off taking the profits of your business than paying yourself that same amount as a salary. \n\nEveryone in the room was satisfied that there were way more interesting questions to ask about tax that they were capable of grappling with than \u201chow do I complete my tax return?\u201d",

            "The thing is, it's not taxes and bank balancing that are tricky. That stuff isn't too hard. But understanding a loan or mortgage? Understanding interest rates, how credit cards work, how your credit score works, all that stuff is much more complicated, and unfortunately, much more important. This is where so many people, myself included, fuck up. I didn't realize that $4500 car was actually going to cost me over $9000 because of the interest rate. Nobody explained to me that other banks could see my credit score, I thought I just burned a bridge with Pioneer Bank, I didn't know EVERY bank could see my credit score. To a lot of people, this stuff seems obvious, but to those of us who grew up poor? Who's parents made the same stupid mistakes and didn't know better? It's a big contributing factor to WHY we're poor. Theres dozens more examples, but I think you understand what I'm driving at. Eric Cartman once bought a bunch of stuff on credit with no interest/no payments for 2 years and then said \"that's how you people stay poor forever, right Kenny?!\" That joke is funny but also painful because it's true.

If maths wasn\u2018t mandatory most people wouldn\u2018t take that either most students don\u2018t want to learn so we force them to to an extent so why not with taxes etc. Btw 16 or 17 year olds would most likely take those classes and even if it\u2018s just the minority you should still give the people who are interested the chance to learn how taxes work with a teacher who knows what they\u2018re talking about.",
            "You are correct but then at least the state would be doing right by it\u2019s citizens. Whether or not to pay attention is personal choice and there will always be wasters in society no matter what you do. The point is that the state should not be complicit in the uselessness of the people.",
            "Agreed. I was a straight A student and learned about taxes, retirement savings, etc in my junior year of high school, and still didn't retain that information. I just plowed through it and purged after. Luckily right after college and I was in charge of my own finances, I started going through everything with a fine tooth comb. I guess being an engineer makes you want to optimize everything. But I can totally see why most people are ignorant of it all.",

            "In my senior year in high school in 1977 we were offered a selection of six week short courses for our English credits. One of them was \"Death\", which taught among other things that modern life segregated death in such a way that it was no longer a familiar part of our life cycle compared to the past when it was a part of day to day life. It also gave sore practical advice on how to support loved ones in grief, e.g. there is need to talk much but just being present and spending time with them is very helpful. We had a great English department in our school. \n\nI also took a class on vocational education as an elective. Learned a lot about how to survive and succeed in the work place.",

When something interests me, or if something is actually useful in the real world, I enjoy learning about it and make sure I fully understand it. A great example of this is when I finally got into biology, we learned about digestion, respiration, nerves, the heart, etc. This stuff is actually useful to me so I worked much harder in that class so I could understand it best.",

As a parent the ecd class very much prepared me not only to change diapers and make bottle but also the toddler stages. How children learn and how every child is different. Also the fake baby we had for like 10 days made me immediately get on birth control. Lol. That baby cried and I cried towards the end. My dad started driving me to school because I was too tired to do it myself. I knew a real baby was way harder and I noped tf out real quick. Plus, my teachers were really good. Cool, laid back, all of us were friends and it was a very easy environment. You weren\u2019t afraid to ask any question. I think the teachers made the difference.",

            "Actually, at my school there is a class called personal finance that a teacher started about 10 years ago. Because it was an optional course (they don't force you to take it like math or science) people did pay attention. And when it comes to people taking said course usually (at least in my highschool expirence) it was always packed.\n\nWe also have a cooking class too! For that there's a room with like 5 or 6 stoves/ovens and microwaves and they just explain recipes and you have to make them. In my expirience usually 10-20 kids take the class. (This is in a school of ~360 kids)\n\nFor both of these you just sign up as you would any other class. Not sure if its the same everywhere but in 11th and 12th grade they just let you pick whatever other classes you want (- the manditory math and french). And, at least for personal finance you don't have to get good grades in math previous years to sign up cause there's like different levels. Lvl.1 - practical knowledge. Lvl.2 - basic understanding + a little theory. Lvl.3 - Theory, understanding the history etc.\n\nMind you, I'm Canadian and go to a relatively small highschool so I have no clue how it'd work in America.",
            "Well to be honest at my old school we used to have both economic (taxes, stocks and other ways of using money that would result in more money) and cooking classes which were so popular that our school actually stopped making it a graded class and more of an in school activity so that the teachers had an easier time instead of also having to grade them and give them homework and concentrate more on teaching them how to do the activities. \n\nalso because our school was mainly for physical teaching and jobs (think farmers, animal handling, gardening and stuff like that) first aid and safety classes were also mandatory which although some subjects weren't as loved (mainly wound treatment and that sort of thing) in general it was for most people an incredibly fun and interesting class, especially the intoxication on the work floor week and the fire safety week were well loved.\n\nWith those kind of subjects it isn't that people don't want to learn it they don't want to be graded for it and also the way they are learning it matters a lot.",
            "Cooking classes are easy to pay attention to because you actually do the things, like I had to do cooking in middle school and we all got to eat what we made after so it was actually fun. But yes the taxes thing, nobody would pay attention lol",

I loved cooking but the real reason i took those was to break up the day for me and get my mind some time to relax an recharge before doing school work  again. It was a very basic class so all we did was cook macaroni and souls and stuff but i still learned a bunch and it was really fun.",

            "Culinary class was a thing that I absolutely loved and enriched my young bleak life. Opened up many opportunities down the road. Wood working class taught me I could build and make nearly anything I wanted if I could imagine it. Electronics class taught me the basics I needed to know to diagnose and repair damn near anything in cars to computers. Auto tech class taught me how to turn a wrench and work on my cars. Those were the ones that were available to me in high school. And those are the ones that hold the most nostalgia and meaning in my life to this day. As they provided me with the know how and the confidence that I can do anything I put my mind and hands to. \n\nIf there were more classes on taxes, financial guidance maybe psychology and many countless others life skill classes. Would likely be the doors of discovery needed for young minds to find what sparks that passion for interest into a meaning life. \n\nBy what OP is saying is to have a more standardized schooling system that doesn\u2019t teach us nil to the real things in life? What type of classes would you rather see if not more life skill classes? \n\nA forced redirect and ideology does not produce independence only captivity.",

The thing is, these programs aren't thinking about the individual but rather a community as a while. These programs need to be implemented and required without being forced on anyone. Is EVERYONE going to pay attention? No. But it could make a difference to the point that instead of maybe 1 percent of said community knowing how to do basic things maybe that grows to 20 percent. Kind of a pipe dream but you know what. I'm sick of people knowing only their anecdotal stories and assuming that they apply to everyone. It doesn't.",

            "I have to call bs, when I was still in grade school the middle school and high school I went to offered these classes and I took most of them. Because of that I have the skill to be able to cook myself, and do most of the time, I also own and use a sewing machine to mend jeans and shirts that get ripped but still have life in them, I change my own oil and do 90% of the basic maintenance on my can and have done other repairs on cars like replacement of radiator, brakes, axle, wheel bearings and these are just the ones I can think off off hand that I have done. I also do my own taxes but school didn't teach me that and my parents had to teach me but I have been them on my own for years and even have helped teach friends how to do theirs. I understand there will always be people who take these classes to just mess around and treat it like a free period but for the ones who actually take them seriously they are skills that will be used throughout the rest of their life.",
            "It would have depended on how strict the grading was.  Everybody gets a Pass?  No, I would blow it off.  Everybody is graded on some impossibly hard scale?  Blow it off.  Fair, but tough?  Study my brains out.",

            "I didn't know this was a thing, and now I do, and definitely have to agree with you.",

            "The equivalence you're trying to draw assumes that both cases are only about not protecting the other party from an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nStealthing is much worse, because in addition to potentially causing an unwanted pregnancy, you also put the other person at risk for getting an STD. \n\nAnd with regards to lying about birth control: if you don't want a baby, wear a condom. It's not that hard.",
            "If a man lies about having a vasectomy and has sex with you does that also count?\n\nIf it does than sure, I do agree. However, if men want to be serious about unwanted pregnancies, bring condoms of your own. Don\u2019t gamble it on her taking her pill every day on time. Pregnancies still happen on the pill.",

Obviously pregnancy, but also STDs. \n\nBoth are shitty, but they aren\u2019t the same.",
            "I agree that both are deceptive sex. If sex is had under agreed upon terms, such as wearing a condom or having birth control, then breaking those terms should be criminal. However, I do think we should acknowledge that the two are not entirely equivalent. For a man, if a woman tells him she is on birth control but is lying, the man still has the option to wear a condom to ensure his safety if he chooses. For a woman, if the man tells her he is wearing a condom, the woman can't just take birth control right then and there to ensure her safety. Her situation depends entirely on the man keeping his word to wear a condom (assuming she isn't already on BC). Still, I agree that both are deceptive and should be considered criminal.",
            "Nope.\n\nWhy they\u2019re not the same:\n\nCondoms do much more than prevent pregnancy, they prevent disease *that can kill you.* When a partner, male or female, trusts the male partner to wear a condom, they are trusting them **with their life.**\n\nObviously not all STIs are fatal, but at least one is and more than one is for life.\n\nStating this *strictly in the form of forced paternity,* purposefully ignores the very obvious other purpose for condoms.\n\nIf you\u2019re man enough to get it up, you\u2019re man enough to put one on.",

            "So these are two very different acts.\n\nStealthing involves non-consensual fluid transfer that can result in a much greater risk of STDs and pregnancy.\n\nNot being on oral contraceptive birth control exposes a greater risk of pregnancy, but involves an underlying sexual contact that involved consensual fluid transfer and, therefore, unprotected STD risk.\n\nLying about being on an oral contraceptive is fraudulent inducement - not rape.  The fluid contact was consensual.\n\nStealthing/condom removal involves non-consensual fluid transfer - rape.\n\nNot saying the fraudulent inducement is \"ok\" at all - it's just different.",

            "I\u2019ll add another point to why you shouldn\u2019t love your career. I had a job that I would call a dream job. I worked for a large, publicly traded company that provides medical insurance for cats and dogs. When I got my finance degree I told my husband that my dream was to find a way to use accounting to help animals. This job gave me that dream!  Add to that, I was allowed to bring my dog to the office with me!  It was pure heaven. \n\nExcept for the 50-mile EACH WAY commute. And I worked payroll so it wasn\u2019t like I could work from home. Payroll really needs to be an in-office job when you have 500+ employees. Add to that, because I was the only person doing it, I was working no less than 60 hours a week. I burned out fast. I finally put in my notice after 2 years. It was one of the worst experiences of my life, leaving that job. \n\nAnd here is why you shouldn\u2019t love your career. Or at least don\u2019t take your dream job. You\u2019ll work too hard with a smile on your face. You\u2019ll miss out on important things with your family. Your blinders will be so dark that you\u2019ll consider missing your grandmother\u2019s funeral so that you can be in the office to help with month-end closing. And when you finally shrug off your Stockholm syndrome, you\u2019ll feel like garbage over it.

I am merely saying that capitalism has its downsides.\n\nCapitalism values profit. Why? Because if a company doesn't make a lot of profit, it's shareholders will be displeased. However profit comes at a cost. One needs to make the productionchain cheaper. This can of course be done by making the production process more efficient, but there comes a point when maximum efficientcy has been achieved. So a company has to cut the costs of employees. This means that a worker has to work more for the same or less salary, because this is more efficient with money, so it leads to more profit. Or could even be fired. What this means is that the worker will have less free time and less money to do things with in the little free time he/she has. This is a very simple explination of the problem.\n\nSolutions to this would be a reasonable minimum wage and more paid leave\n\nNow, call me a filthy commie",

I have good pay and good hours. I can finally not worry about taking my dogs to the vet, can save up for a car, maybe move out of this terrible abusive house, and can afford to eat. My brother can no longer hold everything over my head and threaten to put me and my dogs out cause he doesn't like something I said.\n\nBut I got to the jobsite after 2 weeks of training, and for what looks to be miles there is nothing but mud. Trees all around the outskirts, far off you can see smoke from where they're burning them down. This is weighing so heavily on my conscience. I am all about lessening my carbon footprint, taking care of the earth. Every time I sit in that big truck burning diesel fuel into the atmosphere and see all the machines, smoke, I can only think of the thousands, maybe millions of ecosystems that have been destroyed. All the animals run off from their homes, maybe killed in the deforestation process. God I hate myself. \n\nI can't quit. My dad would stop talking to me or at the very least it would ruin our relationship cause he really stuck his neck out for me to get this job, and he's the only non-manipulative family I have. I wouldn't have a ride to work cause I have nobody to take me - the only reason I make it to this job is cause my brother works with me. The verbal abuse here would get so terrible again and I've already attempted suicide from it - quitting would just mean I'd be threatened, called lazy, a leech, a bitch and more even though I want to work but it's impossible without a ride. \n\nI don't want to ruin this planet. I want to take care of it and fight the good fight. I hate that I have to choose between taking care of myself and my dogs or not destroying earth. I wish it could be both.

Sometimes the derp next to you gets a promotion and a payrise in their first year, and you're the one who trained them. Not everyone can be a high-paid manager/worker.

I understand that it comes from a good place, but if you truly want to support those on the front line, support them by demanding proper equipment, better pay, better hours and properly funded healthcare services, now And once this is all over. It would be appreciated a whole lot, and it benefits you, our patients, on the worst days of your life.",

Fire fighters signed up to save people in fires, but they're not rushing into dangerous situations without proper safety gear.\n\nHealthcare workers aren't upset about taking care of sick people.  They're upset about the conditions they're essentially being forced to deal with. Basically all safety rules have been thrown out the window because hospitals and governments completely fucked up.\n\n----\n\n\nYou do realize about 20% of infections are healthcare workers.",

            "First off, it\u2019s not just doctors, in fact there are significantly more nurses, respiratory tech, etc. on the front lines of this battle. Second, nurses and techs did not go into this job agreeing to put their lives on the line. They are not soldiers. People are clapping because medical professionals in hospitals around the world are not being provided with proper protective equipment, are asked to work In hazardous conditions and put their own lives and the lives of their families at risk, and are still showing up every day for the benefit of other people. And third, even if this was part of the job description, which it\u2019s not, doctors get paid significantly more than nurses and techs. Some might think that $500k is appropriate compensation for this danger.

A firefighter knows they are going to be asked to run into a burning building. They sign up for it because the risk reward calculation in their head makes it worthwhile. I never expected to be thrown into a situation like this when I dreamed of being a doctor as a wee tyke. And the soldier and the firefighter are trained specifically for those situations and given the appropriate gear to combat them. Would a soldier ever be expected to run onto the battlefield without a gun? A firefighter into a burning building without his gear? And do the people who clap now not remember a few months ago when so many of them were vilifying doctors for being greedy and heartless and in the pockets of big pharma prescribing expensive medications just to line their own pockets? And didn't I recently hear about medicare proposing a 20% reduction in physician reimbursements? Because the 10% of healthcare costs that make up physician salaries is the first place to start trimming to save money on healthcare, not the hundreds of millions of dollars paid to hospital CEOs and many hundreds of millions to billions more paid to all the other executives and administrators who never lay hands on a patient. No, you can keep your worthless  applause and insincere platitudes which you only give because you are scared you might be the next one in the ER struggling to breathe, relying on one of those evil doctors to put his or her life on the line to take care of you.

            "I was in Disney World a few months ago with my brother who has muscular dystrophy, a degenerative muscle disease that will eventually lead to him being unable to walk or use his arms. At home, he still refuses to give up and confine himself to a wheelchair, instead relying on a cane and various methods of assistance to help him stand up. But for Disney, we wanted him to be able to enjoy himself and relax and not feel too sore after a day, so he decided to use one of those motorized scooters - he refused to allow me to push him around all week in a manual chair, despite it being easier for him. He\u2019s the kind of guy who gets along with everyone, makes friends with everyone, and we ended up having a long chat with one of the Disney staff who was helping him get set up with the disability pass. She told us that she feels personally conflicted, as there are a limited number of motorized chairs available, and she sees the vast majority going to people who are even just slightly overweight. People who don\u2019t necessarily need them, but use them bc they are convenient and easy. And that detracts from those like my brother who truly rely on these. She also said that lately there has been a large number of families who are not obese, have no disability, but instead rent these chairs just for their children to ride around in and skip lines - and they can\u2019t really do anything bc they can\u2019t ask for some sort of proof, just if it\u2019s a mobility issue or mental issue (don\u2019t think she used the word mental, but she was talking about autism/add).

            "I\u2019m an Occupational Therapist. Based on the # of upvotes, OP\u2019s title is not an unpopular opinion. But this comment is: I disagree.\n\nI agree that it sucks to not have equipment when you need it, like scooters at grocery stores. But consider a patient who is diagnosed with an illness that can\u2019t be seen. There are many of those \u201cinvisible\u201d disabilities out there. Narcolepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic lumbar back pain. Or a complication from a surgery \u2014 maybe an infection on a weight bearing joint. You have this hypothetical person who is suffering and less mobile than they used to be, who chooses to self-medicate with food. Sugar can have druglike properties when consumed, with areas of the brain lighting up in similar patterns to cocaine. Regardless of the persons knowledge of poor coping skills, they put on weight. They become more and more immobile, and they are suffering.\n\nSelf inflicted disabilities are, to be sure, frustrating to see \u2014 but many of them are comorbidities. And exercise, once you become large enough, can cause more pain and joint damage; water aerobics are recommended as a starting point because it is gravity-eliminated.\n\nShould we deny someone who is large, who may be trapped in their own fat, the ability to access the world? I say no. If manual propulsion hurts too badly, these patients won\u2019t get out of bed anymore. They\u2019ll be home bound and totally dependent on others \u2014 like in 600 lb life.\n\nIf you want morbidly obese people to have a shot at losing weight and becoming more mobile, provide them with a power chair \u2014 they can be rented, not just purchased \u2014 and education about DIET. When the caloric intake is less than TDEE, the weight loss comes. And when of a moderate BMI, THEN exercise can be introduced gradually as a sustainable habit.\n\nNo one should judge anyone else without knowing their medical history, and no one with a disability should be denied the opportunity to interact with the environment.",

            "As someone who works in the industry, I can assure you that this is an ongoing debate and struggle. It is clear that there is a correlation between disability and mental health, and between mental health and obesity. I represent Soldiers who are leaving the Army due to disability. Many of these people were very active. Many defined themselves by their fitness. Now, they have to struggle not only with their disability, but with their loss of income and self. Of course this leads to mental health challenges. Because they were so fit, many did not have to think about their relationship with food and struggle to redefine that relationship now that their bodies can't keep up. I think that echos, to some degree, most of our transitions from our young, healthy metabolisms and active lives to older, more sedentary ones. As a result, most gain weight. They have a difficult time figuring out how to keep it off without exercise. They are offered counseling both for nutrition and for behavioral health. But still, as we all know, its a daily struggle made more complicated by their limitations.\n\nThat being said, we do not advocate using disability or mental health as an excuse for excessive weight gain. Of course, we compassionately understand that this is an incredible challenge and there is more to this than that they are \"lazy.\" These are NOT naturally lazy folks. However, blaming it entirely on your disability and behavioral health allows a person to completely avoid taking any responsibility in their condition. You did NOT gain 100+ pounds because of your disability. You gain some weight, maybe 50 pounds or so is the average I usually see. But you do not become chronically and severely obese for any other reason than you are eating too much and moving too little. You can change this. You can get treatment for your physical and behavioral health. There are ways you can manage weight and have a disability. But you need to take an active and realistic approach to this process. You must acknowledge that this much weight gain is a choice, not something forced upon you. That is difficult to do with physical and mental health challenges, no question. But it is far from impossible.\n\nOur concern, as an industry, is that the conversation about obesity and disability sometimes either demonizes these individuals or gives them cover for their worst impulses by telling them there is something else entirely to blame. Or that its too hard, so don't even try. Or that there is some miracle cure that doesn't require them to take any responsibility or make any changes. We can talk about this with understanding and compassion, while still encouraging them to face the bitter truth that THEY, not their disability, are most to blame for their condition. They don't have to be this way. They have a choice. Many feel they have no control over their own bodies and their own lives. We owe it to them to tell them, repeatedly, that this isn't true. They can't just give up. And this doesn't make them bad people. It also doesn't mean they can't love themselves because there is so much more to love about a person than their appearance. \n\nPlease realize, this process is long. Many who are obese are also disabled. Not going to lie, sometimes the disability comes after the weight gain and not before. But that doesn't mean they don't struggle to walk and need the carts as much as someone else. They may be working on this, feel terrible about their situation. They may not be at that place yet. But tarring and feathering certainly isn't helping. Your sentiment is correct, that you don't like them not taking personal responsibility for their condition, but your approach of ridicule and sarcasm is simply not going to help fix that. Not any more than the people who spout \"fat is beautiful\" as if they don't have to or can't fix it. Can we just start having a more nuanced conversation about a nuanced problem, rather than a snarky meme exchange for once?\n\nRant done. lol",

No, more like a little Cosco card but you just tap the electric wheelchairs so that way it keeps obese people *who are fine* off them.

Never mind that I was the main first aider at the school, or that the girl's knee was bleeding everywhere as she'd done a knee slide on gravel, or that I attended to it in the school's reception area. Apparently because I'm a man, I had to be watched at all times.\n\nNo one saw the shocking level of sexism going on there, and how the children picked up on things being different with me, than with the female staff.

            "When I was about 12, me and some friends went to a local shopping centre. We were having a great time, laughing, joking, just being kids. A woman who was there with her children started yelling at us - \u2018How dare you laugh at my son! Just because he\u2019s different. Your parents should be ashamed of themselves for raising mean children like you.\u2019 \n\nWe hadn\u2019t even noticed this woman and her family, and had no idea what she was talking about. She had assumed that our laughing had to be related to her son who had some sort of developmental issue.\n\nNow I know this isn\u2019t the same thing, but my point is the same. Most of the time it isn\u2019t even about what your doing. People are so involved in their own lives, in their own insecurities, that they see everything as a threat. That everything revolves around them. When most of the time, people could care less about your kids. \n\nThe suspicious suspect suspicion. So I really do find it quite disturbing when people suspect sexual predators everywhere.",
            "Bro it\u2019s a shame. I worked at a summer camp as a camp counselor for like 4 years and you can tell the kids look up to the adults. When I started I was 13 and the kids thought I was like 25 (haha kids). Obviously I had NO thought of anything inappropriate but I loved being  around them. They were funny, Wild, talk about fortnite (this was towards the end of the 4 years). They truly made me laugh sometimes and you could tell they got a kick out of it and felt good that I was also enjoying their company. \n\nI know so many people, usually teenagers, who say \u201cugh I hate kids. They\u2019re so annoying and stupid\u201d and I just don\u2019t agree. Yes they CAN get annoying and MAY do stupid things but...they\u2019re kids!! They need guidance. And I don\u2019t mean just to teach them how to behave but a space where they can express themselves and be goofy and laugh and enjoy their youth. \n\nThere was no kid in my group (about 11-13 years old) who actually suffered from depression. He casually brought up one day that his mom and dad got a divorce because his mom came out as a homosexual. He said he also was bullied constantly by his twin sister and I saw it. She would constantly pick on him in front of the other girs in her group and he would sometimes just break down crying. He was on anti-depressants and went to therapy and everything. I could tel his peers in the group thought he was weird and annoying; they didn\u2019t know he was trying so hard to be accepted so they just took to making fun of him. So me and my counselors would give him the attention he needed when he sat alone or was being picked on. He tried out for the camp play (they have like a theater arts side thing where kids can be pulled from normal activities to do the end of summer play) and he was one of the lead roles because kid could sing! We told him he did a great job and even the other kids were like \u201cyou were going so crazy Tyler! Like LAAAAH\u201d \n\nMy point is that kids look up to adults and I know I did when I was young too; I wanted the cool counselor or cool older kid to think I was cool. These kid need guidance not just with \u201cgrow up and go to college!\u201d And \u201cit\u2019s okay to be different!\u201d But with being able to express themselves and have fun! I don\u2019t want kids to think EVERY adult is a damn predator; to be fair, at the camp I\u2019m at there are other adults and cameras everywhere so the chance of that predator type behavior is slim. Kids shouldn\u2019t be going into strangers vans, but if Leonardo Decaprio wants to talk to a fan at a public event, I see no harm.",
            "At my school there was this camp for all girls that was available during the summer. It was run by a very kind man who you could tell was just trying to help people. Unfortunately, he was over the age of 45, so that led everyone to believe that he was a pedophile. They still got a fair amount of participants every year though.",
            "I will say this: America has this strange \u2018fascination\u2019 with pedophilia. Shows like \u2018to catch a predator\u2019 etc etc seem to bring it out in people. Maybe it\u2019s the whole \u2018car wreck\u2019 thing where people just can\u2019t help but to look. I think that fascination(?) just causes people to see it everywhere.",
            "I worked at a restaurant by the waterfront for awhile. We had signs everywhere saying not to feed the birds because they were a serious problem and feeding them obviously makes it worse. \n\nWell, one day I was bussing tables and a little dude, maybe 3 or 4, was feeding fries to the birds. Dad is sitting there on his phone just ignoring it. So, I really nicely asked the kid \"hey man, could you not feed the birds please?\" That was enough for the dad to go off on me. He says \"how dare you address my kid directly? You don't do that. If you want him to stop doing something, you talk to the kid's parent. You have no right to address a kid without their parent's permission\"\n\nWell, asshole, you're hardly a parent allowing that kind of behavior to go on and just ignoring it. Hell, he was completely ignoring his kid until I said something to him. Furthermore, he's a human being and I'm being respectful to him. If I was being mean that'd be one thing, but I have every right to interact with whoever I want to as long as I'm showing them respect and only saying appropriate things. \n\nThis is part of why so many kids have social anxiety. They don't learn how to interact with anyone without their parent acting as a filter, and they are taught that anyone coming to talk to them is some kind of verbal attack. It's insane",
            "I once saw a kid on a bus looking at me happily, and I made a silly face to make him laugh.

If I had helped them down I could have been accused for mishandling a child.  If I didn\u2019t help them down and they fell, I could be accused of not interfering in a situation where the child became injured. \n\nI had a kid hit me and then the parent went to the board of education because I wrote a referral at my administrator\u2019s request and therefore labeled her child who couldn\u2019t have POSSIBLY done wrong.   We can\u2019t win. \n\nI had another kid assault me and I had to have the other kindergarteners go into the hallway unsupervised because I was already bleeding at this point and the other kids were in danger.  I could have gotten in MAJOR trouble for leaving 25 six year olds unattended, but fortunately I had a supportive principal.  \n\nThere comes a point where this has GOT to stop.

Please...have some grace with your kid\u2019s teachers. \n\nBy the way, a lot of folks bash teachers unions.  Are they perfect?  No way.  BUT, I have known MANY teachers (myself included) who pay to be members because NEA provides $1,000,000 in liability insurance each year in case we are wrongfully accused.

I\u2019m totally ready to be the chill but self righteous victim if anyone ever seriously tried to give me shit. I\u2019m not yet however ready to not be friendly to everyone, especially kids.\n\nI also think a lot of the problem is actually due to the fact that men have accepted this guilt and don\u2019t stand up for themselves, but self censor or remove themselves from innocent situations entirely out of fear. Not that men are ultimately to blame, but if we all had collectively said fuck this, I don\u2019t think it would ever have gotten like this.",

            "The real issue is a lack of education and the mass of myths surrounding child sexual abuse. The truth is that child sexual abuse is only very rarely committed by strangers. It's usually someone the kid knows and that includes their family members. Another thing people seem to ignore is that women can abuse kids just as easily as men, if not more easily due to the belief that kids are always safe with women. And if a kid is abused by a woman, especially if the kid is a boy, then they're much less likely to report their abuser. I've done a fair bit of childminding and I'm male. I can tell you now that parents with boys trust me a lot more than parents with girls. I feel fine taking the boys I look after to the park. I'd be terrified to be in public with the girls I look after. Absolutely terrified. I wouldn't hug them or hold their hand and anything.\nAs someone who was sexually abused as a kid, I can't help but be glad that people are more actively looking out for their kids - I was abused because nobody questioned an adult being alone with a kid. The scary thing is that I was abused by a woman and so I think it could still happen today. The reality of child sexual abuse is that any kid can be abused, boy or girl, and any psycho or sicko can abuse a kid, man or woman.",

            "This has been the same problem i have, i have been in the same relationship for 15 years this fall, sadly i cant have children because my sperm count is way to low, doesnt mean we dont try it.

(i am 40 she is soon 39.) \n\nI was always very engaged with my sisters kids from the moment they were born. I am their play uncle, i love playing with them, and this started very early from the phase of \"pick a bo\" to coloring, and puzzles. The oldest one really loves monopoly so i play that frequently with him.\n\nAnyway, i was baby sitting the older kid when he was 4 years old, yes i do actually love baby sitting. Well he wanted to go to the playground. So i take him there, there are 3 women watching the 2 children in the playground meaning one women is only there watching.\n\nSo he starts playing with the other kids and i mind my own business. But im not comatose, so i clearly see this women picking up her cell phone and making a call, 5 minutes later 2 police officers shows up in a police car. They watch what is going on and i miss this because i didnt think about it. Anyway they go up to the woman who made the phone call and she points directly at me.\n\nThe police officers approach me and i think, \"what the hell could they want to talk with me about?\" They come up and say \"What are you doing here?\" and i just automatically respone \"im watching over my nephew.\"  So they say something like \"which of these children are your nephew?\" So i call him over but he is very hesistant  Seeing two uniformed police officers next to me.\n\nSo after maybe 15 seconds (atleast that is what i remember but could obviously be wrong) i manage to make him come to me, using his name and that everything is perfectly fine, so he does come over.\n\nThe police instantly turns to another tactic seeing that one of the children there were apparently closely linked with me and say \"you have to leave, you are making the children uncomfortable\" and i say \"they havent even looked at me yet, they arent even aware i am here\" and they respons with something like \"you still have to leave, you are making them uncomfortable or could be making them uncomfortable\" and i just think what the hell could they even mean.\n\nAnyway they force me off the playground and i have to carry my crying nephew in my arms against his will being a lousy fucking uncle.\n\nI mean am i a threat to children, no im fucking not i love children and would gladly sacrifice my own life to protect them.

It actually hurts me, deep down into my soul that i cant be a good uncle.\n\nI work as a manager for a company and we have 2 days a year with a \"bring your family\" theme. I have worked for this company as a manager for 15 years now. Guess who all the mothers and fathers give their children away to? Yes that is me. Because i play with them, because i do actually care for them from the bottom of my heart. Do these parents have any problem at all giving them over to me temporarily, not one single problem. And it has been showed that parents mimic their childrens brain waves interacting with strangers. The children feel safe with me, and so does their parents.\n\nHave their been accidents, numerous, scrubbed knees and elbows and bruised forheads, along with broken nails, splinters, bug bites etc etc. Several things almost every year. Do the parents mind at all? No they dont they give their children to me to have a good time without their children bugging them with everything and instead bugging me, but i love it.\n\nHave i ever touched one of these kids in an inappropriate way, no i havent, im not interested at all in any of that, i just love children the way they are, what is so interesting to them, what makes them happy and engaged. Showing them the wonders of the world i experienced as a child.\n\nSo there i am the \"responsible one\" making a fucking fool of myself just to make the children laugh and i dont at all regret it.\n\nWhy do people assume i am an evil motherfucker that wants to harm children simply because im male? I love children, i love the way they see the world, i would give my life for any of those children in a fucking heartbeat. But no im an evil pedophile because im male.\n\nI cant stand it, i love when they call me names yes even derogatory names such as \"lazy baronmad\" \"ticklish baronmad\", \"blind baronmad\" \"baronmad that cant smell\" \"clumsy baronmad\" \"big foot baronmad\". And i do all these things just to give them a smile. Do i even at all care if these children calls me that infront of their parents, no not at fucking all. I would rather have their parents hate me and their children happy.\n\nIt is a pestilence this anti male view of looking at the world. It is especially bad for the children. Because they dont get to have fun with an adult which their parents have very little time to do with all the cooking and cleaning and getting breakfast in order and everything else.\n\nYes i work mostly in an office, but what happens often is that their parents just lumps them over to me, when they dont have the kindergarten open or other problems. And i love all of that. Taking the time away from my office while taking one of their children to a playground or just showing them the world which is so intrigueing to them. \n\nThey really do see everything in a new way of looking at the world, a cow, a horse, a butter flower, a 4 clover is so interesting to them. They see everything with wonder and excitement, but all i see is an old faded memory. But they give me the joy of seeing everything with new eyes. Where its a wonderful new mystery about everything that i have a hard problem to see because im older, and all i see is faded old memory of them, but because of the children i can see again, and can experience the wonder of the world. the inherant beauty of a sunset, the mystery of a fire and the flames, the inescapable beautty in a singly flower, the things we dont understandm why ants go they way they go.\n\nHow something so simple as lego can give them hundreds of hours of joy, just exploring what they can do and build on their own with a few suggestions of an adult. A car, a tractor, a doll, a parking lot, a gas station, an airport, a cradle, or a mother. And they will glady invest their time and effort into making it, for you. Just to see you smile and be happy about their creations.",

            "I think there is more of a miss representation here.  \n\nFirstly, your friends are shitting on you for playing on child mode because that's what friends do.   Shit on each other.  \n\nSecondly, the reason this sentiment exists is more because \"triple A\" publishers have been pumping out squeals of original great games... watered down and made more accessible at an obnoxious rate.  And have only focused on these titles not really daring to release something original or challenging. \n\nLooking at you bethesda.....Blizzard....Ubisoft.... shit pick one major publisher and you will see an example.  \n\nThis is the reason Dark Souls fans appreciate the series as much as they do.  Deamon souls and Dark Souls people today forget... were not major AAA releases.   They became one after, and instead of doing what every other publisher does with a franchise that goes mainstream.  They stuck to what makes the game great, it's very difficult but very fair combat stayed.   \n\nBut it doesn't have to be about just difficulty, it can also be about dumbing down of mechanics.  Take Fall out for instance, comparing the Fallout 4 to even New Vegas and the dumbing down of RP elements is glaring.   The addition of base building.... what is this waste land mine craft?    Fallout 4 is not a 'bad' game... it's just so inferior to predecessors that it's a shame.   And it'd directly related to the dumbing down and slapping on things from other games that don't really fit the franchise in order to try and snag more money.  \n\nOr look at Call of duty, a game i haven't played in years.... it was great at one time... like back in 2007.    \n\nSorry this ended up in a rant about how publishers fucking slap franchise names on games that are so different they lose the feel of what made the originals or even first sequal or two a great game.   In order to grab easy money by slapping a franchise name on it.\n\nI'm hopeful Diablo 4 is going to be good... but extremely skeptical that it will be.",

If you try to play on Legendary for the story, there are stretches in some of the games where you might be stuck on one level for an inordinate amount of time due to difficulty, and it really warps perception of the story just by the amount of time you spend in one area.\n\nHowever, as far as I'm concerned, if you play on Normal and still have trouble completing the game or finishing the story, then that's a you problem. It's the default challenge, typically meant for it to be reasonably doable so that you get the full experience. If you've gotta roll it back to Easy just so you can get the story, then I'm sorry, but, yeah, git gud.\n\nEDIT: To specifically note, however, the HALO games have a \"Heroic\" difficulty that's relatively unique to them, which is basically a bit harder than Normal, but is also the \"true\" way to play the game. Not as hard as Legendary, the hardest difficulty, but is the intended challenge.",

            "I'm a culinary student so I'll pull a quote straight out of my textbook:\n\n    \"We have two words about using pictures on menus or menu boards: Forget it. You can\u2019t possibly make the item look like the picture. We realize that pictures are critical marketing components of quick-service operations, but even so, we don\u2019t like them. It would be much better, and safer, to prepare a few sample plates and display them in the restaurant\u2019s entry area. At least these are realistic. Plus, they can enhance your overall marketing efforts.\" (Feinstein & Stefanelli, 2010, p.9)\n\nTo summarize, unless every single one of your staff, including yourself, can make the exact same dish in the picture, to the detail, every time for every dish, you're better off not putting the picture in. Its fine for fast food because cheap is their whole game, but the more value you put into your food, the picture idea gets worse.\n\nAs an alternative, I recommend a method that restaurants in Japan have been using for the last hundred years where they ask special craftsmen to make wax or plastic food models that look like the real food and then display them near the entrance. This is the best way to satisfy your wants and the complaints of culinarians in a weird sort of compromise since you get your visual representation and the chefs get their displayed \"sample\" plates. Plus, since everyone would understand that what theyre looking at is a fake plate, there would be no unrealistic expectation for the real food.\n\nI've linked a video of a guy making tempura shrimp, some other tempura thing, and a wax cabbage or lettuce [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PPQrNkOgttQ).\n\n\nReferences:\n\nFeinstein, A.

If Gamestop takes (random number I made up) 5% of the sale, steam can do that too. What about years of development costs, paying large amounts of developers and support staff (accounting, HR, IT, management, janitors, etc) is what will cost the huge amounts.

For me, having a digital download is easier and offers a better value proposition: it saves me time, gas and wear on my vehicle, risk that I might lose the disc, and it is just overall a far better customer experience. Heck, I would be willing to pay MORE for a digital download (but not much more :) ).\n\nI think you\u2019re correctly acknowledging some cost savings the manufacturer has through digital distribution. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re accounting for the incremental costs of digitally distributing the games: App Store development and maintenance, mobile checkout solutions, the discount rate is actually higher when you buy online (so if you pay for a disc in a store, the retailer gets about $0.99 on the dollar after card network fees, but online the card expenses or \u201cmerchant discount rate\u201d is higher and the retailer only gets roughly $0.98 on the dollar.\n\nSo the retailer is already arguably netting less due to the card expenses, pays more for web store and related support, AND offers a superior customer experience all for the exact same price.

            "I think I've read about this on reddit before and someone gave the explanation as follows:\nThey do not set the price of the product based on manufacturing and distributing cost, rather it is optimized for maximum profit. With that in mind, the costs of actually making the physical copies ( plastic and shipping ..) are almost negligible compared to the costs of making the game ( developing and design ). If it was up to the companies they would definitely rather only sell digital ( which some companies do ), but they also have to target the customers looking for a physical copy. If they were to make the digital copies cheaper no one would buy the physical copies, yet if customers are willing to pay up to around 60$ for physical copies they would also pay the same amount for the digital copy, hence they could maximize profits.",
            "You have this all backwards.\nDigital copies and physical copies cost the same because they cost the same to make. It costs like 60 million dollars to develop a video game. The cost of printing and shipping the disc is basically nothing. The cost of digital delivery is basically nothing. The cost you are paying has nothing to do with how you get it.

Like, a few cents per disc for high volume stuff these days.\n\nShipping, stocking, and the wages of the people *selling stuff* are all born by the retailers for the most part, not the game company. Basically it comes out of the retailer's cut of each sale, not the game company's. Digital sales take a similar cut, for example Steam's 30%.\n\nOn the flip side, game's have been about $60 for 20+ years now, and in that time inflation has raised costs by about 50%, meaning that the real cost of a game has dropped in that time from $60 2000 dollars to $40. All this while the complexity of games has gone up and the cost of producing them has increased. In reality games should cost about $90 each now for large titles, but because consumers don't react well to this price point no one's done it.\n\nIf you've felt like the quality of games has been dropping for a few years now this is why. All but the biggest companies are having to start cutting corners and putting less polish on things to keep costs down.\n\nAnd yeah, there are companies making tons of money off of DLC and what-not, but they're the extreme minority, and besides mostly that's the *publishers* making that $$$, not the developers, who are the ones with stretched budgets and tight deadlines.",

Overall though, most games come with enough content for less than 60$, a price point that hasn't changed for decades.",

Each video game CD and its packaging would most likely cost the company a few dollars per game to produce. But the develop of the game would be millions. So the difference in cost of production for a digital game and physical one is virtually zero.

It was a no-win situation to distribute software.\n\nToday, in much the same way the newspaper tries to stay relevant where their printed media costs 100X their digital costs, we find an interesting gambit.

However the costs to produce them in physical form, ie printing, is an incredibly small part of what you\u2019re paying for.  I am almost certain the same is true with video games.  It\u2019s actually not that expensive to produce the physical discs and boxes.  The majority of the expenses are going to be the same whether it\u2019s electronic or physical. The final physical production is really a tiny part of the process.  I used to rant about the prices of electronic products myself.  But after looking into it, it\u2019s actually not that surprising. Just saying.",
            "Shhh....companies will respond by marking up prices for physical copies.",
            "Ex game publisher here, I'll give you more details on why that's the case.\n\nMaking a game costs a lot, digitally or not, and way more than people expect. Remember that this industry relies on unpaid overtime. Making the software, testing it, getting it through platform compliance and paying teams make is very expensive. A lot of small teams (3 people) get up to spending 250-500k to release. You'll find cheaper examples but I've worked on 20 titles and that's the average.\n\nTo release a game digitally you need to go through a compliance phase with the platform holders. It can take up to 3 months (especially for Nintendo). You still have to produce marketing assets for the digital stores. You still need to talk to the console's compliance team. You still need to pay your studio working in the meantime.\n\nTo make a physical copy you \"just\" add a couple of months to your production cycle. Usually it's delegated to a third party company that of course, you pay, but don't put your own resources on. You save on opportunity cost that way, and it's cheap. The physical release process does not weight a lot on your balance sheet, it's only a small portion of your budget. If you plan your production well, you'll do that while your team tidies up the last bugs on the software so they don't stay idle. Because most of your budget is about getting the software ready at release quality, and producing marketing assets you need for the digital store anyway, you actually \\*reuse\\* most of your work on digital release for physical copies.\n\nSo you're actually not paying more for your digital copy, you're paying less for the physical one. Which is fucked up because all that packaging isn't sustainable. It's a lot of plastic, there's lots of CO2 emitted in the process and for shipping... And don't get me started about the cost of making your console and how dirty the electricity you use probably is (natural gas/oil based).\n\nTo be honest, you're not paying the real cost of that game anyway, since devs rarely are paid mandatory and systemic overtime, the physical copies are barely reflected in the retail price since they're such a small portion of the dev and marketing costs, and none of the environmental impact is factored in (dirty electricity, plastic, microchips and conflict materials like gold in your hardware) etc... Your opinion isn't unpopular, it's just misinformed.",

            "Everything you listed as to why physical copies cost more adds up to pennies. It cost 14 cents to make a cd in the 90's. Shipping is mostly free, paying an employee to stock shelves? Very weak argument imo. Setting aside the actual cost of creating the game and the intellectual property etc. I think the coding and programming labor to be able to download a game cost a lot more than anything listed to justify hard copies being cheaper.",

Ugly teenage girl experience seems roughly equal to the normal male experience, from what I can tell from the sheer volume of these sorts of posts. \n\nThe fundamental issue is that people are **incredibly** bad at giving advice and will often just say something to end that particular conversation. Which is why you get advice like \u201cI know you\u2019ve been unemployed for a year, have you checked out this LinkedIn website?\u201d Or \u201cjust be yourself, everything will work out.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons people are bad at giving advice is that we\u2019re also quite bad at taking it. But that\u2019s a story for another day. \n\nMy ultimate point is, stop asking for general advice. Decide who you are and who you want to be in a relationship and work towards achieving that goal. If you need specific help, reach out to people who you respect and explain exactly what you need help with (e.g. do you need help brainstorming ideas, or help finalizing a plan?)\n\nETA: to all the men responding to this, telling me that my understanding of my own life is wrong, that as long as I wasn\u2019t, in addition to being ugly, fat, a prude, aiming out of my league, trying too hard, weird, fat, or, again, fat, men should have flocked to me, I just thank you for reaffirming my gratitude that I was an ugly teen.\n\nWhatever bullshit issues I have about my looks (which, now, are minimal) are dwarfed by my delight that it ensured no men like those responding here were interested. \n\nWomen, be ugly!

Same goes for telling women (or anyone really) \u201cyou\u2019ll find someone when you aren\u2019t looking for a relationship and when you least expect it.\u201d This happens for some people, but not everyone. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m seeing a lot of messages saying not to be desperate and if you work on yourself, relationship stuff may fall into place. I agree! That being said, I\u2019m not desperate and I work on bettering myself and my self worth everyday. \n\nMy point is, telling someone that a relationship will fall in their lap when they least expect it vs using dating apps or chatting someone up in person (pre pandemic) isn\u2019t helpful advice. It sounds like you\u2019re telling me to just let it happen. What if I want to purposefully and intentionally look for a relationship? You can actively look for a relationship without being desperate or coming on too strong.

            "Confidence isn't something that you just decide to have. You have to build it.\n\nIt's not the same as someone telling a depressed person to cheer up, because there probably is something in them that's genuinely blocking their ability to cheer up.\n\nMost of the time confidence can be slowly integrated into someone's personality. It just takes a lot of effort and not everyone wants to give that effort.\n\nTake it from the classic shy kid who could never talk to anybody (not even his girlfriend at some point) and today is a completely different person who can speak to anyone he wants/needs to. It just takes practice and care.",
            "The real advice: accept yourself, love yourself, and learn to believe that are deserving of love and affection. Do not be afraid to be yourself and to let another person see who you really are. Learn how to believe that rejection is just a part of life, and does not need to be feared.\n\nTelling a scared person to just be yourself is a meaningless cliche. But I think it comes from a good place. What it really means is: \"you are my friend, and I have decided that you are worthy of friendship. If you are good enough to be my friend, you are good enough to be somebody's significant other.\" I think there's truth and power in that; if only it were articulated like that more often.",

There's a trick involved.  As others here have suggested, that trick is, when you get right down to it, pretending to be confident.  \n\nAs someone who has suffered from both lack of confidence and depression his whole life, I can tell you that faking confidence is far easier than faking happiness.  \n\nYou can learn to be confident just by pretending to be confident.  Pretending to be happy when you're not just causes more and worse problems.  (In my uneducated, humble opinion.)",

It takes years and it takes failure, but getting good then transferring it to other areas is easier. So sports for example can translate to work, hobbies, communication, ect.

I know, so how the fuck do you do that?? Self improvement. Explore your hobbies. Become the best version of you.\n\nI'm a woman but grew up with horrible social anxiety. One particularly shitty year I asked, why do I force myself to work a job and do social things I don't enjoy? I wanted a better life but didn't know where to start so I tried any non-bullshit self help advice. Meditation, positive affirmations, Konmari-ing, etc. Things I might've scoffed at but that ended up helping. I pursued my interests. Instead of talking myself out of everything social or new, I'd just act. If I always wanted to try a thing, I'd try it. If it looked even remotely helpful, I'd try it. Then if it turned out terrible I wouldn't beat myself up for this \"stupid, wrong\" choice, but say, well at least now I know not to do *that* again. I realized I hadn't had confidence because I thought I was shit and sometimes some shitty people would reinforce that belief.\n\nAnd slowly I lost most of my social anxiety. I stopped putting myself down. I stopped fearing people and their judgment. Strangers would small talk to me like I was a normal, approachable human. I'd finally get guys hitting on me that didn't have a weird asian fetish. And it'd often be at events I liked so we'd already have something in common. Granted, this happened over years, but it worked. \"Fake it til you make it\" may work for some I guess?

            "So this post is 11 days old and you might not ever read my comment but here is my comment anyway. I\u2019d say my move to fake confidence happened some time around 21 years old and alcohol certainly helped. But even without the alcohol I had always been in the habit of having full blown imaginary conversations with people while I was alone. Sort of like a daydream where I\u2019m having a conversation but I catch myself actually saying my parts out loud. So maybe that practice helped also? But the very first time I remember using my fake confidence was while walking up to a friends apartment building for a party. There were a guy and girl standing on the sidewalk facing each other, having a conversation, and I decided to squeeze myself awkwardly between them instead of going around because I was,and am still, incredibly awkward. Half way through the squeeze maneuver I pause, my face inches from the girl\u2019s, and I blurt out that there\u2019s a party up in 3D and she should come. That was it. She sort of smiled and I was off to the party. And to my astonishment she showed up at the party a few hours later. I imagine my awkwardness showed itself many many times that night, but we hit it off and dated for awhile. At some point during the dating we got to talking about that first night, and she told me that it was my having the audacity to stand between her and this guy, who may well have been her boyfriend, that made her decide to come to the party. Apparently I came off as confident. That one instance changed the way I thought about talking to strangers from then on.",
            "Asking someone who is neurotypical to change their attitude is very different than asking a person with depression to cheer up.",
            "I have to 100% disagree with this. Confidence is 100% fake it until you make it. Confidence is a state of mind based on your insecurity. Depression is a mental illness or chemical imbalance. You can tell someone to feel more confident because it's just telling someone to stop feeling so insecure. If someone fakes feeling confident eventually people will think they are confident and that will in turn make you more confident. If you fake being happy when you are depressed people might think you are happy but that will never make you happier and you will still be depressed.",

            "The Tesla model 3 is the one that's taken it the furthest ofc. I've had one for about a year and can offer a review, as I was initially skeptical.\n\nThe one thing I thought done poorly was windshield wiper control, it was dangerous to hit 2 buttons on the screen when in poor visibility. Thankfully, shortly later they moved that control to a physical button on the 'stalk' next to the steering wheel via over the air update. There's also buttons on the steering wheel that control audio and speed.\n\nI'd say that changing climate should never be done while driving, whether with real dials or not. But we all know people will do it anyway. I do agree buttons make it easier to perform with less time with your eyes down. What does make this a hell of a lot easier is autopilot and decent voice control. Many automakers already have the level of autopilot to make this more safe already - basic adaptive cruise and lane-keeping. This will become standard.\n\nAs for the pros - looking to a screen for the speedometer is no different than looking at a cluster. What I do find helpful in heavy traffic is the ability to bring up rear-view and blindspot cameras up on the main screen so I don't have to turn my head, and has much better visibility. The bigger screen does allow all main buttons to be laid out so you don't have to hunt through a menu. Cleaning between all the crevices and buttons on a normal dash makes me want to gouge my eyes out. It's much cleaner now lol.",

            "On some levels I agree with you. I have a Tesla and I can't even open the glovebox without going through the touchscreen. Sometimes technology can be a pain. Also, if the touchscreen goes out, I have no way of knowing my battery range or speed, which isn't great.",

            "Having so much shit tied to a touchscreen is just another way for them to nickle and dime you on repairs. I mean cars are so computerized these days you can't do any repairs yourself. If one thing fucks up well because its all computerized then at least 5 other things die on your car. Its like commercialized murphy's law.\n\nAlso unlike touchscreens at least with physical controls you can adjust things simply from feeling them without taking your eyes off the road. Another issue with touchscreens is if your hands are ice cold well you're fucked since many register by sensing the heat from your  fingers.",
            "Absolutely correct.\n\nWhen I need to turn the heat up or whatever in my old school car with big physical buttons and dials, I can just reach over without looking and do that. \n\nIn a Tesla with a really cool 17 inch tablet, forget about it. You gotta look at it, and try to hit the right area, and fuck up your night vision in the process, all the while not looking at the road.\n\nTouch interfaces are great for some things but for this it should be fucking illegal imo.",
            "Not to mention some of the screens stay on the entire time you\u2019re driving and are bright as shit. You\u2019re telling me I have to drive an hour with a migraine/headache with a bright ass screen glaring at me and I can\u2019t turn it off?",
            "To all the people here thinking this little Reddit circlejerk is representative of the general population, ask yourself why this got popular in the first place, way before it was cheaper to make than buttons.\nWhy? Because it's not unpopular at all, anyone with a lick of sense for tech (so anyone under 30 or maybe 25 really) can handle touchscreens just fine.\nAnd to those saying it needs constant adjustment, that just means you have an older car.\nNewer (going on a few years now) cars you just set the temp and let it do its thing.\nAnd I've always seen people do it before even getting out of park.",

            "Ask an engineer.  \n\n\nA car is a machine that weighs a lot and flies down the road REALLY fucking fast. It's a death missile that only takes a second of distraction to kill someone with or really fuck up their life.  \n\n\nEVERY single thing that will regularly be used or referenced should be a button, knob, or other form of physical input device, a hard switch, that gives physical feedback. You can feel it and know what state it's in. You use it and it clicks. There's feedback and muscle memory. You can use it blind.  \n\n\nThe less important things unrelated to driving can go into the touch screen. Even the radio and AC should be non-touch. Not enough feedback. Not enough muscle memory. It's a fucking death machine, don't fuck around with the controls.",

            "I took a really cool class last year (media psychology) and we had a lecture or two about \"adult media\" such as pornography.  One of the things we talked about is that, although for 90% of the general public, pornography usage is free (using the big name sites with millions of hours of content), the industry is still worth millions if not more. But you also can't imagine there are a whole load of companies out there that are dying to drop 100k on ads that precede \"Backyard Bitches 9\". So what becomes the driving force of the market (and thus dictates what type of content is popular / suggested)? The people who do pay for viewing. And who usually pays for viewing? Affluent or semi-affluent, usually white, married men. And what does that group want to see? Exactly the stuff you are describing, in addition to the plethora of young women who would never refuse a male (which the viewer can see themselves as a stand in for), incest shit, and whatever else. So because there's this one group driving the economic side of the industry, the content produced is tailored to that demographic. Theoretically if women suddenly decided \"hey we're gonna collectively drop a couple million dollars into the adult film industry\" you'd see a huge reversal in the content produced (likely away from the \"4k blondes with huge plastic breasts\" as you so eloquently put it.\n\nAnyways there's a whole lot of cool research (with econ and psych approaches) that i definitely recommend checking out if you're interested.",

            "I made the mistake once of making a post in r/relationship_advice. Asked for advice on how to make it clear to my BF that I didn't appreciate how pushy he was when it comes to sex and doing sexual acts I'm not comfortable with (anal). I tried to be as \"objective\" as I possibly could be given the subject, but alas I was swamped with hundreds of comments telling me to dump him. If I replied to them saying thanks for the advice but I'm not looking to end our relationship over this, I was down voted to oblivion and told just how wrong I was. Got a few DMs directing me to FDS/female dating strategy as well. I ended up just deleting my post the next day because I was getting tired of just reading the same old shit of \"dump him\" and telling me how much of a piece of shit my S/O is.\n\nIt's just so easy for people who haven't lived your life to tell you how you're \"supposed\" to be living it. They don't have the experience themselves, they don't even know you in real life, so it's all fine and dandy for them to tell you to immediately take the most extreme option available to you, because I guess that's what they would see themselves doing if they were in a similar situation. Except they're not, and I'm sure they don't take into account other factors such as, I dunno, loving the person or living with them into account in their own made up scenarios of how they would handle the situation.\n\nAnd guess what? The pushiness for sex has stopped after some firm boundary settings. Didn't need couples counselling, didn't need some randos on reddit either. I've been with this guy for 6 years, our relationship is hardly perfect but whose is? I like to try and work through issues before immediately just throwing them in the garbage because I can't be arsed to deal with them. That ain't how life works. You don't just immediately toss your phone in the bin because it's being laggy or otherwise having issues, you troubleshoot that shit.\n\nI think some people seem to genuinely forget that the person they're apparently giving advice to is an actual human being with a life just like theirs, not some character who can just magically solve every problem with some miracle solution that works wonders on paper, but not so much in real life. Also, can I just say just how fucking condescending it is to essentially tell people that they're \"too dumb\" to know what's good for them?\n\nSeen tons of other posts and comments which aren't even directly about a person's S/O, and you still get replies like \"red flag!\" or \"dump his ass\". It honestly just gets really tiring, especially in those cases when no one is even asking for relationship advice.

There was allegedly illegal firearms in the compound (this was never confirmed before the raid by their undercover agent or anyone else) there was also reason to believe children were abused and or raped inside said compound. It was a cult. ATF pulled up, it\u2019s still undetermined who shot first but whoever did still resulted in the ATF opening fire, blindly shooting into a building full of innocent women and children. They were forced to back down eventually resulting in a 51 day standoff. During the standoff the ATF drove literal tanks on the property unnecessarily destroying the victims\u2019 and suspect\u2019s property. They also played loud noises at night. The standoff was ended by the ATF and FBI pumping teargas into the compound. They had gas masks, but not any that fit kids. The goal was for everyone to see the kids suffering the effects of tear gas and they would surrender. But instead many people were trapped inside. The flammable teargas caused a fire and 72 people died. 25 of which were children. Not a single member of the ATF or FBI was ever charged with any sort of crime or held accountable whatsoever for this tragedy. And I think that\u2019s bullshit. \n\nI agree with OP 100%. It\u2019s completely reasonable for the citizen to see this as a home invasion, and should not be prosecuted for shooting the police as they enter. \n\nEven if they are guilty of something imo, it\u2019s not a reason to carry out a military style assault domestically on an American citizen. Police/FBI/ATF shouldn\u2019t be able to cram barrels of guns in peoples faces like they do and *not* expect an armed American to do it back. We don\u2019t wanna die either.",

As per the 2nd Amendment, an armed citizen has a right to defend themselves and their family. Period.\n\n*Even more unpopular opinion:* The vast majority of police situations don't need SWAT, or even lethal force, which is vastly overused, to be dealt with. We've done policing of similar situations for *centuries* without a fucking bearcat. Not saying we should disband SWAT entirely, as there are times where specialized police units are absolutely necessary, but those are very few and far between. In the event that they are deployed, like that mentioned above, they need to be in full kit, and attempt to negotiate or use non-lethal weapons like an LRAD first, if that's at all possible. If not, for example if that would likely cause the hostage taker just to kill everyone, then a no-knock raid should be allowed.\n\nYet another very unpopular opinion: When the line between police and military gets blurred to the point of no longer being clearly and obviously discernable, that's a clear warning sign that your government is not your friend, and is starting to see you as subjects instead of citizens.",

The soldiers that fought in these wars were not defending our rights, because our rights were not really being threatened.\n\nEdit: this has been very interesting! A few points to address.\n\n1.\tA repeat theme is that WW2 was about American Rights. I politely disagree. The US entered only after being attacked and having its global position threatened. We had no choice. We had been declining for 5 years to enter the war. Now I guess it\u2019s very true that many people joined the military after Pearl Harbor out of a sense of duty. But I just have a hard time seeing how it was a war for our rights. It was 100% a just war. But much of the justification was learned of only after the fact (most Americans didn\u2019t know of the atrocities happening at concentration camps). \n\n2.\tI never said there was anything wrong with joining for any reason other than patriotic duty. Join for whatever reason! I\u2019m all for it. \n\n3.\tThis last point is very important. Many have said that without the military we wouldn\u2019t have all these freedoms and rights so they therefore are fighting for our freedoms and rights by simply existing. This is an interesting notion. Because from my vantage point as an American, our military is the most powerful it has ever been, yet I have seen a steady derogation of American rights and freedoms throughout my entire life - from within. Being a super power does not somehow make our freedoms more secure. It\u2019s actually the opposite IMO. The lack of a credible threat means our government can actually take away our rights without being checked. Look at China and Russia where it\u2019s happening today and has happened for a while. Look at the last 12 years in the US (increased surveillance, Portland, police brutality etc).",

            "In ww2 they were, Japan literally bombed Pearl Harbor. A foreign nation attacked the US. Killed 2400 people. We were forced into WW2. The US then sent the Navy to fight japan in the Pacific, and the Army to Africa to support Great Britain later on in 1942. The US was literally fighting the fascist regimes of Germany and Italy (Germany was fascist, Italy was not Nationalistic socialist aka Nazi.)  \n\n\nDuring Korea, China and communist North Korea invaded south korea. The Communist pushed the SKs to the southern edge of the Korean Peninsula, the UN deployed troops and beat the commies to Chinese border, China then pushed back to the 38th parallel. This wasnt mainly about fighting for the rights of the US, mainly for the rights of a key ally in the region.   \n\n\nVietnam was a complete shitshow. The US didnt really learn from Frances defeat. The US was giving money and aid, both military and supply, to the South Vietnam government after a civil war between Communist North and Capitalist South. US was afraid of the South falling to the North, thats why there was aid. In 1964, the North attacked a US Naval vessel in the Gulf of Tonkin. Congress gave LBJ to wage war against the north. The US committed countless war crimes and had military operations in Sovereign Laos and Cambodia (they wearnt in the war but were supplying the NVA with means of travel from the Ho Chi Min Trail)\n\nAlso fun fact, Ho Chi Min was supported by the US before the Vietnam war.   \n\n\nThe Gulf war was caused by Iraq invading Kuwait, an ally. The US along with coalition forces staged up in Saudi Arabia and invaded kuwait to liberate. Then invaded Iraq. Iraq sued for peace. This war was to defend another country who was an ally and their rights.   \n\n\nAfghanistan was in response to 9/11. Intelligence believed that Al Qaeda was behind the attacks and Taliban controlled Afghanistan were hiding them. Coalition forces invaded in response to 9/11 in an attempt to capture Bin Laden and overthrow the Taliban Government. \n\nThe US shouldve pulled out the majority of its forces after bin laden was killed and left military adviser to train ANA and ANP forces, aswell as SOCOM guys to provide counter insurgency operators. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nId wouldn't say all wars and military campaigns wearnt about Fighting for rights, Mainly Vietnam up has been complete shit shows. First gulf war and Afghanistan turned into shit shows. Especially how Halliburton profited exponentially off Iraq and Afghanistan. Most soldiers probably didnt join to fight, they probably did for the GI bill and benefits. War isnt as black and white as it seems. Theres several factors go into play.  Alot of people joined up after 9/11 for the same reasons why after PH. To fight those who attacked their country.\n\nFrom my perspective, alot of hopeful recruits arent tolled the bullshits of the military.  Shitty command, low morale. War is hell. Its pain, suffering, and death. I guarantee you that those 19 yo kids who are wanting to be infantry would change their minds if they experience the physical and psychological tolls of combat. \n\nEvery way has their justifications.

            "This is pretty inaccurate in regards to WWII but true of the others. 40% of soldiers in WWII were volunteers, and many genuinely of both draftees and volunteers were eager to defend the nation from hostile attack and to a lesser extent put down a dangerous and violent regime. It really was a great ideological battle, not merely geopolitics.\n\nThe real thing about soldiers, particularly today, is that the overwhelming majority will never even reach a combat zone, let alone fire a weapon, let alone x2 actually shoot someone.  For a military as advanced as the US it is rather archaic to have the massive infantry battles people tend to think of when they hear \"war.\" Most of the actual combat is precision bombing and armor strikes done by a handful of highly trained professionals at key targets. This is part of why a draft will almost certainly never happen again, because having more bodies (especially for a military with so many numbers as the US already has) is for the most part outdated and only helpful in an occupation type role, something often more easily achieved with local police and collaborators.\n\nIraq for example, often seen as a sort of Vietnam part 2 for the US, wasn't really that dangerous for US soldiers. Only 0.3% of those deployed were killed, and many of those deaths were from noncombat sources like training accidents. And that's only people who were deployed! Hundreds of thousands of military members were still performing regular duties at bases across the globe throughout the entirety of the Iraq conflict. In WWII for example, 2.5% of deployed soldiers died, almost 10 times the rate.",

I can see a lot of them have commented on this thread talking about \"the machine\" and \"just working a job\". The military is a tough job to stay motivated in if you're only there for yourself. Low pay, long hours, hazardous conditions, and you spend months away from your loved ones.\n\nI wouldn't say that WWII and OEF/global war on terrorism weren't about fighting for our rights. The US didn't enter those fights without cause. The Nazis declared war on the US after the Japenese attack on pearl harbor. Nazis killed millions of Jews, blacks, and various ethnic and religious minorities. What do you think 1960s civil rights movements would have looked like under Nazi occupation? \n\nI don't know how old you are but do you remember where you were on 9/11? That was a direct attack on our way of life. US civilians were killed because extremists don't approve of the way you live your life. Going into Afghanistan was to cripple al Qaeda and the Taliban, disrupt their training of soldiers, and remove their source of income. Fighting abroad so that an attack of that caliber will never be seen on US soil again. Sure, the war in Afghanistan has long since turned into a drawn out transition of power. The Afghans deserve to live prosperous and peaceful lives, but we need to make sure their military can bare the burden before we can leave. We saw the rise of ISIS in the vacuum left in Iraq when we pulled out prematurely. \n\nMy time in Afghanistan (tail end of Obama's surge) saw the Afghan army take on the majority of the responsibility while often taking heavy casualties. I feel so badly for the Afghan people. I hope that within their lifetimes they will get to see what it means to live in peace. If history is an indicator, they likely will not.\n\nWe don't always fight wars for just our own rights and freedoms. I think a look at the vast differences between North and South Korea would be an indication of why we fight. There would be no Samsung, no Hyundai. Just millions of people opressed and living in poverty.\n\nI'm not saying the US is perfect or the world's morale compass, but we should hold ourselves to that standard. The racial injustices and current pandemic response are sickening. Our current \"leadership\" looks like a snake eating itself everytime I turn on the news. We as Americans have the ability to make it right. We need to educate ourselves and pick the right people. It may be cliche, but be the change you want to see.

Lots of young kids joining the military think it'll be great too! They think it'll be cool and honorable to serve their country because thats what the army recruiter told them, \"and i even get an education too!\".\n\nSo they ship you off, only just becoming an adult and only *really* an adult by law, and they strip you of your dignity, your individuality, your free thought, and do everything within the law (and sometimes more) to make you less than human so that they can thrust you headfirst into the worst places on earth, and tell you put your neck on the line for an idea and nothing more.

So while you can attribute some of it to the school, it\u2019s how much the boosters are willing to pay vs how much revenue the sport can bring in. Also, to be fair, there was waaaaaay more scholarships given to academics than there are sports scholarships. People just need to look.\n\nAs for the doctors/sports thing, there\u2019s way more doctors/teachers/lawyers than there are sports figures. And even most of them don\u2019t make the millions we think of. And the ones that do supplement a lot of it with sponsors. So while you can say sports players shouldn\u2019t make as much money, the fact is that they\u2019re on a platform for tv networks to make money, and are compensated to get a share of it at a lower dispersion rate than other professions, which translates to more money.",

Completely ignoring the fact that student athletes have to work incredibly hard to even get a chance to get a scholarship, there are still more academic scholarships than sports scholarships. \n\nAlso the reason NBA players make more than doctors is because of the revenue they produce for the league. Complain all you want, but unless the vast majority of basketball and football fans suddenly stop watching, the players will continue to make bank. Frankly, I think that\u2019s a good thing.

Athletes have upwards of 12 practices per week, each around 2-3 hours in length. Includes weight lifting, sport training, film study, and team building. Academics demands around 16 hours in-class per week, and easily a few hours of studying/homework added on after class.\n\nThey are BOTH demanding. And the higher you climb on either scale, the more demanding the activities become. I was smack in the middle of both and I worked my ass off to graduate.",

Most of them never realize, for instande, that as a college baseball player not on full scholarship we usually missed most Saturdays in the Fall which were big social events at our school because we had a fall schedule where we would load a bus to drive 3, 5 or 6 hours of baseball scrimmage with another university which often would last from 9am to 5, 6 or 7pm.  We often left late for Christmas break after exams for additional workouts, training or practice....then returned early because the season really got going in late January.     \n\nBeing a college athlete isn't just showing up in nice dorms, taking in the cheers, fighting off the girls\\guys then laying around all year...it is college with a full time unpaid job at most schools.",

            "Well, let\u2019s look at it from some more angles. \n\nFirst of all, the obvious- sports require intelligence of their own that isn\u2019t quite accounted for or rewarded in a classroom. A cornerback reading the hips of a receiver while backpedaling and taking in the routes of every other guy on the field, while maintaining his zone to be able to make a play wherever necessary is something that plenty of people never successfully develop. Understanding matchups, technique, timing - hard stuff to pick up. \n\nThe revenue portion of sports is an obvious one but also think distribution- if you\u2019re only putting a small number of students on athletic scholarship versus hundreds and hundreds (if not thousands) of students on academic scholarship (from full ride to partial), that\u2019s a lot more money to manage. One outweighs the other by a long shot. \n\nThen, let\u2019s look at opportunity and socioeconomic class (note that while this would naturally link with race, I\u2019m not going to get into that). People in more affluent neighborhoods also statistically have better schools which then leads to better grades etc from better teachers. Of course one cannot rule out personality issues of kids choosing not to work hard on their studies, but affluent neighborhoods don\u2019t have as many external distractions. When a whole community values education more, it fosters that same appreciation in the kids one way or another. A community that dgaf because bills gotta get paid one way or another? Harder to care about that little essay when you\u2019re about to be evicted. \n\nFor plenty of athletes, when you have shitty curriculum and teachers that don\u2019t care, the only real level ground you have with the masses is ~> athletics. It breaks past how much your parents make or where you\u2019re from. I speak to that more so because I went to a school that wasn\u2019t going to teach me long division until the 5th grade. \n\nMy dad missed a chunk of raising us kids so that he could get us out of the hood and when I got to my new school-> all the kids already knew long division (plus so much more) and were working on math problems I couldn\u2019t comprehend. I went from being top of my class tutoring other children as the teachers helper to rock bottom and all it took was driving 30 minutes up a highway. But in sports?

That's it and that's all. Every year there's 60 players taken in the NBA draft competing for those 450 jobs. In the entire world.\n\nLast year the NBA generated $8b in revenue.\n\nIt is a highly highly specialized and competitive job in an industry that generates massive amounts o money. They are paid accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConversely lets just take a small segment of doctors, this is from 2012:\n\n\\> There are approximately **3,689** practicing board certified neurosurgeons for over **5,700** hospitals in the U.S., serving a population of more than **311 million** people \n\n[https://www.aans.org/pdf/Legislative/Neurosurgery%20IOM%20GME%20Paper%2012%2019%2012.pdf](https://www.aans.org/pdf/Legislative/Neurosurgery%20IOM%20GME%20Paper%2012%2019%2012.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there are nearly 10 times more practicing neurosurgeons than there are NBA players. And that's not a fair comparison since thats a very specialized field of doctors, it should be compared to the numbers of Centers in the NBA (60). In fact if we look at the total number of MDs in the US:\n\n\\> As of 2016, there were over 950,000 practicing physicians in the **United States**. 93% have an MD degree, and 76% were educated in the **United States**. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians_in_the_United_States)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt gets even more diluted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo of course the NBA Players make more. There 450 total in the entire world. Theres over 1 million MDs in America alone. One job is far more competitive than the other, and the pay is scaled as such. Additionally the NBA as an industry generates a massive amount of wealth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow if you wanted to argue the merits of if the NBA players contribute more to society than doctors do than sure, you've got something to stand on. But the moment you complain about their pay it should be pointed out how much money the league generates per employee and you quickly lose the argument.",

The amount of time, dedication, physical and mental fortitude put in to be at a level that allows someone to gain an athletic scholarship is staggering.

Meanwhile there are about 900 thousand active doctors in the US who make an average of  $300k/yr, though that depends quite a bit on location and specialty.

Lifetime earnings of \\~$8-20 million in today's dollars is not uncommon.\n\nCollege scholarships are pretty similar.

Were talking about college. You\u2019re \n trying to equate the endgame of an MD to being the same as the NBA, which is kinda silly. \n\nFor one, college *is* the endgame for most athletes. Most highschool athletes aspire to play at the highest level they can, and regardless to what Hollywood promotes, most have an idea of where their maximum potential could land them, best case scenario. For the slim minority, that\u2019s college. Where they will be able to capitalize on their career whist contributing to a market that brings in *millions* of dollars to their university. Like it or not, people watch college sports, and the market is vast enough to make the barrier to entry having to commit your whole like to the game. \n\nLastly, there are incomprehensibly more academic scholarships than athletic ones. You have to be at the top of the top, to get into a school based on your sport, and then the top of the top of that, to get money for it. \n\nIt\u2019s as fair as could be.

In my area, 60% of the kids live in homes that would not be able to afford for their child to go to university.

Sports on the other hand require a lot more work and dedication since most people don't understand that it's not only working out, mental health, food, sleep, recovery, overall lifestyle, all of those things have to be perfect in order to really succeed.

            "As a basketball player who had a full ride, I completely agree. However, there\u2019s a deeper reasoning behind it than most people think, money.\n\nThe degree of which some universities profit off these athletes is astronomical, even your comparison of \u201cdoctor paid less than an NBA athlete\u201d is flawed because of the comparison as well.\n\nIf you breakdown the money trail you\u2019d deeper understand, a doctors craft is very useful, and very helpful, however their economic impact is very simplistic and not generating of other wealth streams, they do a service, and people pay (either subsidized and paid by the government like in Canada, or paid by the person directly through their own funds or insurance). Mind you, a successful doctor can create a business and hire some workers, but overall, not a huge amount of wealth or jobs generated behind them.\n\nNow, and NBA Star, is insane. The amount of economic impact and revenue streams made because of them, is absolutely insane. The amount of ENTIRE industries supported and actual full on careers created is insane. Not only all that, but their skill is a limited physical labor, they can only perform at peak performance until about an avg or 5-10 years until needing to retire.\n\nBreak this down in the form of a student now? Well every university has entire schools and sectors dedicated JUST for sports, and some of the big universities make BUTT TONS of money from it. Even for smaller universities though, it even acts as a portion of advertising and creating a more \u201cinviting\u201d university for more students, seems more fun, more entertaining, more likeable, even for small universities. So for the university, athletes are insanely useful, helpful, and beneficial. A student who is their to study an expensive degree anyways? That\u2019s the profit, that\u2019s who the university is trying to charge money.\n\nAn athlete of a university will have a beneficial financial impact on the university that is WAY more useful than the value of their 1 scholarship, infact they should actually also be PAID for their services, it\u2019s disgusting if you look at the actual breakdown of it all, like to be honest, some student athletes are being absolutely ROBBED, for how important and impactful they are for some of the larger universities.\n\nThe last thing is supply and demand, the supply of skilled athletes is very limited, that\u2019s why there\u2019s entire recruiting staff in university sports, finding a good athlete is WAY harder than you think. Now supply for a \u201cMed student\u201d? Ha, there\u2019s an oversupply, there\u2019s such an oversupply of applicants, they have to REJECT, students who want to give them money to get accepted and learn there.\n\nSupply and demand is a huge last factor.\nThe problem you are having is that you\u2019re looking at the use of \u201cscholarships\u201d from a consumers standpoint, when really these \u201cscholarships\u201d are a universities TOOL, that they will use to help regulate their supply and demand, they do reward some Acedemic scholarships, to the brightest students, as a small incentive to doing well, and to help drive the demand up a little more. Infact if most universities WERE legally allowed to pay athletes, they WOULD pay athletes huge amounts of money, because of such a huge demand and low supply, they\u2019d be begging players to go their with huge sums of money contracts.",

I might be willing to pay hand over fist for my heart surgery, but that still won\u2019t be even a fraction of the ticket sales, advertisements, food ect all made possible by pro basketball players. \n\nHaving a government body decide what everything is worth according to their personal feelings on the matter has historically led to famine.

Our current system has flaws to be sure but the other alternatives are far far worse.",

If those economics shifted there would be a lot more \u2018value\u2019 in a academic scholarship.\n\nAlso the academic equivalent of the top 100 athletes probably turn out pretty well in the long run and probably do get various scholarships and grants...your average kid with straights As is actually way more common then a top sports prospect.",

        "selftext": "In my opinion, math is the most beautiful of any \"traditional school subject,\" but the thing is schools are set up in a way that encourages teaching math as a bunch of formulas to memorize. And real math is seldom about memorization. I heard a friend describe math as \"the most useful game humanity has ever created\" and I have to say I agree with that. Math is like a game, it's a playground where you try to extrapolate truths from a set of rules. I will now spend the rest of this post explaining parts of math that are ignored in schools but are super interesting to me. My explanations don't use any technical math terms, but some of the videos linked will require some thinking.\n\n1.) fractals: You might have heard of these before. Essentially, they're shapes that no matter how much you zoom into them, they're still rough. They never end up looking straight like a polygon or curved like a... curve. Some of my favorite are the [Mandelbrot set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPHbgHVxLYY), the [burning ship fractal](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/the-burning-ship-fractal/), and the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle). All of these are mathematical objects that have infinite complexity but are governed by relatively simple rules. The Sierpinski triangle is just putting triangles in triangles, and the other two use something called \"complex numbers\" which sounds very obtuse, but can actually be explained in under 30 minutes. But these fractals are even crazier: we often think of shapes in terms of how many dimensions they have. A line is 1D, a square is 2D, a cube is 3D, etc. But by a certain definition, fractals have a **fractional** dimension. So. for example, that Sierpinski triangle is about 1.585 dimensional. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4) for details\n\n2.) Chaos theory: ever heard of the term \"the butterfly effect?\" This actually originated from a field of math called chaos theory, which studies systems that are sensitive to initial conditions. One example of a system they study is called the Lorentz Attractor, which is a simplification of the laws that govern the weather. What I love about the Lorentz attractor, is that when you \"solve\" it with a computer, it draws out paths that look like these [beautiful butterfly wings](https://imgur.com/a/0FS86tI). Let me make that clear: a couple of mathematical equations draw out something that looks as beautiful as that. There isn't human intervention in that drawing, that's just what the equations draw. There's also the [Chaos Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) which uses probability to draw things. When you run the chaos game on certain initial conditions, you get this [absurdly accurate drawing of a fern](https://imgur.com/CizSVy1). Again, none of this is done by a human, all of these works of art are made entirely by solving mathematical equations. If you find that out and don't want to learn more, you're crazy\n\n3.) Unexpected results: Let's take a second to play a [game of pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs). We'll knock one pool ball (ball one) into another (ball two), and count how many times they collide with each other or the wall. Then, let's change the mass of one of the balls and see how that affects the collision count. Tell me if you notice a pattern\n\n    Mass of ball 1    Mass of ball 2      Collision #\n    1kg               1kg                 3\n    100kg             1kg                 31\n    10000kg           1kg                 314\n    1000000kg         1kg                 3141\n    100000000kg       1kg                 31415\n    10000000000kg     1kg                 314159\n    1000000000000kg   1kg                 3141592\n\nNow you might not notice it, because it's not something you'd expect, but when you increase the mass by 100x, the collision count adds **another digit of pi**. Again, hitting some balls against each other writes out **the digits of pi**. I find that crazy. Pi is normally about circles: I don't see a circle. And pi is counting something. When was the last time you saw it do that? In the words of the legendary math educator Grant Sanderson \"If you have a **soul** you need to know why!\"\n\nI could name more instances of math being beautiful, but I think these three should be sufficient for a silly Reddit post. However, even if I didn't completely change your view of math, I hope you understand why people like me love it.\n\nEdit: I just looked at this post on my phone. God that chart looks horrible. Why can't code blocks look consistent on all devices?\n\nEdit 2: I'm not saying that teachers who teach math don't try, I just think it's inherently incredibly difficult for 1 person to teach 50+ kids math every day.\n\nEdit 3: I'm aware of dyscalculia. The use of \"only\" in the title was a bit of an exaggeration, however, I do feel like for the vast majority of people they simply aren't taught in a way that suits them.",

How is that easy for a 6 year old to do? It was a weird way of doing it as a full grown adult. They get addition, so just say 3x3 is 3+3+3, soo much easier for them to understand. Once they thoroughly understand the concept of addition, then teach them tricks like \"count by X\". \n\nI shudder to think how they teach division now!",

            "From my experience, it\u2019s a mixture of poor teaching and lack of interest. I imagine people who say \u201cI\u2019m not good at maths\u201d would be able to pick it up easily with the right teacher **and** enough interest to do so. \n \nThere\u2019s not really any particular need to convince people to like maths, you either do or you don\u2019t, and things like undiagnosed dyscalculia, dyslexia or ADHD etc. would probably put someone off maths from childhood. (I\u2019m no psychologist though, this is pure observation)\n\n[Edit: can people stop responding that people with dyslexia can be good at maths, I didn\u2019t say that wasn\u2019t possible]",
            "My main problem with how its taught (and this is a problem with many subjects) is that if you fall behind early , you're basically catching up forever. As someone whos good at math I've seen this absolutely destroy most students who are struggling with math. They only care just enough to pass after that point. I still saw students in my Calculus class who were getting stuck on extremely basic algebra theorems like that 0 x something is 0.\n\nI feel the pace needs to be set per student rather than per age,  to ensure proper absorption. People would only finish classes after they truly understood it, not just barely getting by to pass within a semester. It would be harder to group classes but I think this would work 10 times better. We push forward just for the sake of progress and passing grades even if there are people not understanding it at all.",
            "There's always something to be said for redefining the way we teach a subject.  I suppose I'm not really sure how you want it changed.  The devil is in the details, claiming it's taught in an ineffectual or boring way without providing a substitute doesn't help.  Perhaps I'm not much of a visionary here, but I can't think of any radical way to rethink arithmetic or algebra, without running up against the inescapable conclusion that you're still going to be teaching arithmetic and algebra.  You can't avoid the technicalities.\n\nIn my experience math stands out as a \"boring\" or \"hard\" subject for two reasons.  The first, is it builds on itself, so once you're behind it's a lot more work to catch up.  Second, it actually requires serious work to pass compared to other traditional subjects.\n\nNot to cast shade on those other subjects, but the answers and testing benchmarks are much less concrete.  As long as you can read and write proficiently, you will be able to succeed.  For example, when someone graduates high school they're expected to know some algebra.  They should be able to figure out questions like... 5^(x) = 4.  Whereas testing proficiency in history, science, and english is less straightforward.\n\nThese are my observations as a chronically bad student.",

The problem was solved either in my head or on my calculator, so why do I need to explain how I got the correct answer? I know proof is a big part of math later in the courses but the system is flawed.\n\nThe way math is taught in school discourages people who aren\u2019t good at it, as well as the people who are good at it.

Sure, you can use implements at a young age with time, money, algebra, etc., but once you reach higher math, you\u2019re not going to have time to play with the numbers AND learn the concepts. Take college calculus: you can show me what rate of change means by letting me play with simulations and whatnot, but at some point I have to grapple with difficult math. If schools want people to enjoy math, we need to lower testing stakes because the difficulty makes people attribute a bad grade with the subject as a whole.\n\nThis holds true for any subject, really. I go to an engineering/STEM university and most engineering students you ask will profess their love for math and physics.

It's in my native tongue so I'll try to explain it in English. The paper is called 'why Daan en Sanne can't do math, but their teacher can't either'.\n\nThe disinterest in learning math comes from a change in perspective: around 1995 the opinion about math changed. A lot of researchers thought/think children should only learn from 'realistic math', not from 'tricks' (like long division, ciphering math problems).That means that children need to be able to visualize the problem before solving it, by using materials and showing a lot of different strategies. \n\nI think that's great, but they forgot that that's a terrible idea for people who do not speak the language very well. To those not skilled enough to comprehend simple math problems; it's also very detrimental. Those 'tricks' that they advocated against, are necessary to teach people a simple strategy to deal with that kind of math problems. The perspective is changing now, though. I advocate for teaching math in comprehensive levels, break up peer groups and start following the zone of proximal development.",

This happened still in one lower university course I took, were both the teacher and the book repeated the same terrible teaching behaviour. I tossed the textbook the moment I finished the course cause it was just awful. I ironically learned more math at my coffee job then at school just because i was on register most of the time.

            "This will get lost in the comments but it's cathartic I guess. I was diagnosed with a learning disability in my childhood - but to this day I'm uncertain if I genuinely have one. I'd be the type of person who'd find some of the formulas or methods I'd learn to be cumbersome or just not click, and would come up with my own formulas or methods. The teachers often had none of that, I had to do it their way or no way at all. My last burst of joy with numbers during primary education was when I was home schooled. My father left me to my own devices in the workbook unless I needed help, and I'd simply look in back for the answer. I didn't leave it just at that though, I'd figure out other ways to find the answer, and test different variables or approaches to confirm if they were valid or if I just got lucky. It stopped being work and became pure fun playing around with numbers and seeing the end results - the 45min for the lesson turned into hours at the table. But the following year, back to public education I went, and back to the methods that drove me away from math.\n\nEventually, the curiosity and excitement I'd have with exploring numbers turned into a disdain towards them, and thinking less and less of my abilities across the entirety of academia. The special ed classes often relied upon reducing the amount of problems, not any productive strategies that helped make things click under their mandated approaches. I was fortunate enough to have one teacher for a different subject that turned things around for me during my last semester of senior year. \n\nNow, I'm pursuing degrees in electrical engineering and physics. Granted, college still provides those lackluster instructors and professors, but it's not as rigid as public education was. If not for that one teacher, I might of lost that excitement with numbers indefinitely - and I know not everyone is fortunate enough to come across a teacher or two who gets you out of that \"I'm a piece of garbage and will never be good at math,\" mentality. \n\nYears ago, I would've never imagined myself taking a break from writing an English paper, finding a hole inside a microwave while making myself a snack and asking myself, \"How can I measure the amount of microwave radiation being released, and with this information, is it possible to measure the approximate size of this hole?\" and figuring it out just because I wanted to.",

Making patterns by looking at a garment is easy- scaling up that garment pattern through math feels impossible.  I would love to up my geometry game.\n\nUnfortunately in my Texas school we had math by scantron- our volleyball coach was the teacher and every test was taken as multiple choice, and we weren\u2019t allowed to work out the problem.

            "My impression is that schools, at least in the US, teach math really badly because the folks who become grade school teachers are afraid of math.\n\nMy son went to a Montessori preschool, and by the end of kindergarten, he was adding and subtracting 3 digit numbers, understood what multiplication was, and was beginning to grasp the idea of division. (He's a bright kid, but didn't really stand out from the other kids in his Montessori classroom.) Then he went into public school, where you don't even talk about subtraction until the end of first grade. \n\nOf course, reading wasn't a problem, if your first grader could read at a high school level, they had stuff for him to read.

            "Agreed. I still suck at many subjects of math (mainly trig and calculus) and hate them for it (starting to like calculus, I love algebra though). High school math class was learning how to use a TI-85 graphing calculator, then needing to learn how to use the other main brand cause the school would run out of TI-85 ones. Once I got to college there was the learning curve of learning what a sine cosine and tan wave was, how to apply them (tan=sin/cos) and the simple y=mx+b equation and variants (y=asinebx+c-d one). The teachers legit couldn't explain why, they just explained things like you follow this sequence of events to get a right answer. No knowledge on the application. Once I learned how pi was just the ratio of times the diameter fits around the circumference, my mind was blown, but it was quite a while after high school. I think learning what we needed to do on the graphing calculator was not just easier than using the calculator, but way more applicable. Models of calculators change and there are plenty of easier apps to use, but if you don't understand the concepts, you won't know when to apply them.  \nHad an amazing math teacher in 1st year college who got me and allot of people up to speed. Still could only really get 60s-70s best at math (usually just barely passed) but I was able to get through it. But I was set back pretty early. In grade 5 we had a lazy teacher who would just throw homework answers onto the projector and get kids to mark their own work, then just write down the mark they wrote. Me and a bunch of other kids just got lazy and marked everything right, except maybe a few questions, and she would right down the mark. Then 1 day she found out the whole class was doing that cause pretty much everyone failed a math test and had to go back and correct everyone's work and marks. lol",
            "Math, contrary to first appearance, simply isn't something that can be standardized and taught *well*.\n\nThere's really not much you can do about it without fundamentally changing how the entire school system works.\n\nIf everything's online, it can certainly transition into a \"my own pace\" type learning with the teacher being closer to a tutor.\n\nBut that would require changing everything.\n\nNot to mention most people simply don't have the aptitude to do any sort of self-motivation.",

But what makes it click for one person night can be totally different from making it click for another person.\n\nI've tutored some friends prepping for the math portion of the GRE and found that it's easier to teach someone one-on-one than a large group of people who have little in common other then being roughly the same age.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the way math curriculums build on earlier material, all you need to have a really awful time is to miss one click.",

            "Currently studying mathematics education, and from what I\u2019ve learned in my major, the answer is \u201cyes, this is completely true.\u201d We\u2019ve been doing research into how to better teach math for years and have found a plethora of answers, there are book after book about how the way schools are teaching math currently doesn\u2019t work. The way you think of learning math, with a teacher up at the front of the board just reciting formulas and telling students that \u201cthis is how you do this.\u201d Doesn\u2019t work. Students won\u2019t be interested, and anything they do gleam likely won\u2019t be meaningful in context. A lot of big problems we see start very early on, with students not developing number sense and instead being forced to memorize math facts. We put too much emphasis on speed and computation ability and not enough on reasoning and in depth understanding. Keep in mind, everything I\u2019m saying is based on the American education system. There\u2019s a multitude of reasons for the problems we\u2019re having and there doesn\u2019t seem to be some simple band-aid we can put on it. But from what I\u2019ve read the solution seems to be better teacher education and career development. Math teachers need to be trained how to better teach math. There\u2019s problems with that though too. Like teaching not really being an appealing career path in the United States for a multitude of reasons. (Problem is, lets say we pay teachers more, more people come to the field, but likely you\u2019re just paying more for the same old routine, something has to change in how we train and implement our educators.) Research has shown that a big part of our problem is how we grade and the mindset students have. Students are not rewarded for learning, they\u2019re rewarded for memorizing. And after a test has gone by, students not teachers care to go back and fill in the holes in the learning. You got a 50% on a quiz? Well, that student isn\u2019t going to go back and say \u201cwhat am I not understanding?\u201d They\u2019re going to look at the grade, get discouraged, say \u201cI\u2019m just not a math person.\u201d And reinforce the mentality that has convinced them they\u2019ll never be capable of this. We\u2019ve also seen that the best way to teach math is not to tell students what to think or what is true, but to pose an appropriately difficult question and let them explore it. Let them think with one another and reason with the problem, you as an educator provide guidance and scaffolding where needed, but for the most part let them do the actual thinking and teaching. I could probably talk about this for hours and honestly doing so kind of discourages me sometimes because I can see some of the changes that need to happen, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m competent enough to make them a reality. If you\u2019re interested in this, I recommend reading some books by Jo Boaler, she\u2019s a mathematics education professor at Stanford and has INCREDIBLE insight and research into what\u2019s happening and how we can change it. The first two that come to mind are \u201cWhat\u2019s Math Got to do with it?\u201d And \u201cMathematical Mindsets\u201d",

Each time it had the same questions! It literally became memorisation. Then we had a leaderboard with the fastest times (for those who got 100%). This put so many students off math and made them feel dumb. \n\nMy first taste of real math were those interschool competitions, where instead of calculations you had to solve a problem or prove something. \n\nHowever highschool math wasnt much better, it was just learn and apply these formulas. I literally learnt more from some 3rd party math competition than school. Its not until university where you learn real math techniques which is a shame.",

            "Thank you.\n\nI am a community college professor. I mostly teach Computer Science, but every now and then I also teach remedial / developmental / middle-school-level math.  For the most part, these students *hate* math. It's not that they aren't good at it. It's not that they can't learn it.  Frequently, they hate math because they were taught it by people that hate math.\n\nAt least here in the northeastern US, elementary education (age 5 to age 10, give or take) involves one teacher for all the \"academic\" or \"regular\" subjects, and then specialized teachers for things like music, art, foreign language, etc., and so the classroom teacher - where I went to undergrad the Ed majors all had to double major in something else - might have been Math majors, or Lit majors, or History majors, or whatever.  And if that History/Ed major hated math, but is a good classroom teacher besides that, that person might be teaching math to 6 year olds.\n\nIf you've ever known a 6 year old, you know that they're very perceptive.  \"Here, try this medicine\" you say while holding your nose, and they know what's up.  Well, if you are teaching her math, and feel that way about it, they know what's up then, too.  Well, guess what?  In twelve years, that 6 year old will be in my classroom with a learned aversion to a necessary skill. I have fifteen weeks to convince this person, who has a lifelong fear of and/or hatred for math, that it's not that bad, and you don't have to memorize anything more than the quadratic formula.  I will teach you how to remember the rest without memorization, but first you have to trust me that your brain is pre-wired to do this successfully.\n\nNow throw in that these elementary school teachers are far too often assessed on things like student test scores, and not more inclusive outcomes, and to keep their jobs, they have to teach the kids *just enough* to pass a test, and we've hit a never-ending cycle.  (An infinite loop in my CS classes.)\n\nI see the problem, but I don't know how to fix it.",

It sucks, and now many people think of the field as cold and uncreative, which could not be further from the truth.

            "The thing about this statement, though, is that we can love things and want to change them at the same time. Love isn\u2019t limited only to perfect things. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single person on earth, overweight or not, who doesn\u2019t have something they\u2019d change about their body. I\u2019m a woman who isn\u2019t overweight, but I have a list of pills I\u2019d take that\u2019s as long as the Charter of Rights and Freedoms if given the chance. Regardless of this, I DO love my body. I love it, while simultaneously acknowledging that it is flawed. \n\nAfter reading a few of your replies, you seem to think that loving your body means being proud of it. To me, these two words are not synonymous. You can love something privately, complicatedly, and still be ashamed of it in other ways. \n\nI\u2019d compare it to loving a person, almost. We all love somebody that we don\u2019t always like. If you gave me a pill that made my sister nicer, or took away my dads drinking problem, I would take it. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love them. It just means you can love something and criticize it at the same time. \n\nOf course, I can\u2019t speak for all fat people (or any). But I\u2019m pretty sure that when they say they love their bodies, they mean they love the positive sides of it. They don\u2019t mean \u201cit\u2019s PERFECT\u201d but it\u2019s the body they have for the moment, so they choose to focus on what they do like instead of what they don\u2019t.

Sure they want to be healthier or skinner or more tone, but that isn't going to stop them from being happy in their skin and living there life without living in constant shame of who they are or what they look like. \"Loving yourself\" doesn't mean you think you are perfect just the way you are.",

Let\u2019s say I make $35k/yr and live a modest life that I\u2019m totally fulfilled by, would I be a hypocrite if I accepted a magic money pill? Also, this magic pill scenario is flawed. The weight classification is determined by a generic height/weight chart that doesn\u2019t take into account the body-type diversity that exists. If an overweight person takes the pill only to wake up at their ideal weight, that doesn\u2019t guarantee that they won\u2019t still fall into the overweight category. I\u2019m sure some people would/do fit the scenario you\u2019re describing but when you put it in absolutes then everyone has to fit the bill and that\u2019s just not possible under these conditions. On a side note, I hope you (OP) and anyone else who happens to read this knows: you are more than your weight and loving your body or being comfortable in your own skin isn\u2019t just for thin people.

The act is the superset which includes the stance.\n\nIn the last decades, with the internets incredible success and spread, it became more and more important to the elites, to not act anymore, but instead to hold a stance. That's because you can read everything a politician has said 10 years ago on the internet, while in the past (90's and before) it was just forgotten after 2 or 3 news cycles.\n\nWhat does that do to the elite?\nEverybody tries to be the most wobbeling pudding, just so you cannot be nailed and hung up to a wall for what you 'DID'. Everybody on the discourses nowadays only tries to show off her or his 'stance' for some applause, instead of 'acting' on something that can be turned against you in 10 years.\n\nThis is where the attention junkies on social media come in. It is, all of a sudden, such a refreshing thing to see people to 'act' on something.\n\nWhile in reality they are nothing but that - junkies - they don't act for the act in itself. They do it for attention. And they just found the most efficient way to squeeze the most atttention out of a situation.\n\nBy the way, I totally dig your statement.

            "You're absolutely right mate and it's OK to be frustrated. For me I am/was also a redhead male which is another \"open season\" for shaming and ridicule which seemed to just be acceptable for some reason AND I'm short (5'6) - the triple threat of \"acceptable\" ridicule! \n\nI'm sure many will have noted there are options to control/slow/stop the process depending on your openness to medication and/or surgery. I mention as sometimes feeling like you have options to decide can be positive but admittedly can add to stress of the experience.\n\nMy own journey with this mental challenge has been the last 17 years, which when I type that sounds crazy and exhausting but shows it can consume you.\n\nMy father was bald at 22, and when I was about 21 I noticed a lot of hair coming out in washing or touching my hair and freaked out. My long time girlfriend at the time although normally being the \"I'll love you forever and get married\" one in the relationship had a negative reaction when I raised it with her - \"oh, bald, really?! I mean you'll do something about it right?\"... So that was the unconditional love person feeling it was OK to shame me right there and then.\n\nAs a result at 21 I started taking Finasteride (Propecia), and did so till about the age of 31 - whether it was the drug or natural course of things it seemed to do the job. I had bit of a receding hairline but not significant, so why did I stop?\n\nIn that time I had established a career, had moved on from the first girl, been with some others, and had met my now partner of 7 years who is my true partner (we dont believe in marriage hence not \"wife\"). The key thing here was I had much more self confidence and I made the decision I didn't want to risk my sexual health taking Propecia - I was more comfortable, but still scared of being bald so was using Rogaine as a less serious alternative.\n\nI let things take their course for a while and till about age 35 was a very slow loss of hair but on the flip side I was happier in myself. With that security and comfort in who I was as a person I had far less socially anxious thoughts like \"can they see I'm balding\", \"are they laughing behind my back\", \"will it impact being attractive to my partner\" - they were still there in the background on occasions of self doubt that we all have but not the dominant thinking.\n\nInterestingly I had no comments from anyone about my hair loss except from my Dad who a) has always been an asshole, and b) was openly upset that I didn't lose my hair like he did at 21 (yup an asshole). I think this is in part because I spend most my time these days with established friends, and if there was a comment about my hair it would be from myself as a self-deprecating method to protect and control the narrative. \n\nOver the last 2 years my hair loss has been at the \"end stages\", I literally have used this COVID lockdown last week as the opportunity to go the full shaved head for the first time - so your post is quite timely. Having done the shave I've had very few comments (and I spend a lot of time on work video conferences). Apart from a bit of a shock when I see my head in the damn 'self view' part of the VC (seriously would hate that with full hair) I actually feel more comfortable than I did before. I'm lucky enough to have a supportive partner who says she finds it attractive, also it has removed the fear for me that people thought I was trying to hide my baldness. Sounds weird, but this last stage of baldness I was more worried about people thiking I was attempting to hide it and look silly rather than the baldness itself - I didn't want to look insecure about it.\n\nSo as many have said, the shave can be liberating but no doubt scary like all the other stages.\n\nI apologise for the unwieldy post but hope this helps show that everything you're thinking and feeling is not unusual and many here will have shared, and secondly that you are not your hair - you'll grow confidence and it wont be your main focus - friends, relationships, career and other life meaning will take over and then any comment someone makes is meaningless.",

What gets me is the expression I get from some of those who I have considered asking out or friends who clearly want to express empathy. I've yet to have anyone directly have that knowledge change how they interact with me, but that look notes a change in how they perceive me.\n\nI mean, yeah, I'm 25 and look like I wore a radioactive Kippa/Kipa/Kipah (spellings provided by wikipedia to try and keep it respectful), but as far as negative genetic aspects go I got off pretty light.\n\nSo yeah, thanks for the thread OP.",

I'm not saying folks should weep and wail and throw tantrums at the slightest thing and expect it to be validated. You're a grown up, take a breath and act like it. Self control is key.

            "it really depends how you are using \"man up\" . As you said, if you are using it in response to something legitimately traumatic - SURE - that's terrible. \n\nBut what if you are using it for something not so traumatic? \n\nLike imagine the post is something like \"my disabled grandmother didn't want to shovel her own snow, so I did half, and then I gave up and I guess she has to finish it\" \n\nis telling THIS guy to \"man up and finish it\" the same as telling a woman to get back into the kitchen? \n\nhow should I express to him I think he need to be more of an adult \"man\" than a child ? I could say \"grow up\" or I could use \"man up\" as a phrase meaning \"act like more of a mature man than a child\".\n\nI don't see how telling a woman \"get back to the kitchen\" EVER invokes anything other than sexism. There aren't like a whole myriad of situations, the majority even, where I find it appropriate. Our society is riddled w/ situations where people shirk responsibility, and their duties as good humans, and using \"man up\" in these is fine - if they are male - and only implies you think GOOD THINGS about men in general. But \"get back to the kitchen\" implies nothing except negative thoughts about women.",

            "\"Man up\" is probably the biggest motivator when I need to do something that I don't want to do. This is a pretty innocuous example but just last week there was a giant snapping turtle in the road and when I drove by I thought of a bunch of reasons why I should just continue driving. I ultimately didn't want to go back and pick him up get myself dirty and have this thing try to kill me, but I told myself \"man up\" and turned around and did it anyway.\n\nI think there are situations in life where my \"duty\" as a man supersedes everything else. At the same time telling someone to \"man up\" when it comes to traumatic experiences is messed up. Men should be able to speak openly and not have to worry about judgments from people. But for me, \"man up\" can be a big motivator.",
            "Sometimes people of both genders do need to man up though.",
            "Not justifying anything, but they are not the same at all. \"Man up\" is often encouragement to do something difficult, overcome something, or move on even, but it's ostensibly a positive idea with poor messaging. \"Get back in the kitchen\" is just degrading with no other purpose.",

            "I agree to an extent, I feel like telling a woman to get back in the kitchen holds a lot more hatred and sexism and intent to offend, while telling someone to man up could be said in a way to encourage or to push. I do not like being told to man up and I disregard being told to do so, I don't feel that carries the same weight as telling a woman to get back in the kitchen.",

There are conotations to manliness but these are secondary. \n\nSaying \"get back in  the kitchen\" is a dismissive or domineering command to remove oneself from some place of percieved importance and slink back to a place of servitude. \n\nThere are very different intentions in these phrases.",

It can mean that you\u2019re being too childish. It can mean that you\u2019re being a crybaby.\n\nTelling a woman to \u201cget back in the kitchen\u201d isn\u2019t telling her that she\u2019s doing anything objectively wrong.

There are no acceptable ways to use \u201cget back in the kitchen\u201d.\n\nI do agree that men do get the short end of the stick when it comes to social interactions on the internet though because third wave feminism has convinced many women that men are immune to any kind of emotional hardship.

It's like a high, or a superiority thing that they need to keep feeding. Also, whether people on Reddit want to admit it or not, people are attracted to negative stuff. If you look at the people with the highest karma on Reddit, it's people with low effort comments and bullies. People just like that stuff. They gravitate towards it. There's that video: \"This video will make you angry\", and it sums up Reddit perfectly. Subreddits argue amongst each other about other groups and they never actually interact.\n\nThere are a lot of problems with Reddit.\n\nHere's what I would do to fix them:\n\n1) I would de-mod anyone who mods more than one subreddit. No one person deserves that much power. They can enforce their views across too many subreddits, cause users to become marginalized ( a word I never thought I'd use) and create massive, toxic echo chambers. It also puts them at risk for being bought by people or companies who want to spread evil ideology. Mods are people, and people are fallible. They'll also demand 'proof' and provide none while expecting citations. They'll also wait for you to provide those so that they can move the goalposts and try and detract from your proof by using a ton of fallacies or just plain dog piling.\n\n2) I would figure out what causes people who visit specific subreddits to get auto-banned without even commenting or posting. \n\n3) Get rid of mods' ability to message people after banning them. It's not right that they can send a really backhanded, bullying comment and not allow the user to defend themselves. If this happens, the user should be given the option to have that mod removed.\n\n4) Hire more paid people to respond to issues with passwords and allow providing forms of ID in order to unlock accounts.\n\n5) A live response team for the getting help with users that are toxic or dangerous (provide proof, etc so it's not a witch hunt)\n\n6) Fair sub banning. If you're going to ban extremist subs, when Reddit banned r/thedonald, they should have banned r/politics. This should be the same across opposing subreddits. Ban on side of an extremist coin, ban the other.\n\n7) Create politics subreddits with a balanced group of admins with differing politics to read submitted stories to prevent the current clickbait, bias, and echo chamber. Each story would have to be vetted for bias and clikcbait titles to guarantee that it's real news. It would also slow down submissions and increase quality posts.",

Other officers, the police chief, the mayor, the governor, the president. The 4 cops were fired the same day. One was charged the same day. Investigations take time to get it right.\n\nBut what is worse is people taking to the streets, looting and burning. Assaulting and killing. They are the real enemy of the country. They loot and destroy out of greed, racism and evil intentions, all the while hiding behind then senseless death of a man of color. Would the looting and burning be happening if it was white cops on white? How about black cops on white? No  I didn't think so. Racist protesters is all most people see.

All these countries and more across Europe and the world has had an uptick in support for far right populist parties.

            "I've said this before, and I'll say this again. Every white person I know (myself included) has a racist uncle or a racist gandparent, or some other \"racist\" relative. What I mean by that, is that we all have ONE relative who is ok with saying racist shit out loud to their family, and a lot more relatives who agree with that person / don't speak up to that person. I don't know a single family this doesn't apply to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing about that is that people don't just become racist over night. They live racist lives, they raise racist children, they infect other people with their racist beliefs. If you have one racist relative that you know about, I can guarantee you that you have many more that you don't know about. People don't marry racists unless they're racist themselves or they are ok with it. People that grow up in households with racist parents don't just simply grow up unaffected by it, they become indoctrinated by it and rely on the outside world to correct that part of their upbringing. People will say that they aren't racist, then go home and openly use the N word to their families. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just think most white people are completely full of shit when they claim that racism doesn't exist IN THEIR OWN FAMILY / LIFE, let alone in the greater united states. It's much more likely that they've just been indoctrinated to not recognize racism because they grew up in a racist household. My immediate family was racist when I grew up. They didn't openly say anything bad about other races, and they definitely taught me acceptance, but they also surrounded me with people that WERE racist and never really contradicted those people. My mother has since told me that she understands now that she needs to be more aware of her own behavior, and she is at least trying to correct a problem that she recognizes. I've been doing the same for the greater part of my adult life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRacism runs SO MUCH DEEPER in white families than I think the vast majority of us are willing to admit. We give out free passes to the racists who we grew up with because that's what we've always done AND because we view them as 'good' people. Well guess what, you probably only consider them good people because you were a kid for most of the time you knew them, and, because they know what they're saying is wrong, they don't talk about that shit around the kids. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this Thanksgiving is going to be a good one, because I for one don't plan on listening to my shitty racist relatives act like they're good people.",

            "TL:DR- I think what you're saying isn't true, there are so many good games that aren't online focus that have come out and gain popularity, and if you look for them you will find them. I also don't know how anyone thinks this is true.  \n\n\nYou are allowed to prefer singleplayer games, there's plenty of reasons to do so, but everything else about your post is ridiculous, I don't know how anyone who keeps up with games beyond the most mainstream of mainstream titles can agree with you. I am gonna take what you say and argue from that to prove my point.   \n\n\nJust from the first sentence, \"Video games have become all about competition and getting the flashiest new upgrades, or spending hundreds of dollars every 'cycle' only to have all your achievements washed away at the end of each one.\" For flashy upgrades, do you mean cosmetics? They are a big part of gaming but I can assure you there's more to it than that, and most games that sell them now are free to play or have a free to play mode. And what do you mean by cycles? Do you mean battle passes? Updates? What are they doing to wash your achievements? And for them being about competition, yes, if ur playing a competitive multiplayer game I don't know what else you expect, there's plenty of singe player games out there/   \n\n\n\"Games used to be about the story, more than the mechanics and the competition.\" 2 things I have to ask, when was this true? And have you seen a E3/game showcase within the last 5 years? Many older games gave zero fucks about the story, hell take something like the OG doom where the main Dev made fun of the idea of story holding importance, sure later in the 90s this changed a bit with things like Ocarina of time, half life, final fantasy, metal gear, etc etc, but even in these games it wasn't \"more important than the mechanics\", It wouldn't be until later where we saw more games with a primary focus on story. And that never ended.  \n\n\n\"Story driven games are pushed under the radar\", in what world is this true? I mean 2 of the biggest brands in gaming make most of their money off of singeplayer games, nintendo and sony, Sony's main selling point of their console is their single player story driven titles. There are so many good singe player games that've come out, some with focusing on story and some not, The Yakuza Games, Ghost of Tsushima, any from software game, doom eternal, red dead 2, God of war, Jedi Fallen Order, The Resident evil games, DMC 5. I can go on, I mean for fuck sake we live in a time were a new half life game was released less than 2 years ago.  \n\n\n\"independent artists are being killed by lack of support\", Hades, Shantae, Among us (it counts), Stardew Valley. Satisfactory, Undertale and Deltarune, Omori, Celeste, just to name a few. We live in a time where many people point to indie games as an alternative to triple A games and many have risen to almost as much, if not just as much popularity as some triple A games.  \n\n\nOnce again, I don't know how anyone agrees with this, there are so many games that are out there of so many varieties, and dev's talk about it forever at showcases, going on about their \"immersive world\", and \"deep story\", I really do feel like you just have to be lying or unaware of what's out there, and going by the fact that you only listed the most popular of franchises I think the ladder is true.",

I suffer from a quite a few different mental illnesses which I won't go into, but they were all kind of getting the better of me and I felt buried in this feeling of despair and hopelessness and felt I needed to call because I was having a mental breakdown from the stress of losing my nana and my own mental health problems acting up.  It was too much to bear and I just needed someone to talk to so I didn't do something I would regret.  I got on the line and it felt like the person I was talking to was reading off a script, \"You're important, you matter,you're smart.\". Etc but I questioned the person about what makes them feel that way after a short conversation she got really really annoyed with me and just kept on repeating the same stuff over and over again.  Which she already seemed annoyed right when I started talking to her.  When I got off the line I felt worse than I did because I felt I was a burden.  The only thing that prevented me from harming myself was that my sleeping meds finally kicked in and I passed out.  I woke up the next day feeling much better (I do have insomnia which that day I hadn't slept at all and was up iirc for 24 full hours which didn't help my other problems but I couldn't do anything about it.) From my one experience that I had all I can say is that I hope that I never break down like that again because if I do I don't feel as though I'd be able to call the hotline.",

I described that one reason I felt depressed was that I was single at had never been in a relationship at 26. The woman said she wasn\u2019t married until 40. I think I asked something about how she dealt with feeling unwanted that whole time, and she said \u201cwell it wasn\u2019t because no one was interested!

            "Def an unpopular opinion but I agree.  I\u2019ll be honest and say that I\u2019ve never actually called the line, nor am I a licensed mental health professional, but everything I\u2019ve researched, heard, etc sounds awful. \n\nThe most obvious thing is that from what I know, it\u2019s all volunteers.  These volunteers can be pretty much anyone.   Sure they are trained and given outlines on what to do but man, these people are not psychologists.   I just think there\u2019s so much room for failure here. \n\nIt\u2019s a nice thought, but it honestly might me doing more harm than good.

There are people who don\u2019t actually want to die, atleast not at that moment, who are severely depressed and honestly just want to be talked down and relaxed/calmed.   They want to know someone somewhere out there is willing to listen.  For these people, these hotlines probably help a lot of times.   However, the people that truly want to die at that very moment, man, calling a suicide hotline is probably not helpful at all.   I seriously doubt a volunteer can successfully talk someone down and convince them to live.  That\u2019s horrible for both sides.  Obviously for the person who kills themselves, but also imagine the trauma of some young naive highschool or college kid trying to help and make the world a better place, and hearing someone blow their brains out with a gun over the phone.

            "Oh no, I totally agree.  \n\nI'm also frustrated that people who haven't sought mental health treatment are unaware of the frustrations involved.  It's a loooong process of diagnoses, treatment including meds that might have shitty side effects and withdrawal symptoms but no therapeutic benefits, counselors that pass you around because \"so-and-so may be able to help you better\" so you start over every two or three sessions.\n\nWhen people say \"you/they should get help\" I hope they realize it's sometimes a life-long struggle of trying and trying different things and not getting results.",

            "I agree. I called them during a mental breakdown and all they did was say a bunch of useless garbage that I could tell was scripted and I just hung up",
            "I agree. I have called them myself and regretted it both times. I felt worse after, like the same level of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, but now someone else knows that I exist and feel bad and now there's a good chance things are going to get even more difficult because they may call someone who will ..etc etc..\n\nI've known several other people who feel the same.\n\nNot to say there aren't absolute gems working these types of call jobs. There really are. There are people there who will care about you so much and want to do whatever they can to help you. But it's not likely you'll reach one of them, they are so few and far between.\n\nWith this, I would like to offer an open invitation to talk. This goes for anyone who reads this. Pm me.  We can talk about anything and everything. I'm fucking horrible at my own life. And I won't necessarily know what to say to you to make you ok. And generally, I'm not very good at advice. BUT, I will try very hard. And I will care a lot about you. And think you about you often. We can talk on a medium or at times that work best for you. I know what it's like to have to hide to talk to someone because there isn't anyone else, but the people in your life can't know. I will do my best to help you feel better, if only for a minute. I can send you weird or stupid or funny things. I can tell you funny stories, or mindfuck stories. I can show you how things can be not so bad. I will give you a part of me that keeps me going. So you can too.\n\nI may be busy with irl a lot, I don't have much time to myself..but I'll be there for you. Because no one was for me, and I don't want anyone else to feel like that.",
            "This is what I have heard too. It\u2019s sad because there *should* be something like the suicide hotline available, but it needs to work differently than how it does right now. Hire actual trained therapists instead of volunteers, for one.",

Oh and I was definitely being passively shoved off the phone. \u201cThese are the things you\u2019re supposed to say when you need to end the call because it\u2019s going on too long\u201d is what I kind of imagine their trainer telling them.",

            "Smaller, more local hotlines tend to not just be better in general but know HOW to be better. Giant hotlines always lose their focus because no matter how many people you have answering the phones some people won\u2019t get help, some people will accidentally give out detriments and some people on both sides are misusing the hotline. A national suicide number has its uses but I think ultimately every state should have one at least and if they do, they should be as advertised as possible. Plus, people tend to forget how big the US really is and a big problem doesn\u2019t always require a big solution but maybe a lot of little ones. I agree with your conclusion I guess but I don\u2019t entirely agree with what you use to support it primarily the statement they do more harm than good. I don\u2019t think a suicide line will ever do more harm than good but there are certainly methods and people that just aren\u2019t universal and that\u2019s something we can never really fix, only improve upon.",

You feel like you are talking to yourself, well not really, I enjoy talking to myself, but this kinda made it worse at that time. I felt like nothing help me now, I mean, I already did a big step and I achieved nothing.",
            "TLDR I used to manage one of the largest hotlines in the country for a couple years and I need to address some of things that were mentioned here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First, I want to first validate everyone's feelings about their experiences** because I can definitely see how detrimental the experience was for you. It's definitely not the perfect way to help someone in a crisis. I'm obviously biased because that work was important to me, but I feel it's important to address some of things raised here (please bear in mind that I am only speaking from the perspective of one hotline in the country which is not representative of all the hotlines):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Most of the time the suicide hotline ends up doing more harm then good**\n\nBased on your anecdotal experience (and others here in this thread), I can see why you might feel that way. Based on my anecdotal experience, that's definitely not the case. We can agree to disagree on this.\n\nJust so everyone is knows, the hotline is not therapy. It's *therapeutic*. My goal as a Crisis Counselor is to not to convince you to stop the thoughts of suicide, but to deescalate you to get you to a point where you will not act on those thoughts immediately. If I can get you to a stable sense of self where you don't act on your suicidal thoughts on that day and seek resources for long-term support then I've done my job. Suicide hotlines function as temporary relief and is not a replacement for therapy or other forms of mental health support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**They have been known to hang up on people in crisis**\n\nDefine what you consider a crisis.\n\nFor me, a crisis is a situation where someone has a specific plan and an immediate timeline on when/how they will kill themselves. It does happen where we have to triage our resources and prioritize some callers over others. It's painful to do that as a counselor. No one likes doing that. Let me explain to you how suicide hotlines work.\n\nIndependent of the [VA line](https://maketheconnection.net/conditions/suicide?gclid=CjwKCAjw2a32BRBXEiwAUcugiB0kPVysGt_J_-oEXPG_GGXR7uUqO3_zLFEYQ7SHamLKw8PCyfvihRoCnSwQAvD_BwE) (which is a great resource but also not perfect), the majority of the suicide hotlines fall under the [Lifeline network](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/help-someone-else/). This means if a hotline is impacted with a lot of calls then a hotline has the option to \"roll\" calls which goes to another hotline in an adjacent city. If that hotline can't take the call then it'll continue to \"roll\" until somebody can take it or the person hangs up. The problem with this framework is that all hotlines operate differently and don't talk to each other in regards to what is best practice. This means if you are used to calling a hotline within your \"network\" and you get rolled to another city then that hotline has a different set of practices and expectations that you may not be familiar with which may contribute to a poor caller experience.\n\nIt should be clear to everyone that hotlines are not money makers. We heavily depend on grants and other funding resources. Most of the time we are understaffed, underpaid, and we rely on volunteers for support. Whenever suicide is in the news (like when Robin Williams died) or a natural disaster occurs (like Hurricane Harvey), that's when we get the highest volume of calls and oftentimes we can't meet the need. Getting volunteers to commit to a weekly 4 hour shift for at least a year is more difficult than it sounds. Having people get paid anywhere from $15 to $18 an hour is hard too. Suicide is still a stigmatized topic and not everyone has the emotional capacity to volunteer 4 hours of their time every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Use very scripted methods that usually don\u2019t help**\n\nWhat do you mean by \"scripted methods?\"\n\nI can't speak for other hotlines, but I'm aware of this type of feedback. I have no idea how other hotlines train their counselors but this is how we did ours.\n\nWe used to facilitate intense 6-week training sessions. Volunteers and potential staff of about 20-40 people would meet every Saturday for 6-hour days that consisted of lectures and roleplays. On the weekdays counselors were required to listen in to actual calls and were assigned a mentor whom they were required to practice what they learned.\n\nOur model requires us to ask specific questions that identify your crisis:\n\n* Gauging the severity\n* Asking about plan and means\n* Asking about prior attempts, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, due to funding we are also required to ask demographic questions as well. No one likes doing this.\n\nAfter we get those questions out of the way, the call is focused on hearing the caller out. Basically I ask open and closed  ended questions about what's going on, and have you expand on your story. Through that conversation, hopefully the caller comes to a more stable mental state. At the end of the call we talk through resources and things you can do to help with these suicidal thoughts. We are not supposed to:\n\n* Give advice\n* Tell you how to live your life\n* Talk about ourselves (the call is about you)\n\nI understand the feedback I've received from people who say things like, \"you are reading from a script\" or \"you don't sound human.\" I get that asking those questions feel prescribed but asking about your plan and specifying your thoughts of suicide at the beginning of the call is necessary. What if you had taken pills before the call? What if you began to overdose on something?\n\nOther times I find that people are uncomfortable with talking about themselves and hate that I say shit like \"how does that make you feel?\" because it reminds them of their therapist or no one in their life talks like that. Have you considered that you're calling this hotline because no one in your life talks like that?\n\nAlso, no mater how much training I can give someone, there will always be counselors who don't follow what they learn and go rogue. Sometimes they aren't good at deescalation techniques (or not good yet).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prematurely call the police on their callers**\n\nYes, this does happen. I'm sorry if this has happened to anyone. I can't speak for others, but our hotline has a strict policy on calling police which is **don't call unless you are absolutely sure they will act on their thoughts.** Unfortunately, there have been times where we made the wrong call. Other times we were justified and the caller was mad regardless. My concern is always your safety and even if you're pissed off because I did something against your wishes, I would rather you be mad at me than I take the chance that you shoot yourself.\n\nOur hotline was acutely aware that calling the police prematurely will potentially negatively impact your experience and decrease your willingness to call us back. So our policy was to only do that if we were sure or if we got the callers consent. However, I admit there have been times where we made a bad call or did it against someone's intentions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I\u2019ve brought this up to multiple mental health professionals and they know the line sucks but they still send it out.**\n\nYes because most therapists aren't working 24/7 because they have their own lives. There are scant number of free and immediate mental health resources. I've heard the same arguments for other crisis lines like Crisis Text Line and the VA Line. All it takes is one counselor to negatively impact your experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It\u2019s over glorified so people can feel like they are making a difference or helping when in reality they are recommending something that does more harm them good.**\n\nAgain what are you basing this off of? What's the alternative to suicide hotlines then?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Feel free to downvote me into oblivion.**\n\nI won't. You're entitled to your opinion and I don't doubt that you and others have had some shitty experiences on the lines. **I just want to make it clear that one counselor does not represent an entire network of counselors.** If you had a bad experience, I'm sorry but just know that there are thousands of well-intentioned people out there and we try our best to help. I don't want this echo chamber to cloud someone's judgement and prevent them from getting the support they need.",

            "There are a lot of people that need help, and not a lot willing to do so. Those answering the phone are people too, stressed and worried that a life literally hangs on the line, and do the best they can.\n\nThere is always need for improvement in anything and everything.

I stopped eating because of it, I was surviving on baby food for 6month. I was a healthy muscular 125-120 girl and went down to 98. My OCD was controlling my life and causing me extreme distress. \n\nI called multiple hospitals to get set up. This one in particular pissed me off. I was in tears , sobbing while driving out of control and I\u2019m expressing this to the lady and told her I\u2019m on the verge and she did not care. She was very rude. Then I was told because I don\u2019t live in the county I can\u2019t be given service. That what made me realized how messed up this is. She hung up on me, I was livid. \n\nI call my county hospital and they were also unkind and unhelpful. They also explained how long the process will be. \u201cWe will have a psychologist evaluate you to see if you actually need services - this will take a month.\u201d I\u2019m like screw this I need help NOW. Seriously I was on the verge of doing something to myself. \n\nSo, honestly forget insurance. I sought out-of network therapists and I have a great one! He is so fascinating and helped me grow so much. My OCD is more calm now. What I like about this therapist and he takes you seriously no matter. I don\u2019t mind paying $130 if it means my life and happiness. It\u2019s so nice being able to book an appointment anytime I want w/o going through insurance or other guidelines or evaluations. \n\nI noticed with therapist that took insurance , honestly they were all about the money - not really as good as out of network therapist I\u2019ve have. \n\nMy best friend saw a therapist couple years back. She has a great life from the looks of it, and good circumstances (money, 2 parents, good education) but she is depressed and I know it, and she knows it too. She filled out a sheet \u201con 1-10 scale do you feel X?\u201d She put pretty high numbers on everything and the therapist goes \u201cyou can\u2019t be depressed. You don\u2019t look like it.\u201d Honestly, what kind of a therapist are you? A really ignorant one that should not be in this field. \n\nWhen I was in high school a guy did some uncomfortable things to me that caused me extreme distress. I told him to get off and he did, thankfully. I was still traumatized tho... I went to the therapist crying my eyes out and SHAKING. After I explain all she had to say was \u201c.......well did you enjoy it?\u201d !!!!!!! I said \u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME?\u201d I yelled at her. \n\nI also can\u2019t take the therapist the claim you have it better then others - sure, we all have it better then someone in some shape and form. But this really prevents people from seeking help I believe. \n\nI ignored myself for years (including my best friend) because we never been raped, or abused physically, or assaulted for years. Sure, I saw my dad die. I know a lot of people feel as if they don\u2019t need help because it \u201cisn\u2019t bad enough\u201d no. We all need help. No matter what circumstances! \n\n Right now I\u2019m doing much better. I had a victory and recently weighed myself and I\u2019m back at 120!!!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 it took 2 YEARS to get back to my normal weight.

I was trying my hardest to keep my cousins safe and be strong for my aunt so she could make arrangements, and I completely broke down. I couldn't take it anymore.

Not to be told its okay to grieve. I knew that. I was still struggling. I was damned lucky to have a friend that had experienced similar and he talked me down. I'm in a much better place nearly five years on, even after a ton of other shit, because that one friend taught me how to carry on. I've been struggling for years under the hospital mental health team with them making appointments and then just not turning up, with them calling the police when I was pregnant with a child from rape, even though they promised they wouldn't. My son is now 18 month, and is just as loved, just as cherished as his older brother. I KNEW I loved that child right from finding out I was pregnant, and they tried to tell me i needed to abort.

So now the call center requires everyone to follow a script, so they can\u2019t be sued.  But they still gotta pay out those lawsuits, so they cut back on payroll, because logically if everyone follows a script anyway, you don\u2019t need the best people.

I was just baffled that these people are the people some suicidal people talk to when they have no one to talk to. It\u2019s sad. \n\nIt also solidified my belief to never call the suicide hotline again.

This was a while ago and it was tough, I still remember every caller and in the beginning I would have nightmares about how they're doing. The kids on chat were especially tough.

            "I\u2019m so late to the party but boy do I have a story about this. \n\nSo, back in 2010 I found myself gripped by addiction. I was depressed as hell and had recently moved to a new city for a guy that had just dumped me (because of my addiction). I was young and stupid and the weight of my world was too much for me to handle. I was suffering in a kind of silence, embarrassed by all of the mistakes I had made and continued to make. When you do enough drugs for a  long enough period of time, they stop working. Self medicating had been the status quo for a long time but when I found myself in the darkest of dark places, the drugs no longer helped. I was at the point where I was having to \u201cdrink/use/myself sober\u201d because without it I risked seizures and acute withdrawals and mental collapse. \n\nI wanted to end it all BUT thankfully I had just enough clarity (due to past experiences with attempted suicide) in the depths of despair to understand that I couldn\u2019t do that to my mom. It had never occurred to me to call a hotline for help before but I made the decision to call that night. I made an agreement with myself, that if they could talk me off this metaphorical ledge I\u2019d found myself on then I wouldn\u2019t go through with it. I was absolutely desperate for someone to either convince me to save myself or give me permission to die. So I called hotline. \nAnd I will never forget how that conversation unfolded: \n\nWhen my call was first answered they asked me very quickly how serious my situation was and I told them the truth: I wasn\u2019t literally about to die but I couldn\u2019t see a reason not to. \n\nI got the impression right away that this guy was super busy. I could hear voices and phone lines ringing in the background. It was distracting and a little confusing. I had assumed that the person taking my call would have given me their full attention but this guy was in a hurry and I could tell he was multitasking.\n\nAs he began a kind of scripted reply he abruptly stopped and said, \u201ccan you hold please?\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t really know what to think and just said, \u201cuhh... yeah?\u201d \n\nHe returns in 30 seconds and quickly apologizes, claiming that they were just so slammed with calls right now. \n\nHe launches into his response and once again, almost immediately, asks me if I can hold again. I said something like, \u201cI guess so..?\u201d \n\nThis time he\u2019s gone for a minute and a half, at least. I\u2019m trying to remember if there was any \u201chold music\u201d playing but I\u2019m not sure. \n\nIt is at this point that my depressive state changed into more of a rage, angry that this guy wasn\u2019t taking me seriously. \n\nWell, I shit you not, this happened FIVE MORE TIMES. Each time I was on hold a little longer. It was during that 5th time of being on hold that I began to laugh at the sheer absurdity and just hung up. That call lasted about 17 minutes and I was on hold for about 12 of those minutes. \n\nIt\u2019s a good thing I was able to have a sense of humor about it because so many people who are calling them are so fragile and vulnerable, that they would probably have taken this guy\u2019s inattention as a sign that they weren\u2019t even worth speaking to.",

If you only want to be a code monkey, filling out software to a specification, that self-learning is sufficient.\n\nBut if you want to actually *design* software, you're going to want some theory.

I went to college to make maps. I was employed in my field before I graduated actually. I never learned how to do my job. There are a million types of maps and college just went over theory. I was never trained, occasionally my boss would make an appearance at my desk to ask why the hold up was on this project and just do it for me. He knew I had zero experience beyond my degree. After a year I knew I was on borrowed time and moved on. I got into engineering (bridges specifically, and without a degree in engineering, just experience using AutoCAD from my previous job). They actually spent a solid week teaching me to calculate camber. I was pretty good at it, I\u2019m no genius, but if you invest time in me, I can learn anything. Anyhow, I thought I had found my job. Then a month later they threw in other aspects of bridge design that I knew nothing about and it was essentially the same experience as my last job. Boss would ask me what was taking so long, do it himself instead of teach me, then I got put on probation. So I joined the FD. I love my job now, still glad I got my degree as I get paid more and can climb higher up the ladder. But wtf",
            "Truth. I had minimal college and was lucky to work at a place for almost 20 years that didn\u2019t care that I was non-degreed.

Everyone boos the person who caught the ball for not giving it to the kid. The person who caught the ball has likely been waiting since they were that kid's age to catch one and now they have an entire section if not stadium bullying them to give it to some little kid that will have 0 appreciation for it because they just did what their parents told them and went and asked for it. \n\nObviously if I ever catch a ball I will break it to the kid that inevitably gets sent over gently that no, I will not give them the ball AND I will take my boos.

Sat above our Team's bullpen for the 1st game and was able to get a pitcher to toss me the ball after the game ended.  \n\nThe next day we were next to the visitor dug out.  We had signs and were in our jerseys. So we are dealing with rooting for the visiting team but also being 2 female fans and dealing with the stupid comments. \n\nA pop up comes our way and it is in my hands... until the dude behind me yanks it out of my closed hands.  I get someone to toss the ball to me (Only one standing and the player points at me) the dude in front of me pops up grabs it and hands it to the kid with 3 other balls....  \n\nWe finally get a ball for my friend from Pablo Sandoval and I catch a 3rd ball and give it to some other Giants fan who was there.  But it took me into my 40s to finally get a ball...  Keep it my friend. \n\nJust don't KO the kid for a ball or yank it out of their hand.",

We had pretty shitty seats, the upper deck along the third baseline. \n\nOne of the opposing players (I can\u2019t even remember his name but it was no one noteworthy) hit a line drive foul ball and it took a crazy bounce and landed right next to us. It was on my girlfriend\u2019s side and she literally dropped her beer and practically dove to get it before these other two guys got it. \n\nShe held it up to a very timid round of applause and had her moment in the sun. We had a few laughs and took some pics and less than 2 minutes after she sat back down this little kid, about 4 or 5, came up with his wittle baseball glove and asked if he could have it. I joked with him and said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry buddy, next one is yours!\u201d \n\nThe fucking kid would NOT let it go. He kept asking and pointing at the ball and just saying stuff like \u201cmy turn?\u201d Or \u201cI can bring it home?\u201d I got fed up real quick but my gf was much nicer than I was and kept talking to him. Finally she asked if he wanted to hold it and he nodded excitedly. She gave it to him and he quickly ran back to his dad (a few rows back) and they both started cheering. The dad was saying stuff like \u201cyou got one, pal! You did it!\u201d \n\nI was pissed and stood up to ask for the ball back but my girlfriend pulled me down and told me to let it go. \n\nNow, if the kid almost got the ball or was sitting right next to us, I\u2019d be ok with giving it to him. But it was quite clear that the dad sent the kid down to basically guilt my gf into giving it to him. Not only that but she never actually gave it to him. She asked if he wanted to hold it and he ran away and his dad just went along with it. Oh and neither of them even thanked my gf. It still makes me mad to this day. \n\nI hope that kid lost the ball before they even made it back to their car.",

Hits my buddy square in the glove, he barely had to move. And like god damn clock work that guy reaches into his glove, pulls out a ball, and hands it to the kid next to us. People clap, the grandfather is over joyed offering to buy us beers. We decline and soon head to the concourse where my buddy reveals the MLB ball still in his glove. Gave the kid our ball and looked like a hero in the process. Even saying this story I feel like I must be making it up because it sounds so ridiculous, but it happened. The man still has the ball.",

            "So I know this will get buried but I actually have a story that connects great with this. I\u2019m a huge Nationals fan but sadly I had to move to Florida a few years back. It was supposed to be temporary but met I met a girl and she did not want to move to a state where it gets cold. The Nats are playing a game in Tampa a few years back so I tell her we should go since I always loved attending games in DC. When buying tickets I told her I\u2019m getting them in left field for two reasons, 1. This rookie Juan Soto was tearing it up and I wanted to sit behind him, and 2. That\u2019s where most home runs get hit. She asks me how many I\u2019ve caught and I told her none, when she says I must be unlucky I showed her how rare it is to actually catch one and how we won\u2019t catch one. But if we do and it\u2019s from a rays player, I\u2019d probably just give it to a kid, a rays home run ball would be something near for me to have, but it would be an amazing memory for a kid. We get in a playful argument how she thinks I should keep it and it ends with me telling her it\u2019s pointless since we won\u2019t get one anyways. Cue bottom of the fourth inning, former Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos comes to the plate and absolutely cracks one, and it\u2019s heading our way. A guy in front of us tries to catch it and it bounces out of his hands and lands at my feet. I grab it and look over to see a young Rays fan going absolutely wild, I look at my girlfriend and she goes from excited to \u201cdon\u2019t you dare\u201d. Walk over, put it in the kids glove and he screams \u201cNO WAY\u201d. She still gets mad at me for that, but our wedding is coming up so she got over it.

And no, the date did not turn into a relationship. Evidently she thought I was an asshole for not giving the kid the puck and didn't go out with me again.",

Personally If I caught a ball and I saw some parents send their kid over on purpose, I wouldn\u2019t give them the ball. If I saw a kid run over on his/her own accord then I would always give them the ball becuase I know I would be making somebody\u2019s life better other than my own.

Unfortunately, it never worked out, and I've never caught a game ball.\n\nI am a lifetime Oakland A's fan and my favorite player is Rickey Henderson.  Henderson was at an Giants game a few years back and caught a fly ball.  And as luck would have it some kid came up and asked for the ball.  Rickey being Rickey, he told the kid no, [because he had never caught a foul ball!!!](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2865084)\n\nOP,\n\nIf it's a good enough excuse for a first ballot hall of famer, it's good enough for you",

You go home after the game and use a shotgun to test if pro balls are any different than what you buy at a sporting goods store. \n4. You throw it in the Mississippi, satisfactorily thinking about the stupid brat that didn't get it, and ran back to its entitlement creating mommy. \n5. You realize you can start a sex cult based on whatever player touched the ball last. The ball will be the center of the cult. \n6. You sell it on eBay and use the proceeds to lobby MLB teams to forbid children under 16 from entering the arena. \n7. You leave the stadium with the ball, you walk to your car, and you see a landscaping crew that is running a wood chipper. You throw it in there thinking \"I'd rather throw it in there, and see what happens than give it to that spawn of Satan that expected me to give it to him\". \n8. You go to the next bar and pretend that you are a pro player, signing it and giving it to that evenings lady. \n9. The bully from high school that made your young life a living hell walks across the street right after you leave the stadium with the ball. You figure \"better use than any\" and throw the ball at him as hard as you can. The ball makes his eye explode and gets stuck in his eye socket. You are in the news again because you are the first person in your town that gets arrested with a smile while NOT under the influence of meth, crack, cocaine, or a crotch attached prostitute. \n10. You take the ball, go home. Your parents call. They are wondering what they did wrong. Your fiance breaks up with you.

Nobody wants to use angry or sad reactions to these people, but you can guarantee the dislike button would probably be the most used feature on the platform. Twitter has a similar problem. You can only like a post, but there's no negative feedback, aside from getting ratioed. \n\nI can appreciate Reddit's structure that allows you to bury trolls and people will tell you like it is here. It's partly the anonymity, people aren't expected to have a public profile here where they're the content on display, so the contributions to the subreddits are what keep people coming back, not the insights into people's lives. Each subreddit has its own culture and rules. If you can't read and participate in the fashion outlined, you'll get told, or ignored. I can appreciate that, there's a certain meritocracy aspect to it that isn't there on other platforms. Is it perfect? No. But it is refreshing not to be beholden to friends and family who might use the platform like you are on Facebook.",

You can even freshly ground the beans and it won't make a difference.  Percolators or French presses allow for the coffee to brew longer rather than tasting something burnt from a pot on a warmer.  The result is far less bitter than the coffee than expected.\n\nSimilar to alcohol, coffee is an acquired taste. IMO kids in High School shouldn't be drinking it.  It's not cool to be drinking coffee-flavored milk (lattes) in front of your friends.  \n\nIMO, avoid French or dark roast coffee if you are trying to be a coffee drinker.  The beans are roasted even longer to a burnt level making the coffee have a burnt taste to it.",

            "So I went on a holiday to Columbia last year, and boy oh boy, you learn some stuff on what coffee should taste like. Basically, if your coffee tastes bitter, it means that the coffee beans have been burned. Normal \u201cproper\u201d coffee has all of these incredible flavours!

            "Coming out of my cave for a moment here. It's not the coffee, though it truly matters, but the way you treat the bean. The fight against bitterness is best fought by not bringing any part of your conically burr ground, locally roasted, $16-$22/lb Brazilian 1100 meter bean, past 190 degrees F. This is done with a press, an AeroPress for me, at the highest medium grind setting, with water at 190 exactly, steeped for 90 seconds and stirred for the first 30-40 seconds while pouring the water, to assure a more uniform application of the heat to the bean. This is a science, more than an art, and also only makes one 16oz cup of coffee (actually, it makes 2 espressos, which you dilute with leftover hot water to make a 16oz cafe Americana, or coffee as we know it here in the USA.  At that price, I'm paying less per month for an exceptionally non-bitter potent brew, than anyone buying a medium coffee at the Dunks every work day. But, it's work, and you have to create your process. Pourovers and cold brews also should be very low/no bitterness, but time/temp/grind are the factors that determine amount of extraction and how much bitterness. Surprised this is not already written here. Maybe I'm missing the joke? Using my method, coffee only smells about 4 x better than it tastes, lol.",

            "Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn\u2019t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn\u2019t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn\u2019t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun\u2019 a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn\u2019t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I\u2019ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.",

Recently, however, after reading article after article about the brazen systematic detainment, and torture of a conservative 1.5 million people from a single ethnic group I\u2019m getting serious fascist Germany vibes. \n\nAt least the United States hides its ethnic mass incarceration under the veneer of mandatory minimum sentencing laws (I\u2019m kidding, this is not the same thing, obviously)\n\nOne article published just today presented evidence that the Chinese government had been collecting involuntary samples of DNA in order to map faces. Are you fucking kidding? \n\nAlso disturbing has been China\u2019s active use of existing technology to repress dissent in Hong Kong. \n\nChina has repeatedly demonstrated they have no qualms about shoving racial minorities into concentration camps, and a brutal capacity to eliminate opposition. I don\u2019t see any reason why China will not continue to get worse in these regards.

Laws bend or vanish to please the ones who are loaning the money, or who now have authority. \n\nWent to the Philippines in the past then went back recently and there is now a swell of Chinese working there, malls have signs in Chinese, ATMs have Chinese as a language selection. Is it bad to have foreign workers? Not really. But they were allowed in and do business, and conduct online gambling which gambling is illegal in China. \nThey even opened up restaurants that don't allow local Filipinos to dine in, because it's an only Chinese restaurant.\n\nIt's happening now. This is already the start of a war or conflict that will escalate.

            "I think China is mostly missing the racial superiority/genocide aspect of the Nazis to make the comparison entirely. \n\nThe Nazis based a huge portion of their ideology and actions upon eradicating ethnic groups they didn't like and having the Germans become the superior people of Europe. It was essentially the basis of their entire movement, the 'clearing' of Europe of slavs, jews, gypsies etc. \n\nChina is not nearly as driven as the Nazis were to commit genocide. To Chinese people, the internment of the Uighur people is nothing more than a 'necessary deradicalization' campaign and they think it will be over in a few years. Of course, we know how often these things go sour and turn into actual genocide, but to the Chinese this is just a small side project of the CCP. To the Nazis, genocide was their #1 goal. \n\nTo say its the next Nazi Germany just feels strange. They are both highly abusive authoritarian governments, but they are radically different overall. The Nazis had the supreme goal of the invasion and ethnic cleansing of Europe, that goal overrides everything to them. They were ideologically fanatically and extreme in their methods in ways that the modern CCP couldn't even imagine.",

            "This is the conclusion you'll draw if you live on reddit. Negative news and unconfirmed sources cite each other and suddenly become the reality. Media racing each other on who can come up with the most horrific news about China. Anyone speaks neutrally or simply pointing to the facts is either \"brainwashed\" or \"bending to China's money\".\n\nThere are countless celebrities in Chinese entertainment industry from both Uyghur race and Hong Kong, probably few tens Uighur ethnicity and several hundreds from Hong Kong. It's interesting that zero of them is speaking for their people, I'm sure every single one of them is morally corrupted and puts their own career in front of the life of their own race/people. Also it's more weird that these re-education camps are widely supported among Islamic nations. I'm sure every single Islamic nation is corrupted and put Chinese money in front of lives of other muslin. I'm sure US cares so much about life and human right of muslin, that's why they are doing so much more than the fellow Uyghur celebrities and fellow Islamic nations on the welfare of mulsin in China.\n\nThere are evidence on people are detained and re-educated in camps but I don't see any evidence on torture and murder. Please show me the evidence that they are tortured or killed, other than citing biased media report that are basically saying \"they are evil therefore they must be doing it\".\n\nRegarding to the Islamic extremists, mass re-education served the function of deradicalization and prevent jihadists. Of course detaining a million people into re-education camp is bad, but it's waaaaaaaay better than declaring war after war in the name of anti-terrorism, completely messing up the middle east and leading to millions of civilian death and tens of millions homeless.\n\nThe popularity of sentiment against China is just showing how easy it is for media to manipulate public opinions.",

            "You do realize that China in the 20th century is by an order of magnitude worse in death toll due to ideological fanaticism then Nazi Germany.  I've always found it interesting about us that we recognize when the right goes too far and are very open and clear about it (aka something akin to Nazi Germany) but we consistently seem to ignore when the ideological left has gone too far (aka Soviet Russia and the Ukrainian Famine, read about it! and Mao's China murdering almost 100 million Chinese folks based on class/group identities).  The Extreme Left is just as scary as the Extreme Right.  They both end in death, destruction and fascist extermination.\n\nIt's just unexpected that anything dealing in death and genocide seems to be synonymous with Hitler and The Reich but not synonymous with Stalin/Mao and Communism.  What's up with that?  Why is it cool to wear a Sickle & Hammer shirt on a college campus but a radical hate crime if one were to wear a Swastika?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't think wearing a Swastika should be acceptable socially/politically (although you always have a free speech right to do so in the USA, that's what living in a democracy is all about, sharing it with a bunch of assholes your disagree with and not murdering each other in the process) but I think the Sickle & Hammer should be right up next to it on the unaccepted list.\n\nI'm starting to ramble now, but thoughts?

Not in this capacity before the 1930's, but on a large scale for its time.\n\nWe westerners seem to take democracy and western progressivism so for granted we believe the things that have been going on for ever is odd and a defect from the normal.\n\nAuthoritarian \u2260 Nazism and Fascism",
            "Ok; let me give you another unpopular opinion (I\u2019m almost certain this will be more unpopular than OP\u2019s). \n\nI don\u2019t see much wrong in what China is doing. Religion, especially a hard line religion like Islam prevents people from mingling / harmonizing with rest of the country. China, which is on a mission, to solve its poverty and grow as a super power, doesn\u2019t have patience nor inclination to deal with the nonsense that comes with religion. If in doubt, look at the number of dumb bastards in the US who are against climate change and earth being round. \n\nChina wants to prevent the Uyighurs from making China another India or UK by caving in for Muslim fanatics and get rid of them completely so it can focus on the wellbeing of the 99% population. \n\nChinese have shown, time and again, that they are okay with losing individual freedom for the collective benefit. If in doubt, checks the statistics. They know that\u2019s how they got through absolute poverty. Not by letting any Tom, Dick and Harry do whatever the fuck they want to do. They knew freedom is not absolute and greater good matters despite what the west says. That\u2019s how they got through 200 years of West\u2019s industrial growth in less than five times the time. \n\nSo to come and tell them that the rules are different today doesn\u2019t make sense to most Chinese. They don\u2019t give a shit about the Muslims because they know Muslims are trouble waiting to happen so they are happy their government is addressing the problem head on.",

Suppression of labor rights, COINTELPRO, CIA drug smuggling, MKULTRA, the general policing habits in urban centers, city planning, bailing out the major banks a few years ago.

            "China doesnt have expansion plans, Germany did.\n\nWhile the Nazis wanted to take over much of Europe geographically,  there is little indication that China has interests in expanding its borders.  Nor would it need to, because it's got tons of natural resources already and a near limitless population of workers.  \n\nAlso, to a huge degree, China's power is a direct result of Western countries.  \n\nWe've created the mess in China by advancing their country economically and technologically by decades because capitalist companies have zero ethics.

Or America's support of Saudi Arabia (a real fucked up muslim nation if you ask me, cuz it's too fucking muslim of sorts).\n\nChina has a population of 1.4 billion. Maybe it's doing what it can to keep as much of the rest of the population happy.\n\nAnd besides, according to Boris Johnson,  Islam is a problem. [https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-islam-is-the-problem-and-islamophobia-is-a-natural-reaction-2018-8](https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-islam-is-the-problem-and-islamophobia-is-a-natural-reaction-2018-8)\n\nThis is a religion that talks about having 72 virgin wives if you suicide bomb yourself. It's backwards af. There are other cults/religions that are banned in the US too.\n\nI find the red light camera's in the US to be pretty fucked up too. I want to make illegal U-turns and break the speed limit and cross red-lights at 2am when there are no other cars and when I deem it safe. Are you cool with that? China just took it to the extreme and recognizes faces instead of just license plates.\n\nEvery country is quite fucked up. America might have arguably fucked up the world the most (countless coups in many nations), and rampant corporate greed and capitalism and consumerism that contributes most to global warming. (America's carbon emission per capita is 2x that of China's)\n\nBut America's the best, and I'm thankful to be here. So as the rest of the world goes to hell, just keep the Muslims and lazy immigrants out. Trump 2020?\n\nHow you like them unpopular opinion apples?",

By this I don't mean absolutely freezing/sizzling climates, I just mean from *mildly* warmer/colder weather than normal. I've seen myself be really stressed during warmer weather, with no real way to cool myself at all. On the other hand, with colder climates, it's really easy to cool yourself down; get under a warm blanket, get a hot drink and just **vibe** there I guess. It's really comforting too, probably one of the best feelings ever.\n\nThough this doesn't really make sense if you're outdoors and not inside, it's technically inside I'm talking about. Being outside is a whole different story, though it's technically the same answer on that side in my opinion.\n\nSo in conclusion; I don't like going outside because it's too warm  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Geez thanks for the awards and stuff guys, I didn't need this much attention. :-)",

            "I remember back when I was dating my ex she had a work friend that would tag along with plans even when he wasn't invited. Showing up at her birthday uninvited, showing up unannounced where she lived. To be fair they were very friendly but it was very obvious he wanted something more.\n\nThe thing was, he never acknowledged that me and her were dating. The most awkward moment when he showed up at her place while we were... indisposed. Then instead of backing off he actively treated me as some sort of rival that he had to win her away from.\n\nBecause they were friends before her and I met, I didn't want to be the guy who said she couldn't have guy friends. The breaking point came when he found out we were going to the movies. We came back to the car and there was a note under the wipers from him about how he looked for us to hang out waited a while and left. My guess was he was trying to elicit sympathy.\n\nOf which I had to point out, \"I don't like your friend. He's creepy as fuck. You can hang out with him, but I don't want him near me.\" I set that boundary. It was respected after that except for a few weird encounters.\n\nSad thing was. I got it. I totally got it. He's the plucky main character of the movie he's in. I was that guy too. But eventually you have to accept. She's not into you. Either be happy you have a friend or leave. There's other fucking women.",
            "Agreed, big time. \n\nI've been with my lady for going on two years and she still has \"that guy\" who emerges from the woodwork to send a borderline creepy text about how he misses her and hopes well for her and all that. The thing is- they weren't even close to begin with and she never responds to him. Yet, every time she updates a profile pic or or just out of the blue, here comes Mr. Nice-Guy-With-No-Ulterior-Motives \ud83d\ude44",
            "Or that it comes to \"I have a SO\"  to get dudes to back off because my feelings are irrelevant",
            "Yes.\n\nTo be honest, I was that fucker a time ago. Couldnt take a no and spammed her with texts when I was drunk after a party and felt alone. After a while she \"ghosted\" me and I was mad af. Why couldnt she recognize me as a human being that has feelings?\n\nGuess what, its because I didnt do that in the first place. Who the fuck wants to get some cheesy message from a friend in the middle of the night and pretend the next day that didnt happen? Who wants to constantly make up a lie about why they dont have time to meet?\n\nIt didnt stop there. I got afraid of rejection and couldnt even make a move when there would be a possible way. I was that stupid friend who only hangs out with you because Im into you but afraid to say anything.\n\nAll I can say is that I changed a couple of years ago. I dont know, maybe it was taking break from thinking I need to be in a relationship (while not being in one at all).\n\nAnyway, youre completely right!",
            "I'm currently witnessing this from an outside perspective. I asked a girl who I work with out on a date yesterday and she gave me an emphatic yes. Went to chat her up and wish her a good rest of the day at the end of my shift today, and saw her talking to this other guy we work with. I could tell the conversation was pretty one-sided, with him doing most of the talking.  We work retail, so I did some shopping while she talked to the other guy. After a bit, he left, and I was able to go talk to her. I walked up and said: \n\n\"You're awfully popular today! I think so-and-so likes you.\"\n\nHer reply: \"Oh god, yeah. He's so not my type, and he never looks me in the eyes when we talk. He's always looking *elsewhere* and I DON'T appreciate it. I hope he never asks me out, because I don't think I can let him down nicely.\"\n\nWe chatted for a couple of minutes about our days and said our farewells. \n\nI used to be the type to obsess and pine over someone. Building up some hypothetical relationship in my head and falling in love with some ideallic version of her that more than likely doesn't exist, never having the courage to actually make the move, but rather just be horribly awkward around her.  But I grew up. I asked her out, made it clear I wanted to take her on a date, and she said yes, which I'm glad for. However, if she had said no, I'd have been okay with that, too. I have the emotional maturity these days to handle that sort of thing and remain friendly. \n\nBut seeing that old version of me in someone else is a bit of a surreal experience.",
            "Most of the guys who have complained that I friendzoned them hadn\u2019t even ever asked me out. We knew each other for years, hung out, over the course of our friendship they would date someone and then be single again and I would too, and they never once indicated to me that they were even remotely interested in being anything but a friend to me. And then I get a drunk call in the middle of the night from an old friend from high school that I haven\u2019t spoken to in years, he\u2019s crying and sad cause I never gave him a chance. Sounds rather specific but that exact thing has happened to me now 6 times. Sad part is, if any one of them would have asked me out when we actually knew each other and were friends I would have said yes. Wth.",
            "I can\u2019t speak for other men, but receiving rejection is an instant turn-off, thus not barking up that tree again. Not even to be friends and that\u2019s fair too imo. Pride goes both ways, and hounding after someone after a no is cringe and void of any dignity like OP said. We owe it to ourselves to not give a shit about rejection.",
            "Exactly, sometimes they\u2019re even in a \u201cI was baseline nice to him and then he thought I was into him and I didn\u2019t want to be an absolute bitch so I chatted with him in a friendly way and oh god now he\u2019s asked me out\u201d zone\n\nWomen are taught to let men down gently, we\u2019ve all been told about how much rejection hurts men. Mostly we just act solely as friends and hope he never asks us out. We don\u2019t want to be like \u201cby the way, I don\u2019t like you in a sexual way\u201d before he\u2019s explicitly asked us out because that\u2019s unnecessary, rude and also just in case he actually did want to be friends.",

I just thought \"well I guess that's her way of telling me to back off\" and so I did. I backed off, never talked to her again. 3 years later I learn that she was into me and that she just expected me to insist. Wtf?\n\nI think the whole playing inaccessible and blocking when you're into that person is what's causing to some men to be \"that fucker\"",
            "I think this is an example of how the \"friend zone\", like many words/phrases, has been used in such varying contexts it's kind of lost all meaning.\n\nTo me the original meaning is basically a man that is interested in a woman, acts in a friendly (i.e. platonic) manner with her instead of her out (or even overtly flirting), then gets rejected when eventually working up to asking her out (the implication being that the man would have been more likely to succeed if asking her out earlier on).\n\nIt's morphed into \"guy who follows around a girl like a lost puppy even after it's clear she's not interested in him but is also secretly resentful about it\" or something.\n\nAlso one other thing...\n\n> Men, it can hurt when romantic desire is unrequited. You\u2019ll feel your pride take a bashing, wonder what\u2019s wrong with you. Understandable.\n\nNot every woman who rejects a man acts with this level of understanding (and I imagine that's true no matter what combination of genders).",
            "A very long time ago I made the mistake where I misinterpreted basic friendship from a couple of ladies as they being interested in me and tried to ask them out. Big mistake. I learned that I can\u2019t trust that I will read the situation correctly so since then I\u2019ve basically assumed I was just friends and unless I get some sort of blatant signal from them, that friends is it. I have no idea if this was the right thing to do or not but at least it keeps me out of trouble.",

            "I was talking to my boyfriend about this last night. The worst is when you have a great guy friend, you really vibe together and you have an awesome friendship, and out of nowhere he hits you with the \"can I tell you something\".\n\nBecause either a) you have to let him down and he'll end the friendship (valid) so you lose a great friendship, b) it turns out he never wanted to be friends, he was just friendly to get with you, or c) he takes it fine and you go back to being friends.\n\nObviously it's not a bad thing for dudes to catch feelings, especially when we can just go back to how things were with no hard feelings. But I've lost so many awesome male friendships because of this. It just sucks bro.",

Closer to the \u201cbest friend zone\u201d or the \u201cmight as well be gay best friend zone\u201d\n\nThat girl who legitimately shows like best friend interest in you. Takes selfies with you and posts them to her social calling you her bestie or \u201cguy friend\u201d. Invites you to parties she is hosting or going to. Constantly texting you, sometimes venting about her problems with random dudes she\u2019s met or complaining about her girl-friends. Even going so far as to make comments about how great you are and how she has no idea why you are single, or how she wishes she could find a guy like you.

            "A big part of this is cultural. Our society's bombarded by propaganda that says guys who aren't sexually successful are pitiful at best and disgraceful at worst. Thing is, why should I (or especially hurt males) take that claim seriously?\n\nWhat proof is there that low to no sexual success overrides every other positive trait that person has - primary among them is a choice to **not** hurt, harm, or demean the dignity of others?\n\nHow does low sex success even mean the person doesn't actively help, heal, or uplift others in most desperate need of it?\n\nIs a good decent kind-hearted virgin really more worthy of disrespect than a sexually successful abusive husband (since we're talking about unsuccessful men here, I'll stick to that)?\n\nAnd at any rate, starting a family is not any benchmark for respectability in the first place - due to all that I've written above.\n\nJust live your own life as you see fit as long as it doesn't hurt, harm, or degrade the dignity of others. Find a hobby you are interested in (or were, before puberty and pop culture propaganda short-circuited your psyche), throw yourself into it.  THEN, choose a social circle according to your base values and attitudes - not because of who or what crowd society says is cool.

Same dude wouldnt get confused, then angry, then depressed when the same \"friends\" would then block him and want nothing to do with him.\n\nFucking laughable. \n\nHim and his GF of 5+ years broke up because he started talking to her about his feelings for a friend of his that was only 17 at the time. He is 24. Not a huge gap but a 24 year old should NEVER want to date a 17 year old. Fucking red flag. \n\nThen he'd pay for this 17 year old to visit him. Then get angry when she wants to sleep in a different room from him. Month later he's making comments like \"dude fuck her. If she doesnt put put next time I invite her out here Ill never pay for her to come out here again.\"\n\nHe then met some girl while gaming. Starting gaming with her friends.

I.E. they don't have romantic/sexual feelings when you do.\n\nIt's always going to put you in a bad position for yourself and it's obviously unhealthy. As said move on, and if so burn the bridge with the girl. \n\nI know people will say dumb things like you can still be friends and things might work out later. Don't fall for that toxic thinking.\n\nYou don't have to be rude, but I think it's easier to either say hey I don't think we should hang out or you just ghost them.\n\nTo any ladies offended, I'm sure your life is better off not having a guy in your life who's just waiting for you to change your mind. If you think that is something you want then that's manipulative and cringe.\n\nMen can be more mature and move on. If she doesn't like you and tells you that then it's a gift to look for someone who will like you in a similar fashion. Not an excuse to treat women poorly.",

Definitely was my fault for not clarifying earlier\u2026.but I also had felt very led on. I know a good chunk of guys who experienced literally the same thing.

Everything after that statement is a waste of YOUR time and YOUR resources, because the question, the answer, and the implications can't be taken back. Anytime she complains about how a guy treats her? In her estimation, he's still vastly superior as a human being to YOU, because he's good enough to try for. Any guy who pumps and dumps her? He's good enough to risk it for the shot at more, but you, even as an effective guarantee, are not, according to her. Any time you do her a favor? Give her a ride? Whatever? You're good enough for *that*: labor for her convenience. But not good enough to date.\n\nWhatever you think you'll get, you won't, so don't do it to yourself and don't let her use you. It takes two to friendzone, and the simple beauty of it is that *you* can walk away. Save that time, money, and affection for somebody who deserves it.\n\nAnd that's the real unpopular opinion, not this \"be a gentleman, do right by women\" that's basically the default cultural take.",

            "I blame pop culture. Basically every portrayal of romance in media teaches men to hang around, be persistent, and they'll eventually get the girl. This is true of media aimed at men, and media aimed at women. All those rom coms where the sexy best friend becomes the new love interest? That crap is beaten into our heads from a young age onwards.\n\nThere are so many mixed messages between pop culture, modern activism, and even different women themselves. I'm not sure how anyone is supposed to know how to pursue someone else romantically anymore. \n\nSome women want you to be the bad boy, some want you to be the husband material, and you just have to know, because by the time you have a chance to learn what she's actually interested in she's usually decided whether you're in or out. Many women don't want to be approached by men, but then how are you supposed to meet anyone? Then there are workplace harassment concerns, where showing interest in someone can be taken as an insult, or even worse, discrimination.\n\nThe friend zone issue is a tiny sliver of the real issue. The real issue is that no one knows wtf the rules are anymore, if we ever did. Unless you're one of the few guys who can pretty much behave with women however you want and still come off as charismatic, there is no way to know what will or will not work for you. The same action that lets one guy meet the love of his life might end up with another guy being fired for creating an intimidating work environment. Every attempt is a roll of the dice because we are expected to be responsible for the proactive creation of our romantic relationships, but we are also expected to know about all of the booby traps that are laid in our way with each woman, even though every woman has different traps and trap layouts.\n\nIt's exhausting. It's no wonder why most relationships start with two drunk people letting their guard down and engaging without the typical constraints of a sober mind. You basically have to just wing it on each attempt and hope that you don't step on one of her landmines.",

            "In my adolescent friend group, all of the girls ended up losing their virginity to the same guy.  \n  \nI had friends who were girls, summer pen pals... I don\u2019t think they hated me, or why would they have written me back? Said my butt looked cute in jeans? I don\u2019t think I was hated, I just wasn\u2019t considered a candidate for romantic interest.   \n  \nI never felt entitled or got pissy or morose. I didn\u2019t do any of the hypothetical \u2018nice guy\u2019 things that people like to point to. I just put myself out there, and was never invited out of the friend zone.  \n  \nBut yeah, all of the girls I liked, and I only really came to be aware of this years later, apparently all had sex with the same guy in my class.  \n  \nThis turns out to be pretty typical. I\u2019m not upset about it, even in hindsight. It\u2019s okay. People are allowed to do whatever they want with their lives and their bodies. There\u2019s not a problem here that needs to be fixed or justice to be disseminated.  \n  \nThe only thing that does bother me is this absolute lack of empathy for the \u2018nice guys\u2019 who are left out. Girls are free to all pine after the few most eligible bachelors while ignoring the majority of average guys. That is their right.  \n  \nBut I think it\u2019s understandable when guys get frustrated by forces beyond their control. That\u2019s a tough deal. If a guy falls in love with a girl, really just full on heart filled adolescent infatuation, and is prepared to do anything for her, offer her all his love and commitment... and she prefers to pine after some guy who doesn\u2019t remember her name, that\u2019s harsh. It\u2019s no excuse to become a dick, but it\u2019s worthy of some empathy rather than just mockery.  \n  \nIn the end, everything works out. Guys are able to establish themselves later in life, and, even if men are involuntarily abstinent more often than women, women obviously endure their fair share of indignities as well.  \n  \nMy overall point is just about empathy. I think, when everything\u2019s said and done, the lifelong experience of dating is probably more or less equally frustrating or fulfilling between genders... depending on how cynical you are.  \n  \nBut I do think there is a pretty big lack of empathy for young men, and that\u2019s something we should try to improve on as a society.  \n  \nIf you love basketball, but you\u2019re short, that\u2019s tough luck.  \nIf you love a girl, but she loves somebody else, that\u2019s tough luck too, and it seems like we\u2019re getting maybe a bit too comfortable just ridiculing those guys. A women has absolutely no obligation to have sex with anybody she doesn\u2019t want to. There\u2019s no entitlement or \u2018justice\u2019 or \u2018fairness\u2019 or any other factor with any merit that needs to be considered in evaluating the proprietary of who a girl ought to select as a sexual partner besides her choice. My only contention is that the guys who get left out of the dating scene? Try to be sympathetic.  \n  \nThe girls in my life have all been pretty great. I was never mocked or ridiculed or treated in a way I thought was unfair. But I do feel, and maybe it\u2019s just Reddit, that there\u2019s a growing acceptability for just raking undesirable guys over the coals, and I hope that doesn\u2019t become too common.",
            "Depends how you define friend zone.\n\nFor me the friendzone is more that you're very close friends with a girl. And you do everything for her because you are in love. And she enjoys your attention but doesn't see you as a viable partner.\n\nIt happened to me once. And it was gruesome. Cause she'd rope me in. If it went bad with her BF, she'd come to me. She'd promise things. Send me texts that would make me believe she loved me too but actually just keep me as some sort of toy. \n\nAnd the thing is. I tried to distance myself and move on. But I was in over my head and she would purposefully flirt with me to rope me back in whenever I distanced myself. \n\nIn the end she even used me for sex, she asked to stay the night. And then was like' this is just a one time thing' even though she knew I wa madly in love \n\n\nLooking back on it I feel really really stupid. Like. Really' I should have left it. But she was toying with me and when you're madly in love, you don't think straight.\nIt destroyed me and plunged me into a depression and a self esteem crisis for a year or two. It really was hell and erasing her from my life was the best thing I have done. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. The dudes being stupid and pursuing a girl that obviously doesn't want anything happens a lot. But that's not friendzone IMO.\nThere are girls who take advantage of guys who are too kind. They know they have feelings for them and they like it. And they'll use it.\n\nSo please don't just throw all guys under the same bus. That friendzone thing can be a lot of things.",

            "The problem with the so called \"friend zone\" is that fundamentally, men and women just don't view it the same way. Men could go from being friends to a couple in a second. Women just don't think that way. A lot of men have this idea that they'll be \"next in line\" if they have a female friend who is in a relationship already. Then they get stunned if she DOES break up with her man, but then continues to not show any romantic feelings toward them. I had a ton of female friends in high school and college. I never once tried to hit on them or thought anything would happen as I knew they wouldn't go for me. That being said, if virtually *any* of them had told me they were in love with me I would have gone from friend to boyfriend in 0 seconds. But, it just doesn't work that way. I'm 45 now so I am able to see all the errors of my ways but I can also say men don't get it.

            "I agree, even when it comes to just being friends with these types. I have noticed that those who feel the need to put EVERYTHING out there on social media tend to have some sort of major issues, anywhere from extreme insecurity to narcissistic behavior. The obsession over social media always interferes with your relationship with that person as well, and even worse in the case of romantic relationships, especially if said person tends to really be a drama queen and post every life detail, including private matters that should be left between you two only. \n\nAnother thing I notice about people whose entire lives revolve around social media is that they tend to be extremely negative, almost always looking for a fight. I know of a few people who are always posting very controversial things, obviously looking to start a Facebook war, and they have a very pessimistic outlook on life. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the rise in mental illnesses these days has something to do with how many people are addicted to social media. I think too much of it can definitely have a negative effect on the mind (in fact, I've had to really distance myself from Facebook, especially during this time when there seems to be a lot of political tension due to the upcoming election here in the US).",

I have yet to meet any one who considers me \"shady\" for not having social media besides reddit, but if I do, then fuck them I just don't like social media... \"But you're missing out on memes!\" Okay, send it to me and if it's funny I'll laugh. If friends/love interests aren't compatible because of internet culture, then thank God it didn't work out in the first place. If you think it's a red flag, then you're as dumb as they come.\n\nSecond thought and relatively unrelated:  In regards to r/VostoDeVulpo's post I forgot that flip phones are still around at all -- I admire that you understood your employees, and I didn't get a smartphone until my early twenties because (again) I don't care about social media. Employers hating on you because you don't have social media is stupid, but generally the only people who use flip phones are drug dealers (not judging, just saying). Unless your super poor, I think everyone should have a smartphone because I can get why an employer would think that would be sketchy. Going back to my main point though -- however, if they don't hire you because you're absent on social media, then it probably wasn't worth it to begin with. I don't want social media and probably won't again besides reddit and LinkedIn for jobs, but I don't hate people that do because that's like 95% of the world.

Expensing and ordering in 300+ work phones for people to use at home for a situation that nobody knew would last this long just wasn\u2019t feasible that quickly. So they gave us permission to use our own phones as long as we put no caller ID on so that the people that we contact don\u2019t get our numbers.

I was a DV advocate for many years and I saw horrible, horrible abuse cases involving same sex male couples. Gay men on average experience high levels of sexual and intimate violence. And society is not ready to talk about that. Even among these comments I haven\u2019t seen much of a talk about same sex male couples/situations.\n\nI remember one of my clients had a horrible case that became pretty notorious and it was being spread on social media- most of the comments were negative comments made by other men who were cruelty making fun of the victim and were using homophobic rationales to justify what had happened.

My buddies were calling me trying to see where I was and I couldn\u2019t tell them because I didn\u2019t know, but they said they saw me walk outside with her and never came back into the bar. I only had a few drinks, nothing anywhere near enough to get drunk let alone black out like that.

            "I mean both sides do it, its impossible to have any sort of public thread about anything related to men's rights without some feminist, male or female, coming in and tripping over themselves to show either that women have it worse or that men's rights movements are pointless because feminism somehow helps men.  \nFor this reason there is a ton of discussions about men's rights, sexual assault included, that dont involve talking about/against women, but they have to be in private environment because feminists see the mere idea of pursuing men's rights as an attack on women.  \n\n\nI think I can speak for most male victims when I say that the vast majority of us have had our problems dismissed in some way by women arguing its not as bad for us because we are men. Dog forbid one of us got raped by a woman, because in that situation its even worse.",
            "I agree. However, I do think it should come up in the discussions you're talking about. Just not as a 'counterpoint'. So instead of \"Well so what? Men get raped too!\" it should be \"This goes for all rape victims, both men and women.\" \n\nPersonally I think there's issues on each side.   \nYou have one side that only promotes rape prevention and rape reporting exclusively for women while shouting things like \"teach men not to rape\", essentially accusing men of inherently being rapists.   \nThen you have the other side that feels the promotion of women's issues is a feminist power grab and therefore fights any effort put forward purely because they feel it's an attack on men in general rather than actual rape prevention. \n\nWhile both sides are the minority they do tend to encourage each other since feminists blaming men for rape is actually an attack and therefore makes the second group justified in fighting back.   \nHowever, because the second group appears to be defending rape, since they're arguing against anti-rape campaigns, the first group feels that these people have rapist inclinations, and since they're all men it reinforces that idea of 'men need to be taught not to rape'. \n\nSo basically, feminists and menimists are both stupid and any advocating for rape reporting should be gender neutral since it affects both genders. While 90% of sexual assault cases might be toward women, it's not like anti-rape campaigns would lose effectiveness from being gender neutral. Reassuring people that they'll be supported if they report their abuser is universally sound advice.",

I met many unique males who each faced their own bevy of struggles and challenges. Some were belittled for what they faced; some were not; all of them suffered immensely when someone told them that their suffering wasn't valid.\n\nThe culture we live in has unique ways of silencing male victims.

Rape refers to being penetrated without consent.  As such, the statistics show that women are raped far more.  Because when men are forced, they usually are not penetrated.  \n\nPeople imposing their will on others, sexually or non, is not a sexist trait, but rather a personal one.  Some people enjoy overpowering others, and some to a point where they lust after that control.   They could be male or female.  \n\nMen are victims of abuse, rape, sexual assault, and a slew of other atrocities.  We're just disposable.

            "Efforts have been made to talk about male victims of rape, but as discussed below, those efforts are silenced, or not even allowed to get off the ground, especially when men are raped by women (the most common form of sexual assault men face).  The answer here is to take male victims seriously in the first place.  It is unfair to both say that people only bring up male victims when talking about about women being raped while actively silencing any independent discussion or consideration of male rape victims.\n\nFor statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. You should listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape: [https://clyp.it/uckbtczn](https://clyp.it/uckbtczn).   She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.   As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence **does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely \"unwanted contact\"**\n\nYou see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics. E.g.\n\nDetecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206\n\n>Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**\n\nSrc: [http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf](http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf)\n\nShe is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbyists, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.\n\nMost people talking about sexual violence refer to the \"rape\" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, and 2015 NISVS studies.\n\nAs an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm)\n\n>**an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**\n\nand\n\n>The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nvs\n\n>**an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**\n\nand\n\n>Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),\n\nSo if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of \"made to penetrators\" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**\n\nBut since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3rmapx/science\\_ama\\_series\\_im\\_laura\\_salazar\\_associate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/)). Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.\n\nAnd before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been pretty close between the sexes every year, and that's *before* the fact that male victims go much more underreported than female victims.\n\n2015 survey results - [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf)\n\n2010 survey results - [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc\\_nisvs\\_ipv\\_report\\_2013\\_v17\\_single\\_a.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf)\n\nScientific American - [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known)\n\n*data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd non CDC study...\n\n*A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*\n\nThe Atlantic - [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/)\n\nAnother non CDC study...\n\n*a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd another non CDC study...\n\n*National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d*\n\nTime - [http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers](http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers)\n\n*when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d\u2014either by physical force or due to intoxication\u2014at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*\n\nJust maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.

            "Because male victims are mocked and shamed and told that it wasn't \"real\" sexual assault/rape. So they try to just keep their mouths closed, but shit like that can stay quiet for only so long. They aren't taken seriously when they try to talk about it normally, they are told that if they want to actually support men's issues then they have to do so at the \"gender centers\" which are poorly disguised women's centers. When men try to say that they want to support each other they are told that feminists do that already so they should just sit down, shut up, and be grateful - nevermind that men can't speak out about women's issues because they couldn't possibly understand. Finally, it seems like most of the time men are only believed if they say something like \"if you switch the genders\" or \"if I was a woman\", so they have been conditioned to bring their issues up around women's issues because that's one of the few times people take them seriously.\n\nr/egalitarianism is frequently a bit of a shit show but in general they actually post good sources of much of what I mentioned above and r/menslib has to declare that they are actually feminists just to be able to be left alone to support men",

            "I think there's two reasons why people do this.\n\nReason #1: It's to shut the opposition up because they don't feel like getting into the meat of it and want to throw around easy enough to say phrases in order to sound smart without putting two iotas of an effort into doing so. Or sometimes they do it to \"win\" an argument against feminism because they just don't like the movement.\n\nReason #2: Because nobody wants to give a two flying shits about male sexual assault outside of the context of women getting sexually assaulted. Outside of the context of modern feminism, which is hellbent on keeping women as the universal oppressed gender, most male issues exist in a vacuum of sorts where they are rarely, if ever, heard by others. And if it is, it's treated as a joke and dismissed without a thought.\n\nNot to say that this is the only way to bring up male sexual assault, because it can have the unintended side effect of demoralizing and sidelining the issues women do face in the wake of sexual assault. But since society almost seems brainwashed that men are inherently incapable of being sexually assaulted by virtue of being a man alone and nothing else, the best time many people see as opportune to discuss male sexual assault is when female sexual assault is discussed.",

That was how the adults treated it as well, which in retrospect just makes me so angry. There was no police involvement or anything. Not that they've ever done anything for any of the incidents I've managed to pick up the courage to report.\n\nEven my close friends are just like \"huh, guess that's not great\" and treat like it's not a big deal.

Like...how is this normal?\n\nEven among comedians (I know, it's just a joke, but still...) the male rape jokes are so prevalent. Like P90X only existing for people who just got convicted and have to report to jail in 90 days, and want to get as jacked up as quickly as possible because they're worried about their butthole.

Also, a lot of the time, the publicised wonder aren't to actually spread awareness, but to fit an idea, like the patriarchy. You can see this by just looking at people in politics.

I thought the worst was over, but at the time I had a super toxic partner and when I rang her she told me it was all my fault and angrily hung up. I probably should have ended that relationship then and there but I guess I just wanted someone to believe and support me. Anyway after that was dealt with my assaulter texted me every day for a week, switching between low key taunts to straight up telling me no one would believe me because she\u2019d done nothing wrong. I kept ignoring her until I eventually said to her that if a man had done to a woman what she had done to me there\u2019d be no doubt it was sexual assault. 30 minutes later she said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and at the uni\u2019s advice I blocked her.

So i asked her why she accepts women dealing with being abused, but not men.\nHer answer was, men should deal with it on their own, or just kill or beat the person who did it. Men dont come to talk... and she was serious. Asked if they had any men there, got told no.\nSo i explained. If i do that i go to jail. i want them arrested, not me.\ngot told, i should try something else then.\nHung up,\nrang the police.\nThey couldnt believe i got this reaction.\nOfcourse the woman denied denying me.\nand that was the official helping point for a large region.\nso i really struggled.\nnobody got arrested.

So anyone with vaguely similar search terms will end up on that page with the false assumption that the nine dollar piece of shit will do the trick. \n\nI hope that doesn't happen to you, but it's a definite possibility.

There's definitely a nostalgic sort of community quality to them, but that's being overshadowed by 50%+ price markups, the congestion of traffic, and just the fact that it's pretty unnecessary to have to travel to buy most things in this day and age.\n\nA lot of cities have insane real estate and rental prices and could really use that space for housing.",
            "You're getting shit deals because of the way amazon and more commonly big box stores priced out smaller retailers through massive amounts of investment and speculative debt. As another commenter said, amazon is not profitable unless it wipes out competition. The result is that only the sketchy places stay open and have to rely on overcharging the few customers available to stay afloat.\n\nThis is exactly what happened with taxis. The only taxis around are absolute scams because all the normal honest taxi companies that relied on being fair and having more customers were wiped out by uber and lyft, two companies that also use speculative debt and investment to price out normal companies.",
            "This is so true tbh. Amazon is just better, but it\u2019s because they literally drive the small businesses to the point where even if they\u2019re charging 3x the amount they still can\u2019t make ends meet and they\u2019re still gonna go out of business.

I jammed to them and he featured in some of their songs n he was never like someone to \u201clike\u201d. He was unique and a character for sure, and knowing who he was in the emo scene was very common but he wasn\u2019t anyone to idolize. He was a shit then n he\u2019s a shit now, it\u2019s just weird because back then he could exist in his shitness and contribute to his character to the scene without all these weight behind it, you could kind of just brush him off if you weren\u2019t a fan but weren\u2019t out to get him either.\n\nIt\u2019s 1. Weird that a man who sang about getting pee\u2019d on in a song about MySpace became a makeup guru \nBut also 2. It\u2019s weird how invested we get into these people who literally mean nothing to us now. I kinda miss when you\u2019d just ignore someone if you didn\u2019t like them.

He also made a general comment about how black women should throw acid on their skin to lighten it up so they could wear the right color foundation. He is creepy and a blonde version of Marilyn Manson who looks like he crawled out of the pit of Hell. \nHow he achieved the status of being the 5th highest paid YouTuber is beyond me.

            "I agree with this. I am very passionate about dogs and I have seen the horrible nasal malformations that cripple dogs who are bred with short snouts and what a detriment it can be to their quality of life.\n\nI have helped people train dogs, and I have seen a pug start choking after taking in water through the nose while trying to get a drink from a bowl. I've seen   a bulldog who couldn't breathe properly while on their back and lying on their sides a certain way. I've also seen many short nosed breeds suffering and struggling to breathe through their noses, or it being so bad that they have to breathe through their mouths their whole lives due to the fact that their nasal cavities are so warped.\n\nThe right to breed a specific breed ethically should end when their suffering begins. If an animal is struggling to do basic necessary tasks like drinking water and breathing, you know you've fucked up.\n\nI get that they are popular and cute, but it makes them suffer. No animal should be disabled to the point of having trouble functioning in day to day tasks for the sake of something as superficial as looks. It isn't right. It is literally paying to have someone breed a deformity into your pet. Dogs were never meant to have snouts that short.",
            "Some of the dogs that are bred, it\u2019s so cruel. Imagine having asthma bred into a group of people. Yet there are so many people who claim to be animal lovers and don\u2019t talk about this at all. I find it hypocritical.",

            "I am a dog lover myself, so this is something I have wondered about for a while now... There are so many irresponsible breeders out there. What makes me sad is when a new, \u201ctrendy,\u201d breed pops up, like the Puggle or the Pomsky: they are bred and sold into oblivion and more often than not, the litters have tainted bloodlines. They start breeding mothers with their older children or litter mates, and that\u2019s when it gets really bad for the dogs. \n\nI have had only one purebred dog in my life, and it was a Shetland sheepdog. She was healthy, and her litter was her parents\u2019 only litter. She was given to my family by my mother\u2019s boss at the time, and he had all of her and her parents\u2019 records and breeding lines. All of my other dogs have been mutts, and they have been extraordinarily healthy\u2014even my rescue who had lived almost five years on the streets before she was found by a shelter owner. I think the first step to stopping incessant breeding is to quit putting breeds into such high importance. Additionally, it\u2019s about changing attitudes about certain breeds, because until that stops, people will continue going to puppy mills or breeders\u2014many of whom are irresponsible\u2014to purchase them without knowing or caring much about the breeds aside from, \u201cit\u2019s cute.\u201d",

It would be nice if the debilitated breeds could get support to go \"retro\" like the pugs and the AKC WOULD CHANGE ITS STANDARDS so that these poor dogs could have a better quality of life. \n\nAnd frankly, flat-faced anythings are ugly, imo. Not ugly-cute, just ugly. I don't understand why anyone likes them.\n\nAlso traits like German Shepherds' sloping haunches need to go away.",

Sadly, as I am 16, I don't have control over my cav's vet visits, but I will notify my parents and see if I can convince them to bring it up. I wish all of your cavaliers good health! And for those passing by who aren't aware, though cavs don't suffer as much breathing-wise as other dogs, they do have poor cardiovascular systems. 50%  of cavaliers develop heart murmurs by 5 years old, and almost every cavalier has them by the age of 10.

David Leavitt was the original OEB breeder, but he has since separated his dogs into their own breed called the Leavitt Bulldog. Leavitts are required to go through health and joint testing before being approved for breeding, and any dogs who show genetic defects are required to be neutered. They look drastically different, but this is how bulldog breeding should be! The kennel club English Bulldog is so deformed.",
            "They should definitely be cross-bred with hardier breeds, maybe the larger ones with labrador retrievers, and the smaller ones with schnauzers, or something. \n\nOr, if more people would just adopt rescue dogs, the world would be a better place. I have a husky/lab/cane corso mix, and she's healthy and happy.",
            "Sad but true. My whole life I always wanted a Grate Dane but when I learned they only have,give or take, like 7-9 year lifespans I just can\u2019t bring myself to get one.  Their bodies die of old age before they are even old at heart. So sad.",

            "Completely agree. I'm not a dog person and have never owned a dog but sometimes when I see specific breeds I just feel bad. I think a lot of dog owners don't know that their dog is finding it hard to live because dogs are incredibly loyal and always seem happy, despite not being able to breathe/see/walk etc.",
            "Dog eugenics is the problem. I think instead of letting them die out cross breeding in healthy animals and fixing the disgusting changes in the last few years to dog breeds would be great. Old school bulldogs and pugs used to have snouts. Not these squished in faces. The tiny genetic pools for individual breeds hosts scores of health problems. Breed for temperament and health not aesthetics.",

It was continuous and disturbingly sad. \n\nThe pug puppy was energetic and happy but she couldn\u2019t even keep up with my lazy adult Maltese\u2019s playing due to snorting and struggling to breathe. My friend says she can\u2019t even take her for walks due to breathing issues and heat stroke. \n\nThis pug is not obese nor does she have any abnormal health issues that aren\u2019t typical of her breed.

            "Theoretically I agree, but the simple reality is that **it isn\u2019t possible.**\n\nThere are too many dogs of these breeds in circulation, and they are too popular. You could force every legal breeder of Pugs to shut down right now and there would still be millions of pugs in the wild, being bred by people with no idea what they\u2019re doing. The demand for Pugs would only rise, creating a Pug \u201cblack market\u201d where their value would skyrocket and their living conditions would plummet even further than had they been raised by certified breeders.\n\nNot to mention, they\u2019re being bred all over the world. So you would need an instantaneous *global* ban of pug breeding (good luck getting China onboard), a task force to seek and punish illegal pug breeders, and then you\u2019d need to wait 1-2 decades for the rest of them to die out. Even then, there are just too many to deliberately drive them to extinction. \n\nIt\u2019s a nice thought - one that I\u2019ve had many times myself - but it literally isn\u2019t possible.",

            "Vet student here. The number of brachycephalic(short-snouted) dogs with respiratory problems we see is honestly depressing. Breathing problems shouldn\u2019t be a normal, natural part of an organism\u2019s day-to-day life. Brachycephalic breeds are prone to BOAS(Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome), which can effect even the most basic of activities. Bulldogs usually can\u2019t even breed and give birth without human intervention. And we MADE them to be this way. Nature doesn\u2019t make animals like this, and for good reason.\n\nAlso...\n\nWe need to stop breeding certain colors and patterns too. \u201cLilac\u201d and other \u201crare\u201d colors usually are not genetically viable in dogs. They are associated with inbreeding, blindness, deafness, skin problems, and other issues. PLEASE stop breeding these dogs!!!",

Some breeds that are used as service dogs I can understand, but as a whole I personally think it's unethical to keep breeding dogs when there's already an epidemic of homeless animals in the US. Not to mention that there's next to no accountability for breeders to actually take care of the animals they breed. Three of my family's dogs were rescued from people who got them from a breeder and realized they had fleas, pneumonia, etc. and couldn't care for them at just six weeks old.\n\nBut as for your specific opinion, yes, I agree. It's not the animals' faults - I love French Bulldogs' personalities, but they have so many breathing and health issues it's kind of depressing. Also, some of those dogs can't even naturally reproduce, which should tell you that they're not meant to exist in the first place.",

I remember fondly being a hoodlum - smoking cigarettes under bridges and getting shitfaced at house parties, flirting (or at least trying to) with girls and just generally discovering who I am and who I wanted to be. I doubt very much most adults are referring to the act of going to highschool itself. It also doesn't mean it's all downhill or anything, just that it's a period in your life where you're sort of both an adult and a child, that you will never get to experience again. There are good things about being an adult too, and you should look forward to it.",

But high school shoukdn\u2019t be considered anyone\u2019s \u201cglory days\u201d. You grow a lot in your twenties and your brain finishes developing. But over the years you just won\u2019t really care about what happened in high school any more.",
            "It think nostalgia is why that happens, you remember the good bad and forget a lot of cringe. I had a a lot of mental problems in high school, and was jokingingly called the 'school shooter' by a friend so you can guess how well it went for me lol. High school is great when you're popular, sucks if you're a lonely outcast.",
            "My best years started after I graduated school and uni. These supposedly best years of my life were actually the worst for me.\n\nI didn't know what to do, what I wanted to do, I was anxious, awkward and constantly depressed, I had self esteem issues and constantly questioning myself. I'm in a much better place right now and I definitely don't miss those years.",

The good times were some of the most fun, probably because I was younger. Easy to look back nostalgically at the 10%",
            "I was told this all through high school and \"you'll miss it when you graduate.\" \n\nHigh school for me personally was the most devastating and disheartening four years of my life. I still have some of the people I met there on social media and they try to organize reunions which sounds horrifying. I didn't even go to my own graduation ceremony despite my father's pleading and telling me \"it's always been my dream to watch you walk across the stage to recieve your diploma.\" My home life was part of the reason high school was so shit. It's usually the kids with the well rounded and put together families who enjoy their high school experiences.",
            "Some people love it, some hate it. I would say most hate it. IMO, the best part of your life should never be locked to a specific age. You may be 50 and that is when the best moments of your life happens. I agree though, high school fucking sucks.",

            "If high school was the best years of your life, you're doing life wrong. Yes, you are free from responsibility, but the amount of pointless drama, shitty friends, the inexperience with life in general, and the pressure to determine your purpose in life just plain sucks. I'm 42, and my 30s were the best years of my life so far. You're still young enough to have energy, but you have some life experience by then.",
            "In fairness, adults just say shit like that because other adults have said shit like that. They're not even thinking. It's just something to say to a younger person, because you can't relate to them because you have nothing in common.",
            "For me, high school was probably the worst period of my life. I was deeply depressed and regularly abusing any substance that'd let me escape from reality. I was incredibly lonely. I felt like I was really awkward and unfit for dealing with real life.\n\nI'm in my early twenties now. Moved out, started working, went to uni. I still struggle sometimes when dealing with my responsibilities and I do miss not having to worry about things.

            "I\u2019m 41, I love my life now. I have a great home, fianc\u00e9, career, and friends. But I had to work really damn hard for all of it. I had some really hard times and went through a lot of shit to get here. I miss high school, I miss how easy it was to make friends, I miss my musical theatre friends, I miss how easy life was even though at the time it seemed hard and emotional. I loved learning and wish I could not work now and just go learn and be on sports teams with my friends. I miss crushing on the guy in the hall. I honestly miss all the emotions of being a teenager. So raw and bright. I miss school dances, and stupid football games that we all went to just to hang out in the parking lot, because our team sucked. Would I trade what I have now to go back? No, but there is definitely something nostalgic and innocent about high school, everything was a new experience. The experience of crushes, music, failures, successes, partying, ditching, being grounded, being \u201cin love\u201d, being heartbroken, all of it was so real and intense. Hopefully they aren\u2019t the best years you will have but you\u2019ll wish you could have appreciated them more when you were in the moment.",
            "I agree, I actually feel BAD for the people who peeked in high school. Once you can LITERALLY do whatever you want, whenever you want, is when you truly meet yourself, and you probably kinda suck. For me, this process was especially shitty, learning to treat myself like I was worth something is still a work in progress. \n\nBut being an adult and out of my abusive household has been better overall, I would never go back to before I was 18, high school or otherwise. Once you take on the full responsibility of caring for yourself, is when you realize \u201cyou\u2019re just like your parents\u201d because you learned how to deal with things from them, even if in a more broad aspect. I (24f) have realized over the last couple of years that I am basically my father. During this period of figuring out how to do life with your specific, personal set of experiences is a different ball game for everyone. Some people have their own kids before even reaching this point. Some people never decide to work on themselves and just decide \u201cthis is me, I guess\u201d. And some people decide to change. And some people even come into adulthood with a decent skill set that gets them by while they figure out the rest. \n\nLong story short, life doesn\u2019t get worse, it gets harder. But it also comes with new, awesome, sometimes joyful experiences that are worth the effort and you have the freedom to MAKE things happen.",
            "THANK YOU! As someone who\u2019s dad died 3 months into freshman year I couldn\u2019t stand this sentiment. Even my older family members would perpetuate this shit knowing full-well that my high school experience wouldn\u2019t come close to what they had. \n\nWere there good times I can reminisce over with my friends? Hell yeah - I met all of my closest friends in high school and have maintained those friendships into adulthood. \n\nBut seriously, I\u2019d rather die than go back. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m past it and can look back on it fondly, but I remember the muscle aches from sleeping 1-3 hours a night consistently. I remember the general anxiety from being a teenager combined with the existential anxiety of how fragile life is. I remember how badly I wanted to die because I was in so much pain mentally every day. I remember the one and only time I cut myself just to feel anything at all. I remember never feeling up to snuff against my peers academically and the condescension that resulted from both students and faculty alike. \n\nHigh school straight up was not a good time. The circumstances and life experience I gained around high school were tolerable. But really it was the people that did it for me - for me, that\u2019s the end all be all of any enjoyment from that place. \n\nHowever, that\u2019s separate from my feeling of gratefulness to my younger self for going through it. As an adult I\u2019ve benefited so much from the suffering I endured, the coping mechanisms I developed, and the perspective I gained. I\u2019m 23 now and seeing some of my friends hitting similar lows that I had back when I was 14-17 and being completely unprepared for that level of \u201cwhat the fuck is the point.\u201d",

You can't do that once you graduate high school.",
            "Kid, I'm in my 30's. I hated everything about high-school when I was in high-school. I got told the same exact thing by adults at that time. If I can tell you anything worth a damn is this. Being an adult is infinitely better than being a teenager. There is not one damn thing I miss about high-school... not one. I was so happy for that chapter to end. I made more friends as an adult, found more freedom, and learned so much more. High-school is not even close to being the best years of your life. Will you miss it? Maybe I don't know you. But I sure as hell don't. I would rather work 2 minimum wage jobs for 80+ hours a week than to ever repeat a semester in high-school. I would ignore the people who say those are the best years as it is very likely they have dependence issues or simply can not function without some authority figure dictating their life. Trust me the freedom to do whatever the hell you want as an adult is 100% better. Will you have bills? Sure, but that all depends on what you want to spend your money on. Your best years are yet to come. And I'm in my 30s and know my best years are yet to come as well. I have had a great decade and can only look forward for more.",

I was so afraid they\u2019d find out. They had threatened to take me out of my public high school so often that I withdrew from everyone. I also had mental health issues they refused to take me to a therapist about. They even told me never to go see my school counselors, so the government wouldn\u2019t take me away from them (they were big into government conspiracies too). \n\nI still love my parents, and they\u2019ve chilled out considerably. But oh my god was living a lie for four years stressful. I still struggle, but I wouldn\u2019t give up my freedom for anything now. High school sucked.",
            "Don't know why so many people say this. Would definitely say my 20's have been a lot better. I was pretty awkward in high school and generally didn't really know where I fitted in exactly. A lot of these doubts have cleared up with time. Also you have a lot more freedom in the sense that you don't live with your parents and you have a lot more income, giving you more possibilities. Of course it also comes with more responsibilities, and I do miss being as carefree as I was in high school some times. But I would definitely say the good sides of adulthood make up for the bad, as long as you have energy and don't get disheartened by failure. Because you are most likely going to fail a lot. I know I did, but for me it worked out, because I just kept going.",
            "The message isn't \"it's all downhill from here\" it's that you're really going to miss these days. Highschool is the time of your life where you become who you are as an adult. You ARE who you're (pretty much) going to be for the rest of your life. You can have a job and money while also remaining care free like you were when you were a child, it's like being an adult without any of the major responsibilities. You get to see your friends every day, I'd kill it be able to see my friends again, we see each other maybe once every 2 months. You can participate in band or football or art class. It's harder to find a group for things like that as an adult. When you grow up and reflect back on your time in highschool you realize how much you had it made, how you would have done things differently. None of those people matter really, you could embarrass yourself or try talking to anyone and everyone just to see what sticks and it doesn't really matter most of them won't be in your life in 4 years. Don't get me wrong, it's cool being an adult, owning a house, having stable income, etc. But in reality I think back to highschool days with fondness. Walking for miles and miles around town, going to concerts, flirting with girls, just watching people do stupid shit in class was fun. I can't pick up and go on a road trip in the summer as an adult. I have to work 6 days a week 70 hours a week 52 weeks a year just to afford being alive and having food to eat. Plus time fucking FLIES after high school. It really does, people used to tell us that when we were in highschool and we never really believed them. You're just working and one day you realize like, the kids that were in elementary school when I graduated would graduate this year, what have I done with my life? It's already been 9 years for me. Before you know it you're 30 and... It just sucks man. You really need to sit back, take it all in, and enjoy the *hell* out of it. You only get to be young once.",
            "They aren't!! I personally really enjoyed college. Most of my 20s, also loving my early 30s. No kids, stable financially, rewarding job, and close friends. \n\nSometimes I wish I was still stupid enough to go dance at a club until 2 am, and I can if I want to... I just don't want to. Would rather stay up talking about ideas and current events, or even just laugh at about life with my friends.",

So many different people I could talk to on a daily basis, so many people I had little inside jokes with and whatnot. Even after high school I still talked to a lot of people. I saw a lot of my friends at college and/or back home. Then I found out my girlfriend got pregnant. Two sons later, and a daughter in the way, I don\u2019t have really any friends. I lost my core group of friends from drama between them myself and my wife. I talk to one person from school.

Just make sure you are constantly moving and bettering your life even if it\u2019s only a little bit day by day. I 100% prefer my adulthood to my childhood and teenage years. Is it easier?

            "It\u2019s life before responsibility and unending regret. Enjoy it while it lasts",
            "I pretty much told my kids the opposite, high school sucks - just get through it and you will enjoy college.  I also told them to try to enjoy high school as much as possible. Do extra stuffs- sports/clubs that interest them.  I\u2019m like, In college you make your own schedule, work odd hours and you are partially on your own.",
            "I absolutely hated high school, it was actually some of the worst years of my life. Being a hormonal teenage girl with heightened emotions was horrible, all the stupid drama that went on with other girls was crazy. I got severely emotionally hurt during those years. Those who say it was the best years of their life were likely popular, had a significant other, on a sports team, or something like that where they peaked and excelled. Those people generally have nothing after high school. \n\nThe best years of my life were college by far. Living away from home for the first time, in a dorm with all your friends is a blast. Being able to do whatever you want, when you want is amazing. Then after college things are still good because you can still be on your own, but you\u2019ll be working the majority of the rest of your life and doing that every day can get boring. But you make up for it by doing whatever you want on weekends. I like being an adult honestly, other than paying bills.",
            "For some it might have been. For others not so much.\n\n For me they definitely where not my best years. While i'm thankful for the things i've learned there, they where not the happiest, and i actually feel more free now. Life is what you make of it, and if you plan on having a good one i'm sure you have a lot of good times to come after school OP!",
            "Oh god no, high school is miserable for a lot of people. Your young adult years will be the best.",
            "The best years of your life are after you\u2019ve realized that you won\u2019t accomplish the dream life laid out for you by anyone else but your own vision for yourself.",
            "This is BS. My teenage years were filled with a ton of anxiety about what the F\u2019 I was going to do with my life, how to meet a girl, heartbreak when said girl eventually broke up with me, busting my ass working for chump change so I could go to community college, and on and on.  It was stressful, sad, and exhausting. Sure there were good times too, but it wasn\u2019t all sunshine and roses.  \n\nBeing an adult is much easier because much of that uncertainty has been resolved.  Sure, I have bigger responsibilities now, but I feel better equipped to handle them. Not to mention the freedom that comes with being an adult. If I randomly decide to play video games all day Saturday, that\u2019s my call, and the rest of the world can kindly go F\u2019 itself. Just hang in there. It gets better, not worse.",
            "Definitely not true. College is the best years of your life.\n\nTHEN it\u2019s all downhill.",
            "If high school turns out to be the best time of your life, sorry, but you're a fucking loser.",
            "As you age and gain experience you will understand this better.  Although if you are an overachiever, you could perhaps be going through some of the most stressful time you will ever know.  It is not the best time to be alive today and perhaps the people that are tell you this grew up in the greatest time to be a kid or young adult (70's - 80's).  I personally feel for anyone under the age of 20 right now.  Your lives fucking suck.  Good luck cuz your sure gonna need it.",
            "cause its wrong. college is the best years",
            "My high school years were the worst years of my life. And the people that say that they are the best years of your life are lying to you. \n\nHigh school is not the best years of your life. And it shouldn\u2019t be. You don\u2019t want to be one of those people that peaked in high school. Life after high school is scary. But after high school is when you get to blossom and build YOUR life and not have your life being built for you anymore. High school is rough for most people and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a growth period. Believe me, life gets scary with more responsibility but it is so rewarding and so so so much better.",
            "My favorite teacher in high school point blank told us that any adult telling us that high school would be the best years of our lives had lived a very boring, sad life themselves. She was... interesting but also correct I think",

            "I HATED school. I was bullied by girls for having red hair, and for some reason boys liked me, so the girls would call me a slut. I went to a small school, so everyone knew everyone and rumors were more entertaining than the truth. At one point, there was a rumor that I lost my virginity at the age of 10. 10! So when I would hear shit like the OP title. It would swing me right into a doom gloom perspective. \n\nAs an adult, I would never exchange my life to go back to school. My life is so much better. IMO, people who say OP title are the ones who were popular at school, and where never bullied.  Now as adults, they harking back to their \u201cglory\u201d days of school. Because they were someone then, and now they are not.",

            "What that really means is it was the best years of their lives, most people however do not peak in high school.",
            "There are a lot of people who, at least in their own perception of themselves, \"peaked\" in high school.  It's really kind of sad.  It's also a ridiculously distorted way to remember the teen years.  In reality, it's a horrific period of time - full of awkward, painful development, questionable choices, emotional overload, and hormonal insanity.  There are great times, great friendships, and you'll hopefully get through it intact with some great memories, but saying it's the best of times is like thinking the Renaissance was all art and culture and leaving out the disease, poor hygiene, and lack of antibiotics. \n\nAs someone who is about to hit 50, I can tell you that in my humble opinion life just gets better as you you get older, if you're doing it right.  The only downside is that your body starts to get harder to maintain (aches and pains, weight management, etc.)  But even so, I wouldn't trade my life now for my life in high school for *anything*, and I had a great time in high school.",
            "I couldn\u2019t agree more\n\nHigh school was one of the worst parts of my life.",

            "im a junior and honestly i don't miss my childhood in the sense that i want to go back, i miss it in the sense that i could have done so much more and made so much friends and crap rather than being a rage-filled incel suicidal sociopath sitting on my PC 24/7 only living to escape reality",

That\u2019s still mind blowing to me. \nYou want a dog?\nGet a dog. \nAlready paid all your bills and saved a bit more?\nBuy that video game, damnit.

            "Totally agree. The fact is, it all goes downhill after age 8 or 9. WAY before high school.",
            "High school may be the best for some people, but the best time of my life so far has been college and beyond. Particularly 23-28. High School sucked! Living with your parents, nothing to do, not having full freedoms of yourself. Having a curfew from the city and your parents. Teachers and the high school having rules on what you can wear, or when you can use the bathroom. Not being able to go anywhere. I\u2019m from the Midwest, mid sized town. There is literally nothing for teenaged kids to do, except hang out at a coffee shop, or at a friend\u2019s house. \n\nI really find myself missing college, the friends all living around you, the free time etc., but those feelings are starting to fade a bit. It\u2019s not all downhill from HS. Now a new phase of life has begun and that is different and fun too! Having a better job and making more money, having goals of buying a house etc.  Having a family of your own. If someone gave me a chance of reliving High School days, I would not take it!",
            "Graduated a few years ago. Its not that everything goes down hill, its that high school is just simpler times that you don't fully appreciate until you're in a different phase of life.\n\nThere is a lot to look forward to. The only difference is the level certainty. In high-school you know you're getting a diploma. In real life you have no idea whats going to happen tomorrow. In a sense, real life is just unpredictable and ever changing",

There's plenty of fantastic stuff to come, but, bills suck, owning things and having to take care of them sucks, having to go to work when there's other things you want to do sucks. It's not all bad, owning stuff  rules, being able to accomplish your goals without anyone telling you what to do or how to do it is awesome.",

Well, except when some rando from high school hits you up on Facebook/Insta or whatever and you ghost them because you\u2019re not the same person anymore.\n\nHigh school is a joke. \ud83d\udcaf agreed with you. It\u2019s the modern day equivalent to a participation trophy. The beSt part is you still won\u2019t know how to do taxes, build a marketing or business strategy, and lack a bit of emotional intelligence. You\u2019ll learn that after you get your heart broken a couple times or start dating. \n\nI would encourage you to never stop learning, never stop growing, and if something is hard, or there is an obstacle to success, acknowledge that the obstacle is the way and push through it. Challenge yourself. Do something tomorrow that you didn\u2019t do today. Lastly, always love yourself first.",

I did get married young but my husband and I have gotten to live in cool places, meet all sorts of people, get into all sorts of adventures, (hell were moving to a fucking tropical island in a week).

Those may be the most FORMATIVE years, but they definitely won't be the best. You've got an entire life ahead of you, kid.",
            "Yeah, I don't get that. K-12 is literally kiddy jail. College years were amazing as you have much more freedom, and what I love about being 30 is you drop a lot of insecurity you feel when you're younger. If I could go back to the freedom of college with my 30 year old mindset that'd be amazing. All I can say now though is cut through the bullshit. Travel while you can and things are not nearly as dramatic as they seem.",
            "Lol what. As a nearly 29 year old they\u2019re right. High school was by far the best time of my life. And I\u2019ve had a good life. Stop being so soft they\u2019re just telling you to enjoy yourself.",
            "lmao! as a 30 year old I can assure you that it\u2019s not all downhill from high school. you have loads of amazing and fulfilling experiences to look forward to that will blow high school out of the water. nothing in high school can touch the experiences I\u2019ve had in the last few years.",

            "Yeah - this is stupid advice. High School can be fun but it also can suck or be totally forgettable. The same goes for every other aspect of life. The best message to take away is that every experience can be what you make of it. Even the \u201cbad\u201d experiences can give tools or lessons to be prepared for or mature enough for the best experiences. Also, it\u2019s okay for your job not to be your passion. It\u2019s okay to make ends meet and find joy in life through your non-money making pursuits instead.",
            "For what it\u2019s worth, life is rough at times but that claim is false. We all do and will always romanticize the old days... when I think of childhood I think of the fun times, not being grounded all the time or getting bad grades if I didn\u2019t show my work. I don\u2019t remember how much time I spent bored living away from friends and without high speed internet. We look at the past with rose colored glasses. If I could restart life at a specific point, it would be right on graduation of high school. \n\nDon\u2019t fall for the romanticizing... I\u2019d like to go back, but only with the freedom and knowledge I have now, and the respect of being treated as an adult",

I hated most of the people I met. I saw through their masks because I had that mask on myself.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert. I love physical activities but I love to do them alone. If I could talk my HS self, just be yourself and improve on what you do best.",
            "I agree.  My teen years, in particularly high school, were the worst years of my life.  I would rather be an adult than go back to high school.  I was a total failure and had the hardest time coming to terms with myself and the world around me.  I had trouble fitting in during high school and I felt so hurt and sad about it.  It felt like it was the end of the world.  Even though I\u2019m now in my 30s I still feel like I missed out on something great and it makes me a bit sad.\n\nI think high school is great for \u201cnormal\u201d people because you get to experience \u201cgrown up\u201d stuff (dating, relationships, driving, etc.) for the first time and I can imagine how new and exciting this is, but it is absolutely painful for those of us that deviate from the norm and totally missed out on all of this.",
            "There are benefits of being in high school that you won't find anywhere else. But almost no one would trade being an adult for going back through high school. \n\nI certainly liked college a lot better. And I enjoyed the time after college before kids even more. Now that I am financially stable and I have kids, I get a different kind of fulfillment from life that I wouldn't trade for any of those times. Can't wait to see what it is like to have older, more independent kids, and then to see what life is like when I have an empty nest.\n\nAlso, 2020 sucks. It will get better. Even if there is a new normal. \n\n\"Enjoy the wow... That's happening now\" -- advice from Daniel Tiger (did I mention I have kids?).",

You have little clubs where you can easily meet people with similar interests and you've got everyone rooting for you because your life is still full of endless possibilities.\n\nIt only gets worse from there.

So much god damned money, own house, sick car, travel to Vienna on a whim, danced with a literal princess at a Viennese Ball, hooking up with french girls, go to brazil for the brazilians, go to Barcelona for the Spaniards. Trying coke, loving coke, quitting coke. Journal books filled to the brim.\n\nEven as I settle down into a probably marriage relationship, girlfriend is 9 years younger. I'm sporting that experienced wisdom she cant grasp. M'lady comes to me for advice and I got thr answer. She knows I got my shit locked down so she takes extra care to stay important to me.\n\nHighschool was the tutorial completely worth skipping.",
            "You may not see this message at this point, but I've noticed most people who say that really did plateau in high school. I remember hearing that phrase, getting depressed because high school was not a great time for me for a multitude of reasons. Let me tell you, I am in my 30s now... so far, the 30s have been the best time of my life. And I only expect it to get better.\n\nI think better phrasing should be something like, \"High school may be the best time of your life *so far,* and it'll only get better from there.\"\n\nDon't forget it's your life. You can take control of it. Don't let others' narratives drive you away from your dreams. Advice is one thing, but sayings like how high school is the best time is absolutely negative and not constructive at all.",

Being a teenager is super weird. Just because you aren't an adult doesn't mean your life is care-free frolicking through the fields.  \n\nI think better advice would be to work hard but also play hard. You have tons of energy and few responsibilities so make the most of it. Spend time with friends, have fun, make good memories. But make sure you're also working hard to set yourself up for a good life down the road. Don't be the person that is so miserable that high school is the best time in their life because it definitely doesn't have to be.",

            "Completely agree. When I was told that while I was young it killed me inside and made me much more suicidal than I was. Often people project THEIR experiences on youth and its not appropriate to do. \nWhen I was younger I DIDNT have any of this mysterious \"freedom\" or any of that shit that they say they miss. \nLiving in poverty as a 12 year old caretaker of an elderly parent, being a 15 year old orphan, having no friends, being homeless etc was most certainly NOT the \"best time of my life\". Not being allowes to dress myself as a teenager without having my clothes inspected was not freedom. Not being able to leave a trailer in the woods was not freedom. Not having shit for myself was not free or fun and young. Not being allowed to have friends was not being a kid and being carefree.\nMy point is, not everyones experience will line up and to tell someone when YOU assume the best part of their life will arrive or leave based on YOUR life is wrong and all together can be the catalyst for suicide. I almost did it on a whim after someone told me that when I was young. I never felt so disrespected even while being beaten. \n\nI'd rather work full time but have MY money to use on what I want, talk however id like, have the ability to travel if I were in the place to do so, have an adoring partner, and dedicate my life to my beliefs and choices any and every day than 'be Young' and helpless again. being older is AMAZING and many people also believe being young was the worst part of their life. I can't wait for what's in store when I'm even older because I KNOW the best part of my life hasnt come yet",

Not to say there isn\u2019t a lot of great stuff ahead for you, but the amount of stress free, spontaneous fun you can have now won\u2019t be possible as a full fledged adult.

You get to stay up late for videogames, sports or just hanging with friends. A cop may still see you as young and let you off over something dumb. Your parents are still there for you with the holidays, cooking, bills and just that smile of love. Often the age is more adventurous and forgiven more mistakes. Sleeping in without a care about losing out on something. Maybe eating so much more than you should but getting away with it! Trips with friends to theme parks to do dumb stuff but being let off because of your age. Adults actually trying to care or look out for you even if they do it badly. \n\nI hated high school and was treated beyond poorly by faculty along with fellow classmates. If you ask me if I have anything positive to say about it in itself? The answer will always be a big fat no and the system fails students. Now if you ask me if I miss it? No but! I will miss everything else that walks alongside it. I would redo it in a heartbeat to try for a better outcome and have more fun.\n\nAdulthood has charms but honestly I'd still rather take the time when people actually forgave me for not knowing everything. Just do not worry about it man and my only advice to you is just live it. Stay at friends, take a trip and do it all. Leave that part of your life without regrets because one day you are the adult. Smile at your younger sell for falling asleep playing that amazing game till 5am.",

If you work hard in life, take the good with the bad, and just focus on making you the best you you can be I promise every decade will be better than the one before. And not by a little but by a lot because every decade you will be 10 years wiser, 10 years more experienced and learned and have 10 years more resources at your disposal. If I could go back in time and give myself one piece of advice it would be meditate 1 minute when you wake up and 1 before bed each day, focus on your health and wellbeing and let everything else express from that place of health and well being.

I was feeling so shit a few days ago I was going back into disordered eating that I really started struggled with during freshman year. I was genuinely considering self harm and the only thing that stopped me was considering the scars. My life isn't terrible, and I know adult life isn't all the best thing ever, and I'm working on myself and my mental health now and not just waiting for college to come by.

            "I kind of think that is just from people who don't consistently work on themselves and just settle for what they are used. Life for me has gotten progressively better since highschool. Sure there are different difficulties, but that's all they are is different. Highschool for me was a shit show. Was it fun? Sure it was. Was it out of control because of lack of responsibility, hormones, drama, and being an arrogant, ignorant shit? You fucken bet. I felt trapped and very limited in highschool, as well as, a pressure to fit in. Outside of highschool you can choose who you want to be, who you want to associate with, what your real interests are, what you want to learn and so on. It's a wonderful journey figuring out who you really are, rather than having it dictated to you. \nThe best thing you can do is always be grateful for what you have, no matter how tough things may seem, spend time with yourself to learn about you and how best to care for yourself and never ever stop learning. If you aren't learning, you might as well be dead.",

Even if highschool is 10% fun and 90% suffering from high expectations and too much work, that 10% is gonna make up most of what you remember.",
            "Late to the game here. Who is running around saying high school is the best time of their life. I have lived a relatively normal and traditional American life and the usual way of high school, on average isn't the best years of anyone's life under 30. I was reasonably popular, athletic, social too but was well aware that \"this wasn't it.\" I also went to a smallish college and those were by far the years of which these adults are referencing. I completely understand that a lot of people don't get the traditional college experience but I'm in my 30s and live a picket fence life and its still better than high school. Bottom line - this is misinformation.",
            "High school was so academically stressful and difficult because I needed to do very well to get into my uni course. But looking back it really was the best years of my life, being around my friends all day and just not having \u201cadult\u201d responsibilities yet. Despite all the mental breakdowns about exams and tests I really wish I could be in high school again.",

            "My life started looking up only after I finished technical college. Your life begins to shine in your early twenties at the most, and this is my own personal opinion, observation, and experience, but I didn't get to participate in too many activities in high school due to personal reasons and the kids that DID participate in a lot of things did look like they were having a very good time. But there are limited things you can do in high school and unless you're absolutely tops at everything I don't think you can call high school the best years of your life. On the contrary it is easily the worst years of your life. My adults then told me that college will be the best years of my life and even that wasn't true.",
            "In the novel \"Celibate Succubus\" someone asks \"wow, you are an actual demon from hell, what is life like there\" and she says it's like high school.",
            "I agree! I\u2019m a teacher and I never tell my students this, I do tell them to take advantage of the opportunities to do fun stuff in high school, but I tell them their lives can get a million times better as they get older and to not lose hope if they\u2019re feeling down. My life kept getting better and better after high school and I can honestly say I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been now that I\u2019m in my 30s. High school has its good points, but for lots of people post high school is so much better. For me, having the chance to spend time studying things I really loved in college was awesome, and being able to choose who I lived with, who I hung out with, etc made all the difference. I worked a lot of different jobs and even got to travel a little. Also, I found my confidence and stopped being so shy. I feel like a totally different person today in many ways and high school is a distant memory. I hope this helps someone who\u2019s younger than me have a little hope for the future.",
            "Who thinks High School years are the \"best years of their lives\"? LOL, wow. That's pretty sad. I would say that High School is probably some of the worst years of your life. You're a slave to the school and have to show up(with no choice), do tons of work(with no pay), and have little to no respect a adult would receive from their Teachers and society at large. You're a slave to your parents and have to check in with everything. What time you have to be home? What you can do, where and when? You have little to no autonomy. Clearly not the best time of your life."

Being a former smoker, I recognize the addiction and subsequent irritability of coffee drinkers and it bugs me to no end that caffeine gets glossed over as an addictive substance, or even fucking celebrated to some extent.  Those people who brag about needing 5 expresso shots (sorry, esssspresso) a day need an intervention, not a nod of approval.  Seriously, all you coffee drinkers are the biggest group of fucking enablers I've ever seen.\n\nWhen doing group activities, like camping, I loathe waiting for others to start their day after a morning ritual that hogs counter space, or propane, or dirties good clean water.  I hate the sleepy look in peoples' eyes as they grasp their cup of stimulant that they wouldn't need had they never started drinking it in the first place.\n\nThere's an entire fucking cupboard in my kitchen dedicated to stupid coffee mugs and their dumb sayings staring back at me despite living in a household where only one person drinks coffee.  Why?  And the dishes.  Since nearly every person drinks coffee, inevitably us non-coffee drinkers are going to have to clean up after your morning fix.  Seriously, I've done so many goddamned cleanings of coffee mugs if I had a dime for every one, I'd probably have enough for a Starbucks franchise.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Starbucks.  Godamned devil business slanging legal crack for decades, hogging good real estate so addicts have a place to slurp up and get their morning shit in before work.\n\nLastly, I despise the amalgam of ways people cook up their black powder and then talk up the flavor as though it tastes like something other than a dirty sock.  That's your addiction speaking.  You want to know why you need to dump half an udder of cream in your cup?  It's because cream is fucking delicious and when combined with your filthy water, makes it somewhat bearable.\n\nAnd your stupid machines that creak and groan through the quietude of my morning can go fuck themselves.  Talk about a waste of counter-space.  And the spent black stimulant granules that spill over onto the counter, staining the grout drives me nuts.\n\nAnd lastly, the goddamned keurig cups or whatever they're called are one of humanity's worst inventions, sandwiched between Glyphosate and Joe Rogan.  At least the meth addicts don't deposit a plastic remnant that will persist in landfills for hundreds of years spreading micro-plastics into our environment every time they need to get high.",

To those who do, whether by choice or not, give birth to handicapped children, you have my deepest respect and I don't doubt that parents will do anything in their power to provide the best life for their children and love them the way they are, but i don't think it's wrong to assume that such a life is more emotionally taxing than raising healthy children.

            "My wife and I just had to go through this. She was pregnant with triplets and when we got to the first anatomy scan disaster struck. Not only were we told that one of the three babies basically had no brain. She had developed pretty much none of the mid brain structures, all of the ventricles were full of fluid. It was just an empty dark void where her brain should have been. But we were also told that another baby had some very worrying signs of potentially having Trisomy 18. He had clubfeet, a hypoplastic nasal bone, and his limbs were measuring behind in growth numbers.\n\nThey sent us for genetics testing and for the baby girl confirmed with just another note detailed scan that she was basically a lost cause. The poor thing showed evidence of at least one stroke and was literally having seizures during the scan. They saw the same worrying signs for the boy and they took amniotic samples for the boy and the seemingly healthy girl to do the genetics on. For two weeks we were dying inside because we were going to have to terminate her for sure. Not only that but if he had that particular trisomy he had like a 10% chance of even being born alive. If he managed that he had maybe a 5% chance to live to his first birthday. There was even a chance because of all of this virus lockdown stuff we could miss the window to terminate him if genetics came back that he did have that trisomy. We were both absolutely distraught.\n\nLuckily for us, if you can even call this lucky they got the termination done on the one that needed it and genetics came back that absolutely none of the babies had genetic issues. No additions, deletions, extra or missing chromosomes. She just had the profoundly shitty luck to just randomly not develop several key brain structures.\n\nMy wife has an eight year old from a previous marriage with significant developmental delay and autism that when diagnosed was rated half a point from severe. I love him to death, as far as I'm concerned that is my son. Having another child with a disability we could handle. But even I couldn't bear the thought of what this poor baby would have to go through if he came back positive for that particular trisomy considering it very likely could have been too late to abort in a way that wouldn't endanger the one healthy baby.\n\nI've never been more pro-choice than I am right now. No one gets this far and just decides they want to kill a baby. No one. And I implore any pro life people to consider that even if you don't agree with abortion as a concept, there is basically no way to craft an anti abortion law such that it wouldn't hit all of the cases like my wife. I'm sorry that I can't offer you any assurances that the scenarios that you fear won't come to pass other than saying to just trust in people. But that's where we have to be, and I'm sorry that it's the case.\n\nI wrote a bit of a novel here. Sorry if some of the grammar is off I'm writing this on mobile while laying in bed.

Their first child had it and the poor kid was going through hell. I also recall the child dying and the parents decide to have another child even though they knew the risk. The next child did end up having this terrible diseases as well and suffered.\n\nIMO that was incredibly irresponsible, selfish, and cruel. They could have adopted and were warned about this.

The people alive today with severe disabilities didn't choose to be born that way, they didn't choose to be met with a combination of pity and revulsion upon first meetings, they didn't choose to be excluded from normal activities, they didn't choose to be different.

If a couple or mother knows that their kid is gonna be born with a severe disability and chooses to abort then they are *not* saying that those alive with that disability are somehow lesser than, or that those alive with that disability should be killed. Those parents are simply saying \"this isn't the life we want for ourselves and/or our child\".

I think another reason why people do that is because of this false narrative movies and media in general tend to depict of the severely disabled kid being the unlikely hero. \n\nI\u2019m not saying disabled children *cant* amount to anything.

But many times, other siblings, friends or relatives, once the parent dies or becomes unable to care for the disabled person, ends up having to take care of them. If they have the person live with them, it's a constant sacrifice. If they're in a group home, it's a constant financial sacrifice.\n\nI'm not saying whether you should or shouldn't abort them. But I am saying that I have a ton of respect and empathy for people who are forced to make such a hard choice.",
            "This definitely isn\u2019t an unpopular opinion where I live, that\u2019s why they have the tests in the first place.",
            "I completely agree. When my husband and I found out I was pregnant and decided to keep it I told him that if a test comes back that suggests a handicap then I'm getting an abortion. He fully supported my view and has always felt that i should have the final say on anything pregnancy related for obvious reasons. I have bad depression and anxiety, my daughter, while amazing, can be difficult enough for me at times. I know that I absolutely do not have the ability to care for a handicapped child. It wouldn't be fair to the child, myself, or our family. I have great respect for the parents that become their handicapped childs champion.",

            "I think it's also important to mention that not all handicapped people are\" the most loving people\" some people are extremely violent , some are sexually aggressive at care takers . Some don't understand the world and are constantly frustrated, over stimulated  and angry and harm others and themselves even though it's not their fault  .\n\nThe  reason why in mentioning this is that I think people get an image from their head that somthing with disabled adults is \"cute\" and \" awwww\" .   One of my close friends used to work in a facility that to care for mentally to save adults and she got hit.bit, Jizzed on ,shat on eventually she had to quit because the physical toll is too much. But if she talks about the negatively (the physical abuse, low pay, ect) she's \"not being compassionate\" or gets very little sympathy even though i know for a fact people most people wouldn't want her job anf even less could actually handle it -  but she loved her clients even though the daily abuse . that is compassion-but its still abuse too.

            "I had an abortion many years ago for this very reason. I was told early on the fetus wasn't developing properly and another scan about 4 weeks later confirmed the fact.  If I had gone on with the pregnancy and the fetus survived, it probably wouldn't survive the birth (less than 5% chance of survival), it would have been born deaf, blind, mute, not fully physically developed (obvious deformities), and been in pain 24/7 until it died - one doctor said about 0.5% chance of surviving 3 months again assuming surviving the birth.  I wouldn't want to live like this and would never condemn anyone else to either.  I don't look for anyone's approval or judgement and give the same to anyone else in this position - only you can decide what's best for you and yours.",
            "Early on in my moms pregnancy there was a false result that said I would be born handicapped. This was the 90s so I\u2019m not sure how accurate those kind of tests were back then. My dad flat out said he couldn\u2019t care for a kid like that, he doesn\u2019t have the temperament and patience for that and the kid wouldn\u2019t have his best life honestly. At the very least he wanted to put me up for adoption to someone who could care for a special needs child. Thankfully another test proved that one wrong and I got to live, but I don\u2019t blame him in the slightest, I couldn\u2019t handle a kid like that either and I don\u2019t look down on anyone that can\u2019t; it takes a special kind of person and you\u2019re giving up a normal life. Not only that, it\u2019s not just for 18 years like most kids, it\u2019s for life with certain special needs kids",
            "I wrote my undergraduate honors thesis on this actually.\n\nFor context, I am a pro choice woman who works as a special education teacher for kids with severe to profound multiple disabilities. I have worked with kids with intense needs for about 6 years now, and I love and cherish my kids more than anything else in the world. However, I still think women and couples in general deserve to make an informed decision about having a child who may have complex needs. In my opinion, it comes down more to how we as a society can become more accommodating and supportive for people with disabilities and their families. We need to have people who have experience with living with disability counseling couples who are making these choices, not just medical professionals who only know disability in a medical context. We shouldn't deny that having a kid with a disability can be very challenging, but I think its important for people to know that there is so much joy in it. \n\n In my research I found that the primary concern of parents of children with disabilities, like most parents, is providing for this kids in terms of health care, education, care once the parents are older and even gone. If we had a more robust network of social safety programs for people with disabilities, then many of these concerns for parents could be eased. It will never be easy to raise a child with a disability, and people should always have the option to choose what is best for their situation. Let's focus our energy and resources on making the choice to raise and love a child with a disability as accessible as possible.",

However, if you think it\u2019s wrong to terminate the pregnancy under normal circumstances, then this is just ableism, unless you can give a reason why disabled people don\u2019t possess the same rights that able bodied people do. The argument that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want spend my whole life taking care of the disabled kid\u201d is devoid of any moral reasoning, and only \u201creasonable\u201d if you consider doing what\u2019s best for yourself, regardless of morality, reasonable.",

            "I think if the handicap is life threatening/altering it\u2019s understandable. Like a minor handicap can usually lead to someone still leading a happy and healthy life with some adjustments. But if a child will suffer severely and most likely die soon after birth, or if the child would basically have to live at the hospital, I would understand parents wanting to terminate the pregnancy, even if I don\u2019t agree myself. I could understand the situation, though on the flip side, there are many adoptive couples that only adopt children with disabilities which is a very noble cause. But of course, they can\u2019t save every child. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a hard situation to be in for the mother and father faced with the possibility of aborting a child they probably wanted but had a disability that may make life difficult for both them and child. It is nuanced like many things. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve noticed on Reddit, most people are fine with abortion anytime and for any reason unfortunately, so this probably is actually a popular opinion to most.",
            "My partner and I have had the talk about what we would do if we were pregnant and found out that the child will be disabled and we decided we would not go ahead with it. It\u2019s hard, but in my line of work I\u2019ve seen parents who can\u2019t meet the child\u2019s high needs due to their disability so they relinquish \u201cparental responsibility\u201d. So the child ends up in residential care with absolutely no independence due to their physical limitations and intellectual disabilities. It\u2019s barely a life. But I have respect for any parent that cares for their child with special needs. It\u2019s hard work that\u2019s for sure.",
            "This is the reason I wont ever have kids. I always think to myself, you have no business having a kid if you cant give 100% to it and love it no matter what. I could not give up my life even for a healthy child never mind a disabled one that required extra care. The same goes for those people who have a kid, and then if the kid is gay, and the parents are homophobic and they disown them - why have the kid in the first place if there is even a slight  chance of you not loving it for who they are?\n\nAnyway back to the main point, regardless, if you are pregnant and find out early on that the kid is going to be handicapped and with little quality of life, yes it is selfish to bring it into the world. It is not fair to make someone exist in a shitty life just because you want them to, because you love them and want a little piece of you to carry on into the world.",

            "I am a sibling of a severely mentally handicapped person. She cannot cook for herself, bathe herself, count money, or hold a job that requires any independence at all. She must be watched 24/7. Her and I are both now in our 30s. My parents are close to 60. I will be the person responsible for her financially, physically, and legally when my parents can no longer care for her. That\u2019s a lot of pressure, and it\u2019s hard not to let resentment seep in. That could be next year, could be in 20 years. It\u2019s hard to plan for.\n\nThe financial side of having responsibility for a special needs person is the most straining. We can say we love these people all we want (and yes I support the progression of rights for special needs people), however the financial strain cannot be ignored. I estimate it costs anywhere from $50k-$100k per year to support my sister. I earn in the top 10% of earners in the USA and I still don\u2019t know how I can afford her care.   Unless I give up my life to take care of her. That would be a lot cheaper but I pay with my freedom. Anyone here willing to do that for the next 30-40 years? \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about my financial future. My parents retirement and any inheritance there may be will be spent on my sister\u2019s care. What about my immediate family and their financial future and educational expenses? What about my retirement?\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider the legal responsibilities. Special needs individuals are protected by law (as they should be), but it can be very difficult on the legal guardians. Once your special needs adult turns 18 in the USA, legal guardianship must be established if they are a dependent adult (like my sister). Which means if you leave her alone at any time, the caregiver can be arrested. Let me repeat. She can NEVER be left alone for the rest of her life and this is protected by law. A friend of the family\u2019s parents went to JAIL because they left their special needs adult home alone for 2 hours. 2 hours!!!!\n\nThe state and federal governments do not currently have enough resources (funding, buildings, etc) to adequately take care of these populations. It falls on the parents and siblings to pick up the slack financially, physically, legally, etc.\n\nLike to travel? Forget it. Try finding a qualified person to watch your special needs kid or adult for 3+ days. Maybe you have a nice family member that will take this burden on once every 5 years.\n\nWant to be an empty nester? Probably should forget about that dream, too.\n\nI completely relate to those of you who teeter on whether or not to have kids and/or terminate a pregnancy and/or give a child up for adoption because you are afraid of the life you\u2019d lead if the child are special needs. Your fear is COMPLETELY valid. I know many who live with guilt, depression, and loss of every kind of freedom you dream of because they are responsible for a special needs individual.\n\nI could write a lot more on this, but will stop there.",

I have always wondered about this because I myself am disabled with many different complications. If I were to have a child, of course I would love it however I will feel regrettably guilty if that child gets my disability as well. It can be almost unbearable at times with the pain and if I would eventually have to watch my child suffer with the same thing I have or would kill me.",
            "Yes! I completely agree, as the primary caretakers (and presumably the person carrying for 9 months) they have the right to abort. \n\nI still believe, though, that people need to do their research before writing off a child with physical and/or mental disabilities. Though raising them may be difficult at times, it is for any child, and you doesn\u2019t how to adapt. It may take more time, patience, and learning by to do things a different way\u2014but there are soo many resources out there for parents with kids on the autism spectrum, with cerebral palsy, physical deformities etc. \n\n Support systems, while not perfect, are out there to help parents and their loved ones. Plus there are many group homes, shared living, in house aids etc. that can care for them when their primary family care takers are no longer able (or if their guardians are unable). This can help guardians to maintain a relationship with the person, but not have the stress of caring for them 24/7.\n\nYes, it is hard, but they are some of the most amazing, loving people. I know there are places in the world where support is not as readily available, but if you can\u2014don\u2019t write these people off completely without knowing it all!\n\nTo sum it up: do your research.

She decided not to and here I am, \u201cnormal\u201d\nI was also supposed to be a twin, but I ate him so perhaps that\u2019s had some influence on my health.",

            "Choosing to terminate a pregnancy is reasonable.",
            "I don\u2019t disagree. But I think it\u2019s still important to remember that there a million other things that could go wrong in pregnancy, labor, delivery, etc that could result in a child who is not neurodevelopmentally normal. There are no guarantees in life. When you decide to have kids you are choosing the potential for all types of responsibilities.",
            "I definitely agree with OP in this. One of my mother's friends became pregnant, and she was told after some testing that the child would be born without any bones (a rare defect I can't remember the name of). She didn't believe in abortion, and decided to have the child anyway. This was heartbreaking, especially to my mother (she's been trying to get pregnant for over 13 years. I'm her stepchild), who has openly said that if something like that happened when she were pregnant, she would terminate it. The child was born and suffered an excruciating 14 hours of existence before finally passing away. Abortion is a tough subject, but I don't think it's right to allow a child (or any parents/potential parents) to suffer against their will."

For an example south Korea is now tracking they're citizens to figure out how many people you spread it to. Once you give the government that much power there's no getting it back. So when he makes statement like free the country in an sense I agree with him.",
            "Wow, you must be a real asshat if you can do a complete 180 on your opinion in a matter of hours. Musk is not a good person but so many people fall for his Twitter account because it's an individual instead of a brand, but make no mistake he is using his platforms to make it so people will ignore all the horrible shit he's been doing. For some reason everyone's so brain washed by this douche that they never call him out on his actions.",
            "He, along with people like Richard Dawkins and Neil DeGrasse Tyson are in that weird group of people who are blessed with some great intelligence and excellent knowledge in their fields; but are some of the dumbest smart guys in the public sphere. They are so consistently off the mark in so many things it\u2019s weird.",
            "Environmental efforts aside, I think the unethical treatment of his workers (pre and during the pandemic) is worse than the covid tweets.",
            "I think it is completely defensible to favor lifting the lockdown. Let me start by saying I\u2019m a physician and I\u2019m working in the ICU caring entirely for covid patients right now, and I fully understand the value of quarantine and the strategy of flattening the curve. Nonetheless, even though I think there is merit to that strategy, it still objectively is a violation of civil rights to order everyone to stay home and prevent citizens from freely going about their business.\n\nBeyond that, it isn\u2019t costless. It\u2019s not clear how many lives we are saving by quarantining. Everyone is still going to get this virus, just more slowly. The lives we will save are limited to those who would die *only* because hospitals are overwhelmed. Many people are dying despite having full resources of ICUs, and these people will die under any strategy. The lockdown hopefully saves those who would survive a ventilator but wouldn\u2019t have one in a state of true scarcity. It is not clear how many people that would be. That has to be measured against how many people are going to die or have their lives ruined by 25% unemployment, homelessness, poverty, and suicides that will all spike as a result of these lockdowns. I don\u2019t know how to do that math, I\u2019m just focusing on saving who I can, but I don\u2019t pretend to clearly know what society as a whole should do. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an obvious answer. I have no respect for those who say the virus is a hoax or is caused by 5G or whatever, but I do respect those who merely think the costs of the lockdown outweigh its benefits. \n\nI don\u2019t think Musk only cares about money, or at least I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair conclusion. He has plenty of money and he is the person who is easily able to weather a lockdown. It\u2019s the poor and the vulnerable who are most affected by the lockdowns, and you could just as easily conclude that it is those people Musk is advocating for. \n\nI have my own problems with him, chiefly the huge subsidies he receives for Tesla, but his opinion about the pandemic doesn\u2019t bother me. The truth is nobody knows what to do. I\u2019m hip deep in this pandemic every day of my life, and I\u2019m as lost as anyone. It bothers me that the less fact and less evidence there is, the stronger everyone\u2019s opinions seem to be, both with regard to public policy and with regard to the best medical approach to treating this disease.\n\nI\u2019m just gonna keep doing my best. I can\u2019t wait for this to be over, I want to be able to sleep again. This is so exhausting.",
            "This lockdown isn\u2019t some magical cure to prevent deaths.  It also has its own casualties.  Suicide rates go up, cancer screenings aren\u2019t happening which leads to more death, the UN is reporting that hundreds of thousands more children will starve this year due to the shutdown, domestic abuse rates will increase, substance abuse and relapses will happen, overdoses go up, and poverty-linked diseases increase.  \n\nWe should not be afraid to look at the impact calculus of this lockdown and see if the trade-off is worth it from a numbers standpoint.",
            "I would argue that Musk understands basic economics. Deaths due to the virus are horrible, but deaths and a spiraling poverty rate due to a collapsing global economy are just as bad if not worse.",
            "A) upvote this people it\u2019s unpopular so it makes sense to make this a main discussion on the sub \n\nB) OP you make some halfway valid points. I think some better critiques are the South African upbringing and his stance on South Africa because of it, the way he and his wife have separated but he still sees his kids often (I think they separated on good terms). I think he is a lot better than most billionaires, he clearly cares about good causes, and most importantly he knows how to put on a good public image (smoke weed on the Joe Rogan show). But he is still a billionaire, incredibly type A, and will sacrifice things to achieve his goals. But if you have ever watched a doc on him (I did) his story in terms of Paypal shows how he invests everything he has into making himself succeed. He is the prototypical global model of successful risk investment, and that deserves nothing but praise and close examination. \n\nTl;dr upvote post, Elon Musk has issues but is too chill and cool for me to dislike him",

I see an argument for why states/private businesses should make the decision, but it wouldn\u2019t be one I\u2019d agree with and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the one Elon is making",
            "Disagree.  \nThere does need to be a balancing act between saving the economy and saving lives. It is easier and more emotionally satisfying to prioritize saving lives above all else, but if the economy collapses, medical infrastructure collapses with it, and even more lives will be lost.  \nWe need a balance, so I don't believe Elon Musk is a bad person for championing the economy. We need champions for both sides, so we can find the balance.",

            "Hes still good in my book, businesses have to open or america will become third world, cashflow at lower levels is essential and it's up to people to stop themselves from getting the virus, ie mask the fuck up, wear gloves and wash down your damn groceries. \n\nBuy some everclear and a spray bottle and protect yourself! You tell a cafe owner right now to stay closed another week, or a restraunteer, or any small business. Rent is still due and people have to be responsible for themselves.\n Elons not a doctor or a political adviser or even a businessmen, hes an engineer. But an engineer that realised we've got to keep the wheels turning economically and take personal measures to protect ourselves instead of using the government to provide blanket security.\n\nI know I'm gonna get downvoted straight onto satan's dick for this but the man makes fucking rockets dude. Whatever else he says comes 2nd imo especially something that makes a bit of sense.\n\nI bet you he walks around with an n95 and gloves like everyone should be. \nThis lockdown slows community spreading no doubt but also hands the market to big Corp the longer it stays on. \n\nAight boys... thrash me.",
            "The problem is that you're brainwashed by the media and don't even consider other opinions.  \n\nAs soon as someone tries to share their taughts about the virus and it doesn't reflects what the media says, you  immediately label him as a \"murderer\". \n\nFACTS:\n- Elon Musk probably has a higher IQ and smarter than you.\n\n- As of today according to Google 247k people died \"because of\" the coronavirus.  \nAccording to worldometers.info around 20 million people died this year. Because virus or not, people die. Let that sink in.\n\n- The reason I put \"because of\" in quotes is because the statistics reflected by the media are inaccurate.  \nIf I'm hit by a bus tomorrow and coronavirus is found in my blood, the cause of death will be the virus. So the number where the REAL cause of death was the virus should be much lower.  \nWhat about really ill people who died \"because of\" the virus? How much longer would those people lived? Days? Weeks? \n\n- Even the WHO compared coronavirus to influenza. [link](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-similarities-and-differences-covid-19-and-influenza)\n\n- How many people will actually die BECAUSE of the economic crisis that is caused by this nonsense?  \nThose will be the real victims and not of the virus but stupidity! Those numbers will not appear in statistics or shown by the media. But I assure you that it will be higher than those currently shown.\n\nSo how about considering \"what if he's actually right and still on a good purpose?\"",

Even many of the symptoms are the same. Like the flu, it mainly kills the old and weak with the average age of death being 80.1 in Italy and 99.2% of investigated death cases in NYC having at least one major health issue. Unlike the flu however, it virtually cannot kill young people. The mortality for those under 18 is 0.00%, or 1 in 900,000. For 18-45 it\u2019s 0.01% or 11 in 100,000 from NYC data.

His businesses are almost all technical, so it's not like the biggest deal in the world, but if they ever get big enough to seriously re-define our lives, we will have a huge class/social divide (like we already have and are already having).It's not really all him that does all of the engineering either. A lto of people leave tesla and work for competitors to make the same technology.But he's definitely not henry ford by any stretch of the imagination. He probably knows every technical detail of everything that his businesses are working on. He's just not always the sole person doing the innovating, and everyone thinks he is. But he frequently brings his lead engineers on stage with him.But the thing is, his selfish motivations are ultimately doing some pretty good things in the world. He's disrupting a lot of industries and motivating a lot of other people to do some things that would have probably taken a much longer time to happen.- Space Travel- Electric/Automated Cars\n\nSuddenly, the auto industry is racing towards making electric cars.When/if we can all get anywhere, at any time, from any place, we will all be in a much better position. That will happen with auto navigation and electric cars. No more rural/suburban bus problems , no more worrying about how you're going to afford your car note, no more massive environmental destruction.Suddenly, everyone is trying to get to mars now.Do we need to get to mars? Probably not, but our planet will die someday, and being able to go out into space with ease will eventually give us things like global satellite internet, etc.He also open sourced his electric engine, which was probably one of the coolest moves I've ever seen by any business, and one that is SO FAR away from the normal EXTREMELY shady culture of proprietary, royalty grabbing fuckery that has actually HINDERED progress. No idea how refreshing that is.\n\nAnyways, no, he's definitely not the best person in the world, but I definitely have a strong respect , and find a lot of inspiration with a lot of the things that he is doing.If it continues this way though, we will definitely have an even bigger class divide.We need the technology his businesses are working on, not his businesses themselves, to thrive. The latter just happens to drive the former right now.Get down to the nitty gritty of his businesses and you find a lot of screwy stuff.Whether Tesla thrives or fails, the fire that he lit under everyones ass will definitely bring us a little closer to that ideal future.\n\nI do think it's weird that people see him as some kind of cult-like figure though.He does say and do really crazy shit sometimes, but who cares? at least he's honest about it. I give little to zero fucks about how someone is presenting themselves \"socially\" and honestly its' pretty refreshing to see them be honest about it sometimes.He really should be trying to use his HEPA resources to manufacture masks right now though, and as a science person, he shoudl realize that the rising deaths are no joke and we really need to be considering some long term solutions here that minimize deaths.  \nOne of htem being a basic income.",

In that show their lives are about whatever big mystery is going on, their relationships, and their friends. The characters in the show are high-school age (16 I believe) but a majority of the cast are actors in their mid-twenties (one actor is almost 29). \n\nIn the show, or as much as I\u2019ve seen, being an actual high school student occupies very little of the character\u2019s lives and the aspects of high school we do see the characters participate it could more or less be translated into a college setting. So why even make them high school students? I know to reach a youth audience and whatever but seeing how a lot of this shows content displays varied sexual relationships between characters, I feel like it\u2019s a bit weird seeing all these high school age relationships so graphically being acted by much older people. \n\nAnd I\u2019m realizing now that Riverdale isn\u2019t the *best* example (a plot point of season 1 is an inappropriate teacher student relationship) but there are a lot of shows like this out. I think Hollywood should stop fetishizing high school sexual relationships when they really don\u2019t have to. My issue with it isn\u2019t so much the displays of sex, more that the show creators are leaning so heavily into all the displays of sex of people who are **supposed** to be minors. Gives a weird voyeurism vibe. If the plot allows, just make the setting college, it would even make more sense with the plots sometimes.\n\nTLDR: I have no issue with sex being a plot point in teen-oriented television but the mentality of \u201cWe have 27 year olds playing 16 year olds so let\u2019s shoot this soft core porn scene because we can \ud83d\ude0e\u201d is very problematic and approaching borderline pedophilic\n\nEDIT: Restructured as paragraphs for clarity\n\nEDIT 2: I understand not all viewers relate to college, this was merely a possible suggestion to a pretty pervasive issue in television",

Even something as simple as a 'normal' sexual relationship becomes a much more political and psychologically dynamic situation in adulthood.   \n\n\nSo really it's about just how abstract and hard to pin down adulthood is compared to teenage mania. Excess emotions, empty sex and drama are much easier for writers to regurgitate ad nauseum at us.   \n\n\nMost television lacks depth, so it makes sense that easy and predictable choices are inevitably made in the writing process.    \n\n\nAlso take the fact that some of the best and highest art we have only just scrapes the surface of what adult life is like you see why it is so easy to just stick to less mature subjects.",

            "I can kind of understand why Riverdale is set in a high school setting; if it were a college setting then the characters could simply switch schools on their own with all the bullshit going down, but being teenagers and being rather young gives the show more time to keep them in Riverdale because teenagers can't easily just pickup and leave town on their own. Hwoever, I do think that writers of shows like this should be mindful of what they portray and I don't think Riverdale does a good job of that (ie portraying a relationship between a 15-year old boy and a teacher as some \"forbidden love\" thing, showing a 15-16 year old girl doing what's essentially a striptease, the ABUNDANCE of soft sex scenes, etc.).",

            "What do you expect, though?\n\nMany of the concepts you're talking about have only been widely available for study within the past hundred years, and only instantly accessible since the dawn of the internet. We're only three generations from most people in America working as farm hands or miners. \n\nToday's kids *are* (in many ways) more intelligent than the previous generation, because that's how generational progress works. I understand technology because I was taught from a young age by my dad who had to figure everything out by himself on a TRS-80. However, he's pretty clueless when it comes to modern tech, because you can't expect the old generation to stay lock-step with the young. In the same way, my son will know things that will never even be on my own radar, no matter how hard I try to keep up with the times.\n\nAs I get older and time seems to move relatively faster, my mind is blown at how quickly human intelligence has accelerated via increased communication. Some people are privileged to be born into families that were ahead of the curve, but for many of us, we still have a lot of catching up to do. You speak of people tuning out around age 40. I think that's the age where most people become weary of the grind and decide to just enjoy the life they have in front of them.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, though, is that book smart is not the only type of intelligence. I think of my grandfather, raised in farm country, who never continued school past eighth grade and worked his entire life as a general contractor. He wasn't the brightest crayon in the box, by far, but he was extremely skilled in his field after decades of experience, and that was all he needed to put food on the table and be happy.

You are right: the vast majority of people do not share it, indeed many adults are just as they were as children, at least in the west: they look down on \u2018eggheads\u2019. Remember however that your view of either world is not -objectively- superior. If someone finds a reality TV show, or fashion, or football more worthy of their emotional or intellectual investment there is nothing inherently negative about that even if you think that your interest in existential philosophy, or the history of art, or particle physics is a more \u2018worthy\u2019 pursuit. You have to live in this world alongside everyone else: do business with them, be neighbours with them, interact with them as parents of your children\u2019s friends etc etc. A surprising number of them will be more successful in life because they can relate to this majority better than you.\n\nI suspect I was very much like you as a child, but unlike you I already knew and conversed with like-minded people even at the time. I knew of course that there were adults like that too, because most science and literature is written by adults. However I also knew it must not be the norm: my parents weren\u2019t interested in philosophy, and most adults do not contribute to science and literature! So when it came to leave school, it was obvious to me to choose to pursue academic and career options that continued to put myself in daily contact with exceptional people - capable of extraordinary complex thought, true experts in their field, with unique knowledge and vision.\n\nOnly you can choose the path you take: if you go to work in a shop, you will be surrounded with shop assistants and customers. If you go to work for the most prestigious scientific organisations or high-technology companies then believe me you will find those other \u2018abnormal\u2019 people who get just as much out of working with other \u2018abnormal\u2019 people as you.

Not knowing how to swim puts you at a HUGE disadvantage, as you pretty much can't avoid water. Any mildly interesting / fun activity might turn into a potentially lethal one, should you not know how to swim. Going fishing? Better not fall into the water... It's like permadeath for video games: instead of ending up wet, and maybe slightly (or very) cold, you just friggin' die if you fall into deep water. I know, swimmers can drown too, but if you can't swim, you're guaranteed to have to be rescued.\n\nOn another note, it's so weird to see healthy people being incapable of performing the most basic human activities: I've seen grown men injure themselves trying to climb over a 3 feet fence (not drunk), women twisting their ankles and tearing tendons when running towards a bus stop, etc. Now, I'm not saying that everybody needs to be a world-class climber like Adam Ondra or swimmer, like Michael Phelps. But learning how to... I don't know, not die when navigating anything but flat terrain seems like it should be part of being a grown human.\n\nEdit: Jesus Christ this blew up... Most of the negative responses are about not having access to swimming facilities (either due to lack of money / lack of said facilities or both). I'm obviously not suggesting someone shouldn't eat for 3 months to pay for swimming lessons or move to an area just to learn. \n\nBut \"I'm scared of water / I've had a bad experience\" are not valid excuses, all the more, they're reasons to push your boundaries and defeat said fear. It's like saying \"I've had my heart broken in high school, I will NEVER date again\". Sure, you can avoid both water and dating, but is it worth it? If you end up falling in water / love unexpectedly, you'll just panic more because of the unfamiliarity of the situation.",

It takes roughly 20 hours to learn to swim, that's $300. And that's also assuming you get some practice in outside of lessons. Say you have the $300 to spend on a recreational activity... are there facilities in your area? No, because where I grew up (I barely know how to swim and the only reason I have experience with water is because I was lucky enough to have what is called the desegregation program when I was growing up. I lived in the city and was bused to a really nice school in the suburbs. Program no longer exists) didn't have facilities within a 10 mile radius. So how do you get your children there? Not everyone has a car or can spend x amount of time on public transportation. \n\n\nNow that we have basic numbers on the table... $300 may not seem like a lot but for struggling families that is a shit ton. That's food, utilities, and rent. Why if I barely have enough to put food on the table would I risk it for a recreational activity- I know what you're thinking, \"it's not recreational, it could save your life\". I'll offer another unpopular oponion: bullshit. If you live in the middle of the country and never go near water why would you care, why invest the time and money? The fact is you don't have to go near water (don't light me on fire here, if you think about it it is in fact true) if you choose not to. It's not like walking, walking is an absolute necessity.

But saying x is BETTER or WORSE than y is the actual fundamental issue. Things are different. Let\u2019s talk about it and think about it rather than putting one another down.",
            "yes that would be true human equality. \n\nhowever, true human equality would only happen if people were actually equal, or, not different. on the contrary, there are very many differences between men, women, transgender people, non-binary people, etc. - biological differences, yes, but also between every individual human being there are bodily, social, emotional, and mental differences as well. Two different men which identify as men are still not \"equal\" because they innately have differences, advantages, disadvantages over others. \n\nthat's why gender equality as a social movement isn't about sameness and ignoring difference in sex or gender, it's about EQUITY which is about fairness in the face of difference\n\nthat's why, instead of homogenizing all human beings as the same, we should be appreciating differences between genders, between people in general. gender inequality comes from the hierarchy of social power and status based on the idea that masculinity, traditionally 'masculine' qualities, and biologically identified males are above femininity, traditionally 'feminine' qualities, and biologically identified females as well as other genders. In order to destroy the hierarchy we can't be blind to the differences between the groups at the different levels of the hierarchy, we have to raise people to the same level by acknowledging what makes them different, why they are oppressed by social hierarchies, and how to eliminate the subconscious, conscious, systematic, and discriminatory ideas, traditions, and structures that perpetuate their oppression",

            "Of course and hopefully we'll get there eventually, but we're not going to get there without fighting. Acting like we're already in a great situation where gender is no big deal only upholds the status quo. \n\n We have to make it an extremely big deal for a while in order to successfully root sexism and/or transphobia (whichever one you're talking about) out of our cultures and get to a point where people's genders are inconsequential enough to stop being worth worrying about.\n\n\nCelebrating marginalized identities can be a really important part of the process because people who are treated as less than others in society at large often need more support and/or specific communities of like minded people to compensate for that.\n\nPride and LGBTQ activism in general is an excellent example of community organization and celebration being an important step in the process of normalizing marginalized identities to the point where mainstream society very slowly starts learning to treat members of that marginalized community more like everyone else.",
            "I mean, yeah of course this is true.\n\nBut, the reason that the LGBTQ+ community celebrates pride is the exact same reason people celebrate the US's independence from the British empire... It's because the community members have been the victims of oppression for so long simply because of who they were that they have cause to celebrate being able to be who they are, publicly, without (the vast majority at least) people persecuting them for just being who they are.\n\nSo yeah, you're 100% right, I'd love to live in a world where celebrating gender or sexual identity isn't something we need to do because everyone realizes it's totally valid to be gay or a trans woman or whatever other identity you happen to be.  But being that bigoted and ignorant viewpoints are still incredibly pervasive, even if not the majority, it's still apropos to celebrate being able to be out and proud about one's identity.",

That will make it likelier that you will share experiences that stem from having that attributes with those that share that attribute.\n\nThat being said, it definitely be good if people stopped identifying with one another merely based on gender. However, it's cuckoo land to assume it will simply cease to matter as well, simply by appealing to some abstract concept.",

Both could repair stuff like their own bikes/ furniture/ electronics. The guys were able to cook and bake (sweedish princess cakes are yummy!) \n\nAt least, this is what I personally observed. \nNone of them celebrated a girl for doing something \u201ctraditionally seen as male\u201d or the other way around. \n\nSometimes other people would comment on it, like \u201c hey Finnish girl, it\u2019s so awesome you know how to repair that chair!\u201d Or \u201cwow, Swedish guy, you know how to cook! Your Gf is so lucky\u201d etc. And they would just shrug it off and say it\u2019s normal where they are from. That it\u2019s actually kind of frowned upon when a girl gets all whiney when she cannot carry her bag and expects the guy to carry it for her or when a guy expects his gf to clean and cook for him because as a guy he never had to learn it at home. \n\nLike I said, it\u2019s only from what I witnessed from Scandinavian students and friends.

I go through the hoops of helping when the final task comes around, and thats moving two Hydrangea trees across the parking lot.\n\nA little background: Hydrangea trees are extremely light, even these 8ft tall ones. You can pick them up with one hand, almost all of the weight is in the soil. Since the soil is unwatered it makes it even easier. The younger female coworker (my age) and I both grab a tree. The one I grab is slightly smaller, which I hadn't even noticed at first glance. The older woman insisted I switch because \"I'm a man\" and thus should take the bigger tree. I sort of laughed since that was incredibly sexist to say, both towards men and women, and continued on with the smaller one. She stopped me and insisted I take the bigger one, and I complied since she had seniority. They both weigh about the same, btw, hydrangea trees are basically twigs. Afterwards I talk to the younger coworker and ask her what that was about and she told me:\n\n\"Idk /u/glorious_jo, if my boyfriend was here he wouldn't have let me take the bigger one.\"\n\nI lost a lot of respect for her that day, because I had seen her as my equal (she was specifically the coworker I could trust to help me with two person tasks), and here she was insisting that I should treat her NOT with the respect I give all my coworkers regardless of gender, but as if she were too weak to do her job. As though her gender excluded her from pulling an equal share to my own and that I should have to pick up the slack. \n\nI ignore it and go about my business. The next day another coworker confronted me about it. He called me sexist over what happened, because the senior lady claimed I was laughing _at_ her and that I should respect women. He threatened to go to the store owner over it after insisting that my boss, the grower, was not my boss, but rather the owner was my boss, even though both the grower and the owner were my boss this is how HIERARCHIES WORK.

Maybe 20% focuses on the actual dancing and competition, and even that's bogged down by unnecessary commentary. It's one of Lifetime's highest rated shows. The show had a spinoff a few years back featuring a rival team from Miami called \"Step it Up\".

            "AGT, Idol and similar shows aren't really talent competitions.  They're a reboot of old programs like \"Queen for a Day,\" which was literally a competition to see who had the worst life.\n\nIf the goal were merely to identify talent, they wouldn't bother with a television show.  They'd hold open auditions, whittle it down to some likely candidates, sign some developmental deals and see what sticks.\n\nThe pathos is the purpose of the show.  They want the audience to become emotionally invested in the contestant who had cancer, a broken marriage, got hit by a car, miscarried twice, and is a lifelong Detroit Tigers fan.  Susan Doyle was exactly what they were looking for... they'd have paid for her singing lessons on the DL just to keep her on the program.\n\nIt's pretty much the same for any sort of \"artistic\" competition show, just adjusted to fit the format and length of the competition.  If you take a short-run competitive reality show like \"Worst Cooks in America,\" (approx. 8 ep.) they'll have a short segment that runs down the challenging things in each contestant's life.  If you have a longer-running competition, like \"Survivor\" or \"American Idol,\" (around 20ish episodes per season), they'll keep revisiting the contestants' shitty lives hoping to get the audience discussing who has it worse and developing partisan feelings for one or the other.  Even single episode elimination-based competitions like \"Chopped\" try to squeeze in a personal segment so the audience can determine a \"deserving\" winner.\n\nCreating that sort of emotional investment locks in viewers and locked in viewers are worth far more to advertisers than viewers who may stop watching when their favorite is eliminated.\n\nI think if you really pay attention, you'll see a pattern in the editing of the program as well.  One contestant will get the \"villain\" edit - this started with Puck on the show that gave birth to reality TV \"The Real World,\" and is especially common with programs like \"Big Brother\" and \"Survivor\" that involve the contestants living together.  Another contestant or two will get the \"poor, poor, pitiful me\" edit, and still another couple will get the \"genuinely nice person who just wants the best for everyone edit,\" (one of them usually ends up with second place, where the \"villain\" is finally taken out right before the finale - usually after a couple of near-eliminations.)\n\nI don't mention all of this to say it's \"bad\" or \"dishonest.\"  Television is about entertainment, and clearly people find all of this entertaining so it is succeeding in its purpose.",

There are 4-5 rounds of auditions before the actual audition that you see on TV.\n\n\nI had made it past the very first round and was thrilled. For the second round, there were about fifteen singers in a room with a producer. Before entering the room, we were instructed NOT TO TELL ANY STORIES, but to slate (name, age, where you\u2019re from and what song you\u2019re singing), then sing your song. I had watched several groups go into the room for their second round, and only a handful came out with a yellow paper signifying they made it to the third round.\n\n\nWhen it was my groups turn, I sang my song and was actually confident I did well based on the reactions from the judges/producers and other singers in the room. Immediately after me, a blind man stood up to do his audition. He began to explain how he was previously a painter before he lost his vision, he was never a singer, and how he feels his artistic abilities moved from his hands to his voice. It was a touching story\u2013but we were specifically told not to say anything but our info and our song. Nobody stopped him. He sang Whitney Houston and it was good, albeit pitchy and very shaky.\n\n\nOf course he walked out of there with a yellow slip. I was kinda pissed. I really don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve advanced had he not told his story.",

The astounding level of talent, creativity, passion and commitment never ceases to effect me. Could it be a more genuine contest? Sure, but I dont know if that really exists anywhere. Do I fully know what I'm getting into? Sure, but when I choke up to a troupe of acrobatic dancers from the slums of Mumbai, it's real enough for me.",
            "Cameras shouldn\u2019t be allowed either.",
            "I watch a lot of foodnetwork and every episode of Chopped seems to have a sob story contest. \n\nWould rather it be like the british baking where the judges have a blind taste testing to decide winners",
            "100% agree. Although, I will say, Kodi Lee, who has one of those emotional, sad backstories really did have the talent to back it up. All his disabilities put aside, he is a musical prodigy and deserved to win on his talent. The whole backstory just made him a feel good/tear jerker win.",
            "They aren't contests tho. It's not supposed to be fair and balanced, it's supposed to be as entertaining as possible and generate the most views for advertisers.",

            "The whole point of AGT is for the story to touch the viewers' hearts. The whole show is scripted, from the time the front audience stands up and claps, to the way the performer tells their sob story. Even if the performer is over their not very serious sob story, the producers will alter the story and make them show false emotion to the judge. The judges know about this and their decisions aren't even real.",

The kids never get out at the start, even if they are complete garbage. In my opinion, kids shouldn\u2019t even be on AGT because I have seen so many adults who have given everything they have into the competition and lose it to some kid in second grade who can play the piano. Yes, these kids are talented, but the adults they rob spots from adults simply because they are children.",

It doesn\u2019t matter who is actually talented whether a band puts together a song that they\u2019ve worked on for years or a girl with a sad song that sounds generic and is apparently inspired by her sad backstory.

If their first instinct, as soon as they get out from under your thumb, is to completely ignore you forever, you need to own the fact that you messed up as a parent at several, consistent, points along the road throughout your child's upbringing. They hate you for a good reason, and they're probably better off without you in their lives.\n\nThere are a number of forms of abuse that range from over-parenting, to neglect, over-discipline to straight up negative enabling behavior.\n\nI have friends who don't talk to their parents because the strictness was so suffocating, and friends who don't talk to their parents because they were lazy bums who never took an interest in their child's life. There are tons of other reasons kids abandon relationships with their folks, but the one thing that stays true through all of these experiences for me is that it's always the parents fault.\n\nThis is mostly about relationships that end as soon as the kid leaves the house, not necessarily relationships that break down during adulthood, although the same reasoning could be applied in a lot of these cases too.\n\nEDIT:  \nTo the people in the comments defending parents and blaming the kids: If you're a kid defending your parents then congratulations on having parents who treated you fairly and cared for you I'm sincerely happy for you (everyone didn't get the same life you did), if you're a parent defending yourself then just own up to the fact that you messed up and move on with your life, try to be happy and leave your kids alone because they've cut you out for very good reasons and they're better off without you.",

            "I haven't talked to my parents since 1999. That's to preserve my own sanity and peace of mind. In truth it was the smartest thing I've ever done and I have no regrets disavowing two malignant narcissists. I have a list of grievances with them as long as my leg. So long in fact it's a wonder CPS didn't take me away from them when I was a child.",
            "There is this thing called the Social Exchange Theory that states that if a relationship's costs outweigh the benefits then it will likely break off as it is not interdependent nor healthy. \nWhen parents fail to realize that they are costing their kid more than they are providing for them (this includes time, emotional, health, and material costs/benefits) then their kid isn't going to want to be in that relationship. And In parent-child relationships it is even more crucial that the kid's needs are being met and that they are being presented more benefits than costs. \n\nTake it from me, as someone who has been royally fucked up by my parents and whose relationship with them has slowly deteriorated- there are MANY ways that a child can be neglected.",

And never even brings me up. Even when I got married she didn't reach out. \n\nPeople heat that I don't talk to my mom and immeadiatly assume its because I did something bad and we got in fight. In reality I just hated fighting to grt her to answer phone calls, acknowledge anything that happened in my life without making it about her, etc.",

            "I made a post on reddit a while back talking about how upset I was that my dad made a Facebook post saying losing a cat is harder than losing a child. \n\nI was blown away by the comments saying it was my fault for not having a strong enough connection to him for him to feel closer to me. I should put effort to mean more than a cat. \n\nWhy is it my responsibility to put all my feelings aside and be there for my father when he constantly put his band before me growing up? I have 2 kids and have lost several animals. Losing an animal - sucks a lot. If I lost a kid- I\u2019d probably lose all ability to function. \n\nI have always tried to maintain a civil relationship with him. I let him see the kids on the rare occasion he asks. We see eachother holidays. I\u2019ve never argued with him. I never rebelled or did anything crazy. I\u2019m still worth less to him than a cat.",

            "I love my mom, but...\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of memories that fucked me up. Her holding me around age 4-6 when I was crying due to the confusion and sadness of my grandfathers death and her switching from consoling me to tossing me off of her in a rage because she couldn\u2019t deal with my crying. I couldn\u2019t cry in front of people for most of my life, even when my father died when I was 19.\n\nI got in trouble in 3rd grade for telling another kid I would kill them, over something silly, because my mom was always saying things like \u201cI could just kill you\u201d to me and my brother when she was upset. She would come home every single day stomping and slamming cabinets and yelling at us for being kids, and was just generally anxiety producing to be around. I still jump when my now roommate slams a door out of a fit of rage.\n\nI remember asking her how her day was one time when she picked me up from the bus and she immediately responds with \u201cwhy, what do you want?\u201d\n\nHer dragging me around a few nights before prom to find a dress, getting upset with me for being overweight and self conscious in any dress, and eventually telling me on the ride home that all my \u201chopes and dreams will never come true\u201d.\n\nLuckily, around my teens my mom started taking medication for depression and it seemed to lighthen her up a bit.\n\nI also think parents of the 80s really didn\u2019t know the effects their lazy or shitty parenting would have on kids so young. Look at spanking for example. We now know the effects of that where I vividly remember my mom using spanking as a form of obedience training. Yeah right, by age 11 I was willing to throw a fist back in response.\n\nI\u2019ve never considered myself close to my mother and I really don\u2019t keep in touch past what is necessary, and honestly... I mostly do it for her benefit. A lot of kids had it worse. As I got older, I literally worked her job for one summer and saw the change in my own personality. Stress, depression, anxiety, all of the pitfalls that come with being a human and especially an adult *really* affects our vibes. And sadly children are hypersensitive to vibes, so we fuck them up *so* easily. In my case, it\u2019s not her fault.\n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking to me these days, the thought of my mom dying someday and the rift we\u2019ve always had between us, which kept us from bonding or ever getting really close. Her undiagnosed or ignored mental health issues really affected our relationship. That will leave a huge amount of grief that I don\u2019t even want to think about having to deal with.",
            "I cut my dad off in December of last year. He is mentally ill and caused me a lot of problems throughout my childhood to now. Making the decision to block a parent on everything and remove them from your life is hard. It\u2019s easy to fall into the routine of making excuses and letting them damage your mental (or physical) health. I definitely believe there are a lot of exceptions to this post though. I know parents whose children cut them off because they were fed a false narrative by a family member. I\u2019m a parent and I can only hope my child and I continue to have the close relationship that we do as she grows into adulthood.",

            "This. I am 28F and still struggle when I think about my childhood, which is almost daily. I don't hate my parents,  particularly my father, but I cant be around him because it brings out negative emotions that last for days or weeks. It sucks because he has apologized but I literally can't get over the abuse after all those years. That and leaving when I was 18, having no support and being on my own was extremely difficult, and I saw some pretty dark times. Just because you're suddenly \"sorry\" doesn't change the past or the effects it had on me. My mother never did much damage, but she allowed it and never stood up for me. You don't owe your parents shit. They created you and its their legal obligation to take care of you. Ive always envied my friends who came from loving homes.",

            "You are so right. And I like how you pointed out that it wasn't just the parent making a \"mistake\" that leads to their child disowning them, it was a lot of shit that led up to that. People just don't cut you off because you got them a yellow cake instead of a chocolate cake for their 7th birthday. It is always a lot of stuff that leads up to that...a lot of screeching, fault finding, always being right, gaslighting and even physical  violence.",
            "I still talk to my mom, but I'll always remember when she destroyed our PS2 in a fit of rage  (my brother got mud on the carpet), refused to buy us another one, plus made us pay for the rented video game inside the console.  I'll never forget when she bragged about destroying the PS2 in front of her friends, then told us, \"It's too goddamn bad!\" when I asked her to buy us another one.  \n\nI'll never forget when she showed up at 8:30 PM to pick us up from school in the 4th grade, laughing the whole time, refusing to apologize for the fact that she made us wait 5 hours after school let out without even a single call. \n\nI'll never forget when she refused to go shopping for groceries or cook, then told us to \"STARVE!\" when we said that we were hungry.  \n\nI'll never forget when she called us \"Dumb shits!\" when we couldn't figure out the homework we were being assigned.  She couldn't figure it out either, but she wouldn't admit it.  I don't ever remember he being able to help us beyond the 2nd grade with HW assignments because she didn't have the education level necessary to understand what was being assigned. \n\nIf you think we aren't going to remember the irresponsible shit you did as parents, you are VERY wrong.",

My earliest memory is my dad beating my mom. She often got help from friends and would leave for a bit but would always come back. That was my life for 20 years.",
            "We keep forgetting that parents and children are still different people.\n\nJust because someone birthed you doesn't mean you're compatible.\n\nIt's important to establish a good relationship while your child grows.\n\nNot abondan them and then pretend you can come in later on and be apart of their happiness.",
            "I often did not converse with my dad, because, i was often just scared of him in general because he was toxic, narc, and abused me physically, mentally and gave me PTSD. Infront of his friends, he used to tell others, that \"oh he is just shy, you know how kids are like\".",
            "This made me feel better. I have a foster mom who I moved in when I was 11 who I was never close to. She didn't like teenagers, wanted a kid under 7 and basically got stuck with me. During my stay there I stayed in my room, she would yell at me for inconveniencing her, she would make up lies about me so people would feel sorry for her for having to deal with me. She would go through my room and read my diary. When I was 14 I broke down and opened up to her about how I got raped over the summer and showed her the cuts on my arm. She called me stupid for cutting and never mentioned it again. She completely ignored my ptsd and all my mental health symptoms. So yeah were not close, and I always felt guilty for that, she told me cousin she resents me because I never gave her that mother daughter relationship. But she never tried.",

            "I don't talk to my dad. When I was 3 and my brother was 1 him and my mother got a divorce. My mother married an abusive drug addict. When I was 10 my grandmother (dad's mom) introduced me and my brother to our father. Between the divorce and that time he never tried to be a part of our lives. When I was 14 my mother decided to try and get off drugs and get away from our step dad. She told us one day out of the blue that we were being sent to live with our real dad in another state. My dad wouldn't let us leave the apartment we lived in and wasn't mentally present. A year later my brother went back with my mother. I stayed because I was angry at my mom and I figured I had a better chance in life in the city I lived in rather than going back to the small rural town mom lived in. My brother didn't do good with Mom. She married two more times, I never met the guys but my brother hated them. Two years after he came back to live me and dad. My brother was struggling with school and life but my dad's only response was to lose his temper. When my brother was 16 he kicked my brother out of the apartment. My brother moved into my best friends house and got his sister pregnant. My brother married her and had the kid. He tried doing the right thing but with no education and real guidance he struggled. When I turned 18 my dad took me to burger king for lunch and said rents due on the first of the month. I went on and got a job and my GED. I ended up in college and my brother ended up in divorce. He had a couple other kids with other women. I found someone and had a kid and moved across country to the east coast. The day I left, my brother got arrested. At the time he was spiraling and binging hard on meth and coke. He'll be in prison until we're old men (I miss my brother more than anything and I'm glad we do get to talk regularly but it sucks). I stayed on the east coast, my daughter is about to finish highschool. When I first moved out east I invited my dad to my wedding. He never responded. Talked to him later he said he was too busy with work. Over then next few years I would get a random text asking how far my house was from random towns in the state I lived in at the time. I always thought he wanted to come and visit and see his granddaughter but he never came, only said he couldn't get away from work. When the recession in 2008 hit he lost his job and his home. I still owned a townhouse back in that state do I offered it to him, gave him 3 months to get a job and pay rent but charged him just what I needed to cover the costs. He paid rent for about 6 months then went radio silent for about 8 months. I sent police by for wellness checks but no one ever answed the door, I tried calling his girlfriend, sent registered letters, etc.. I flew back out with eviction papers but thinking I would find him dead in the townhouse. When I got there there was no one home but the place was full of stuff, like some hoarder situation but clean. He was using my house as a storage unit. I found him at his girlfriend's house the next day sleeping on her couch. I asked him why he hasn't paid rent or returned my calls or letters. He didn't have an answer only said he lost his job. I rented a u-haul and storage unit for 3 months and moved all his crap into the storage unit. I left and he said he wanted to come visit and see his granddaughter. He never came. He never called. When my daughter was 15 we took her back out to visit the state she was born in and show her where I grew up and meet friends and family. We visited my brother in prison. We had good times with my niece and ex sister in law and all of my old friends. My daughter wanted to meet her grandfather. I told her not to expect much and don't let him disappoint her. We met up at olive garden with him and his girlfriend. The whole evening he talked about how great his life is and how wonderful his girlfriends kids are and how much he's been doing for them since their own father abandoned them. He never asked my daughter how she was doing or what she was up to in life. He didn't ask me how I was or how life is going. He didn't ask my wife who I've been with for 20 years how she was doing. He did say he was sorry he never flew out to visit. He told me he wasn't allowed to fly anymore because he had diabetes.

He said I was crazy to think he would drive across country that far and said he already bought his plane tickets. Apparently diabetes only prohibits you flying to see family not other functions. Anyway. Other than some random text two years later saying happy Thanksgiving that was the last time I talked to my dad.... Actually no... A year later my grandfather on his side died. He called me to tell me he passed... He had passed the week previous to him calling me. I'm glad I took the initiative to talk to my grandfather a couple weeks before that, he was a great guy. I asked dad when the funeral would be so I could go. He told me it happened the day before... That was the last time I talked to my dad. Yeah I don't talk to my dad.",

We are good, something triggers her, she is mad, we don't talk for x many wks, and here we go again. She has been cut out of our lives for a bit over a year.

            "My parents are neither selfish nor neglecent. Sure they've made the same mistakes as any other parent, but nothing worth terminating my relationship over. Despite being as caring, equal, and providing us more opportunities than we deserve between their four kids, my (ex?) Sister was different. For some reason she has always been embarrassed of us. Anytime she talked about us to her friends (which also happened to be my friends), she always made it out like we were animals and witches and she was a princess victim. In fact one time my gf was going to meet my mom and grandma on separate occasions and like any gf she wanted to leave a great first expression. What does she do, she asks me about what they like and don't like. Like your common bf, i give her answers that don't actually answer her questions. So what does she do, she asks my sister. Now i don't know what she told her, but after meeting both of them, she said \"wow they're not monsters like your sister made them out to be. They're nice people\"....both times. Even though she's a 23 y/o adult that stopped talking to just about anyone related to her, my parents still send her money just in case she might need it. They've tried to reach out numerous times. But she's made it clear that she doesn't want anything to do with us. As parents I think they've done the best with what they were dealt with.\n\n\nSo while, yes, in most cases the parent is to blame, I wouldn't say always. Sometimes the adult child is a selfish, inconsiderate, unrespectful, and just outright doesn't want their family to be happy.",
            "There's no such thing as perfect parenting. There's actually a school of thought called \"good enough\" parenting where parents don't tend to all of their kids needs immediately and that teaches them that they won't always get what they want and have to learn to deal.\n\nI see some kids raised by helicopter parents who, as adults, can't even make basic life decisions without asking their parents first. In some ways, this is worse than not talking to your parents at all.",

And a simplistic one too.\n\nSometimes it's kids finally being able to escape a negative environment and not wanting to go back in any way shape or form.\n\nSometimes it's just former kids becoming shitty adults and shitty people to their parents for no apparent or valid reason and through not parents' fault or shortcoming in their kids' upbringing.\n\nWhatever is happening, it's rarely a black-and-white thing, and judging others is a very dangerous game.

Then he met a possessive woman who fueled the rage, so that she could have the son for herself. The son ended up breaking all ties, and even sent back the gifts his father sent him when he had a daughter of his own. I have a good relationship with his older son and a good relationship to the father (my stepdad). The father told me that maybe he wasn't present enough while grieving the death of his wife, but doesn't know what else he might have done wrong and keeps whipping himself over it. The older son told me that he was a very good father and that the younger son really is being completely unfair for no reason other than it's easier to blame his father than to accept his mother's death.\n\nIt's not *always* the parents' fault.

It's VERY kind of you, but it just slightly misses the mark.  The situation for me is very complex.  \n\n\nThank you, so very much for standing up for folks in my situation. Believe me that's actually really really hard to come by.  However, if we're going to judge someone guilty they deserve a trial. (Real or social).  I feel like you're taking a side that is statistically more likely, based on more than a handful of situations you've come across, but honestly, there are good parents out there of children with their own problems.  \n\n\nThere still definitely exists a minority of parents out there, even if it's statistically small, who have grown children who have chosen not to speak to them, by no, or very little fault of their own.  Is it anywhere near as likely? No.  Is it easy to figure out the truth with these families?  No. Not at all.  \n\n\nI personally don't want my parents to own up to the fact that they messed up and move on with their life.  I want them to just own up to the fact that they messed up in the few situations I've told them about an even attempt to address it, rather than gaslighting and making fun of me for serious situations.  They've already moved on.  They were also very verbally abusive when I was young, we had figured quite a lot of that out in adulthood.  \n\n\nSo respectfully OP,  I really really am so thankful that you're calling out parents here, but as someone who has incredibly hurtful parents, I don't want them to leave me alone and move on.  I also don't want this kind of reaction from my friends.  I just want support.  Not to feel alone on my birthday and the holidays.  Validation from other people who aren't my therapist (which by the way you're completely knocking it out of the park on right now).  Friends to not react like \"Dude, no bond is stronger than family!\" as if I had much of a choice in the matter in a decision they would also have been forced to make, but I don't enjoy talking about at length.  I don't even care if my friends believe me. They may never truly know, but they can support the things I'm doing right.  I just don't think the best help we can be is to pick sides, so much as to support the person in front of us in figuring it out for themself.  Many of my needs here are completely different for other adult children in the same situation with their parents.  \n\n\nNonetheless, this is a progressive point of view, contrary to a point of view that society holds that needs changing, and I appreciate you voicing it, so very much.",

            "Thank you for saying this. I have a great relationship with my parents now, but it wasn't always that way. I grew up with a lot of pressure. I was targeted by bullies when I was younger, then I was targeted by the academics when I got older, and all everyone cared about was how close they were to my grades. There was so much pressure from various sources such as school, home, and extra carriculars, and I couldn't open up. My whole family discouraged it since they saw it as weakness. They couldn't accept mental health as an issue. After all, they grew up in a country where you couldn't drink the water, and here I am in Canada. I couldn't complain. I had a roof over my head, food on the table every night, an education, friends, high speed internet, no wars, no death threats, and my parents gave it all to me for free. I felt like I was at their mercy so I couldn't say they did something wrong even when they'd get angry with me for sometimes no reason at all. I felt talked down to so much and treated like a pet at times. I felt so insignificant to them and though that they would be happier without me. They wouldn't need to pay for my university education either, they could travel, and they wouldn't be so angry all the time. I thought I was a parasite. I still loved them so much because they were the only reason I was alive, and I thought all along I didn't deserve them. I felt awful for being so worthless and being unable to do anything for myself. I didn't want to tell them they were the reason I wanted to die, just in case there was the smallest chance they'd be hurt. I kept all that hidden until final year. In 17 years, they hadn't heard me cry until one night I felt like I had nothing left to go on for, and I called them in the middle of the night bawling my eyes out. They listened to everything for over an hour. I finally said the words \"I love you\" to them, I thanked them for everything, I apologized for being so selfish and not being able to pay them back for anything, and told them they were great parents and that I didn't deserve them... and they apologized. They said I was the one that should be thanked, though I still don't get it. Maybe I will if I have children. But this was after years of not talking to them. I couldn't even look at them anymore during high school, and I never visited or even called them during uni. An earlier post really helped when someone pointed out that since it was my parents' decision to give birth, even though they do so much like pay for food, education, extra carriculars, and providing a home, this is the bare minimum. It was their decision and they must accept the responsibility or they would be bad parents. Mine weren't perfect, but I love them so much, now more than ever.",

            "I believe a very fair middle ground is hiring an in home nurse, whether the parent lives with the children or in their own home. Nursing homes can be rough on the elderly depending on how good they are, and even the best nursing home can\u2019t compensate for the family never coming to visit. A very important aspect of nursing is maintaining patient independence. An in home nurse will have the ability to properly care for elderly parents with special needs and disabilities (such as knowing the best ways to communicate with Alzheimer\u2019s patients) while also keeping the family away from the emotional and physical distress of caring for a family member, as well as maintaining that elderly persons dignity (I guess you could argue that having an unbiased, non family  person doing the undignifying  tasks creates a facade of independence that makes the elderly person feel \u201cnormal\u201d and unburdening to their family)",

You don\u2019t enjoy wiping someone\u2019s butt, ever, it just becomes part of the routine. With some caregivers, you come to realize that you do a more thorough job of caring for your elder in this way because you actually care. \n\nOn the nursing homes: My aunt and every caregiver we\u2019ve had (even the younger ones) tell stories of the horrors of nursing homes. Understaffed, under-equipped, negligent, etc. No one who has seen behind the scenes at nursing homes speaks well of them, at least no one I\u2019ve met. \n\nOn your kids remembering you: It\u2019s a tough one.

For instance, when it was bathing time all the residents were just put into one room several at a time, stripped down, bathed, dried and dressed again like they were on a conveyor belt. Also, you need your diaper changed? It's going to happen with your roommates present.\n\nAlso, just because someone is a professional carer doesn't really make them special in any way. They are still human beings and this is a job for them, some will be good at it others not so much. And some will outright hate their job, and it shows. Probably my worst experience working at that nursing home was when I was on bathing duty with this one nurse. I being a  21-year-old student wasn't entirely comfortable with the situation, but wanted to be respectful with the residents and rather helped them where they needed instead of just dragging their clothes off.

            "As someone with no family members and no children... this seems like a privelage of a problem (not to diminish it or anything, the emotions surrounding aging are complicated and everyone is different). But I honestly, with every fiber of my being, wish I had family to care and advocate for my wellbeing. Having to rely on strangers to \"do their job\" in caring for me when I'm old/sick/immobile/demented... it's terrifying. I could easily be one of those people who die in my apartment alone and am only found when a neighbor smells something awful weeks later. I could be one of those heartbreaking stories of a senior being drugged and raped/beaten repeatedly in the nursing home with no family to ever defend me. \n\nThere may be guilt in the ones you love sacrificing their time and energy caring for you. But in my eyes it is *everything*. Even if you don't remember who you are anymore you'd have loved ones who do, who could help you remember good things and soothe you when you can't. You have loved ones to make sure you have doctors and nurses and the professional care you need. If you fall, they will go to the hospital for you. They can sign papers in your interest. They can help you avoid unnecessary pain, approve surgeries, so many things... you'll have someone to hold your hand in the end. You'll have people to remember you when gone.\n\nI hope you don't take this as my invalidating your feelings and concerns. You clearly feel this way out of concern and love for your family. I just ask you remember what a gift you have. And that honestly, no matter how many professionals there are.... having someone that loves you and wants to protect you in your most vulnerable and incapable state is golden.",
            "I would add that parents have a moral and social obligation to take care of their bodies, work on their diet and lifestyle to avoid obesity, type-2 diabetes, and high-cholesterol - while maintaining strength and physical fitness while not smoking or drinking to excess.  \n  \nThe point being - failing to be responsible with caring for your body while younger, means you are MUCH more likely to have significant health problems when older - presenting a burden on family and society. \n  \nWAY too many people have allowed themselves to get lazy, fat, and unhealthy through bad choices stretching over decades, developing metabolic syndrome, and basically letting their body whither away which leads to all kinds of preventable health problems when they get older.  \n  \nTaking measures to stay fit helps you enjoy better health and quality of life in old age - which is enough of a reason to do it - but also puts you in a better position to continue HELPING your kids rather than becoming a burden.  \n  \nSome sicknesses are unavoidable but, in America, MOST health problems experienced by aging Boomers is a product of an extremely irresponsible lifestyle.  \n  \nOld You inherits the body inhabited by Young You.

            "I think this might be a cultural thing as well. In most asian countries, children are expected to give back and provide for their parents once they\u2019re too old to provide for themselves, and that way of thinking probably goes all the way back to confucianism and filial piety and stuff like that. It\u2019s very thoughtful of you to continue to keep your children in mind even in old age, but for a lot of families, it\u2019s just the cultural norm to care for their elderly, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.",
            "As someone who\u2019s worked in hospice/home health, I\u2019m pretty sure most people would agree with you, but unfortunately even with insurance, most people cannot afford to have a sitter or CNA help out. The company I worked for underpays all the employees, including the nurses, in order to try and keep costs as low as possible for the families, but we lost several patients because they simply couldn\u2019t afford to keep the service. Even just part time help is expensive, let alone when a patient needs 24/7 care because they\u2019ve got dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, are wheelchair or bed bound, or any number of other issues. \n\nOn the other hand, spending thousands of dollars on schooling and licensing in order to get a job that starts at like $10 per hour to wipe asses and cook and clean and deal with patients who are often rude and very bigoted just isn\u2019t worth it to most. Definitely wasn\u2019t for me.",

            "I think when a lot of people say they want to move their parents in with them once they're old are thinking of their parents in a condition that doesn't require 'round the clock care. If the parents simply need to not live alone and have household stuff taken care of for them, living with their kids is the most ideal situation. Now if the parents need 'round the clock care like you describe, then yes they absolutely should be in a facility with professionals. There is a spectrum, and what might be most ideal for some cases is absolutely not ideal for others.",

            "I absolutely agree and this is my parent's life for the past year and a half, probably for the next 6 months tops too. My grandpa has Alzheimer's and cancer (he already survived brain cancer before but now he has prostate and bone cancer). He has a catheter. He went from being able to walk around on his own with the help of a walker when he moved in to not even being able to get up. He's been in the hospital for the past few weeks and he's coming home tomorrow, on hospice. We just got his new hospice bed in. \n\nHe was in an assisted living home for a few years before we had to take him in (for the second time, he lived with us back in 2014-2015 too). He had plenty of money to deal with this shit with a nursing home, but one of my aunts brainwashed the poor guy into trying to give her money so he thinks he doesn't have any even though he does. He lives with us now so we can keep my aunt from bringing him to the bank and taking his money.\n\nAnyways, my parents don't have me do much other than get him food and let them know if he was in the bathroom (back when he could still walk). But oh god, is it honestly so depressing that this man's son in law and daughter have to clean him, dress him, wipe his ass, drain the catheter bag. It's so uncomfortable. They literally have to do shit like clean his foreskin because he doesn't know how to anymore. I don't want that happening to me and my parents both said they don't want this either when they get old. \n\nYeah I don't really want anyone touching me but if I had to I'd much rather it be a paid professional than my kids. If my parents need that kind of care I'm not doing it, they're going to get cared for properly. Luckily money shouldn't be much of an issue for us.\n\nBut seriously this shit is traumatizing as a family member. I got to the point where I got massive anxiety when my parents had to leave the house because there's no damn way I'd be able to get myself to go into the bathroom and clean up my grandpa if he needed that. Like I can't let my grandpa sit there and be dirty but I'm not touching him either. Honestly, this is going to get me downvoted, but I really hope he passes away soon. There's no quality of life left for him and he's in so much pain. I can't even believe the hospital is discharging him. It's just a bad situation for everyone involved and it's awful.\n\nEdit (as of the night of Feb 11th): Just wanted to tell everyone who may see this and not realize the weight of it. My grandpa is in home, in bed right now. He's been home all of one day and my parents are pretty sure he isn't surviving the night. I'm not sure what they were doing to take care of him because I had school and work, so I wasn't around much. However, I woke up at 5am to him moaning in agony. It's been like that all day off and on. He'll wake up and he'll start moaning until the medicine he's getting starts to kick in or until he falls asleep. If you haven't lived with someone who is about to die, you don't understand the weight of this. You just can't. He's in constant agony and pain unless he's medicated or asleep. He can't move without being in extreme pain. He's ashen and small looking. I've been honestly so nervous to even go into his room, even though I just went over to him and said good night. \n\nAnyways, rambling point is. It's not just about the treatment, it's the mental load of it all too. I'm not the one who has to try and get him to eat, to get him to move a certian way to help him go to the bathroom. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's honestly chilling and scary having him here. Lots of people don't experience this kind of thing, watching the fall of a loved one like this. It's personal. You don't feel the same way if you visit them once a week in a nursing home than you would if they were sleeping in the room down the hall from you. This isn't just cleaning up poop and helping them get up. This is literally watch someone fade away and die. There are a lot of people who aren't strong enough to be willing to do something like this and I think my parents are superheroes for how they've sacrificed a big part of their lives for the past year and a half or so to take care of my grandpa. That being said, I'm not sure if I'd be strong enough to do the same for them. I don't think I could watch them go through this, and it really does break my heart to say that because it makes me feel like a giant asshole. Just...yeah. This is going to be a rough night.",
            "I'm not arguing against this but you should know there's vastly different nursing homes for people with different wealth. My sister worked at one for wealthy people and they were very comfortable and taken care of like you're talking about. This is not what my grandma ended up in. No one had the money to pay for a good one so she ended up in a state run facility. She wasn't bathed daily, she had a roommate who was young with a mental disability and would go on violent tirades, and they didn't care for her properly. They didn't give her water often enough so she ended up dehydrated with her organs shutting down so she was sent to a hospital to help but they were too late because they had neglected her for so long and she died in the hospital. She was only in that facility for a few months. My mom's biggest regret was sending her there even though she and her sister had been taking care of her for a few years and overworked.",

            "ill put this in perspective for you. My great grandma passed earlier last year. She knew how nursing homes were ran she always hated nursing homes. In most areas ive been to she has every reason to hate them nursing homes are a terrible place people often mistreat the elderly or just don\u2019t give a care that their taking care of real people. My great grandma got to tje point we had no choice but to bring her to a specialized nursing home because we could not give her the medical treatment she needed. She hated it there. She was away from all her friends (think about it like this your normally limited on contact with your friends and depending on where the home is separated by miles) all her family she didnt have any entertaining things to do except watch tv and she hated it she was always outgoing and social so she hated being put in a home with people who didn\u2019t wanna socialize or wouldn\u2019t give her the time of day. I felt so badly for her because I could tell hated it but I had no choice in it. She had only agreed to go in because she knew we couldn\u2019t provide the constant medical supervision she needed. She was nearing the end at 95 with heart failure. In all honesty I don\u2019t think ill get over how fast her death sped up once she entered a nursing home. She up until 2 years ago was driving and walking around without assistance all we had to do was be around her incase something did happen. Then the downward spiral happened she went into the hospital and it just kinda went fast downhill from there. She got to the point where walking on her own was difficult, going to the bathroom was difficult, doing almost anything was difficult. Then she started improving but the hospital refused to keep her instead deciding she should go into a nursing home. The improvement slowly went out the fucking window because the place they sent her to didnt give two single fucks. Which was exactly what she was afraid of. However we couldn\u2019t get her moved into a different one until it didn\u2019t matter anymore. She got to the point of no return. She died in her sleep in the middle of the night. So personally I never wanna go in a nursing home because god damn it i know my family would care 10x more than someone who only took the nursing job for money.",

My only concern is finding a place where the people working there care about the patients, just a little.

A couple years later our other neighbor needed daily injections and the companion caregivers were not authorized to do that.

So I was happy to go over a few times a day yup administer his shot and check on him and his wife (who was from suffering dementia). Soon after the man was diagnosed with lung cancer that had metastasized to his brain and his health declined rapidly. I would go over to visit and check on them frequently through the day and night since the wife saw me as a safe person and was comforted with my presence. I updated their daughters often on their parents. I had no problem helping the aides with bathing and eventually with changing depends. Though their daughters, who lived a distance from here, came frequently and would do anything to help their parents I had no issue with taking care of the depends while the girls visited. Their parents were very humble, helpful, and kind from the day we became neighbors. Allowing them to maintain some sliver of dignity in the eyes of their kids was the least I could do for them. \n\nI only hope that my kids come to visit me often when I'm older and they move out.

            "I'm the oldest child from a large family. We put my grandparents into a care facility close to use so we could visit often and help them out with things to save them money and use less facility services. But, there were somethings the staff were better able to do and it freed up my parents to have more time for us kids' needs. My grandparents were declining mentally and were just happy to see us, but understood they couldn't take care of themselves and it would have been too hard to be that kind of burden on my parents while they were raising us.\n\nMy mom wants us to do the same and when she passes she just wants a simple pine box and we remember her with a potluck party, bonfire cookout, or something of that nature.",
            "I now live for my children which also means not being a burden on them right when they are raising their own children. My goal is to be able to afford to retire and decline gracefully and comfortably without relying on my children for housing, care, or money.",
            "As a nurse, I agree with this. It's very hard work, physically and emotionally, even for us who are paid to do it. I cannot imagine the toll it takes on families. I see the results after long years of carers doing their best. I am fortunate to live in a country with universal healthcare and that a lot of this care requirement can be funded, at least partially by the government.",

Not everyone who is elderly dies peacefully and because of that I am so relieved I was able to be there for her as she passed. It was hard to watch. The days were long and yes I helped her with hygiene which wasn\u2019t fun for either of us. But when the time came she fiercely held my hand as her soul left. If I even moved to adjust she reached out for me in a panic. that\u2019s when I knew that we come into the world with others and it is best if we leave it surrounded by those who care. Within those last few weeks as she grew less able to care for her self, I can soundly say there is nothing to be humiliated about. Acts of service and love are interchangeable.",
            "I dont feel like this is unpopular.  I wouldn't want this for my children either HOWEVER I do want to take care of my mother in law when she gets elderly. My mother died when I was young and I tried to be there for her too. Not because I had the feeling that I had to but because it felt like I needed to. Everyone is different and that is okay, but for me I want to be able to say my goodbyes in time. I want to be able to do for them as they did for me when I needed them. I dont want a stranger comforting them I want to do that. If my mother in law said she didn't want that I would respect it but I don't think its a burden to care for them. It would be an honor to see them on their way to their next journey and to make sure they felt safe, loved, and supported.",

            "I'm a nurse and this is actually a huge problem with geriatric patients. Too many times you have to discharge someone without any sort of aid at home since they won't accept the fact that they actually need help.

My grandmothers sisters are supposed to help take care of her but they always find reasons to push her off onto my grandmother. We are tired. She had the mental capacity of a petulant 10 year old. We are not financially stable. My great grandmother wakes us up at all times of the night asking about possessions that we\u2019re thrown away or sold decades ago and refuses to believe we don\u2019t have them. She throws fits about things that aren\u2019t really happening. We\u2019re exhausted. My grandmothers sisters all have good money but they all refuse to put here in a retirement home because it\u2019s shameful to not be able to take care of your elders. Hispanics are judgy about things like this. I really wish we could put her in a retirement home my grandma deserves a break and to enjoy her life.",

Family call all the time and ask how their parents are doing but don't bother talking to them, let alone visiting. It's sad. Every ass I wipe, the patient feels humiliated and ashamed no matter what you say. Family is family. I would gladly do anything for my mom since she did everything for me.",
            "I'm in my  mid 30's and caring for 4 generations (including myself).  I closed my business to move closer to family because having to travel all the time ruined my prior career and then my business. Not to mention I'm disabled myself.  I've told my children  they will NOT continue this cycle  because they have my support  and will NOT take care of me!!!  They will actual have the chance to live their dreams and travel the world.  I've even told them when the time comes I'm moving myself into a home.  One child said, \"No, I'm moving you in so you can't leave.\" I think they got the message and are on the right track! (Smiling because of that!)",
            "Obviously you're not aware of how awful the US' elderly care facilities are. It's not a coincidence our nursing homes were death camps for elderly during COVID. We don't take care of our elders. They're viewed as burdens, which you obviously believe to be true yourself.\n\nAnd if you think these are \"professionals\", most of them have less schooling than a pet care provider and they get paid minimum wage.\n\nIt's not a matter of opinion here. It's just a fact that you're wrong about what these care facilities are capable of.",
            "We had to put my mom in a home because she has Alzheimer\u2019s. Absolutely no way could we continue to care for her at home. She was just totally ruining my brother and his girlfriend lives. If she were in her right mind she wouldn\u2019t want them to have to do it either. Anyways hopefully when/if I get Alzheimer\u2019s I will be able to get assisted suicide or something otherwise I\u2019m gonna off myself before it gets really bad",
            "Because some of these places abuse old people, \"professional\" isn't always better. Some of them get hit, neglected, left in dirty nappies, not washed, bones broken, otherwise roughly handled, verbally abused. Its quite scary when you find out what goes on in some of these care homes. \n\nWhat shouldn't be shamed are children who don't want to/can't manage the burden of looking after old parents UNLESS they're being actively neglected. I think we have a responsibility to organise care for old people, just not necessarily be the ones who provide it.",
            "Definitely cultural. I don\u2019t agree with so upvote you get. In America it\u2019s all about throwing your folks to the curb for them to slowly die in loneliness. I\u2019m European, we take what our parents did for us with a lot of respect and take care of them in their older age. Of course it can be a burden. What isn\u2019t in life.",

If you can\u2019t do that for your mother or father who is already on their 85\u2019s and don\u2019t have much longer, you just were not raised well and do not have the empathy a son would have for parents who gave them enough love.",
            "I never wanted kids, but I remember that a ex girlfriend asked: who is going to take care of you when U get old? I mean, thats a fucked up reason to have children. A lot of people think its evil and its to dump to take an old person to a nursing home, but I totally agree, its way better.",
            "I think that abandoning your family in a nursing home is messed up. All my family dies at home with family and I think turning your back on your family when there most vulnerable is bullshit. From what I understand there are home health aids that can help with the work load and a lot of insurance companies see them a reasonable alternative to nursing homes",
            "i take it youve neve worked in a nursing home then? when you realize and im understating this, the average person in a nursing home gets attention about \\` hour a day at MOST\n\nMost nursing homes are staffed with  people from foreign countries most of whom have zero experience working in anything at all.   My oldest sister was in charge of  going from nursing home to nursing home doing inspections and then taking them over by the state getting them  squared away and moving on.  out of at least 100 nursing homes almost NONE were ever staffed with real professionals who care.  in every single case  every single nursing home, you have cases of assault and theft, and mistreatment, and yes i said EVERY SINGLE ONE.   Pick a nursing home near you and contact your state for its record, you'll be appalled. \n\nThese people do not loving wipe away the shit from your ass, theyll  smack you for doin git, steal the money your kids left for the cable bill or hairdresser that comes in once every two weeks to help you look  like a human being and restore just a tad of dignity to you.  \n\nThese people will take you into the shower and scrub you raw while bruising you and not giving a shit that the water is freezing cold and your scared out of your mind because you have a diminished capacity now and just need a little compassion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntopically the nurses in nursing homes are the ones who could not  hack tit in a hospital setting or  in a direct patient care setting, so they work in nursing homes because the patients arent all there, so they dont have to worry about the same standard of care.\n\nIf you want horror stories ill give you dozens, but let me tell you, when the time comes, put a bullet in your brain, its a hell of a lot better than going to a nursing home, heck most prisons  are better than most nursing homes.  Your best bet is t pay for insurance now that will cover in home care later so you can stay in your home and  get visiting nurses and personal care assistants.",
            "This sounds more like a rant from a child who doesn't want to care for their parent. But whatever, I guess. Unless your parents were physically abusive or negligent towards you, the right thing to do is care for them when they are older. My father was an awful man who ditched my family when I was a toddler. My earliest memories of him are terrible ones, and I will not care for him when he's old. Contrast that with my mom, who gave up literally everything for us. The absolute least I can do is to help her as she ages, barring some kind of skilled nursing need. Seriously, who thinks it's right to throw her in a nursing home, just because its inconvenient? I'll bet I was pretty inconvenient when my mom had to change my diaper because I messed in a store as a baby. \n\nAging is a fact of life, and to throw away your loving parent or parents, if you're lucky enough to have them still, is such an abhorrent and selfish action. Do you know how many physical and sexual assaults occur in nursing homes? Do you know about all the negligence lawsuits filed every single year? Do you know the number of lonely, aging people rotting away with strangers because their children only thought of them as an inconvenience?",
            "Until you have actually had to be in the shoes of the caregiver you will never truly know. I understand the point that you\u2019re trying to make but it is sheer ignorance on your part. I would never want to have to do that to my father or mother. Nor would I want my kids to have to do that for me. But I know that it is the greatest honor to be able to take care of the one who raised me and sacrificed everything for me. When you are doing that for them you don\u2019t think of how \u201cdehumanizing\u201d or how \u201chumiliating\u201d others may think it is. God gave me the honor of treating my parents with the utmost respect and dignity. And even though that may not be a duty that I dream about, if I had to take care of them that way I would do it in a heartbeat.",
            "I wanna die the moment I stop being able to wipe my own ass. \n\nBut yea no I definitely don\u2019t agree. You sacrifice a lot for your kids when they are growing up and even afterwards the least they can do is take care of you for a few years. \nI\u2019m still 18 and I will definitely take care of my parents if they need me to.",
            "I'm hearing about old people being abused in these types of places. Nothing like grandma or grandpa being raped, beaten, or jacked for their valuables to make a normal person not want that for family members.",
            "Yeah the concept of family has definitely eroded over the years in America. Imagine letting someone else you don't really know take care of your elderly parents in order to not be inconvenienced, what a selfish thought. I guess people with very little connection to their families would allow that, but I personally love my family too much to risk their health/happiness in the hands of random strangers."

            "Just my two cents as someone not shy about real life and Reddit colliding. \n\nI run the largest game development job board on  this platform (r/gamedevclassifieds), and often make professional connections through Reddit as a result. I also follow and post to/leave comments on several subreddits that align with my personal interests, although I try my best to adhere to a very simple set of rules while on Reddit\n\n1. Post respectively at all times, even while disagreeing with users (I\u2019m only human and may slip up at times, though I am also just a no bullshit type of person)\n\n2. Avoid politics, religion, and any NSFW content posts. This account is used for professional purposes on top of the few personal posts I choose to make, as such some topics are not worth engaging in. (An example of this would be the fact I follow r/niceguys because I find the content hilarious/cringy/scary, but I never leave a comment in such subreddits)\n\nLike any other platform people are free to make their own decisions, and yes part of me agrees that in certain scenarios a user being able to hide their history would be beneficial because of the creeps the OP mentions. However, the professional side of me loves being able to look at a users history on Reddit to get an idea of who they are. Bad business deals can be easily avoided by checking a users post history, and there are cases where I\u2019ve noticed a user using the same account for professional use and very personal things (NSFW content), which to me is a red flag. If someone doesn\u2019t have that sense to separate business from pleasure it more often than not means I\u2019m wasting my time speaking with them. \n\nSo there are two sides to this coin. Privacy is great, but so too can transparency. Have subreddits and comments you want to distance your real life from as much as humanly possible? Have a separate account for those purposes. As for myself? I\u2019m happy lurking in the more divisive subreddits I like to visit for entertainment purposes so that my professional life and private interests can co-exist on this single account.",

            "And now a story about the catacombs of France.\n\nSee by the 17 hundreds, and honestly even a while before the cemeteries of France were full to busting. And I mean that in a very literal sense. The cemeteries were often 10 feet or more higher than the streets around them from all the bodies buried in them. They had to build retaining walls to keep in all the \"dirt.\"\n\nHowever a lot of these cemeteries were basically just 30 feet of dirt, coffins and corpses all piled on top of each other, with limestone underneath, and retaining walls all around, so the water would just sit there.\n\nSometimes the added weight of the water would be too much and it would cause the retaining wall to burst, and hundreds of cubic feet of mud, coffins and corpses would spill out into the streets in a horrible slurry of abject horror flooding through the streets like some kind of foul smelling parade!\n\nOther times, the water would inundate the soil so much that the mud slush would become more slush than mud, and suddenly you have a bunch of wooden boxes sealed up and filled with air that are much more buoyant than they are heavy, and are under 6-10 feet of water. So suddenly they launch themselves out of the water and sail through the air to come crashing down on city streets dozens or hundreds of feet away to explode in a mass of bones, mud, putrid flesh and nightmares into unsuspecting people's houses.\n\nTired of these constant invasions from the Skeleton army, and orbital drop pods of the dead, Paris gathered together and dug up all the offending bodies and stuck them down into the dark tunnels below the city where the sun can never shine, burying the horror forever out of sight, just under their feet, certainly not lurking and plotting their revenge.",

            "Cemeteries are usually on land that isn't suited for buildings. They are also normally located in areas not regularly travelled so not good for businesses either as they want to be in convenient locations.\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, cemeteries can still be built on land suited for businesses and near people. Most cemeteries have been around for generations, cities actually built around them. Cemeteries are normally built away from the city but that doesn't stuff urban development from building near them. \n\nYes, some buildings are built were cemeteries were. Those buildings would have to repurpose the ground before to suit a building weighing several tons. Usually this is done by putting cement into the ground, digging and flattening the Earth to suit the building (most cemeteries are built on hills or higher uneven ground) and / or pile several tons of dirt in that area to support such a structure.\n\nCemeteries are also great for local wild life. In some cities they are the only greenspace for many animals to go to and for plant species to thrive in. Many large cemeteries focus on biodiversity for this very reason.\n\nHere are a couple articles that go into further detail on it.\n\n[https://chicagoandcookcountycemeteries.com/2018/08/27/why-are-cemeteries-where-they-are/](https://chicagoandcookcountycemeteries.com/2018/08/27/why-are-cemeteries-where-they-are/)\n\n[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/10/cemeteries-home-to-diverse-plants-animals/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/10/cemeteries-home-to-diverse-plants-animals/)\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/03/our-first-public-parks-the-forgotten-history-of-cemeteries/71818/](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/03/our-first-public-parks-the-forgotten-history-of-cemeteries/71818/)",

My parents are going to be buried 'green' with native vegetation planted over them.\n\n I too, wish to have a green burial.\n\nA forest of trees is far nicer than a forest of grey slabs.\n\n For anyone who doesn't know. A green burial is when they wrap your body in a biodegradable cloth and put it into a wicker basket or other very simple, biodegradable coffin. Then a hole is dug and you're lowered in and covered.\n You can have native plants and trees planted over the plot to grow. Eventually, the coffin rots away, and so does your body - giving vital nutrients back to the earth.\n\n There's NO chemicals and NO body tampering. It's very minimal, and as green as we're allowed to get right now.\n\n I personally believe that traditional burials are selfish and a symbol of human greed.",

            "Look into what is happening in South Korea. In Seoul, for example, a majority of people are cremated, and their remains are places in an urn behind glass on a shelf inside a building designated as memorial. There is space to still have a proper ceremony, leave photos, flowers, and other memorabilia. The facility takes up a fraction of the space of a typical cemetery, is east to visit, and is well maintained. I visited one last year as a close friend had a grandparent pass away and will say everything about that particular location was impressive. Given the cost of a plot of land, casket, headstone, and everything else, similar facilities could likely be built almost anywhere for a similar cost (and easily relocated if ever needed). Botanical gardens are a good idea too. Decisions should be made with consideration of their effects 100 or 1000 or more years from now. Many of the old traditional methods make little sense when taking this approach.",

Don\u2019t pretend like you\u2019re not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> However, this rate of maturity can become problematic when the woman is  ready to make a commitment and get married, while the man is leaps  behind. It becomes particularly troublesome for women when men use  tiresome excuses as a way to avoid or delay an engagement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> In reality, these men do not possess\u00a0these fears, no matter how  determined they are to convince their women otherwise.

            "[Your 4th link, from the Washington Post is very confusing.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/26/hookup-culture-isnt-the-problem-facing-singles-today-its-math/)\n\n>In the Vanity Fair article, David Buss, a University of Texas psychology professor, says that apps like Tinder contribute to \u201ca perceived surplus of women,\u201d among straight men, which in turn leads to more hookups and fewer traditional relationships. Here\u2019s the thing: This surplus of women is not just \u201cperceived\u201d but very, very real.\n\nYou have a lot of links to read but I wanted to focus on this one. The average male and below average men very rarely get any matches on Tinder. These hookups are happening among the most physically attractive and wealthy men. Your article also references Date-onomics, which is very heavily flawed. For example that book says that women don't have enough men to date because there aren't enough college educated men. It acts as if men without college educations shouldn't be considered for dating at all, or don't exist in the dating pool. Men on the other hand are much less likely to think that women are not dating material just because they make less money or do not have a college background. You should check the reviews on that book on amazon and maybe you can get more explanations why that book has a very wrong perspective that acts like women are the ones who are unfavored in dating. The average woman in online dating will get vastly more matches.\n\nI know this doesn't respond to your main title but I wanted to point that out.\n\nEdit: Fixed grammar.",

So they scroll through endless profiles and  eventually make contact with a promising guy. Cue weeks of pointless  text-ing followed eventually by an actual date. The evening often goes  well. There might be a snog, more texting and another date arranged.  After that: nothing. The promising man, who\u2019s caught wind of a woman  with family plans, submerges back into the internet to scroll through  the options again. Why commit when Kate Moss might be beckoning from  behind the next screen?

I sit spider-like and listen, and  I\u2019ve found to my slight horror that all the hallmarks of the old  feckless narcissist are present in more than half the men I overhear.  There\u2019s the over-concern with grooming: hair, beard, tattoos. Then,  after they\u2019ve arranged their avocado egg toast and photographed it for  Instagram, the endless talk about themselves. They begin: \u2018The thing  about me is\u2026\u2019 Then there\u2019s no stopping them.\n\nTell me this doesn't sound like something an incel would say.

Why can't they see I'm perfect for them?\"\n\nIf a guy said there would be yells of incel and nice guy from people.\n\nAnd maybe she's right to an extent. She says:\n\n>It took the threat of public shame, fear of God and the censorious  tutting of mutual friends to chivy a man towards family life. Online,  dating strangers, who\u2019s to see or care?\n\nThis actually has some truth to it because you don't need a child to live or to be happy. In the past you were obliged to continue the family name, produce working hands for agriculture or because \"Deus vult!\" But in today's society there really is no logical reason to have a child.\n\nI'm not debating if having children is good or bad, that depends on the personal view. But from a purely logical point of view, you have no actual need for a child as an individual. The economy and humanity as a hole does in the long run, but you as a person don't.\n\nYes, some guys have a strong paternal instinct and want a family. But for those who don't, who don't want to change their life style just yet, who don't want to get tied to a baby in their 20s - early 30s or at all there is no reason to do this. And you can't shame or ridicule someone for not wanting to do something that will change their life forever - and not necessarily for the better.",

Add on top of that not wanting to settle down until closer to 40 and most of their male peers have lots of options and will often go for the young women, especially if they want kids.  Or they may have married young so Mr CEO already has a wife from years back.\n\nThe most mind boggling thing to me as a guy is that this is almost always framed as an issue that men need to solve.  That men were supposed to stay in their traditional role while society was drastically changing roles for women.  That there was to be equality in some aspects and traditional roles in others.  \n\nTo me his seems like an issue women need to figure out.

            "For the media, Its some kind of blues clues mystery that can't be cracked about the younger generations isn't it?\n\nThe media ignores that young people aren't allowed to live, then criticize them for not living? Its another blues clues mystery why young people don't listen to mainstream media. \n\nWouldn't it be nice to be able to buy a house at 22? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to afford cars that aren't over 10 years old? Wouldn't be nice to not have the chance of divorce after 30 years be somewhere in the 90% range?

            ">about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women \n\nI'm not surprised at this - the education system in the west is stacked against males from a fairly young age. In the UK at least, there's been a concerted effort to ensure that girls perform better at school than boys through a variety of methods (changing curricula, removing break times, socially isolating boys who are acting out because they have different needs from the girls), which is now showing its results as more and more women are going to university because men are being left behind academically. And nobody seems to give a shit really about this.\n\n>don't work as many hours as they used to\n\nAgain, not surprised by this. Wages have been driven down thanks to the twin effects of women entering the workforce in bigger droves after World War 2, and the drive of globalisation, so where before the entire town's male community would work at the local factory in one form or another, it's now cheaper to produce stuff in China and ignore the local men because they demand a living wage for their area, which can be expensive depending on where they live. Or there's a ton of competition from women who are also in the same industry who are in the same situation and are more willing to work for lower wages because they're more amenable to a part time role rather than a full time role or for any other factor. \n\nSo the local men have to go and get a second job because their hours have been slashed at their first job, assuming they still have a first job that's not disappeared overseas or gone to competition, and so whilst on paper they might be employed to do a 20 hour week at one job, the end result is the fact that they're pulling an 80 hour week across multiple jobs to afford rent. Which in turn cuts into the whole being social thing. Again, this is assuming that they do actually still bother with that whole having a job thing and don't just get a part time job somewhere and survive off benefits.\n\n>and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something.\n\nSee the points above. When your education is destroyed in favour of someone else, your job prospects are low because it's cheaper to employ someone else in a different country, and you're being harangued by articles screeching that you should be participating in a society that clearly doesn't want you, I'm really not surprised that men retreat away from that and go and do something that makes them happy. Women are encouraged to do these things as well, whether it's a spa day, doing yoga, \"treat yo'self\" or whatever, but men aren't. Good ol' double standard.",
            "Not easy to meet someone when the social stigma now is that every guy is a creep that wants to fuck you, nice guys are boring, and compliments=sexual harassment. Been single for a while, and trying to start something with someone new is terrifying. I've kinda steered away from it out of fear. I get along with women really well, but seeking something more feels like it teeters on the edge of being called some kind of pest if the other person doesn't feel the same way. I don't want people to call me a weirdo creep behind my back.\n\nI really enjoy my time to myself. And my freedom. I've been cheated on in most relationships, but never been the cheater. Or an abuser of any sort. So after being on the shit end so many times, I kinda just started looking for ways to do my own thing. \n\nI also don't have a burning desire to have kids or get married. I'm only somewhat financially stable. Kids would ruin that financial comfortability and freedom, for me.\n\nI really don't see the issue if guys wanna do their own thing. Some might think it's unhealthy, or them locking themselves away. But I know guys that have been through a lot as well. And it takes it out of you to go through a lot of shit. Sometimes it's just healthier for the mind to get some dang peace.",
            "I think it's mostly women's fault. Modern women increasingly hoe around until they are in their 30s, and family courts are massively rigged in their favor when it comes to divorce.",
            "As a woman, agreed. People should have a choice as to whether or not they want to start a family, pursue a high-paying career, etc. If they decide to only work enough to pay the bills and cover their expenses, all the while spending their free time playing video games and eating out, that's their choice. It might not be healthy, but it's their life. Nobody else gets to make decisions for them.",
            "It sounds like you might be referring to articles about hikikomori, which is a real problem where (typically men) withdraw from society and live as shut ins, generally playing video games 24/7, which is an actual psychological condition. That's what I thought you were referring to in the beginning. Nobody (gen x and below) cares if you don't follow the traditional path and prefer pursuing hobbies or playing video games, but for some that shit is pathological. No bueno.",
            "In today\u2019s media/society, there\u2019s much talk about women breaking social norms that are expected of men. This is celebrated (as it should be imo), but when men want to move away from those same norms, there\u2019s concern and chastisement. It\u2019s like we\u2019re living in a paradox. To me, this goes against feminism, or gender equality. \n\nThe bottom line is, people should be able to do whatever they want to do regardless of gender, which sounds like true equality. If a woman wants to become a corporate executive and earn more of the money in her family, she should be able to. And if her husband wants to focus on his hobbies more (and children potentially) with a less demanding career, he should be able to. And vice versa. Neither choice should be frowned upon. \n\nIn addition, men should not be expected to \u201ctake care\u201d of women in a relationship. True equality and equal power should be considered to exist through taking care of each other, and by both contributing to the lifestyle you want to build. In marriage vows the whole point is to take care of each other. I think a power imbalance forms when only one person is taking care of the other. In this sense, if only the man is taking care of the woman, he has power over her in the relationship. So I say if we want gender equality, everything in life should be equal.",

            "Where are all of these women who want to have kids before they\u2019re 30? Almost every woman I\u2019ve dated was repulsed by the idea of having kids in her 20s. \n\nHonestly though, I disagree with some of these articles. They\u2019re implying that men are the issue. I actually think it\u2019s the opposite. Women are the issue. Women tend to be hypergamous and opportunistic when it comes to dating and marriage. As women have became more liberated and financially successful in western societies they have effectively narrowed their dating pool. Lots of women aren\u2019t willing to date men who are less educated than them or make less money than they do. While it\u2019s great that more women are becoming successful, that comes at the cost of there not being as many males who are more successful than they are. Most women want to date men that are \u201cbetter\u201d than they are and many men are starting to realize that it\u2019s not worth it anymore to meet those expectations. Men who aren\u2019t in the top 15-20% of desirable males aren\u2019t really even being considered by the majority of women as potential mates. The more successful women become, the choosier they get with potential partners. That\u2019s part of the reason why birth rates are falling in almost every first world nation.  I don\u2019t blame the men who are giving up. The odds aren\u2019t in their favor.",

No. Am I afraid of rejection? Probably, but thats beside the point. Do I want to date? Yes and no. I miss the feeling of being wanted. I miss sex, but I don't think I'm ready to put myself out there. I have a lot of hobbies to take up my time but I also have more deeply rooted issues which I want to change in myself before I bring someone into my home and show them how fucked up I am. \n\nIf I got approached by women, I'd most likely be pretty interested, and certainly wouldn't say no to a coffee date. In the 5 years since my relationship I've taken up inline skating and generally do it shirtless because it gets hot in the summer. I get cat called several times a week, possibly by the same girls, but never have I ever been approached by a woman. \n\n\nTL;DR; I have some problems in my own life I want to solve before getting into dating, but I would be glad to if some courageous woman did the asking.",

            "I think there's a lot of pressure being put on young men today. The expectations being placed on them haven't kept up with the drastic changes in society over the last 10 years. You're still expected to have a prestigious career job, a kid, a nice house, and make more money than your wife/girlfriend by the time you're 30. If you aren't, you're considered a \"loser\". But that's becoming harder to achieve in this society, and a lot of guys are finding it difficult to cope. And I'm sure I'll get a lot of flack for this, but forth wave feminism is making the situation a lot worse. Rather than asking \"how can we help struggling men\", we're instead resorting to attacking and shaming them. That's counterproductive at best, sinister at worst. \n\nA big part of the problem, IMO, is a lack of support groups for men, offered by their male peers. Men really need other men to talk to. There are things guys just don't feel comfortable discussing with women, largely out of fear of appearing weak. Which isn't as silly as it sounds given the plethora of social media posts telling those struggling to \"man up\" and deal with it. \n\nUnfortunately, we've seen a sharp decline in things like church groups, clubs, and fraternal orders. The sort of masculine places guys used to go for support and male bonding. Plus a lot of men's interests and hobbies have been under a steady attack by the media lately. So as options shrink, many guys are now feeling isolated. I can see why so many are turning inward. As men, we could be doing a much better job making sure our bros get the positive support they need from us. I think it's our duty to both ourselves and society. We never know when we'll be the ones who need help, or just someone to talk to.",

            "Like Kanye, I have bipolar type 1 which has fully manic episodes (as opposed to type 2). I\u2019m in a support group and Kanye has come up several times. Some say he gives us a bad name and others feel he deserves sympathy. I think it\u2019s both. This disorder is no joke. When you\u2019re manic, you feel euphoric/untouchable and it does lead to risky, pleasure seeking, and/or uncharacteristic behaviors. I don\u2019t believe that be is his true self during these periods. It\u2019s not an excuse, but it could be an explanation. I was not an ass when manic, but I can still understand. It is also very typical that individuals with bipolar 1 will go in and out of med compliance. Meds have side effects and yes, from time to time you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the \u201creal\u201d you. But quality of life IS better with meds and therapy. I stick to my meds and therapy now because of my loved ones, especially my son. I really wish that Kanye would consistently participate in his own treatment.",

            "He comes across as extremely narcissistic, which is probably a better explanation for his asshole-ish tendencies than anything to do with his bipolar disorder.",
            "Damn as someone diagnosed Bipolar Type 1 , I am upset with the response of the community. On the right medications people can live a normal life.  He obviously isn't on the right concoction. It took my doctor throwing 3 different darts for 4 years to find the right combination. I haven't been manic or depressed since he hit the triple bullseye. The brain is a difficult beast to modulate. Literally everything you consume or do alters the chemistry. I stopped using all drugs but alcohol. I'm sure if I stopped drinking that my medications would need to be slightly altered.",

            "I'm bipolar. I take my meds every evening before bed. I never, ever want to be the horrible person I was during my one manic episode. Never, ever again.",
            "In my opinion Kanye has only done a few things that were out right \u201cAsshole ish\u201d. And most of them were 10 years ago. I\u2019m not defending his political views or the statements he makes but I do see a good human and a good father somewhere in there.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the flashy moments and poorly articulated statements but I promise you that if you listen to this dudes discography from front to back you will see him differently. He has been through some shit just like we all have but it just so happens that he was burdened with Bipolar Disorder and a massive group of people who hate his guts 24/7.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with his politics but he has done some objectively good deeds. He donated 2 million to George Floyd\u2019s family, He was seen protesting with BLM, He is currently working on Building shelters for the homeless called yzy Shelters. Not to mentioned all the young artists he has helped cultivate their own sound and make songs with. Hip Hop wouldn\u2019t be the same without him.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see 30 secs clips of him being crazy and ride him of as an ass, but I urge you people to be more compassionate towards someone who has faced the death of a mom (for which he blames himself for) and someone who constantly is on and off with manic episodes.  \n\nNo I am not part of the \u201cKanye cult\u201d as you guys like to call it, but he is nowhere near the biggest piece of shit around right now like you guys are making it seem.\n\nEdit: a lot of you people are posting to make it seem like Kanye goes around spitting on babies. Like damn what did he do to make you hate him so much.",
            "Its really enlightening to see how hollow all the talk about de-stigmatizing mental illness and improving the way we deal with it really is. Bipolar is a serious disorder that ruins people's lives and causes them to go down incredibly self-destructive paths and blaming the patient for it is incredibly ignorant. The disease causes irrational behavior, recklessness, grandiosity, and paranoia. You can say \"oh just get treatment\" but the disease itself gets in the way of that, in fact 50% of people with bipolar disorder do not take their medication regularly so this is not a unique issue. People need to recognize this as a disease and realize that Kanye is not in control of his actions and needs help.",

            "I get the entire thing around \"you shouldn't use it as an excuse\" you're saying. People should always be looking in improving themselves but his mental health is none of your business.

Nothing sucks more than knowing you're depressed, having constant suicidal thoughts, being your own worst enemy in everything you do, and KNOWING that you shouldn't feel that way, but you just cant fucking turn in off. \n\nI've told my friends it's like walking into a dark cave in my head to try and escape myself and even though I leave bread crumbs to find my way out, as soon as i am there, im stuck and all I hear are my own thoughts echoing back at me until something minor (or major) happens in my life and i immediately come out of my depression, but now I am in a manic state due to the situation.\n\nIts exhausting, i do not wish this on anyone.

It is so hard to watch someone you love in a manic high only to have them make statements condemning you for trying to get them help.  I spent fourteen years trying to \"save\" my ex when his BP sent him out into the streets for days at a time.  Even though he was mostly med compliant, the episodes could still be life threatening.  It's a pretty common complaint that meds affect creativity but it's pretty selfish to use that as an excuse to continue to put people who love you through the chaos and fear of repeated manic episodes.",

I still haven\u2019t completed high school  because of a really horrible manic episode I had. It\u2019s hurtful to hear people call Kanye crazy. Like I\u2019m sure that when the glass breaks and he comes down from all of this he\u2019s going to see the damage he did. On one hand I sympathize with him because his family is basically ruined but on the other, I see the name he\u2019s giving bipolar people and it really really hurts. I\u2019m not crazy and neither is Kanye, we are both just people fighting ourselves and we aren\u2019t the villains for losing sometimes.",

Everyone is so concerned about the bipolar person and their well being that nobody worries about the spouse who constantly plays referee for said person. My wife and I had a lot of trouble early on in our relationship due to this. She takes responsibility for her \"episodes\" and doesn't try to ignore the damage she rarely causes now, but early on she acted like nothing was ever he fault and she couldn't be held accountable because she had a diagnosed mental illness.\n\nMy buddy also loves Kanye West and thinks any hate against Kanye is hate against all bipolar people. I do not see this as the case. Kanye is responsible for his actions. All bipolar people are responsible for *their* actions. \n\nPeople can be \"understanding\" of why you acted a certain way but that doesn't mean they have to be forgiving or more lenient. Nobody denies being bipolar is not your fault and that it's harder for people with bipolar to keep things properly on the rails. But that does not *excuse* your behavior, it only informs the victims of your behavior why you may have done or said something terrible. Those people are still victims, you are still responsible. Some people may give you a pass sometimes, but that does not entitle you to avoid responsibility.\n\nFuck Kanye West. He's rich, famous, and a complete fucking asshole no matter how mentally ill he is. He can afford the best mental health assistance money can buy. He has all the resources in the world to live a quiet comfortable life for him and the next five generations of Wests and yet he does shit like this on a fairly regular basis. Fuck that guy.",

He likes the press and often uses it to garner hype for his albums. Like his spazzing around Yeezus and The Life Of Pablo.\n\nYes, he\u2019s talented. Yes, you can make the argument that he\u2019s one of the greatest musicians of all time. Yes, you can say he suffers from bipolar disorder. You can say all of that, yet he can still be an asshole, those aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. I truly hope he finds the help he needs, and I hope he surrounds himself with people who hold him accountable.\n\nYou can say all of that, but you can\u2019t call him an idiot. He\u2019s a billionaire, who owns a billion dollar company that he built off his own ideas. He has one of the highest Grammy counts. He has produced almost every album he\u2019s made along with a lot of other peoples songs and albums. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s always in the news. He\u2019s a master of saying stuff to get people to pay attention and they do. But he suffers from the case of, he\u2019s smart but his mind is all over the place that he can\u2019t get his ideas out correctly due to him not taking his medication as it hinders his creative process. He went from hundreds of million dollars in debt to being the first hip hop billionaire before hitting 50.\n\nSo is he an asshole? Yes. Is he an idiot? No. It\u2019s not like he had a billionaire father, or a rich best friend growing up. He didn\u2019t get lucky to get this rich, he built it himself, and to anyone who says he doesn\u2019t have an impact in the world, 90% of the rappers today have influence by Kanye West. His clothing line isn\u2019t going anywhere until it gets disbanded. His Grammys are all legit. And most importantly, he is one of the most influential artists in music in the current generation. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s better than Michael Jackson, because he\u2019s not. He\u2019s not better than the Beatles, because he\u2019s not.

            "This is especially true for comedy and prank videos on social media now.  You can tell it\u2019s scripted and contrived.  It comes off as \u201ctry hard\u201d imo.",
            "About two years ago I decided to start a website for video game reviews.  About 18 months ago I realized I \"had\" to be on Youtube to get any traction. I tried a bunch of things early on (most are still up because I don't see a reason to hide my past but they are not good) and I'm now at a place that I think I'm producing great content.   But the fact is I keep running into this. \n\nYou need a great microphone to be on Youtube.  You need to be a video editor, audio engineer, script writer, and performer to be on Youtube.  And if you lack any of those people will call you out on it. \n\nThere's very few \"hobbyist\" out there and almost every big Youtube channel is either a film student who now does this or an entire production crew.  They make it look like \"Oh this is just a fun hobby\" but holy crap the amount of production on their video makes it really clear this is a full job/a full team working on the projects.\n\nOr maybe they're a person who can make amazing art inserts, perfect film editing, amazing sound quality, and have unique experiences all the time... I just don't buy it. \n\nIt's really hard to have a Youtube channel when you already have a 40 hour job, a family, and a life away from it, and then there's people like LegalEagle who act like \"Oh this is an easy thing.\"  Spoiler: he has at least a video editor, but he has admired to having a full crew that help him. And as a lawyer, he probably has less time than most people.  \n\nThe thing is saying \"I just want to talk about games from a personal perspective\" isn't enough.  The big Youtubers have a huge staff, so most now get advertising deals to make their videos and then eventually have an almost incestuous relationship with publishers and developers  to get early copies, and content so they can make more videos.  If you're a small youtuber, you won't get that so you have almost no way to grow.  It makes it hard to get heard, and hard to really trust most of the current Youtubers, because it always feels like they're trying to sell you something, or not piss off companies to keep the content coming.\n\nDidn't most of us want to watch Youtubers because they were unbiased?  But the fact is they're MORE biased than media outlets because there's very little professionalism to their journalism.  Instead it's just \"Who can make the best video\" and if they give biased opinions to curry favor from the industry they're covering, who cares? \n\nIt is just really hard to trust Youtubers who constantly shill products, and I don't fault people for making money, but... \"Raid Shadow Legends is the best game ever\" also makes it hard to trust them.\n\nAnd it doesn't help that people keep telling others \"You gotta put out content each day to be popular.\"  Yeah.. I can't and won't do that, but I also cringe when I see others just spamming Youtuber.  I really want my videos to be worthy of being released, and the fact is videos should take a good amount of time to produce.  Shooting videos every day is a great way to be a \"Vlogger' but quality drops quickly.  The fact is that's just bad advice.   \n\nShooting a good 10-20 minute video probably takes me closer to 10-20 hours to produce, you put your heart and soul into it to talk about a topic you really care about.   Then someone comes by and says it's not good enough or says you're just spamming low effort content, and disregards or downvotes it for any reason.  That just really sucks. \n\nOk, sorry about that rant.  TL:DR Almost no big youtuber is a single person, most have crews, and pretend to be solos.  And it's not a game that hobbyists can enter without a lot of work, and even then a single person will never be able to make content that gets recognized for more than a single video or two.",
            "True, the market is saturated and on top of that everyone is pretending to be a guru of something they have very little knowledge about plus the ads selling you an ' entrepreneurial lifestyle ' are just downright scams.\n\n I had to make a separate account where I can chose what YouTube shows me, where I only open certain kinds of videos.",
            "This will probably get buried, but one of the answers to this is Google pushes for longer content. Videos under 10 minutes don't get promoted as much and make less than half the money. \n\nSimilar with websites, there is so much useless information in what could be a one sentence answer because Google Ads require long texts to get ads. \n\nSo you have content creators stretching their videos to get more watch time...",

            "I honestly don't mind that creators do get paid for doing Youtube stuff as long as the contents are great and awesome ( i do agree Youtube used to be way better before )\n\nOne creator i like watching is Dave Lee (tech ) he does youtube as a hobby and has an excellent job outside it ( and he is very genuine )\n\nThere's also the facts that people get offended these days for almost anything and it's really hard to make contents that are edgy, a little out of the box and some other stuffs as well ( this is so called controversial nowadays which i find it stupid ). Youtube also in terms of management does a terrible job as well, they prioritise big mainstream stuff and other things often gets demonitized and even outright deleted if they dont agree with it ( they really dont do much to help their creators who made what youtube is which i find it's quite sad )",
            "What's worse is that many of these big youtubers are hindered by what they can say.  If they piss off the wrong group they could lose a large part of their community, supporters, or advertisers.  Not to mention the enablers who give them stuff they can make content off of.  So instead you get the most tame stuff you can find.  \n\nAlso as you get more subscribers on youtube you have to aim your video to them so if you have people if you make a video about riding a bike, and something you are passionate about like building a chair and the bike video gets a thousand times the views.... you're going to be riding a bike for the rest of your Youtube career because that's what works. \n\nA lot of the problems with this is due to making it a career/making money off of it or being beholden to your audience, but in general it's a bad thing for both the viewer and the \"Star\".",

But if someone gets \"too big\", I (admittedly, paranoid and cynical as I am) eventually find a point where I can no longer see that person past the script, or the sponsorship message, or the friendly begging for likes and shares so the almighty algorithm will push them into other people's recommended list. \n\nIf I wanted to watch people acting (or putting on a persona) for money while sneaking ads and such, I'd watch TV.",

If you ever dig far enough into YouTube, you start finding videos with 100 to 1000 views, low subscriber count, and all of that. It feel so much more genuine watching these people as the intent to \"create\" is simply there because the creator felt it. The videos are not there to comply with monthly advertisement revenue.   \n\n\nThat being said, I did a little bit of digging and found r/unknownvideos. There is a lot of fantastic and unique creators out there. Last one I saw was about a kid going out into nature but he edited everything so it seemed like an RPG quest (think of Skyrim or WoW).

You go from being happy with 100,000 views and making a little extra money to getting 1,000,000 views but needing more to pay your car loans. There's a reason so many channels that did things like animation, film, sketches, etc started flooding their feeds with podcasts, Let's Plays, streaming, and blogs. The latter won't get as many views, but they're so much quicker and easier to make that the quantity outperforms the quality and they make their money.\n\nIf an episode of your full-time job animation series takes a month to make, but gets 5 million views, you'd be better off making daily blogs that get 300,000 views each.",

They started it as a fun thing, but as the money started coming in, they realized the demands on their channel also increased. They can\u2019t really do it just for fun since the money coming in was better than any jobs they can get. So they were forced to actually sit down and organize their channel like an actual job instead of impromptu channel. And when the sponsors contracts started coming in, it increased the amount of stress since the contracts actually specify how and when my friend advertises the sponsor contents. He hated it so much since it ruined the flow and narrative of his videos. But there wasn\u2019t really anything he could do. Either he fall back to do fun things, lose followers and incomes, or submit to the system and keep his income.",

            "Small time creator here and I feel like you are reading my mind. While I do have one small sponsor I put in a 30 second spot in some videos it does help pay for equipment/projects. Other than that I don't chase any numbers and will do project videos that people ask for yet I know won't do well on the \"numbers\".\n\nWhile it is a lot of work to continue to make better videos and improve on things I only look at myself as my competitor and don't worry about chasing a number. For instance the thumbnails with arrow everywhere and your surprised poop face on it just does not work for me. I do this for fun and love interacting with the community and hobbyists. Once it becomes a job it stops being fun.\n\nLove the small time guys! They put out some great down to earth content.",

Youtubers that now don\u2019t do filming or editing themselves are now having to make Payroll so the quality takes a hit in favor of a regular release schedule.

I will likely start posting videos again once all of this is over, but like 10 videos a year, max...  I think Patreon is something I might look into just to help pay for supplies, etc...  \n\nI agree that everything has become more superficial.  Much of the changes happened around the \u2018adpocalypse\u2019 where YouTubers were forced to figure how to survive.  Some chose do adverts and to make more cheap content, many other chose to stop making content all together, unfortunately.",
            "But here's the thing, you can argue that since people have the ability to focus on this full time, that they have the ability to make their passion a job, this is what made it explode into something better.\n\nWith that being said, it's just really hard to make it into a job. You have to put those annoying ads in, you have to constantly remind people to like and subscribe, because the more money you make from the platform, the greater your ease of mind, and the more you can focus on creating content instead of trying to survive.",
            "I'm showing up late here but if anyone feels like this here's my advice:\n\nYouTube is a VERY big place and millions of creators go unnoticed. If you have something that interests you, like tech for example, youtube will show you LTT.

I hate how its become nowadays.\n\nI'm not saying its bad some can make a living from it now but things were much more pure back then.

His videos are all carefully made and from scratch. Definitely underrated.\n\n[EmpLemon](https://www.youtube.com/user/EmperorLemon) - where do I begin with this guy? He\u2019s amazing. His videos are full-on documentaries, yet he only has half a million subscribers. If not making documentaries, he\u2019s ranting about what\u2019s going on in the world or YouTube itself. Highly recommend.\n\n[Stryder7x](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYDnJiF0_RqSjkjvjRbG1tA) - is a Paper Mario YouTuber that spends large amounts of time looking for game-breaking glitches or exploits, and creates interesting content to showcase his findings.

Very cool if you\u2019re into that stuff.\n\n[FitMC](https://www.youtube.com/user/SonOfShoop) - is a Minecraft YouTuber that focuses on 2b2t, *the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft*. His style is unique and his tone of voice makes his videos that much more captivating. He covers lots of interesting technical stuff within Minecraft itself like AntVenom, but also lore about the server itself.\n\n[Skeppy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzMjRlKVO9XIqH_crIFpi6w) - this guy has become a lot more mainstream this year, but if you don\u2019t know who he is, he is a Minecraft YouTuber that hosts mini games and events and gives out real money to winners. He\u2019s basically the MrBeast of Minecraft. He also has a lot of older content where he would just mess with random players on his server or mess with his friend, BadBoyHalo. Lots of laughs from this channel.\n\n[Vic Dibitetto](https://www.youtube.com/user/VicDiBitetto) - is a professional comedian that uploads daily skits and rants. I highly recommend his [Ticked Off Vic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQBfgTByfogt8irSXDmjcipcQXStUD3tN) series, where he rants about current events and other nuances of living as a working class American.

Whenever someone tells me they're a YouTuber or they want to blow up on YouTube the first thing I think of is \"Unemployed.\"\n\nI mean yeah you can make money from it but it shouldn't be a job/your main source of income because who is to say you'll still be popular a year from now?  Then what? And to me it seems like a lot of YouTubers don't understand the concept of budgeting/saving for a rainy day so if their channel flops, they're just screwed. I've seen a lot of YouTubers who were once popular but now their videos only generate around 30 to 40k views a month compared to the millions they used to generate at the peak of their careers. Some have gone back to school, others have ventured off into other fields, etc. but they're not doing nearly as good as they were back in the day and always shoving sponsorships down the throats of the few viewers they still have left or always asking people to donate to their Paypal or Patreon.",
            "When people were creating content as a hobby instead of a \"job\", they also didn't show any entitlement. YouTubers and streamers think they're an entrepreneur or whatever, when really they're \"contract employees\" at best. They think the money they're making from their \"content business\" belongs to them and when the platform does anything to affect their money, they throw a fit. If my company cut my benefits, I can either: quit or pucker up. A lot of YouTubers just stay and complain, when that's the cost of doing business if YouTube is your \"job\". In end, I think creating content as a hobby has less overhead (being on trend, monetization, stressing over views).",

            "Same, and i think i know why: it feels 100% genuine, like they're actually trying and giving a fuck and aren't just on it for the money. There aren't any ads, rarely donation requests and those requests are often brief as hell, and there isn't any of that flashy shit on the screen making them look like a big shot; just a monitor and some gameplay (or a meme compilation, if thats what your into). I'll admit it without guilt; my brain, pop-culture wise, is stuck in the 2000-2010s. I love pop songs from the 2000s-2010s (and a little bit after that), and i love tha classic, non-animated anime pictures from back in the days of early nightcore. The main reason why i like pop song from this decade is because unlike pop-songs today, they don't feel like dark, depressing, bass-boosted pieces of shit that belong in the musical dumpster along with cardi B and nicki minaj; they sound so upbeat, so happy, so positive. Thats what i want to hear most often, not some depressing shit billie bob eyelash made to male you jump on the fake depression bandwagon with her.

I made a tiny fire in the middle of the concrete at the abandoned dealership and tried to cook a hotdog. The police came and told me to leave. \n\nI was 18 at the time, no friends or family.

It's similar to loitering laws, it's such a vague law that it's more intended to just be a tool for officers, so if they can't get you on anything else, they can get you on loitering. Ethics questions aside about writing laws designed to be only occasionally enforced, unless you park your car illegally, have it blocking traffic, or make someone uncomfortable by parking right outside their house, you will be fine. \n\nMost driver safety courses actually encourage you to sleep in your car if you feel yourself nodding off while driving. Their logic is it is far safer to sleep on the side of the road then on it. As long as your car isn't bothering anyone else, I doubt you will have issues with officers, and worst case, just tell them you were starting to fall asleep behind the wheel and felt it wasn't safe for you to drive anymore untill you rested. Most enforcement of street laws is just to keep everyone safe, and while there are bad apples just looking to pad their ticket quota, you will most likely be fine. \n\nIt's this same reason why, if you ever get drunk and don't feel it's safe to drive home, you can usually leave a note on your car saying so.

I came about four inches from the from of an incoming car.\n\nI told my boss if she ever scheduled me like that again that I wouldn't be back, but honestly I blame the cop just as much.

Who can tell him to leave? He decides that the location is his now, and he wants running water and electricity. Suddenly the owner of the property who may or may not know this squatter is there is being contacted by the city for having dangerous living conditions ect.

            "Hi, I'm a composer and you're totally on the money in some ways, although perhaps a blanket statement is imperfect. Most def video game composers are overlooked, but it isn't definitively harder to do one or the other. \n\nThere are key things that are hard about VG composition and key things that are harder about film. The hardest three things to think about in video game composition are, IMO:\n\n1- the fact that the songs often (though not always) need to loop perfectly. It needs to seamlessly go into itself over and over again without any issues.\n2- the music needs to constantly engage over a 15-100+ hour experience. Imagine playing an RPG with bad battle music. It would be unbearable.\n3- the music often has to have several arrangements of the same track in order to have various versions play of the track in one location based on the geography of that location. A good example is the various dynamic versions of Skyloft from Skyward Sword.\n\n\nOn the film side of things, there's a couple things that we have to deal with a bit differently. The most integral thing is something called 'hits.' whenever there's an action piece, or something happening on the screen you have to move the piece to match the on screen action. Let's stay an explosion happens on the screen; this explosion should be reflected in the music cascading to some kind of climax in that moment, even if no one ever notices who's watching it. Often the music written has to change several times throughout filming as you deal with rough cuts, or directors who change their mind. It's just sort of how the film industry works.\n\nA major difference between the two, particularly in the modern film/VG industry is that VG music often sits in the forefront and therefore needs to be more melodic, and film music is often more in the BG and thus needs to be accentuating emotion and character as opposed to drawing your attention.\n\nOkay that's all. Hope this was cool to read. Have a nice day.",
            "Fun fact, video game soundtracks are perfect to study  or workout to, as most are psychologically designed to get your heart rate going and/or motivate the player. Also, 1000% agree with this, composers (video game & otherwise) need to be pushed to the front lines to be respected and appreciated for all their hard work.",

If you played the Star Wars theme to any passerby, it's most likely they'll know it was composed by John Williams. But if you played the Mario Bros or Legend of Zelda theme to a passerby, they'll most likely have no idea who composed it.

            "I know what you're trying to say and in principle I agree with you but I still feel very uncomfortable with the fact that my money would be used in such a destructive way. What bothers me is not the \"waste\" aspect of it but rather the destructive part. For example I have absolutely no problem with the idea of buying a homeless guy a movie ticket. Most people will probably say: \"that's crazy, that's such a waste of money, just buy him essential stuff he truly needs\" but I disagree. I believe we all need fun, entertainment, happiness. A loaf of bread and a bottle of water will get you through the day biologically but not psychologically. You need an opportunity to enjoy life... everyone deserves that. So, in that sense I 100% agree with you. I just don't want the fun/happiness I provide to a person to be such a destructive thing.\n\nOne time I was walking home when I saw a homeless girl at the side of the street. She was just a few years younger than me (in her early 20s) and she looked absolutely miserable. At first I walked past her but somehow I couldn't stop thinking about her, so I went back, knelt down and asked her if I she needed some help. She told me she was very hungry and asked for some money. I considered the situation for a moment, then I told her to get up. There was a big supermarket just down the street. I told her to come along with me. She was very skeptical and shy but eventually she did come. On the way to the supermarket, I told her that I didn't want to give her cash but that I had something that was arguably just as good. When we entered the supermarket, I gave her a basket and said: \"Alright, so, this is how it works. You shop anything you want. I will accompany you through the store and help you get the stuff you wanna have. You have completely free reign and there's no financial limit. If you see something yummy and it fits in this basket, go ahead. When you're all done we'll go the cashier together and I'll pay for you.\" I still remember the look on the girl's face... it was like she was struck by lightning. She couldn't believe the offer I was making her. This alone made me so happy and was so much fun for me that I knew it was worth the money. As we walked through the store, I could tell she felt like a kid in a candy shop. There were all kinds of fancy products that she would usually never be able to afford... organic fruits and veggies, good cheese, smoked salmon, cereals, honey and a bunch of other things. In the end, she showed much more restraint than she had to, despite me saying it's okay; probably because she felt too bad to let fully loose. Anyway, the final bill was $75 or something like that and it was totally fine by me. I could tell how excited the girl was and that she still couldn't quite believe her luck. Somehow, that made me really happy inside. I knew she was going to have fun with all that food, especially the snacks and sweets. It was my way of trying to bring a bit of fun and joy into a homeless person's life without the destructive side effects that alcohol and drugs have. I wish I could've also given her a laptop computer to watch Netflix while eating her snacks because that is what I love to do but unfortunately that was not an option ;).",
            "Agreed. If I give them money they can do what they like with it",
            "You know, I have never looked at it this way before, and I have to thank you for sharing a fresh perspective. I have often felt that I should put my money towards shelters or food banks because my goal is to actually help them get back on their feet. However, if it\u2019s a couple bucks we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re right that it\u2019s naive for me to think that would somehow get them back on their feet if they \u201csaved it responsibly.\u201d  \n\nYou are a good person, and have helped me change my opinion here.

            "Agree so much with this. Homeless people need a home, that the first step to solving their issues. Buying food for a homeless person because you don't want them to get alcohol is somehow to me so patronising... I think if I was on the street without a home, I probably would want to get drunk, I have no idea how I'd cope with that situation, my head hurts just thinking about it.\n\nThat being said, I have drug addict friends that are now on the street and I know that they would use the money for drugs and I know they have a home to go to if they decided to give up drugs. I don't give them money. But if I don't know someone situation, I don't judge and don't patronise. They might be an addict, a terrible person, someone with really bad luck, or all of the above. I rise above and help out with what I can in the moment, even if that's money for alcohol.",

            "I agree with you. I give homeless people cash and its up to them what they spend it on. People who are so self righteous can fuck off as far as I'm concerned. Same with those who are convinced the homeless are secret millionaires from panhandling.",
            "As am I. Here\u2019s my reasoning. It is easy to assume the dirty, shaking, stuttering person in front of you is just a junkie that ruined his own life. But could just as easily be a diabetic veteran who is going into shock from a lack of nutrients and whacked out sugar levels. Maybe they have cancer or worse. Maybe they are just straight up starving. Maybe they are going through alcohol/drug withdrawal which is deadly. Speaking from personal experience here. As a recovering alcoholic. The withdrawal can and will kill a person.\n\nNone of us can ever really know what another person is going through and sometimes people just need an iota off kindness from another person. Any person. If we were all better towards one another there would be less homelessness, but instead we\u2019d rather ignore the problem until it becomes so out of hand we see it as an irritant instead of something we can all help to fix for one another.\n\nNothing makes me angrier than watching someone in a super expensive sports car mock and mess with those less fortunate begging in the median of a busy road or elsewhere. When I see it I intervene. I also keep supply bags in my car with some cash in case I see someone who needs it. Supplies as in things like bath kits, socks, underwear, feminine hygiene products, snacks.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with showing kindness and one day those that go out of their way to down, mock or blame the less fortunate for their circumstance\u2019s will find themselves in a bad situation and no one they have surrounded themselves with will be willing to help them.\n\nBecause birds of a feather stick together and you get back what you put out.",

Keep in mind shelters close around 8-9pm, you have to register earlier in the day, temp agencies hours are super early (5-8 am most jobs are assigned) so the time they're begging tells you a lot as well.

Also, lots and lots of lying as well. \n\nDirty secret in homeless community, from my experience, 5+ yrs homeless, 100% of people with signs are full of shit.

How dare you judge a person based on their homelessness. You don't know ANYTHING about their situation, and you are assuming the worst of them by denying their choices with money.\n\n3. If you REALLY wanted to actually HELP a homeless person, you would realize the best thing to give them is not FOOD. It is DIGNITY. The best way to give them that is money. They have agency to make their own choices, and it is up to THEM whether or not it was a good choice.\n\nEdit to #3:\nIf you are homeless in a 1st world country, food is in abundant supply. There are homeless shelters with luncheons peppered all over every city, food banks, churches offer food, a lot of pastors give food to the homeless from their own homes. It just simply isn't the #1 thing homeless people are lacking.\nEdit 2: Thought I should clarify that edit. Of course food is a problem still, because you often go hungry until food is available, or you have to travel miles to get to it. I'm trying to emphasize the agency portion of it all. If you get money, great, now you can choose to buy food if you want.\n\nSorry. I know that no one is reading this, I guess it struck a nerve.",
            "I haven't posted here in over 6 months but decided to log in just now to say that I totally agree with you. Man, homeless people have it hard enough...so so what if they need a little something to get thru a hard day?\n\nBack in the day, my ex and I got into big arguments over this. The first time was back in the 90's when I was in school. On my drive home there was this bridge I drove under where these 3 homeless guys lived. On Christmas Eve, I decided to make 3 gift bags for them. We went to K-Mart and I purchased 3 of: blankets, shirts, pants, socks, some food items, candy, hand sanitizer, kleenex, toothpaste/toothbrush...stuff like that.\n\nThen the ex lost his shit when I tried to include a couple of those airplane sized bottles of whisky and a pack of cigarettes for each. I figured that even if they didn't smoke and drink, they could trade those for something else. And if they did enjoy those, then at least they'd have a somewhat decent Christmas morning. To me, it was just a care package, but to him I was enabling possible rapists and murderers. The point is, unless you talk to them, you don't really know why someone is homeless. And I was just trying to be kind and helpful.\n\nThe other time was when we were walking on Hollywood Blvd. These two young homeless men approached and asked us if we could spare some change. The ex kept walking but I slowed down and one of the dudes said they wanted to buy some weed. So I gave them $20 and told them that I appreciated their honesty. I got bitched out by the ex, but I still don't regret it or think I did anything wrong. Sometimes people just need that kind of stuff to feel OK. And who am I to judge? It's all about being kind. Period.",
            "I think the same way as you. Helping homeless is not always about giving them food, clothes and shelter but also dignity. \nThe feeling of having some money in your pocket that you can spend on anything you want is great and I would miss it if I became homeless.",

If someone\u2019s in a position where they feel the need to \u201cscam\u201d strangers for bread and milk then clearly they need some damn help.

            "OP, you\u2019re a good person. And a better person than the people that only give food. I challenge anyone to try sleeping outside in public without having a drink to fall asleep. Most people will fail. At any second you could be victim of someone\u2019s random act of violence or subject to arrest. According to the National Coalition for the Homeless and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 38% of homeless people were dependent on alcohol and 26% abuse other drugs ( https://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/addiction.pdf ) so even combining the numbers and assuming there is no overlap of drinkers and druggers, that is still only a little over half. So, about half of homeless people do *not* use drugs or alcohol. So if someone assumes 100% of the time that the money is for drugs and alcohol, then that means they\u2019re a stereotyping bigot half of the time.\n\nI was homeless once upon a time and one big thing many people don\u2019t realize that the money they give goes towards is bathing without fear of rape in the form of a few homeless people pitching in and sharing a motel room. Lots of people may not realize but shelters are not safe and the bathing areas are especially not safe. There are crazy homeless people and some of them can be very rapey. And since no one actually cares about the homeless, transgressions against them are never taken seriously and so problems don\u2019t get fixed. It\u2019s much safer option to share a motel room with 3 or 4 other people that you know and take turns showering. Also, that moment of sanity and getting to feel like a real person for just a few minutes, and to sleep without fear for a night, is invaluable to one\u2019s mental health. If it weren\u2019t for getting temporary breaks like that every once in a while I would still be homeless, completely broken as a person by circumstances. It made the difference between having the fortitude to claw my way back into society and just giving up completely and seeing how deep the rabbit hole went. Without occasional creature comforts it\u2019s easy to lose sight, it provides a light at the end of the tunnel and a reason to keep pushing.",

Definitely a former felon unable to land work.\n\nHe knew our rules. If we caught him doing more than just passing through or walking by, we'd kick him out. However, he'd come by and talk with us and we were bored so we shot the shit.\n\nAbout 6 months of this, the weather was cold, it was around Christmas and me and a few coworkers bought him a ton of stuff to help him out.

He smoked too so I hit the Indian Reservation smoke shop and bought a couple cartons of their cigarettes.\n\nWe treated him nicely that evening.

It's not true to say you shouldn't hit women, because you really shouldn't hit anyone, but if you find yourself in a situation where you need to defend yourself, and your assailant is someone grossly physically inferior, you need to exercise some restraint. Whether it's a woman, a child, an elderly person, someone with a disability, whatever. Assess your situation and if it'll do the job, then only open the SMALL can of whoopass.\n\nNow that's probably a bit too nuanced for a school aged kid, and a lot of it goes out the window in school anyway since there's so many other dynamics in play and you could have a six year old boy trying to defend himself against a 12 year old girl, and you're definitely not in the wrong in your situation, but if you think your kid will get it this might be a good opportunity to explain about how it's ok to defend yourself, but to not go overboard and that it can be easy to hurt someone smaller and weaker than yourself.",

While we're in line, discussing what kind of cheesy tastiness we were ordering, this friend saw someone (M) she knew that she didn't like, and I happened to know him as well; he was the brother of one of my college friends.\n\nWell she marches over to him and starts drunkenly yelling at him and shoving him and saying stuff like, \"what are you going to do? you can't hit me!

She and I obviously never spoke again (thank god) but you can't go around mouthing off and shoving people for no reason and expect to get some kind of vagina pass.

I have none of that. Its not that my friends don't think I'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. What about single dads?  We do the same shit. I work and take care of my kids the same way but I don't get celebrated like I'm doing something amazing. I just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. \n\nEdit - thanks for the silver and gold people. I hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because I sounded like I wanted a cookie for being a dad. It may have sounded like I wanted credit for some shit I'm supposed to do. \n\nThat's not the case. I've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and I'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then I play with my kid so I'm not just there on my phone. Its not the same for us. We don't have the same resources. Although some of you have suggested some that I hadn't heard of. \n\nAnyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and I think that may be how it came across. Thanks for all your support and for making me feel like I'm doing good as a parent. \n\n\nEdit 2 - Well this blew up. I'd like to say that I really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. Thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. To those that disagree or say \"man up,\" that's why I put this in unpopular opinions. Not everybody agrees and that's just fine. \n\nAs has been repeatedly pointed out, I know I'm not a full time single parent. I'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. Sometimes its hard. Just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. I can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props. ",

            "When my wife and I separated I got physical custody of our daughter. She was with me pretty much full time. Now my daughter is unquestionably the highlight of my life and I love her more than should be possible, but god-damn it was exhausting to work a 10 hour day, pick her up from daycare, cook a good meal (I really tried in that area because she deserves so much more than McDonald's), play with her, bathe her and put her to bed, all by myself every night. By the time I finally got her to sleep I didn't have the energy to do more than drink a beer and hit the sack myself. It was utterly exhausting.\n\nStill I find myself missing that time of my life. She was such an adorable little 4 year old. Everything was new and magical for her and because I had her all of the time I got to share in each moment. The very best view of the world that I've ever had was through her eyes.",
            "My parents split when I was 4 and let me tell you. My dad was a SUPERHERO. He cooked, he cleaned, he learned how to sew to make us dresses when times got hard (its 3 girls). He coached my soccer and my cross country, he packed picnics and took us on bike rides, made sure we knew how to camp and hike, he did arts and crafts with me, he and I would read together. \n\nMy mother was a single mom. But if I needed her attention it had to go by her work computer. We were eating South Beach Diet with her at 4th grade. Summers were spent inside watching tv or playing with my sisters in the backyard\u2014we didn\u2019t go anywhere. Yeah, my mom was career focused. My dad was too, but he did it when we werent around. He was Dad the week we were there, and he was packing heavy work hours on the weeks we werent. \n\nSingle dads are amazing. And part of it is because they aren\u2019t recognized. I\u2019m a daddy\u2019s girl through and through because I was raised with him by my side, giving me all the happy childhood memories I could have ever asked for, despite not having a ton of money. I don\u2019t really have those memories with my mom. \n\nYou can guess which parent my sisters and I willingly drive out to more often. \n\nKeep it up, man, your kids will appreciate it.

It must be hard to not be around friends who \"get it\". Maybe you could check on facebook and see if there's a group in your area.\n\nI can kind of see the perspective of feeling like you're a single dad. IDK you and your ex's financial situation, but growing up my dad was the one who mostly supported me financially. He lived in the same house from the time I was 1 and he still lives there now, actually. He was very overprotective, and I hated him for it. Hated him.  But now as an adult, and especially after having my own child, I see how he was actually a great dad and did the best he could for me, and was my rock. Life with my mom was tumultuous, and I would have had a lot more issues if he hadn't have shown up and made an effort to be a great parent, always putting my needs before his own.\n\nI don't know why I'm telling you all this, but I think I should really tell my dad more how much I appreciate him.",

            "My ex got a free Christmas tree because she was a single mom. Have heard of other preferential treatments at places for being a single mom. She doesn\u2019t work still even after divorce, I pay for almost all her life. Nobody gives a damn that I\u2019m a single dad who is not only doing my half but also working on top of it to pay her. Divorce is fucked up for men. ",
            "I think single dads definitely have it harder. Single moms seem to have so much more geared towards helping them,  while dads don\u2019t have anything. I\u2019ve actually seen first hand discrimination between the two at jobs I\u2019ve worked at, where moms have been given preferential treatment, but dads have been told to \u201ctough it out\u201d.  My hat goes off to all single dads. ",
            "Speaking as a person who was Single Dad to a high special needs Son. No help what so ever from mom. She left the continent. 17 years now never been in the same room as him, or paid support etc. \n\nI found the exact opposite to be true. For some reason I received extra credit because I was a single dad. Like somehow I had it harder then a Single Mom. Used to annoy the hell out of me. \n\nThe places I found it more difficult was in terms of access to various things and having authorities believe without explanation that I was single, and no mom wasn\u2019t in the picture.\n\nBest example I can think of is what we have here in Canada called the Child Tax Benefit (CTB). A stipend of money intended for lower income families. Well I discovered through my efforts to have it transferred from my Ex\u2019s name to mine. There is something called the Female Presumption Rule. It\u2019s not written anywhere. But when a child is born the money is automatically put into moms name until otherwise notified. And to notify involves a bunch of extra steps that a single mom I had to explained to me probably wouldn\u2019t of needed to jump through. \n\nBut in terms of society I seem to get more praise then then that of single moms out there.

            "> as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero.\n\nThat's... an extremely recent development.

Men need to start giving that same kind of support and encouragement to other men as well!\n\nAnyway, you have my support, and I'm sure you're doing great as a parent.",
            "The term single parent, either single mom or single dad, doesn\u2019t really apply to a shared custody situation...a true single mom or dad is one who does virtually all the parenting not a 50/50 shared situation.  I am a father in a shared situation and would never claim to be a single father as I know that my children\u2019s mother carries the responsibilities, concerns, and care of the children with me regardless of our marital status.  Yes, there aren\u2019t as many \u2018daddy groups\u2019 as \u2018mommy groups\u2019, and being a good father can feel more isolating, but the rewards are your relationship with your children...and that is pure Gold.",
            "My unpopular opinion to your post is half custody isn't being a single parent. Thats coparenting.

They visited a lot. But my own guy friends? Zip. No visits. Not even a card or a phone call. It was really frustrating to see my wife\u2019s friends be better friends than the guys I had thought of as friends for the past 30 years. \n\nThen again, for me guys are more fun when drinking beer, camping, or just sitting around shooting the shit.

            "this is a complicated and fucked up issue.  \n\ni have a friend in a traditional relationship who is a great dad - spends time with his kids, takes them to disneyland, to the beach, to museums.  whenever he posts a picture of his daily outings with his kids, he gets 200+ 'likes' and a ton of comments lauding his fatherhood.\n\nwhen his wife posts similar pictures, it's crickets.  a like or two, and \"oh, they're so cute.\"  she doesn't hear, \"OMG YOU'RE SO AWESOME FOR TAKING YOUR KIDS TO THE PARK, WHAT A GREAT MOM YOU ARE.\"\n\nin their household, she works a 9-5 (7-7 with traffic), while he works three days a week, 12 hour shifts, blocks from home, and spends four days a week with the kids at parks, disneyland, etc. he's a hero for doing the minimum that stay at home moms do, while she gets nothing for coming home after a 12 hour day and reading to her kids.  make no mistake - he's an AWESOME father.  but he gets to do that shit by virtue only of his chosen profession versus hers (and hers is what paid for his training so that they could ultimately have him at home most of the week).\n\nthis dynamic embarrasses both of them.  he feels like a dick for getting credit for playing with his kids all day, while she GETS dick for having the energy to even tousle their hair at the end of a shift.\n\nfor my part (mom here), i've spent 25 years raising a special needs child - setting aside the day to day grind of that, three years ago he also had a brain tumor, and i was the one who a) got it diagnosed; b) found the right surgeon; c) fought with insurance to get the surgery covered; d) coordinated the entire affair, from the insurance coverage to the hotel bills to be near him to taking leave to care for him after.  for six months my entire focus was taking care of my son, both pre-surgery and post, setting aside the years of prior disability.\n\nwho got the credit for visiting him ONCE in the hospital during the process?  biodad, who hadn't bothered to return his calls for the prior ten years.  \"oh, J came to visit, that's awesome!\"  most of my friends and family were blown away by his \"interest,\" while i was like, wait, what the ENTIRE FUCK.\n\nthis is not to take away from your experience - i believe this is what you're going through.  but in mine, fathers tend to get ten times the credit for doing a tenth as much, which says a LOT more about society's expectations of men than it does about anything else.  you should all feel pretty fucking  insulted, on behalf of your role/gender.\n\nso my point is, if you're experiencing all the above as a single dad...  it seems to be the nature of single parenting.  the one they expect the least of ends up with all the credit when they throw a bone and do the bare fucking minimum.",

They\u2019re in it together. It\u2019s not a single dad vs single mother things: it\u2019s about kids dealing with a trauma and needing the support of at least someone. It\u2019s a kid thing.

It's hard for both, women just receive more sympathy.\n\nWhen my parents divorced my mother insisted on my dad taking care of me and my brother half of the time, knowing otherwise we would not remain emotionally connected to him. He was a great dad, knew how to do everything and learned on how to support a teenage girl through her first years. Along with parenting he became a friend, he was providing but also taught us how to manage every day chores. \n\nMen deserve so much, they deserve the same social supports as women as fathers/men are still excluded when it comes to, for example, protecting from domestic abuse.

As a dad who was involved in their lives (going on the field trips, attending plays, sporting events), i would usually be the only dad there.  It\u2019s very isolating to do anything with your kids as a dad because there are no other dads there and the moms won\u2019t talk to you and basically ignore you the whole time which then makes your kid wonder why no one ever talks to you when you\u2019re around other adults.   Oh, they say hello. And that\u2019s about it.  It\u2019s social pressure. No one wants to be seen talking to a man because then the other moms will whisper.  \n\nLuckily I have a job where I can take the day off and do stuff with my kids whenever the had an activity going on.

You get all of the gooey cheese and condiments, the lettuce and tomato, and the bread, but you can eat it with a fork in the exact proportions you want. \n\nTheres a couple of important things to keep in mind when making it though. \n\nFirst, cook the ground sirloin (or whatever cut you prefer) and serve it up on a plate on the side. Second, toast your bun and put cheese on it to melt then cut it into cubes smaller than bite size.\n\n Next make your salad of chopped lettuce and tomato with condiments. I prefer to toss it in thousand island then drizzle yellow mustard on top. Remember it's going to be a very small salad. This is where you can go crazy with any combo you like. Jalapenos, sliced radish. I have even put capers in it. \n\nNow you can use a fork to build perfect bites of burger one by one, and if you're like me, not get it in your damned mustache and beard.",

For example, Burger King has a line of patties literally called \"The Stacker\" and the biggest you can get is a triple.

            "I got rid of all of my social media (except for Reddit) a couple of weeks ago. It was one of the best decisions I could\u2019ve made for my mental health.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize how much it was messing with my head until it was gone. I was constantly obsessed with buying new clothes to flaunt for social outings on the \u2018gram. Obsessively made sure to document every \u201ccool\u201d social thing I was doing in my insta stories (at least in the before times). I started to get insanely jealous and feel FOMO watching my friends constantly hang out without me in recent months on their Instagram stories. (Yes, everyone was getting tested, hanging out outdoors in groups less than 8, and wearing masks). I would get upset when I would respond to something on an insta story or talk in a groupchat and no one would respond to me. I would obsessively scroll through Facebook and Instagram just stalking random photos and comparing myself/my life and feeling like I could never measure. Plus all the political stances that overtook people\u2019s instagrams which didn\u2019t really allow for discussion/discourse like Reddit\u2014it was just people (both sides of the coin) posting shaming, holier-than-thou memes and statuses about anything that reinforced their beliefs. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the past few months of the pandemic when I\u2019ve been at one of my all-time lows and feeling the saddest I\u2019d ever felt, and someone remarked that that was hard to believe since my life looked so perfect on social media. \n\nIt\u2019s been gone for 3 weeks now and I can\u2019t stress how awesome it\u2019s been. I no longer give AF about rewearing the same outfit. I don\u2019t spend hours scrolling and comparing myself/my life. I don\u2019t feel hurt/FOMO with my friends and I don\u2019t feel enraged at political memes that are the opposite of my viewpoints. I\u2019ve been able to read more, truly engage with the few people I interact with both in person (safely of course) and virtually, and focus on getting out of my all-time low. \n\nI\u2019ve realized that most people are literally only concerned with themselves and how they appear on their social media (like I was), and to not take anything so personally/make it about me. (Case in point: two of my closest friends only learned yesterday that my social media has been gone for weeks.) This is also a *duh*, but it also made me realize/remember just how trivial all of that stuff is and how much more there is to life than trying to virtually curate yours to appear perfect. \n\nTLDR; I was one of the people using social media for mentally unhealthy reasons, got rid of it all except for Reddit and it\u2019s been life changing.",

That is of course until something affects them. Once that happens the numb clout chasers make such a big deal out of it for so long. \nFor instance a private school in my area that received stimulus money went to low income housing to ask for money to help during the epidemic. There is not a single person in those apartments that could afford to send their child there for school yet they target the poor to help them because they have more empathy than the people who can pay.

The problem is in the business model, where mysterious third parties are the ones that finance this connection through buying ads that, when integrated with algorithms, manipulate people in very subtle ways--not usually in outright evil ways (though perhaps sometimes). The negative aspects you point out are byproducts of the way algorithms interact with human nature, psychology, and the brain.

            "As someone with depression I avoid disclosing that fact to friends, family, employers, etc., I don't want special treatment, I don't want sympathy, and I especially don't want reminders of any kind. I had to disclose it to an employer once because I had started new medication and it was making me extremely groggy in the morning - enough so that they took notice and asked me what was going on.  \n\n\nI seriously regret disclosing my depression to my employer because I believe they (either consciously or otherwise) pursued my removal from the job from that point forward. Office politics suddenly centered around anything and everything they could pin me with. I don't work there anymore thankfully and I'm happy at my current job, but my point is I don't think OP understands the lengths people with mental illnesses or mental disorders go to to avoid special treatment.  \n\n\nReason being - I know enough people with depression, anxiety disorders, etc., etc., and the ones who seek protection become socially isolated from much of mainstream life and the ones who don't seek protection are able to live life (mostly) the same way everyone else does. Employers specifically are not supposed to discriminate against people with mental illnesses or mental disorders but if it's disclosed they will often discriminate anyways and justify it another way. That's why we are supposed to be protected. Anyways...we're not protected, the protections aren't at all effective, so either you seek protection and get maltreated or you keep quiet about it and let people think you fit the definition of being \"just like everyone else\" so that you can have a mostly normal life.",

They say 'you're overthinking it', 'you're worrying too much', 'you're too sensitive'.

When I finally broke, he threatened to stab himself with a bread knife that was sitting on the counter and said I was a cruel b\\*\\*\\*\\* for dumping a dude who struggled with a mental disorder.\n\nHe was never held responsible for any of his actions, ever. Not even the bruises from consistently grabbing me and dragging me to a corner to lecture me.

When people would also say something bad or do sth insensitive, it would get into me hardcore, but it's truly not something to be taken against. I would admire a bit of sensitivity myself.

So just be carful who you complain about these things to because that could be making them shield themselves more and not wanna \"burden\" people with their feelings or issues. When in actuality telling people that you have those problems usually does the opposite and helps them understand you and gives you time to change those behaviors and open up to people.

Source first: I suffer from PTSD.\n\nOn the one hand, yes, you are (presumably) an adult that should be able to take care of yourself, and this entails managing your mental illness or condition without expecting anyone else to do it for you - that's not to say that you shouldn't expect genuine support and caring, but you definitely should not be trolling for sympathy and for others to expect less of you.\n\nOn the other hand, you have a responsibility to be open to people such as employers or supervisors if you're struggling and either failing to perform, or feel that your mental health is degrading and this may impact your work.\n\nI should have done this, recently, as I slipped into a serious depression following going to full time teleworking and becoming almost absolutely isolated, on top of some injuries and personal upsets. For myself, dealing with PTSD, this sort of deep depression actually compounds preexisting issues such as extreme anxiety and avoidance instincts, which you can imagine aren't great qualities in a high stress job like mine.\n\nIf I had been open about my mental health from the beginning, my team could have supported me, and we would have gotten through it. Instead, I worried they'd see me as weak or unable, or replaceable. So I fell behind and made the team look bad. Now, ironically, I probably look more like having all those qualities I had wished to not be perceived as having at all, and everyone is impacted in at least some small way by my inability to just communicate honestly.\n\nNobody wants to hear that they will suddenly have to pick up someone else's work during an already difficult time, but so many people would have been better off if that had happened.

I ended up snapping and blocked her on everything I couldn\u2019t deal with the negativity anymore. \n\nThis is what I believe OP is on about more with their post of that people think they deserve to be treated better under any circumstances because they have a mental illness, which isn\u2019t the case.

You can't use PTSD as an excuse to murder someone and still get away with no consequences so I really hate when people use mental illness like it is a crutch. It is also just my personality.

I don't want anyone to bend over backwards for me and I definitely don't like using it to get attention. Keeping it bottled up would be detrimental. The healing process is long and hard and for some it never ends. I've lost some freinds just for telling them I have these illnesses.

Between my friends and myself, we all struggled a LOT and we weren't always successful at keeping our struggles from hurting others, but we tried, and we learned from our mistakes, and most of us are actually doing pretty well at this point so I have little patience with people who try and play the \"mental illness card\" as a reason why people should let them do whatever they want with no repercussions. The \"if you don't do ________ I'm going to kill myself and it'll be your fault\" card is particularly infuriating after all the friends I've had who battled suicidal thoughts for years and managed to win that fight (for now). \n\nFuck excuses.

            "Based on my own experience, I think the perception that we want to be catered to is felt by other individuals, but it does not necessarily come from our own expectation for special treatment. People with neurological disorders have to grow/learn/work/live in a world where all of society was built before there was much scientific knowledge of mental health disorders. Most of us just need a flexible work schedule, meds we can afford, and mental healthcare that doesn\u2019t require endless insurance-related hoops to jump through. \n\nThe biggest interpersonal issue that I\u2019ve experienced with other individuals, is that my symptoms are perceived as intentional behavior. That frequently leads to conflict and/or resentment that I may not even be aware of because I\u2019m just trying to get through each day. \n\nTo use an extreme analogy, nobody would complain that a person who uses a wheelchair just sits around all day, or that a person with diabetes should just produce more insulin.

            "They're welcome to come take my organs now for all I care",

Normally, everyone is assumed to be a donor by default unless the family or next of kin refuses.

If I can save someone in death, that's cool.",
            "Medical student currently on transplant surgery here. Just to shed a little light on a few logistical details: \n\n1. The transplant evaluation process for each organ is obviously quite involved, and while its mainly infectious diseases and target organ damage that absolutely rule someone out as an organ donor, there are often other issues at play. The kind of patients with the often chronic disease processes requiring organ transplantation will often have comorbid damage to other organs, or will not be healthy enough that they could be eligible as organ donors. So, for example, someone who's required a kidney transplant previously will likely never be healthy enough to be a living or cadeveric liver donor in the future. However, even people with major organ damage can often donate their corneas, skin, etc. \n\n2. The ethnical issues of donation and care are something that transplant surgeons and all medical professionals should take very seriously. To that end, in the US at least the transplant surgery team cannot be involved in the care of a potential donor prior to a declaration of brain death. Once again, the exam to determine brain death (and therefore, legal death) must be performed by an MD who does not have a stake in the transplant process (not the transplant surgeon, not taking care of the potential recipient, etc). Obviously it's not perfect, but these systems help to ensure that we are treating our patients according to the standard of care until their dying moment. \n\nFinally, kind of a duh, but I cannot emphasize enough the good that is done by an organ donation. It's truly remarkable- you put an organ into a critically ill patient, and *bam*, things are often instantly better. My patient today hadn't made urine in 8 years due to chronic kidney disease; 10 minutes after we put in the donor kidney, he was making urine and on the road to filtering appropriately without the need for dialysis! If you have any questions about the transplant process or organ donation (or the \"donate your body to science\" side of things) I'm glad to answer any questions I can!",

And if the rules were that these people weren't allowed to receive one, then it would just go to waste, or be used for medical research (but better to save a life than do research I reckon).\n\nIt makes sense to prioritising those people for an organ transplant who are willing to donate an organ seeing as it's donated organs that provide the resource in the first place.  And by prioritising organ donors for transplants, non-organ donors are naturally pushed down the waiting list anyway, but not prohibited from receiving one.",

If we start giving treatment upon the fact if someone is a good or bad person the world would be a much worser place.

That makes it valuable.\n\nIt can be as simple as \"cup half full\" vs \"cup half empty\". Perception is everything, especially when you're dealing with laymen such as in the public sphere.

This is an empirical, factual question. It can be answered by experiment and scientific inquiry. It has a correct answer.\n\n2. Assuming the earth is warming, how much of that warming is due to human activity, as opposed to natural fluctuations and normal geological events? This is also a scientific question, although it\u2019s less straightforwardly empirical than 1. I\u2019m not sure if it can be 100% proven, but science can give us a lot of good input in determining the likely answer to this. \n\n3. What should be done about it? This question is not scientific in the least. It\u2019s a matter of trade offs between competing interests, and thus it is inherently political. Science can help us understand what the trade offs are likely to be, but it cannot tell us whether those trade offs are *worth it* to us. It is overwhelmingly likely that people will disagree over whether any given proposal is worth its costs. \n\nPersonally, I get frustrated when people on the left assume that disagreement over 3 necessarily means disagreement over 1 and 2. I also get frustrated when people on the right seem to think that they have to deny 1 and 2 in order to object to proposals for 3.\n\nThe more people conflate these two scientific questions with this third purely political question and pretend that the whole shebang is \u201caffirming/denying science,\u201d the more this turns into kulturkampf instead of a useful discussion.",

            "Science in general is facing this problem, regardless of policy or politics. In some topics the science community sometimes pre-decides that a hypothesis is true or is likely to be true, and trick data in an \"acceptable way\" towards that hypothesis. I believe this is a consequence of \"if I produce no results I get no funding\". In science, getting no results after a long procedure is normal and useful knowledge of what doesn't work or why, but no one wants to pay for no results.\n\nI have met many simple minded scientists in high positions, with one track minds towards not only a specific hypothesis but a specific outcome, sceptical of other possibilities for no argued reason. For example with dietary therapy approaches to certain diseases, a lot of scientists look at that with disapproval, even when they have been stablished for certain diseases for years.

            ">Climate  Change being considered a Politics topic instead of a Science topi\u00e7 is  part of the problem and helps sabotage any discussions on it\n\nThe problem is that politics has invaded the scientific world since they've found it's an easy way to fundraise and the politicians feel more validated in their policies.  Scientists like it because they receive funding from it.  Scientists will publish papers trying to get attention from politicians or research firms that push agendas for politicians.  They do this also for media attention.  The more attention you get, the higher the odds that you get some funding from someone.\n\nThe scientific method has been left behind in the dust.  They no longer favor correct practices, accuracy, and truth - they favor sensationalism and originality.  Some areas of science are finding up to 80% of the published literature is just wrong.  It's become a pop-culture entertainment industry and politics is to largely to blame.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that climate change is an extremely complex topic.  Even the experts in the field have wild disagreements on the very basics and they all can't be right.  So if you think a pencil-pushing politician from Washington, who has spent his life smiling in front of a camera, has the brain-power to understand these issues, then I've ocean front property to sell you.  Some of the world's greatest minds can't grasp it so they build complex computer models that still fall short.  There is no way politicians understand this topic.  They only care about it for its ability to fundraise and to push political agendas and nothing else.\n\nThis is why it's become a political issue.  Politicians abuse it for their own agendas and scientists are OK with that because the politicians give them kick-backs as long as they churn out material the politicians can use.  It's destroying the credibility of the scientific institutions.",

Science might be the key to understanding climate change but its cultural and political change that will solve it.\n\nOf course as it is an issue politics and culture it is also hamstrung by the same divisions in those spaces as other policy issues.

            "Couple of problems with climate change as a political thing.\n\nFirst, the models are always wrong. They're always like \"if things continue like they are, we'll be underwater by 2025\". That never becomes true because the inputs are always changing. These predictions of catastrophe have been happening for decades, and never come to fruition, which damages the credibility of those putting them forward. Doesn't mean there isn't climate change, just that overzealous catastrophic predictions are poor practice.\n\nSecond, environmentalists put the environment first. Climate change is an energy problem. In order for civilization to continue, let alone advance, we need to use more energy, and to find ways to produce exponentially increasing amounts of energy. Before we do anything to deprecate existing energy infrastructure, we need to make sure whatever we're replacing it can meet the energy needs of the population it serves. \n\nTo combine the two, you get climate advocates saying shit like \"stop having children\" or \"stop eating meat\", without understanding that those things are unacceptable burdens to place on people. I think climate has to be a concern, but this concern cannot supercede our energy needs, nor can it diminish our quality of life.\n\nSo I'd say it's only political because of the widespread ramifications of radical climate policy, and the inability of environmentalists to adapt their climate-first ideology to palatable change. It's perfectly understandable. If you *literally* think the world is going to end in a few years, it makes some pretty intense proposals sound like the only option. I don't think most people think the world is going to end in a few years, so policy derived from that assumption becomes unpalatable.",

It's a goal that we have to trust politicians to hit.  If they fail, they can say we didn't act soon enough, or we didn't have enough funds...  Now I personally have been ranting about the health of the Ocean for a long time.  The ocean is responsible for about 80% of the world's oxygen, and we're destroying it without a second thought.  The Pacific Garbage Patch keeps growing, and we keep ignoring it.  There are 10 rivers in the world that are responsible for putting 90% of the plastics/garbage into the oceans.  Now if we funded cleaning up those rivers, and creating sustainable practices in those areas we could demand to see the results.  If we funded cleaning up the Pacific Garbage Island, we could pull up sattelite images and confirm it's shrinking.  I don't think it's a coincidence that as we keep killing the oceans, the CO2 keeps rising.  A healthy ocean would help offset a tremendous amount of the carbon that politicians want to spend trillions on.  \n\n\nOnly politicians can convince you to trust them to clean up the air while telling you to ignore the garbage on the ground.  Only a politician can create a scenario where no matter what happens, they can't be considered failures.  We have issues, but politicans are the least qualified on earth to fix the problems.

The same report places the average sale price for June 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. \n\nA gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in June 2014, when adjusted for inflation.

The data shows that Millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. \n\nFor years now, when Boomers have told us, \"you're lazy and entitled\" and we need to \"just work harder\", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. \n\nWe learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind.

            "1. \"Better educated\" is a useless metric. Having a PhD in Greco-Roman History is a niche degree within a niche field. Not everyone can make a six-figure salary in their field of choice. Some jobs are just going to pay more than others due to supply, demand, risk, etc.\n\n2. Cost of college has risen *despite* additional government subsidies. Most of the additional funding has gone towards administrators rather than classes, supplies, professors, or other necessary components. Eliminate redundant positions and end governed guaranteed loans and costs will come back down. Not everyone is cut out for college, anyway.\n\n3. The cited article doesn't say what you claim it does. Most people outside the \"millennial\" generation didn't live alone when they were the same ages as millennials, so dismissing roommates or living at home is disingenuous.\n\n4. Again, not everyone is cut out for college. No one other than the person who signed up for the debt is responsible for the debt, period. If someone fails to understand the implications of pursuing a certain degree, including the financial ramifications, then they probably weren't cut out for college in the first place. You're not owed a home and a lucrative job just beside you managed to maintain a 1.5 GPA for 18 months.\n\n5. Cost of living is another terrible metric to use when comparing pricing. \"Purchasing power\" is a much better metric. For example, in 1994 a decent (not top of the line) laptop with a CD-ROM drive would cost you *$12,000* when adjusted for inflation. An equivalent computer can be picked up at Walmart for $500 today. The same goes for any product. The average home size in 1960 was about 1,000 sq ft. Today it's about 3000 sq ft. A home may cost twice as much when adjusted for inflation but you're getting 3X the space, plus amenities that didn't even exist for the average person in 1970 like central heat/air.\n\nThis was a well put together post, but it misses the mark several times.

I (Gen X) learned from them. \n\nI work with many people who blew way too much on degrees that never really taught them an actual skill (Is 'businessing' a skill?). Too many people now think they need a masters or more since they pop out of college and still have no skills that they could hit the ground running with. They also have ZERO actual job experience since most thought grades were more important than knowing how to manage time and money.\n\nYes, you do need to work harder. Yes, expect to have to work your way up. Yes, things were just as shitty when we had to enter the workforce and fend for ourselves. \n\nI've had a job since age 9 (paper route), and have never been unemployed or fired ever since. If I wanted things when I was young, I pretty much had to pay for it. Payed off my student loans, never had to live at home after leaving for college, but believe me I usually had more than 1 job at a time on top of trying to study.\n\nOne last thing.... how do you 'struggle more'? Shit is automated, 99% of everything you need is online.",

            "> For example, the Bureau of Census reports that the average price of a new home in June 1998 was $175,900. According to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. The same report places the average sale price for June 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone.\n\nYou need to do more research, because you're not comparing apples to apples with statistics like this.

The main factor here at play in my opinion is population growth (that's why it's called baby-boom) and is that the fault of these people if they were born ? Of course gas is more expensive when you have more cars, of course the economic growth was huge right after the war and now it's not keeping up, more educated people means more competition (especially with globalization) so the wages are lower compared at the time.\n\nThe main valid argument in my opinion is the ecological aspect of things, how the planet got ruined by people who were over consumming for some reason but then again, we are still doing it now, and it's not like people are stopping even though we have the tools to raise awareness now that people didn't have before.\n\nSo yeah, apart from being pissed at someone who says you're lazy when you're not (which btw could be anyone of any age, and you should not listen to these people cause you don't have to prove to everyone that you are hard-working) I don't like your ideas",

However, I think it's fair to say that most of the rhetoric regarding women needing to feel safe is in regard to sexual assault.

Traveling alone in the dark in a city or the country usually isn't a good idea - regardless of gender, size, physical ability or current weaponry.   Listening to your instincts is important as well.  If every nerve in your body screams don't go down that alley or don't take the short cut through the woods, LISTEN to those instincts.\n\nI honestly don't think we will ever get to the point when everywhere in a city is safe.  Not without suppressing free will or arrest people for thought crimes.  There will always be a small percentage of people that prefer to be predators.   Striving for safer city streets is a goal we should still work toward.  It's not futile, but to be realistic we are working towards a reduction, not eradication.",

            "Absolutely, and as a fellow Australian, I assume you've seen The Project segment about this.\n\n\"Instead of telling our women to be careful, how about telling our men not to rape\" sounds lovely, but a genuine violent rapist isn't going to listen to anyone just asking him nicely to not rape women.\n\nIf you actually care about protecting women, then telling them to be careful and safe is nothing less than sensible advice.\n\nI shouldn't have to lock my car, right? Why don't we just tell people not to steal cars?",
            "I don\u2019t think that the opinion is that no one should be careful. Rather, when you hear the phrase \u201c shouldn\u2019t have to fear walking at night\u201d, this is a misguided lashing out at victim blaming. If a guy is mugged at night, I garuntee no one will say to that man \u201chey maybe you wouldn\u2019t have gotten mugged if you stayed in\u201d, they will feel sympathy for him because he is a victim REGARDLESS if he stayed out late or not. However with a woman getting raped you always hear victim blaming, I.e \u201cwell she wouldn\u2019t have gotten raped if she hadn\u2019t been alone\u201d, or \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t have gotten raped is she had stayed home and not partied\u201d this is what the responses usually means. Of course everyone should be vigilant and try to stay safe but at the same time it is ultimately the sole fault of the person who commits the crime not the victim for walking home late one night. That\u2019s like saying being raped or mugged is a justifiable crime punishment committed on you because you made one mistake and walked home alone. This is why victims of both blame themselves for years. This isn\u2019t an unpopular opinion- people victim blame all the time already on both sides.\n\nEDIT: people have pointed out that they were victims of mugging and shamed too, so I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. You didn\u2019t deserve that and I wasn\u2019t trying to imply that they did. I\u2019m saying regardless if it\u2019s a man or woman no one deserves to be raped or mugged because they walked alone one night, but you will hear it used in victim blaming in both cases for both genders. Victim blaming is wrong and misses the whole picture. The perp is the only offender. The person may have been safe staying inside but we can\u2019t live our whole life\u2019s in fear.",
            "I agree that the fear and wariness comes as a result of natural survival instinct.\n\n\n\nBut I think that while walking alone at night on a sketchy, deserted streed, men might see the possibility of being robbed/physically assaulted more than that of being sexually molested/raped.\n\n\nI (a female) am usually on my toes out of the fear of being raped/molested. It'd honestly be somewhat of a relief if I was just robbed instead.\n\n\nI'm not saying that men aren't subjected to/afraid of being raped or molested. It's just that, statistically speaking, we **know** women get raped and molested more than men do. It plays a role in how other women and men think.",
            "I took an intro to communications class and there was this whole video on fear. It talked about how violence on TV doesn\u2019t make us more violent but more afraid.

All I\u2019m gonna say is what my family has always told me know where you are, I have family on the north and south side of Chicago and both sides of the family are originally from the south side.

            "Last year I ended up driving a girl home once because she was plastered, in heels and without any sort of protection, and was planning to walk several miles back to her place at 2AM. She was completely wasted. Part of her walk was past an unlit part of a road that passed a couple gas stations and an equally unlit park, both known for being a little sketchy. We lived in a particularly safe town, but robberies and rapes still happen.  It completely astounded me that her friends let her go walking from the party they were at like it wasn't a huge issue. Even if they didn't know she was going to walk home, they absolutely knew she was leaving alone in the dark. Friends don't let drunk friends do this. I think the only reason she trusted me to give her a ride is because I'm a woman. Sometimes I think about her and it frightens me.",

            "Yes, we should all be careful at night. But please keep in mind that women are statistically more likely to 1. be raped and 2. less likely to be able to fight off their aggressor.

We're taught to be wary of strange men, to not leave our drinks unattended, to not meet men in strange locations. Our lives are built around doing all we can to minimize the risk of being sexually assaulted. I know that if I go walking alone at night and actually do get raped, people are going to ask me why I dared to exist in public at night as a woman. Even if the likelihood of it happening is very slim (most sexual assault happens in the home or with people who are not strangers), I know that the consequences are going to be horrific. Not only will I have been the victim of a violent sexual crime against my body, but I will also probably not get the help I need to overcome the crime. My actions, choices, clothes, and judgement will be called into question. That's pretty horrible. Men don't have to deal with that. If they get attacked at night (even though it's more likely that a woman getting sexually assaulted), they just have to deal with that in isolation. The police will probably believe him and they certainly won't ask him what he was wearing. He won't get the nagging feeling that he was at fault for walking alone at night. That's not to say that male fear of assault is \"mollified\" by knowing that the police will take them seriously, rather that along with the normal fear of being assaulted, women also have to deal with knowing that not everyone will believe them or think that they are innocent victims. Women also have to deal with the people who are victim-blaming.",

In the civilization we all (hopefully) wish for, we should be able to assume that we are safe.

Because you are negating everything we have achieved on a social level so far by advocating that society as such doesn't work and we should go back to survival of the fittest. Advocating that everybody should feel unsafe will, in fact, make the world a much more unsafe place.\n\nWhat you could say is: \"Relative safety is no guarantee for absolute safety and safety is not a replacement for common sense.\" That would work for me.\n\nBut if you go out and say: \"No matter what, be afraid, be very afraid\" will lead to people assuming the worst, always.

            "You're right that feelings of vulnerability stem from natural instinct, but I also think you're missing the point. It's important to consider *why* different groups of people feel vulnerable so that we can use these fears to identify actual causes of systemic injustice that exist outside of this specific scenario. People will always feel vulnerable in uncomfortable situations, but the reasons they feel uncomfortable are often vastly different.\n\nAs an example, consider and compare the following statements:\n\n* Women are often scared of being attacked at night while alone; they feel vulnerable.\n* Men are often scared of being attacked at night while alone; they feel vulnerable.\n* The Eldery are often scared of being attacked at night while alone; they feel vulnerable.\n* The Disabled are often scared of being attacked at night while alone; they feel vulnerable.\n* The Wealthy are often scared of being attacked at night while alone; they feel vulnerable.\n* Racial minorities are often scared of being attacked at night while alone; they feel vulnerable.\n\nI'm not going to preach and explain why each of these are different, as I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but I think we should at least try to acknowledge that each of these groups experience feelings of vulnerability as a consequence of something that is mostly exclusive to their group or class. While the gap between women and men's vulnerability may feel slim, the difference between other groups does not. That suggests that there is some difference of causation outside of base survival instincts, and by identifying *why* this difference exists we can better address systemic issues that continue to pit classes against one another.",

It must be because educated women scare them.\" They always come to the same, obtuse, and illogical conclusions. \"Men are just stupid/lazy/useless/onerous in some way, I guess. Women are better anyways.\"\n\nYoung men are dropping out because they are treated by society like actual, literal disposable objects. That's the real reason.\n\nEdit: To everyone asking me in the comments why women should be responsible for helping men, this is the reason: Feminism by its literal definition is about fostering gender equality. If men are disproportionately negatively affected by things like homelessness, violence, a lack of education, and presumptions of criminality, then these are inherently feminist issues.

Talk about \u201cinternalized misandry\u201d instead, maybe?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the \u201cit\u2019s all men\u2019s fault, because patriarchy\u201d excuse, as if women don\u2019t birth and raise our men, as if women don\u2019t have any say over how our society operates, or over how both men and women behave. \n\nWomen set the moral standards of society. I am shocked that some women insist on warping history to paint women as some imprisoned, powerless subjugated class (which is what you would have to view women as, if you were to believe in the core ideals of feminism wholeheartedly) in order to absolve themselves of any responsibility. It is the biggest sham any demographic has played on society to demand extra rights and even privileges without responsibility. \n\nWomen are not a special interest group. They aren\u2019t even a statistical minority. White women are some of the most protected, pampered, well-treated, and privileged people in society, *safely* above white men. They need to stop laser-focusing on how many female politicians and scientists there are, and start looking at the fact that they are almost completely protected from neglect, from becoming the dregs of society, and are almost always protected from the most violent and ugly parts of life in the west, because of men. And because our society cares so much about \u201cwomen and children\u201d.\n\nWhat happened was, feminists saw that \u201cprotected\u201d status as infantilizing and oppressive, and are now operating in a world where that dynamic isn\u2019t needed anyways. And in a world where men protect them much less. So with chivalry largely removed from the picture, they\u2019re now forced into a world that they realize they can\u2019t handle, so they complain and antagonize men for it, exploiting old concepts of chivalry and the human tendency to feel emotionally more affected by a woman\u2019s pain than a man\u2019s, to deliver so much in favor of women, that they become a privileged class. Which is what they have made themselves.",

The leader of this group mocked another parent, who was a stay at home dad, behind his back and insinuated that his wife \u201cwasn\u2019t a real mom\u201d because she worked and he didn\u2019t. Never brought my son back to the group after that experience. \n\nAwhile ago, I was in line at the grocery store and saw a man with his small child shopping and minding his own business one afternoon (midday). When he was checking out, an older woman behind him made a snide comment about how he should be at work at 2pm on a Tuesday, not the grocery store. \n\nI\u2019ve seen several examples of this since becoming a parent. It seems like if a father (primarily one who does not work and is home with the children) does anything with his kids, it\u2019s often belittled and brushed off, because apparently men aren\u2019t supposed to be good dads.

Women have support systems for their depression, they have systems in place and people are much more prone to be sympathetic to women and don't want to see a woman suffering, people want to help and show they are not alone.\n\n\nBut for men we are alone, partially because of the traditional view that men cannot show weakness, but the biggest reason is no one cares. People don't just not care they distance themselves from you. Men and women will just walk away or show a miniscule amount of compassion. Men know that expressing our depression or darker thoughts is a terrible idea because it will make matters worse, not better. \n\n\nThere is this modern trend that traditional gender roles cause men not to talk about this, I think that's a small component of the reason, but its because most of us know if we come forward with our issues, the people around us and society at large will largely shun us. Therefore we bottle it in and deal with it by ourselves, not because we are afraid of not looking like \"real men\" but because we know we are alone in this struggle and if we open up we will lose so, so much.",

            "As a guy living with depression for 15 years the following has been my experiences and understanding of my mind state in this regard.\n\nIt seems more likely that the depressed mindset has convinced the individual that no one cares. It is also possible that many people associated with said individual are unaware of their mental state. \n\nBeyond this, most people have to much shit of their own to deal with and the thought of supporting other mentality distressed individuals may seem overwhelming. Especially if these people are also mentality distressed.\n\nFurthermore the thought of burdening another person with one's own mental issues may cause the individual additional stress and worry. It then simply becomes easier to suffer in silence.\n\nWithout support however this distress could lead to an overwhelming sense of apathy, hence the not giving a fuck. \n\nAnd finally, yes a good number of people are just flat out assholes. \n\nSometimes you just gotta trudge along.",

To add to this,  there will also be people who pretend to care but really don't,  rather jus just pandering to you because they want to be seen as a good person. \nCase in point,  there was a girl in my class who, after it got out that i had a failed suicide attempt,  started trying to act nice to me, but it really just felt more like she was coddling a child than actually being supportive. I first thought that she genuinely wanted to help and just didn't know how,  but then i noticed that she was like this only in large crowds,  but when i would come up to talk to her, not even about my problems but just as classmates,  i wouldn't get much more than a \"fuck off\"\n\nTL;DR people don't care",

However there are little things creeping up like what you\u2019ve brought up. \n\nAnother is now that I hear so many women complaining about men not approaching them anymore. First of all, if you want equality then that involves women approaching men too. Maybe there\u2019s a side to that I don\u2019t understand. Men in society now are subliminally taught to never approach a girl lest he be viewed as a creep or domineering. There\u2019s a double standard where men can\u2019t talk about how attractive women are but women can talk all they want about men. Any complaints that men aren\u2019t living up to their perceived standards is probably a result of the feminist movement shooting itself in the foot. \n\nLike I said, men still have it pretty great but it\u2019s getting to be really confusing to try and figure out what society wants out of us haha",

Having the mindset that other people have it worse and got through it, or that I'm replaceable, or that I'm not worthy of seeking help because I'm doing what's expected of me stopped me from seeking help until I was admitted to a psych ward for suicidal ideations. \n\nAnd that was the best thing that's happened to me. The support, genuine support, I've received from my chain of command, which includes old, been-in-most-of-thier-lives, type of officers made things so much easier and manageable and now I unashamedly admit where I was in life and encourage others to do the same.

In all that time I've never been ridiculed or made to feel inferior. I've had people who distanced themselves because they didn't know what to do or how to help, but other than that my parents, partner, doctors, hospitals  and especially my work have been great - work paid for me to visit a psychiatrist and provided psychologists. Doctors are also able to give your a referral to a psychologist for sessiins paid for by Medicare. Also at the moment there seems to be a real movement about supporting men with depression, a number of high profile celebrities and sportsmen have openly said 'I have mental health issues and are stepping away for a while to seek help' so there's a definite shift in attitudes happening.

            "I wouldn't agree that that is the right way to think of it. It's like saying that kids shouldn't read books because some books are not the correct content.\n\nWhat I would agree with would be more specific. Certain material should be off limits which can be done quite easily with certain programs or firewalls etc. K9 web protection is maybe a good example.\n\nI get what you are saying though.\n\nBut I don't agree with cutting off their ability to watch Netflix (internet) maybe even Google cookie recipes (internet) say they like playing fireboy and watergirl (internet).",
            "Children should just be monitored by their parents. It's really that simple. There are many tools at a parents disposal to monitor child usage of a computer and of a web browser. If the parents are doing their job then the child won't have access to anything detrimental to their psyche.

            "The innocence of 12 year olds? Everyone in my class knew everything about \"bad words\" and porn when we were 10 years old. EDIT: No, we didn't have common internet access. Internet wasn't mainstream yet, and anyone (me) that used a computer was a super nerd. We also didn't have smartphones. Also also, this was in a private school. One kid just learns about those things somehow and share it with everyone, simple as that, internet just facilitates that, but it happens nonetheless. Oh, and also, the first porn I watched was from cable TV, not from the internet. EDIT 2: Ohh, and one last thing the guy below mentioned: knowing about porn, bad wors, seeing violent movies, none of those things change a kids personality, it's just the real world. Everything boils down to parenting, do a good job, your kid turns out well. My brother made more than 90% of my country population when he was 21, and I passed a test for free public college first try without even studying, thanks to my parents letting me play games that helped me to develop my brain. Also learned english thanks to games, I always had a better english than 95% of my class even though I never took any private classes, and I always knew more than the teacher was teaching us in english classes.",
            "I would\u2019ve agreed with this 15 years ago when the internet was much newer. But nowadays a lot of schools are even use the internet for learning and teaching.

Obviously they shouldn\u2019t be looking at porn or something like that, but censoring the entire internet is a definite overreaction. Shitty things happen in the world and it\u2019s important they\u2019re aware of these things. Innocence really isn\u2019t a positive trait and as it\u2019s important that a child learns that the world isn\u2019t perfect. As far as influencers go; an occasional check at the subscriptions of your child will do fine. Just watch like 5 minutes of the personality, get a feel for how down to earth they are, then make your decision from there.",

Some may go to the wrong place, some may not.  \nThe best you can do is to set rules and explain why you set them. Most adults who were born (way) before the Internet dont get how it works properly. But most people who were born with it have/will have children. They may explain to them how to deal with it.\n\n(if their history is full of innocent stuff, beware)",

They will absolutely find a way to get past all of your locks and firewalls and look up porn and the like before ten years old.

Once they access it, they will start searching things for which it was banned, ultimately finding them. This is a case where the curiosity gets the better of them.

            "One of my 10 year old\u2019s best friends lives 2000 miles away. They met playing Minecraft and talk over discord or on the phone every day. My daughter\u2019s only other really close friend goes to her own school but lives a 30 minute drive away. All three of them regularly get online to play games together and chat audibly or over text for hours. \n\nI have no problem with this. \n\nAll technology has a potential to be dangerous.

My innocence was much more destroyed by real life such as public school and walking in on my parents having sex at age 6 than anything on the internet by far. I think parents should just be monitoring what their children are doing on the internet and how that exposure affects them. Some kids can play video games and be online all day from a young age (me) and be just fine while others do it and become obsessed to the point of development/social delay. Parents should be more responsible and competent to what they are exposing their kids to.",

What we should do is monitor our children, it is just that simple.",
            "I think kids under the age of 12 shouldn't be allowed on the internet without supervision and moderation. The internet is great for learning new things, a lot of good can come out of it, but kids should be monitored on the web. Kids WILL come across things they shouldn't. I know I have when I was a kid in the 2000s. Not to mention using computers/phones too much, I know it's kind of a common thing for adults to complain about but it's true, it can contribute to not only obesity, but depression and anxiety too.",

            "Internet can be used to learn so much valuable information, so I do think that kids should be able to access the internet.  However parents these days need to do a much better job of monitoring and filtering a kid's internet  use.  I teach middle grade students and it is appalling to see the amount of kids who have had their innocence destroyed and their minds utterly poisoned by things they are exposed to on the internet.  It is a disgrace and will wreck the upcoming generations if we are not careful.  I've even had to deal with a student kill herself because of people an things she encountered on the internet.  It's hard enough for me, a relatively intelligent adult, to discern what is real, fake, good, and bad on the internet.let alone a young child.  Not to mention the virtual addiction this is all creating.  Watching some kids try and sit though a 10 minute mini-lesson without phone access and they exhibit symptoms similar to a withdrawl.

I looked through my 11 year old brothers search history and I\u2019m... never doing that again",
            "Upvote for how much I disagree with this.\n\n\"Loss of innocence\" isn't related to the internet, and isn't a new phenomenon concerned adults have about their kids. In the past, parents were worried about comic books, magazines, arcades and heavy metal being breeding grounds for \"loss of innocence\". There are bad role models in every age and every entertainment or educational medium. It's up to parents to limit them AND control their exposure so kids are aware of what's ahead of them and how to deal with negative influences in life.\n\nI think internet access with parental supervision and controls is both possible and beneficial, for the following reasons:\n\n1) Parents need to be aware of what's \"trendy\" so they can keep up with their children's interests and stay ahead of the game by controlling their exposure.\n\n2) Internet media literacy should be taught at a young age because the internet is how the majority of adults with access get their news and general knowledge. By learning who to trust and how to find credible sources, kids will learn to be more well informed.\n\n3) The face of education is drastically different than it was 10 years ago. When kids bring electronics into class, it is often used as an educational resource. Textbooks are cheaper and greener online, and students are expected to find the most up to date information necessary for their schoolwork. I strongly believe kids need to fine tune their research skills early, as it will be demanded of them in higher education.\n\n4) We live in a globalized world where direct face-to-face or telephone communication isn't always efficient. Email and messengers (and lessons in communication safety) allow for children to remain in contact with their family, and more importantly with public safety authorities.\n\n5) For every Jake Paul, there is a Hank Green. \n\nParents need to take responsibility to limit how much of the internet (and what!) their children access. There are hundreds of control programs that allow this.",

The internet is fantastic for the ease of access for information. In my opinion it can be the best learning tool a child could have and for this reason alone shouldn't be banned from it. \n\nPutting restrictions/time limits on your child's PC and or mobile is very effective. You can also monitor what websites they visit and ban it if you don't want them visiting it again if you deem it inappropriate. If you don't know how to do this you can use the internet to find oout.",

            "May be the exception to the rule, but my father was a super pro user way back when and I had really unrestricted access to the internet at age 5 or 6. \n\nI saw boobs a vaginas when they didn\u2019t make sense, but didn\u2019t hurt me in the long run. \n\nI did grow insanely interested in the concept of owning and having a web page. Learned html and had a website for my fellow 5th graders/6 graders with flash games and shit. It was just simple hyperlinking, but it was mine. \n\nThis fostered a type of thought I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve got otherwise. I learned to love having something available to others. It helped me be creative and build things. It inspired an analytical look at problems because my problem solving skills were built on learning how to do simple shit like make an invisible HTML table for organizing a web page. It taught me how to search for things when I wasn\u2019t familiar with the vernacular. How do you search for answers with html when you don\u2019t even know \u201ctable\u201d is a class or whatever. \n\nThis helped me learn how to teach myself at a really young age and through that I\u2019ve been able to teach myself coding, audio production, video and film production, story telling, and a ton of other useful skills that I use professionally today. \n\nand the bad shit I was tricked into seeing? (Very common in the gaming community back in the early 2000\u2019s, \u201chey kid have you seen 2girls1cup?\u201d) ended up teaching me, in a round about way, how to trust. \n\nI didn\u2019t lose my innocence. I still played outside. Internet content was less hostile back to a child back than, where as now, I agree that the Paul\u2019s may not be the best influence, but having access to the internet at a young age isn\u2019t mutually exclusive with having parents who don\u2019t parent. I still got grounded and shit for things I shouldn\u2019t have done. \n\nIt didn\u2019t rob me of a social life, though I didn\u2019t have one for a while because by middle school and high school I was so able to navigate and use the internet to my advantage that I didn\u2019t care to go to movies or hangout with people because I was learning how to use a synth in ableton. I regret it a little, but not enough to change my decisions if I had the chance. \n\nNow, I\u2019m able to do a lot of shit in my workplace others can\u2019t (or at least in my mid-level job) because I have all these years of self teaching and experimenting under my belt. It made me who I am today and I wonder if I\u2019d even be a contributing citizen today if I wasn\u2019t introduced to the internet so young. \n\nIt\u2019s truly my greatest appreciation for my parents. \n\nAlso, why so binary? No access until 12/13? Why not supervised access until then? No one should rob their kid of what is the new normal, you\u2019ll only stunt them in the future with them being the only ones unaware of what is assumed to be known. Not to mention the pop culture aspect of the internet. \n\nYour opinion is unpopular because it\u2019s just as unreasonable of an approach to your stance of \u201cinternet can be bad for kids\u201d as \u201clet 10 year olds watch porn\u201d is to \u201cinternet can be good for kids\u201d.",
            "I've bad the internet since I was right at least and have done a great job of not being a fuck. A kid can be exposed to something bad on the internet and have their parents there to help them get over it.\n\nNot an internet problem it's a parenting issue IMO",
            "The internet is the future of the world. The idea that kids should be sheltered from internet and technology (which some people actually say) is counter productive to their future livelihood. They should be exposed early and often. No argument will convince me otherwise. This is a witch hunt, like horses to cars, radio to tv.\nLet me ask you this, what world do you think they will live in? Because you parents with a supposed utopian idea of a better time (I.e what things were like when you were growing up) doesn\u2019t, and will never exist again. Stop resisting change and adapt faster, and don\u2019t force your kids to have to adapt when they could be born into it and become a \u201cnative speaker\u201d of internet and tech.",

Not teaching about one of the most important tools of modern society from an early age is a terrible idea. \nMonitor your kids use but don't ban it outright.

The person I lost my virginity to at 16 nearly broke my arm, cut up my leg and punched me in the face, he was 18, he should be in jail. I let it happen because I got exposed to shit like that and nobody talked to me about it. \n\nIf I ever have kids we\u2019ll have a family computer they can use for their homework only. No social media. If the school gives them laptops I\u2019m making sure they have the worlds strongest child safe controls ever made. They won\u2019t have smart phones either, they can have a brick phone to call me and their friends. They\u2019re not having tablets, they can have good old fashioned books. \n\nBefore you say that\u2019s cruel, my kids would have zero restrictions on how often they can see their friends and I would educate the fuck out of them. \n\nMaybe they\u2019ll grow up isolated from their friends who are all on social media? I doubt it hey, I\u2019d have no control over what they could see on the internet at a friends house but if I could control it, I would try as much as I could. \n\nI\u2019d also be cool with my kids getting piercings and changing their appearance, (not tattoos obviously but I wouldn\u2019t nut out that much if they came home with one) and if I found out they were smoking weed with their friends, I would only lose my shit if they were under 16, I\u2019d never endorse drugs to them but I\u2019d never say \u201cdrugs are the worst thing in the world, that persons a druggo\u201d etc. Alcohol I wouldn\u2019t be cool with unless they were legal age and I would be really careful about letting them see me drink. (even though I love drinking) They would also have to stay in school and if they started wagging school they\u2019d have to do a trade. They\u2019d learn to cook and do an equal amount of chores around the house. I wouldn\u2019t raise them gender neutral or anything but if they were trans and it was a consistent thing I wouldn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nI\u2019m sure some people would think that style of parenting is crazy but I\u2019m 25 and I saw the peak of MySpace and Facebook as a teenager, I saw what can happen to teenagers that have free reign to watch any porn they want and the ability to connect to any person in the world. I absolutely shudder to think of what social media will be like when I have kids and what porn will be available to them. The worst thing is, it\u2019ll be new to me, I\u2019ll have to catch up like my mum did, too late. \n\nSure, it\u2019s a great information resource but it\u2019s not really, is it? There\u2019s bullshit everywhere in the internet and there\u2019s stupid inconsequential shit also.",

I didn't negatively affect my life at all, and i've been a really happy and good child.\n\nI think that inocence in kids is a useless thing. A piece of reality is no harm to anyone. Seeing all that actually helped me taking care of my own life and not making stupid choices. I also learned a lot about drugs at an early age, and it helped me taking care of myself, because i knew the consecuences, sadly, many friends of mine didn't, and they are not with us to tell.\n\nI'm not saying kids should watch that, but if they do, i din't find it as a big problem, they'll probably see that kind of things someday, and if they don't, good for them, but i don't see it as a good thing.

All it did was make me more conscious of the world and the environment around me. And sure I watched stupid shit like pewdiepie and =3,  but I feel like it didn\u2019t do any harm.
