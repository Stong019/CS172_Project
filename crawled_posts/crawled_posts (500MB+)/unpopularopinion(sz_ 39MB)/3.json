            "Edit: for those who say it's fake or something like that especially for my example is ice cream, it shows shows how fortunate you and your clients is. In our country however, this is still the case. Just because you haven't experienced doing it doesn't mean it mush never happen to others. This example is based on my and colleagues' experiences within the country, and what majority does. While some experienced what some of you said that the food was photographed as it is, most still doesn't. Please let's not dictate what is only true or not based on only what you see and experience.\n\nThey use props in commercial and photos because in photography, for example, in ice cream, you can't photograph it for hours and still have ice cream look frozen. Remember that you need to set up lighting, angle, reflection and such after a few shots.\n\nThen there's color grading. When you capture something using camera, it won't always look like how it is in real life. For example, if you capture an image of meat, sometimes it looks pale, but sometimes it will look vibrant. But if it's painted, most of the time, the color it gives will be consistent and more close to what it looks like when served.\n\nThey instead should potray close to realistic proportions of the final product of foods they sell. Greatest example for this is burgers. We know they make it 15% bigger in menu's image to make it appealing and appetizing but when served looks like it was beaten by thugs. This is misinformation and what shouldn't be allowed.",

This is not the same as lying or false advertising.  If you advertise a bacon burger you are selling the burger, not the burger\u2019s appearance. Like using pizza as another example here: they are not selling you on how stretchy the cheese is, that just makes it look better and more appetizing and we all know it. \n\nI\u2019ve never found it any different than people dressing up and wanting to look nice for an event or really just any occasion. Sure if you went to their house everyday you\u2019d know they don\u2019t dress like that but that person was never trying to get you to believe they look like that at all times.

            "I agree that a realistic commercial would be a nice change of pace. I respected when (I think it was Dominos) did an add campaign where they encouraged users to send in pics of their actual pizza, and they admitted they needed to do better. They showed fudged up pizzas.\n\nThe thing is, you could put a legal requirement that the only show legit food that came of the production line in an actual restaurant and they would still pick the most visually attractive one. \n\nI\u2019ve seen people compare a sandwich that showed tons of one ingredient and when they looked at theirs, it barely looked to have any. They counted and found they both had the same number of this ingredient and that for the pic, they simply moved them all to the front edge, implying the rest of the sandwich had the same density. \n\nCommercials are all about implication and trickery. For instance, in my marketing class in college, I learned that you\u2019ll often see prices with 3,6,7, and 9 in them. It makes people feel like there has been time and research put into coming up with that price, where if it\u2019s a round number, they subconsciously feel like the number was thrown out there. It\u2019s why someone can look at the same item and think $36.97 is an okay price, but $40.00 is a ripoff.\n\nA commercial can imply almost anything. It\u2019s only false advertising if they say something that\u2019s untrue. That\u2019s why they have a guy in a lab coat, with a stethoscope telling you a medicine works. They never claim he\u2019s a doctor. They show underwear on attractive men and women, because they want you to associate those products with being attractive. They show people biting into food with an orgasmic look on their face.\n\nSo while honest commercial would be nice, I don\u2019t see them happening. It\u2019s up to us consumers to do the research and use our dollars to support the best product, regardless of their commercials. The industry wouldn\u2019t spend the crazy amounts of money they do on advertising if I\u2019d didn\u2019t generate massive returns. Just look at what Super Bowl ad time costs.",

            "Food stylist here, I've been in the industry for about 4 years now and have worked on everything from packaging to social media and even TVC. As far as using fake alternatives in advertising goes there are serious regulations world wide that prevent stylists faking a product for a shot. In South Africa we have regulations that force us to use no more than 15% of the image to display non-product items which generally only allows us to plate the item and add one or two garnishes. The hardest thing about this job is hearing about all the fake things we apparently do and I guess it's my responsibility to make y'all aware that we ALWAYS try our best to avoid using fakes. Having worked with ice cream we usually pre ball the scoops and keep them on dry ice (they turn out pretty solid) to make sure it can stand infront of the camera then we swap it out for a stand in (usually a balled up piece of paper towel) between shots.\nThe most fake item I've ever used was in a cider commercial where we had to achieve the perfect pour and one of the flavors required a white peach, something you cannot buy in SA and short of shipping the fruit from France the only option was to purchase a handpainted replica but again that fruit wasn't the product, the cider was.\n\nAnyway if anyone has questions feel free to ask, I don't mind answering styling questions.\n\nEDIT: Most foodstylists - not the IG food porn people - have a 4 year culinary degree that teaches you everything you will ever need to know about correctly plating and preparing food. This allows us to pair up with photographers and videographers who also have degrees to give you the best image possible.",

            "One time me and my brother were on our way to a dealership to trade in his car. I was 16 at the time, this was in 2018 in July, but I was turning 17 in September. (Important later) but we got a little lost and made a u-turn and got pulled over. There were 2 cops, one talking to my brother, asking for License, Registration, ect. The cop talking to me was asking if I had my ID. I somehow forgot it at home. He said it was fine, asked for DOB, Name and Age. I said I was 16, born Sept 11th 2001 and gave my name. He had me step out of the car and put cuffs on me because the math didn't add up. I asked what he meant and he said if I was born in 2001 I would be 17 because it's 2018. I sternly said it was July (after I had repeated the date 3 times). He made me go lean against his hood while he googled how old I would be. Came out of the car, apologized and took the cuffs off. So yeah, officers could very easily screw shit up for you.\n\nEdit: Because this blew up, they gave us their cards and we called their supervisor. Nothing happened of course.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you guys for the rewards. I am trying to make sure I respond to all the comments. Didn't expect this to get this much attention.

The only reason I got pulled over in the first place was because he heard someone yell at him to get off the phone while driving and thought it was me.\n\nI'm super thankful I've never been arrested, but every time I'm talking to a cop I'm shaking in fear lol.",

I have mostly respect for our Canadian law enforcement as long as respect has been shown back, and even when it hasn't.\n\nYet, at a recent traffic stop, I was instructed to turn off the engine, which I did immediately. The officer then told me to remove the keys from the ignition and place them on the dash, which I've not been asked to do before. I informed him that I'd like to keep my dashcam running which is only possible with the key in ignition position 1 and that the engine and all related processes are disengaged. He proceeded to tell me I can keep my cam running but keys need to be on the dash.....that I could take off any minute, and I replied I have no record, maybe one speeding ticket which he has seen already from running my plates. I just want to keep my dashcam running. He said he was going to arrest me for obstruction and tow my car, and I had my gf with me and was dropping her to work. I asked how can I keep my cam running as you said I can do but also remove power from it? He then unholstered his taser and began to radio for backup at which point I pulled the keys out and tossed them on the dash. \n\nAfter all this he said and yelled a number of abusive things, unsurprisingly, now the cam was off.",

I pulled to the shoulder for them to pass. It was a cop, they pulled me over. They got me on no insurance, no registration, said I was swerving dangerously by pulling to the shoulder. I sucked it up and didn't eat for a month but I paid my tickets. What no one told 17 year old me was that SR-22 was a ridiculous system that existed in Texas. Three years later when I was pulled over again I was informed that my license was suspended because of this and that I owed $1400 to get it unsuspended. I spent a decade driving illegally as fees compounded. Finally Texas dropped SR-22 like 2 years ago and after going to jail twice, I finally became a legal driver.

As a result cops get away with treating people like shit because they want to just ensure their own safety. \n\nI'm a white girl from a wealthy family and one of the first things my dad taught me was about cops. #1 rule is to just comply, keep hands where you can see them, but if they start asking questions to call one of my dad's friends who is a lawyer. No point in incriminating yourself unintentionally. \n\nAlso I worked as a nurse for a few years. It was crazy to see how differently I was treated when I was wearing regular clothes vs. in my scrubs. For some reason cops loved it when I wore scrubs and would treat me like a queen then be automatically rude and cold when I was wearing normal clothes. \n\nI also have a friend (also a nurse) who was in a relationship with a cop. He became physically abusive and she left him. This man got his friends to follow her car in their small town when they saw her driving around and would intentionally pull her over and claim she did stuff like roll through stop signs or speed. She eventually left the town and got out. She said that all the cops abused their wives and girlfriends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother experience:\n\nFor example my best friend (a fucking DOCTOR) was working on his car in his driveway late at night. Didn't live in the best part of town but nothing terrible by any means. Well one of his neighbors called the cops on him and told them that someone was breaking into his neighbor's car. Two cop cars come into the neighborhood. My friend has headphones on  completely unaware of his surroundings because.... he is working on HIS car at HIS house. Well the cops yank him out from under the car and hold him at gunpoint while he tries to calm them down and tell them what he is doing.

I exit with my hands up, no fuss and 2 cops run up to me and press me against my car and handcuff me. I ask what did I do and they didn't say anything. Btw I'm like 18 or 19, naive and pretty harmless (not one to argue or know when im being taken advantage of). Anyway he asks some basic questions and says he's gonna search my car. 2 other officers asks my friends to exit so they can question them while the main cop searches. After about 30 minutes he lets me and my friends go (didnt answer any of my initial questions) and that was it. I was so confused. \nOne of my friends got to talking with one of the other officers and apparently a car that fits my cars description was seen exiting that bar with someone waving a gun out the window and they thought it was me.

They absolutely refused to leave, and she began ransacking my condo again when I finally called the police.

My mom showed up to. I was young, it was messy. Most uncomfortable 5 hours of my life) \n\nOfficer shows up. Verifies I called them because these crazy people would not leave my condo. Officer asks why I felt the need to call the police? Had my gf ever threatened me, or been physical with me.

The last three checks were by the same officer. \n\nAs you can imagine, the fifth time they (and third time the SAME GUY)  asked for my license and registration, I started asking questions.

They can't be used to \"fish\" for other violations or try to catch people with warrants. This checkpoint violated almost all of them, and on my fifth stop I wanted to know what was up. \n\nI was polite, respectful, and willing to comply, but when I asked the officer my questions he was having none of it. Before I knew what was happening I was pulled out of my car and arrested for \"delaying an officer in his duties.\" Handcuffed, driven around for five hours, and finally taken to jail. \n\nLong story short, all charges were dismissed, but it cost me thousands in bail and legal fees, a total of seven full days sitting in court while the DA kicked the case down the road knowing full well they would lose, and a very lucrative position in the security biz because even an arrest, outcome notwithstanding, was enough to disqualify me. \n\nIn the end, it took years to recover from my non-criminal action. Did I have grounds for a civil suit? Sure. But what I didn't have was the time or resources, or a local attorney willing to take the case. \n\nTL;DR, asked innocent questions at was what ruled to be a blatantly illegal checkpoint, went to jail and didn't recover from the damage for nearly a decade.",

            "Having been pulled over though I committed no traffic violation, hassled, and gotten spurious traffic tickets repeatedly as a young person with a somewhat beatup car, I learned to never allow a cop car to follow me. Even if I\u2019m in a hurry, if a cop car gets in the lane behind me, I turn at the next intersection and then pull in to private property such as a parking lot. I absolutely will not have a cop car behind me for any reason, for any amount of time.

He called my phone and left me several messages that I actually still have saved. He even waited for me outside work to pull me over and try forcing me to talk again. Thankfully I took some advice to just not engage with him, but for months I still got incredibly tense to see cops just in case it was that one guy that would arrest me in the bread isle or something. Another coworker was apparently related to him and sighed and said he\u2019d talk to him, which is probably the only reason I haven\u2019t heard from him again. Wasn\u2019t a fun thing to deal with at 18, a few months into my first real job. \n\nThe one who accused me casually mentioned that she was wrong and has been acting far too nice to me in lieu of an apology but I still hate her and that overly pushy cop that makes me hide my face like a criminal when I drive past his building.",

            "I live in the U.K. so I know our Police don\u2019t wield the same power that they do elsewhere. But I still maintain a deep mistrust of them. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because me and my mates would be stopped and searched at every opportunity as teenagers. Never once did they find anything on us, genuinely just 3 or 4 kids wandering the streets. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I had a stand up argument with a copper at a Speed Awareness Course when I pointed out that they liked to park in a certain Bus Stop which forced me to let passengers off in a dangerous location. His answer \u201cwe\u2019re the Police, we can park where we want to\u201d. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I reported a Police Car for going through a closing Level Crossing, without Blue Lights (though Flashing Red Lights apply to everyone, including the Emergency Services) and the next day I was pulled over for the first time in years. Probably coincidence, but a pretty fucking weird one. \n\nThey have done good, they pursued and caught a burglar once that I chased down the street with a metal pole. They were on the scene minutes after being called. The guy was taken to court and subsequently imprisoned. \n\nThey took all the belongings from my car for safe keeping when it was broken into for the phone that had fallen out of my pocket as I had gotten out. \n\nSeveral units turned up the day I called to say that my former neighbour was having some sort of breakdown and had come into my house and wouldn\u2019t leave.

            "I think this is almost exactly wrong.  While I generally agree that billionaires are largely a moral obscenity, defining the upper class so narrowly lets us all off the hook.\n\nMaking 300k a year places you near the top 1% and the top 10% of US households average something like 1.35 million dollars in net worth (and that excluding the top 1% from the average with a the poorest of those households having net worths over 700k).  Those households skew near retirement and largely hold wealth in home equity but the moment in time measurement cuts both ways with a much larger group of households rolling into that millionaire category over the course of their wealth accumulation.  Something like one in 5 households will eventually be millionaire households and an ever larger number of households are wealth adjacent.\n\nAnother way of looking at this is that an elementary school classroom of 20-40 kids if assigned by random chance would have kids from 4-8 millionaire or to be millionaire households and many more would have family money.  There is so much money sloshing around the US economy and we are so wealthy as a society that the constituency that defends the interest of wealth is much larger than people realize.\n\nSpeaking from within the top 1-10% bracket I get the precarity people in this segment of society feel and how hard they feel they have worked to earn it, but speaking as someone who got there from a mobile home in one of the poorest parts of the country and climbing up ladders and through institutions stuffed with the mediocre offspring of the upper middle class and the friends, families, and social peers of the already wealthy, I largely blame the privilege hoarding, blinkered self interest, and political organization of this segment of society for much of our current societies ills.\n\nThis upper class (which feels free to call itself upper middle class when earning incomes nearing the 99th percentile at 300-450k) wastes tremendous resources on preserving their and their descendants narrow privilege through massive expenditures on elite colleges, the extended adolescences/all sorts of career advancement and development opportunities for their offspring, and wild levels of personal consumption through their lives and choke opportunity pathways for everyone else in the process.  They do this out of a desire to hold on to the advantages they have gained and insure themselves expensively against precarity.  In the absence of this behavior, wealth would be much more broadly distributed and not wasted in vast sums on positional racing for access to elite colleges or in vast sums on back up private colleges that allow the mediocre elite a second bite at crowding others out.  This spending is an endless arms race among the upper and upper middle class (with 45000 a year preschool through high school expenditures which would finance a fortune on their own) that raises the bar less resourced people must overcome.\n\nThere is already enough wealth across a large swath of American households and enough income opportunities to create new wealth across the economy that we as a society can already well afford to provide everyone with quality services, allow children of all backgrounds access to quality educations, and ensure against the worst deprivations to ensure against most forms of genuinely avoidable human desperation we broadly accept in America.  But a truly large numbers of us (not just the 1% or billionaires) are mostly concerned with our and our children\u2019s continuing advantaged access to this vast pool of wealth and opportunity and fixated only on judging those better off than they are to pretend as if they are not the problem they bemoan.\n\nAnd this goes for the funding of Democratic and left aligned interest groups as well where the upper middle class (read just upper class) left-to-liberal identifying cohort is ridiculously stingy and infinitely less politically and socially invested than their right wing peers who recognize the self preservation game they are playing for what it is and play it in earnest while liberals inefficiently play it privately.\n\nI was shocked when I first started donating to a couple of extremely prominent left wing orgs, including orgs widely recognized on Reddit, to learn that my family\u2019s paltry starter donations quickly made us among the top donors to these organizations (like .1 to 1% of all donations) and the same (apart from top line races and pacs with the gala touring set) goes for candidate donations.  Look up donations by employer for the Fortune 500, see how easy it would be at many companies to become the top individual donor to Democratic candidates.  In many places all this and more could be yours for one year of private elementary school tuition.\n\nUnfortunately, we, the many wealthy, pretend the wealthy are they the few, and choose en masse to invest in our lifestyles and our individual kids and not a better society.  And the sad thing is that with a little moderation and a little public mindedness, it is not hard for people in the top 10% to accumulate substantial wealth in our society and contribute substantially to the public good.  For example, with just a top 5% income for most my not long working life and genuinely middle class as opposed to \u201cupper middle class\u201d tastes and consumption patterns, it has not been hard for me and my family to ride savings and sub index fund returns to a multi-million dollar net worth despite the fact that I entered adulthood with a $250000 student debt bill.  The income is their to be earned every year for large portions of our workforce, and all it took for me to take part was access to the elite institutions and opportunities the top 10% hoard in all sorts of ways (and which if they could be satisfied just to be wealthy and not obsessed with ensuring themselves and their children from ever being god-forbid actual middle class a lot more people would be able to access and likely a good deal more capable and hungry folks at that for the benefit of society) and the good fortune to avoid the kind of health setbacks that should not bankrupt any of us (and which absent hoarding by the top 10% mostly would not).\n\nEdit: cleaned up slightly and added paragraph breaks in response to replies.",

            "I run a popular kids\u2019 YouTube channel. Last year, YouTube got hit with *huge* fines for violating COPPA (Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act) because they were collecting data from YouTube users and serving ads. So they forced everyone who\u2019s channel is in any way directed towards kids to label their content as such, and they took away the ability for *all* of those channels to use a TON of features that help us stay afloat, like commenting, cards, end screens, linking to our websites, and more. They also took away our ability to target ads to kids, which was awful because suddenly our users were being served completely inappropriate ads. They said, \u201cjust use YouTube kids!\u201d which absolutely sucks and doesn\u2019t allow us to monetize. We have struggled a LOT to reach our fans and make up for the loss of income. \n\nAdd to this the issue that parents are desperate for quality content in pandemic land, and most of it is on YouTube. I\u2019m willing to bet YouTube is terrified of creating another COPPA violation with this nonsense they\u2019re pulling now. COPPA needs serious amendments for our current internet situation. It centers around data collection, which YouTube could address without doing all the workarounds they are doing now that hurt creators (both kids- and adult-content alike)",

Even if the lewd content has been approved to be \"kid friendly.\" \n\n  It just pisses me off though because there's hundreds of great YouTubers there are now getting censored and hit with copyright strikes just for saying words like \"simp.\" Hell if you even mentioned Donald Trump once you'll be considered a part of the Q movement and the two topics in the video don't even have to correlate. They are starting to heavily censor everything that we either view or watch in their own way as if it's like actual television now. It's crazy how you can see fully naked women and they won't bat an eye, but when it comes to someone's opinion or bringing light to the situation THAT content creator is the bad guy. \n\n  I just want to control free speech so that all the zombies out there will be persuaded to only view what they want us to view.

Each video receives a maturity rating much like video games or movies, and advertisers choose which level of maturity they\u2019ll accept advertising on. Their system is filled with issues, and videos that do not deserve limited monetization are hit with it quite often, for example a video against vaping will be labeled as mature content since it contains nicotine products, even though it\u2019s actually educational and warning people against the dangers of it. Their system is terrible, but monetization levels aren\u2019t based off kid-friendliness per say, but the content that is being covered and how it is framed. Another example could be daddy o five and how that was monetized wrongly because their system interpreted it as a prank channel, even though it was literal child abuse.",

It's absolutely fucking insane, and they act like that PG-13/R is something absolutely no one wants to see, when that rating of content is exactly what put youtube in its successful position in the first place. I understand regulating videos about guns, terrorist propaganda videos, and videos with just discussing blantant messages about murder or nazism.

I look around as a kid jumps, doesn't get very far, but he doesn't land it properly, and he's running down hill trying to stop, straight across the path in front of us, keeps running (momentum and balance), down the bank losing any balance he had before, then straight into the river. It's shallow so he's fine, he's standing up. I'm laughing.\n\nI look at the dad, he gets up with a shrug and runs to get his kid out, but he's belly laughing and slips into the river too, then I start again. Then my wife starts. Then I give the dude and the kid a hand to get out of the water, they're drenched, then the kid starts that uncontrollable laughing that you just can't stop, the viral type that no one can ignore.\n\nWe're all laughing now, then a few more people start, then a couple more. Tears are shed, takes maybe ten minutes for me to stop, but you can hear the odd \"uh hhhuh, heh... Hehe... Hahahaha\" and someone's at it again. Then someone else... You know how it is.\n\nWe had to leave, both of us were hurting from laughing too much.\n\nMoral of the story, not everyone cares if you laugh at their kid, especially when they're a Muppet.",

Movies were playing so no one was in the lobby and I\u2019m cleaning up things around the concession stand.  This little kid maybe 3-4 was booking it across the lobby.  He was running back and forth, back and forth.  The dad was sitting on the side of the lobby on a bench, talking on the phone. He wasn\u2019t paying attention to the kid or so it seemed.  But this maniac of a child was going back and forth for maybe 15 minutes until the ground grabbed his feet.  He must have hit some spilled dried soda because his feet just stopped but he had so much momentum his upper body continued forward.  He looked like Superman for all but a few seconds.  Straight dolphin dived across the lobby.  This little kid hit the ground hard and bounced only to hit the ground again and skid a few more feet before stopping.  Every worker was just staring.  The lobby had never been so quiet you could actually hear the monitor ads that play.  For a minute it was perfect.  And then that little monster just let out this loud cry.  I busted out laughing so hard.  The dad stood up after a minute of his kid crying, still talking on the phone.  Walked over to the cretin and picked him up by his waist band and walked back to the bench.  He sat the kid down and continued his conversation on the phone.  I was dying from laughing so hard.  I had to walk away into the back to calm myself down.  The dad knew and didn\u2019t say anything.  Didn\u2019t even show emotion.  Dead pan, talking on phone, grabs kid and sits back down.

They're typically out of season and sold by weight, so what you get is a tomato, bred or genetically modified for size and disease/pest resistance, swollen with water to increase weight, picked when unripened and then ripened artificially. The result is watery, bland tomatoes that look pink, have little flesh inside, and have a mealy texture.\n     \nThere's a reason why tomatoes are popular in home gardens - a tomato bred and grown with \"love\" (we'll say) is meaty, sweet, and savory - a terrific addition to your burger or a couple slices of thick bacon.\n     \nSo you're not wrong, it's just an unfortunate outcome of our food production system.",

Then the US engineered a coup with a bunch of rich businessesmen, couped the internationally-recognized Hawaiian monarchy and annexed the country with no formal treaties.\n\nThen, despite the protests from the native population, the US proclaimed Hawaii to be the 49th state of the United States. Hawaiian was then also banned and replaced by English as the official language in all institutions.\n\nThen, they diverted water to sugar plantations, causing shortages in the island of Maui. The sacred island of Kahoolawe was used as target practice for fifty years until 1990 when protests finally stopped the unnecessary maneuvers. And, finally, on the main island of Hawaii, Hawaii, they planned to make a large telescope on the most sacred mountain in Hawaiian tradition.",

The government offers.a multitude of civil and federal support in the way of free housing, free food programs, monthly generous living wage pay checks for registered natives \n\nFree college Tuition,  scholarships offered only to Native Americans students. Career Opportunities at some state and federal locations\n\nIf a native individual strives to be a successful and productive member of society one could argue they are given substantial help just for being Native. \n\nDrug abuse does not discriminate by race   Neither does alcohol. Those problems come with a decision and life style choice.\n\nCovid-19 restrictions were published as early as April 2020 if they were followed by native communities they wouldn\u2019t see some of the spikes that they are seeing....  ie. in most native communities in payday everyone goes and congregates to pick up their government issue paycheck.  also an argument could be made that the numbers may be inflated in order to get funding.  Source: that\u2019s hear say from certain tribes don\u2019t want to get into the weeds on that investigation.\n\nEven still there are federal hospitals that give FREE health care to natives. \n\nA lot of animosity and destain for the native people comes from the fact that natives are given everything to succeed and a large majority throw that opportunity away by poor decision making and spending their free money and benefits on drugs and alcohol.\nThat should not be confused with racism.\n\nSource: ALSO NATIVE",

I\u2019ve never been mistreated or ever felt marginalized based on my ethnicity on a regular basis i think everyone gets shit on at some point, some more than others however statistics here in the states support the claims of mistreatment among Indians. For me its seems most of the mistreatment comes from government officials violating laws & agreed upon treaty's sprinkle in tribal corruption stealing money this money would go along way to help. With over 500 nations here throughout the country some are living in horrible poverty some are making tens of billions with gaming and other enterprise, alot of nations are flourishing. Its all across the board with finances and quality of life.\n\nI do whole heartily agree we are definitely overlooked and forgotten about. Most of us are perfectly ok with it, Were still here tho! I would bet every nation depending on geography or accumulated wealth, tribal leadership, Nation Corruption or other factors would have different opinions. This is just my personal opinion from my experiences. These are very complex issues that have many layers and vary from tribe to tribe.\n\nWe generally refer to ourselfs as just Indian or American heavy emphasizes on (MOST). We get no special Indian checks from the government. We pay taxes just like every other American citizen. Not every nation holds sovereign land or a reservation the ones that do have been neutered by the government take the word sovereign with a grain of salt. Its not really sovereign, they still run oil pipelines and do whatever they want when the nation attempts to intervene they have no problems coming on tribal land with federal law enforcement. Most of the land per the original treaty\u2019s has been stolen or was never relinquished by the government. The nations are making headway in court Sharp vs Murphy would return most of Oklahoma back to the five nations. Yes the government gives tribes billions yearly as go away shut up money, that\u2019s because they have made Trillons off of oil, coal and other minerals sources from land they don\u2019t own! or possess, they violate treaty\u2019s and sovereignty laws and agreements daily that they wrote and purposed!

How black are you? Or how Mexican are you?. Ive never walked up to a White person and said white huh? How white are you? reason i ask its July not sure if you have a summer tan or what. Most people in the states aren\u2019t 100% anything anymore. I have family that are Red look like the stereotypical Indian yet they have less \u201dso called blood\u201c than me, some have 25% or less. Ive met so called 75% documented blood quantum Indians with blond hair, blue eyes that look Swedish. This isnt and has never been a tribal held way of thinking. Cherokee tribal chiefs don\u2019t look the so called part. Richard Sneed my nations principle chief is a perfect example of this. We have oral history going back hundreds of years with so called \u201c pale chiefs & Indians \u201d. We as a nation could careless like everyone else not every Indian or Nation will agree on this.

            "I'm half native and I agree and also disagree.\n\nThere's no question there's a tremendous problem in many native communities that need addressing. On that I agree with you. Where I disagree, however, is the notion that these problems are all caused by non-natives and can only be solved by natives and federal funding.\n\nLet me be honest about what I experience in the areas I'm from:\n\n*  Covid-19. *Numerous* groups of natives ignoring health recommendations and not following safe-distance protocols because they either a) don't believe it's a concern, b) think \"fuck whatever the government says,\" or c) think they know better. The hypocrisy here is astounding. One one day I hear people complaining the government doesn't care about natives and isn't doing enough to help, and the next day I hear the same people complaining that the government has the audacity to suggest the shut down of liquor stores (this is not an exaggeration, there are articles I could link to that illustrate my claim). Then there are the bands who insist on holding pow-wows even though it is not in the best interest of public health measures - and then blaming the government for \"oppression\" when the RCMP comes along and says \"just be careful about how you do this.\"\n\n* Pipeline issues. This is a topic wrought with issues. First off, *numerous* bands WANT the pipeline because it means revenue and jobs. The government sat down with *many* bands and came to fair consensus. The issue with the pipelines in Canada (where I'm from), especially the ones where the rail lines were shut down are completely bogus. 85% of the band agreed to, and *wanted* that pipeline. The \"traditional elders\" are the ones who denied it - even though it was already agreed upon democratically by the other ruling chiefs. Somehow in all of this, the feds are painted as the bad guys when they did exactly what they were supposed to do by consulting the tribe leaders. These bands can't even agree among themselves on this issue.\n\n* Drug abuse - I grew up around it and avoided it, and most of my friends avoided it to. Nobody can resolve this issue but natives but somehow non-natives get blamed for this as well. Let me give you an example of how irrational the expectations are in this regard: Not too long ago a native community in Labrador was facing high suicide rates, shocking levels of unemployment, horrible living conditions, and it was falling apart physically and spiritually. They asked the government to help and they did. The government spent *millions* of dollars and came up with a plan to relocate and rebuild the community to an area agreed upon by the natives. Tens of millions of dollars went into this, and a new community with better homes, an arena, a community center, etc. was built to give them a fresh start. Those who could move were free to do so. They moved to the new community and the tribal leaders took a vote on whether or not to make it a dry community - this should have been a no-brainer decision considering the state of their old community - and the vote passed - *barely.* However, bootlegging and criminal activity saw an increase in illegal drugs and alcohol and the ultimate fate of the new community was that it ended up just like the first. Suicide, drugs, crime, depression, hopelessness. Who can fix those things but us? When given *an entirely new community*, with everything we could have asked for - who else to blame but those living there?\n\n* Finances. There is rampant corruption in band leadership. Everyone I know is familiar with the phrase \"the Chief's driveway is always paved.\" The 2014 transparency act that illustrated the gross mismanagement of community funds (not federal money, *native* money) caused protests in many bands. How does a Chief of 827 people warrant making over $650,000 (tax free!) income when the rest of his people are in poverty? That's but ONE example.\n\nI could go on and on. I don't dispute the terrible living conditions and struggles many of us face but we need to take some accountability and responsibility for the bulk of our situation.

            "(Full disclaimer this is all off the top of my head) Yes especially when you consider that ~80-95% of the population was wiped out when America expanded west, on top of the treatment to come. When Native Americans decided to leave their typical tribe housing they were put in these terrible run down housing sites(forgot the name and just so you know this is 200+ years ago keep in mind) and when they were finally given land through the Dawes Act, White settlers tricked them and bought them out. Then from the first industrial revolution on they were a source of cheap labor and had less priority over White men when it came to jobs. So, yeah, Native Americans are a pretty poorly treated race.",

Seems like black people are held up as martyrs with hispanic people right behind, yet they are all seen as just poor mexican immigrants which is kinda racist in and of itself.  Middle Eastern people are seen as the poor oppressed Muslims which again is racist as not all of them fit into that category.  Asians are basically just seen as white people.  Mixed races are just ignored entirely.  Everyone forgets Natives or thinks they are hispanic.  \n\n\nWe need to just see everyone as people and not as a race or category.

            "It is. But you left something out. \n\n\nNatives Americans receive some sort of reparations from the US government. It is substantially more than blacks (slavery + ) and Asians (wwii internment camps) receive. It is in the form of a whole ass federal agency, federal contracts, casinos, land, programs, scholarships and straight cash. It is probably in the tens to hundred billions of dollars a year that these reparations are provided to American Native tribes. \n\nThese reparations are way above what black and Asian receive and are well protected by the Native American Tribes who the Federal Governments gives the controls. \n\nNone of these programs can be infiltrated by non-Natives or Natives that do not have the proper % or tribe rules/laws.  For example, I learned that at least for one tribe, only the woman can pass the generation line. So if you are a family of all boys, when those boys become men the generation line are screwed out of receiving some reparations unless those native males marry a native female.  If you are a native male and marry a non-native woman, you are screwed out of receiving some of these reparations.  There is no \u201cadoption\u201d that extends this line that can receive access to reparations. Also, I understand that in some tribes you can also be disinherited from some reparations even if your bloodline is good. \n\nThe reparations are tribe controlled and documented as not disseminated well to the Native people. There are accusations that the US imposed conditions like alcoholism that prevent natives from realizing their full potential and investing these reparations to make something bigger. \n\n\nNow on to the others. I believe Asians received a one time payment of small amount of money when they were released from camp. \n\nBlacks got civil rights but the civil rights isn\u2019t just for blacks. It is for white women, hell even white men can get in on it.  Civil Rights are for people of different sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, etc. I have even heard someone bring hair and eye color to the game.  Then you other nationalities that can claim \u201cblack\u201d  and \u201cAfrican-American\u201d to receive certain benefits. Like Charlize Theron who is \u201ctechnically\u201d African-American. She is naturalized American citizen who was born in Africa. Ms Theron is a white woman.  When blacks say, \u201ceveryone makes it off our backs\u201d, this is what they are talking about. Did I forget, even Natives have access to civil rights protection. \n\nCivil rights is so inclusively diluted that you could have an organization or state that is 99% diverse and not one drop of black blood is represented within that 99%. The same can never be said for reparations Native Americans receive because only Native Americans receive them. \n\nSo. I am going to say, that for me, this opinion is unpopular and inaccurate. \n\nNatives *were* the worst treated.  Not so anymore. You all need to have your own NLM (Native Americans Lives Matter) and raise up internally and fight that system and regain your reparations from your own people and tribes who are keeping them from you due you disagreeing.. push for transparency and better distribution.  Even if you initially lose access to those reparations for a few years because the tribes \u201cwrite your line out\u201d. A movement is not without its risks.  You will fix it. \n\n\nSo don\u2019t break this shit by diluting the issues going on now. Go fix your reparations so others can learn.\n\nSource:\n\nBureau of Indian Affairs (FY2020 Budget was almost 2 Billion dollars).   \n\nNative American Gaming  (almost $40B in earnings a year)\n\n\nThere are others.

For expensive products that are custom made, where more information is needed to provide a better price, it makes sense to have the customer contact a sales Rep first. Again, showing the price (in this case rage of price for the product) decreased the conversion rate and increased the bounce rate.\n\nIts not always the case though.

            "A few years ago some philosophers and biologists got together and did a bit of moral investigation on this very topic.\n\nEssentially they found that crustaceans, e.g. Lobsters, have the same central nervous system set up as many other invertibrates, namely bugs. They decided that lobsters don\u2019t have a moral standing because they are essentially only responding to stimuli. Which is to say they don\u2019t necessarily feel pain, they just respond to a sensation. \n\nThis is a far more dumbed down version than the actual paper, because I haven\u2019t read it in years. But the point is, bugs and lobsters don\u2019t technically suffer, therefore hurting them is not immoral. \n\nTake that as you will, I still try to pick spiders up instead of killing them. And I don\u2019t burn them alive for fun. Just food for thought.\n\nEdit: For clarification.",
            "I'll agree that you should kill lobsters humanely before cooking them (obviously, anyone should), but with a quick google search it seems the jury is out on whether Lobsters actually can feel pain. Some sources say yes, some say no, and yet more say 'I dunno'. The obvious answer is that if you aren't sure, go with the worst answer- assume they can feel pain and act accordingly. \n\nYou wouldn't want your alien overlords boiling you alive just because they aren't yet sure if you can feel pain.",
            "Sorry, but it would be very inconvenient to stab each crawfish in the head before boiling them when a typical crawfish boil involves hundreds if not thousands of crawfish.\n\nETA: My last name is Boudreaux and I am from Bourg, Louisiana, so I know of what I speak.",

As she waited for the pot to boil, I would sit on the kitchen floor and let the crabs wander around with me. I remember the horrible realization, when I was about 7, that she was actually boiling them alive, and it was really upsetting. I haven't gone crabbing since I was a little kid, 'cause I can't figure out a practical way to kill them humanely (I eventually ran into a similar problem with fishing). \n\nSometimes we just don't stop to think about customs like this, and we avoid thinking about it because it's problematic. I wouldn't really condemn anyone else for doing this...but yeah, these animals are alive, they feel pain and fear, and we should at least try to keep that in mind.",

            "I\u2019m kind of sick of seeing this post every week. Sure, neither are realistic. But that\u2019s like saying putting a little butter on your potatoes is just as bad as eating cookies for dinner every day? Everyone has sexual thoughts, which is fine and not a problem, but the difference is in the outlet. Lots of men like to hate on romance novels and say how absolutely terrible they are, while fiercely defending their right to watch thousands of hardcore videos a day. Porn has a problematic history. Ask Rose Kalemba, the 15 year old girl who\u2019s multiple rape videos wouldn\u2019t get taken off pornhub, if she thinks porn is just the same as a cheesey romcom. Check out Girls Do Porn, the company that kidnapped, coerced, and forced women into consenting on camera and then raping them. After the lawsuit, one of the girls said she started crying and fighting back but they just cut to a different shot. Many pornstars have come forward to detail the drugs, pressures, tricks, and how they can agree to do a shoot but during it are unable to stop it as it becomes too rough and painful. Girls have killed themselves, come out with bruises and tears and emotional scarring. Men don\u2019t fare too well either, especially the straight men drugged and forced to be the gay bottom. \n\nSure sure, if you bring it down to just merely \u201cunrealistic expectations\u201d yeah they\u2019re similar. However even just the titles like \u201cjailbait teen gets electrocuted\u201d \u201cextreme hardcore milf forced\u201d \u201cgroping drunk sister\u201d \u201cupskirts at the mall\u201d are simply way worse than a dramatic love triangle on daytime tv. Those are all front page videos. A lot of popular porn is forced consent or no consent at all - revenge porn, creep shots, degenerate behavior all is directly tied to \u201cmainstream\u201d porn, which even profits off sex trafficking. Police have found stolen children through monitized pornhub videos. There are even popular companies called LatinaAbuse (where the girls are beaten and called racists slurs and forced to eat off a bowl on the floor) and YoungAndAbused, TinyTeenExploited, on and on. Take away the sex and you just get extreme racist, misogynistic violence against women. Sure, you can try other categories, but even homemade and amateur has a high likelihood of being forced or revenge porn. I came across an entire snap chat account where hundreds of women\u2019s nudes were sent in without their consent to be publicly posted, along with names and home towns. \n\nI could go on. Sex offenders are required to abstain from porn during rehab as it increases the likelihood they\u2019ll commit again. Children are shown and desensitized to porn as an act of sexual abuse. This doesn\u2019t occur with romcoms. I\u2019m not saying all porn is evil, but I\u2019m sick of the narrative that it\u2019s a wholesome wonderful company filled with well-paid, well treated, sex obsessed performers. I watched a Netflix documentary and one of the girls was acting so into it during the shoot and immediately broke down after and said she was in so much pain. If you say no to shoots or \u201cprivate inspections\u201d with producers, your career dies. If you actually get paid, most of it goes right back in to outfits or the medical care needed in such an \u201cindustry.\u201d The effect on our children has been devastating, with how young most kids start watching and even if at such young ages they \u201cknow\u201d it\u2019s fake, subconsciously they don\u2019t. Anal sex was a taboo thing a few years ago, now young teen girls are pressured into doing it in the course of what\u2019s now vanilla sex. Anal is not for everyone, but porn has said that it is, and people can know it\u2019s fake all the way to the bank while still slapping, spitting on, choking, and hurting their partners. Children are impressionable, and wear pornhub hoodies while saying choke me daddy at 13. Talk to anyone older who never had so much access to such extreme porn, and they\u2019ll tell you their first time was a whole different experience. Boys used to be excited just to get a girl naked, now young kids often go into their first sexual experience expecting all the things they\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s fake, but....every girl swallows after a bj right? Blowjobs always come first, then dry penetration, then done right? Most women have been noncensenually choked during sex and it is very scary to have a horny man over you forcing you to do something because he just got an idea from a crazy video and thinks it would be hot to try, even though it\u2019s performative and painful but somehow you\u2019re the prude, the problem, the weird one, for not wanting extreme unpleasureable sex all the time. The dopamine hits you get from watching porn makes it more addictive and \u201creal\u201d than a romcom. If you watch someone kicking a puppy but get a dopamine shot every time, unfortunately you\u2019re going to start enjoying watching someone kick a puppy. \n\nAnd I mean hey. It gives men erectile disfunction. Child trafficking, desensitization, abuse, and problematic themes never seem to bother anyone, but the thought of not being able to get a boner all the time usually scares a few people. Seriously, erectile dysfunction rates in men under 25 have absolutely skyrocketed, and this is not just in an obsessed user but the average guy who thinks porn has zero downsides....but apparently romcom is dangerous and definitely not okay.

Life can be stressful, and little release is good for a person",

You have your own battles to fight and that's okay. \n\nI've noticed that recently there have been a lot of social media posts about dating people with mental health issues (eg. post like \"dating someone who understands ur mental health is soo important. there's humans who will make u feel terrible for things u can't or don't know how to control yet\"). I feel that posts like this don't understand the impact it can have on the other person in the relationship. \n\nAs someone who has been in a two-year relationship where I was the emotional dumpster for my former partner, I felt insanely guilty for even wanting to break up with them because I couldn't continue to support them in their mental health journey. My former partner would often blame for me not being understanding or patient enough. They snapped at me on multiple occasions when I was talking about my day and my work team and how fun my day at work was because it made them feel more depressed that their work team wasn't as close. Later in the relationship, I had learnt to only ask about how their day went but never share my own, in fear of not being supportive of their mental health. \n\nNow I know that not everyone with mental health issues will be like my former partner, but posts on social media perpetuate the stigma that YOU'RE the unempathetic/uncaring/non-supportive one if you can't understand your partner's mental health. \n\nIt's not true. You're not a bad person for wanting to break up with them. It's okay to break up with your partner if they're being toxic. Being with someone who is going through mental health issues is draining and it's okay to break up with your partner if their mental health is too much for you. It's okay to not be an emotional dumpster for your partner. Please remember that you're a person too. You have your limits and your own mental health to take care of. It's okay to break up with someone with mental health issues and it's okay to break up with someone because of their mental health issues.",

            "I think there should be a distinction between someone who is actively working to improve their mental health situation and someone who isn\u2019t. \n\nI was in two long-term relationships with guys that had some serious issues and like you said, it was horrible for me and I felt like I needed to stay to help them and it was horrible for me. Except that they didn\u2019t want to help themselves. They wouldn\u2019t reach out for the help they needed and that\u2019s what kept them unhealthy and what made the relationship toxic. They just took advantage of the fact that I was trying to be supportive and understanding to pull whatever shit they wanted and make me feel bad about it. \n\nHowever, I have my own shit too. I\u2019m bipolar and I\u2019m actively going to therapy/taking meds/etc. The thing is that even with the therapy and meds I can\u2019t guarantee I won\u2019t have days when I\u2019m not my usual self. I\u2019m not aggressive or abusive in these states either, but I just don\u2019t feel well or can be irritable or whatever. During these times is when I need a partner that can understand that meds aren\u2019t a magic fix and that can be part of my support network to encourage me to stay on track and isn\u2019t just bolting out the door at the first sign of a symptom. It\u2019s honestly worse to have a partner that doesn\u2019t care about your mental health than not having anyone there at all, but having a good partner can really accelerate a recovery or just help with building self-esteem/confidence which can be fragile in a lot of cases after being knocked down by a mental health disorder. \n\nPoint is, people who are actively and genuinely working on improving their mental health do need support and should be given a chance but people who are not willing to get help/aren\u2019t really putting in the real work to get better are just going to use it as an excuse to be assholes and yeah you shouldn\u2019t have to stay with those people.",

It was been really hard for him as I have worked on controlling and treating my illness, and I love him so much for sticking by me. We have an agreement that as long as I\u2019m actively trying to treat my illness, he will try to stick by me. But I don\u2019t think anyone who can\u2019t handle a relationship with someone with a mental illness is a bad person.

I\u2019ve known some people who are exceptionally abusive and toxic, but who hide behind the shield of mental illness, and use it as a bludgeon for anyone who would challenge them on their behavior.\n\nAnd the worst part is that some of these people legitimately *do* have mental health issues, but they genuinely didn\u2019t care about the impact they were having on those around them. They became selfish and entitled, and if anyone commented on it they\u2019d be demonized as not supporting their mental health.\n\nNewsflash: your mental illness does not give you a free pass to be terrible to people, and you still need to own it when it makes you be terrible to them.\n\nEscaping some friendships with such people really helped me understand the importance of boundaries, and the need to recognize and protect myself from toxic behaviors. And perhaps that makes me a less compassionate human being, but there are some red flags I\u2019ve learned that have saved my ass on a number of occasions.\n\nGood on you for getting out, OP.

Lol I love having to care for someone so I cooked, cleaned, made the money in the household, went to 4-5 college classes per week and did most of the cleaning. \n\nIt took a huge toll on my own mental health. I\u2019m a super happy guy who doesn\u2019t understand depression and would never consider killing myself. So it was hard for me to be with her for 6 years. Most of my college years. \n\nEvery time we would break up, she would spiral and go suicidal and we would get back together because I could never forgive myself if she killed her second over me breaking up with her. It was a super toxic strategy to get me back every time.\n\nOne day, I got all of her friends together and told them everything and that I needed out. This was no longer about relationship issues, my mental health was really taking a toll and I found myself being miserable. \n\nI devised a plan to slowly stop doing all the things I did to make her feel comfortable. Stopped cleaning as much, stopped cooking for her, asked her to pay more bills, and I started to become \u201cbarely available\u201d. I was on my phone a lot and didn\u2019t give her attention. I instructed her friends to start telling her that I was an asshole and that she deserved better.\n\nOver time, the plan worked. She started thinking that she deserved better and she eventually broke up with me and left my apartment. \n\nI don\u2019t think my plan was morally correct. It was manipulative, but I needed out or my mental health was going to take a toll and I would probably become depressed myself. Moral or not, my plan worked. She gained the courage to leave me and I\u2019m doing so, she didnt want to kill herself, she get the courage to move on and live.\n\nShe\u2019s now happy and in a better place and managing her depression well.

People are far too quick to say \"break up with them, you don't deserve this\". When you get married for better or for worse mental illness is a part of that and you have a duty to try and make things work and get your partner the help they need.

But, when something hard in my life happened, she couldn\u2019t help as much emotionally. She got on meds and became less anxious and more of a self advocate. I was so proud and happy for her. Then she got mad at me for not being loving enough with her. Ironically, I was so happy she was finally able to handle herself and be happy on her own, that I felt like I could take a step back and love myself more and not use all my energy for her.

Full stop. Their reason for being a bad partner doesn't matter.\n\nBut not everyone struggling with mental health issues is going to be toxic or a bad partner. Plenty of us are great partners and have learned to manage and cope with our issues and not let them interfere with our relationships or make us assholes. Breaking up with someone solely because you found out they're in therapy for depression or take bi-polar meds or something when they've been a good partner or before you've even really gotten to know each other at all is kinda shitty though, imo. \n\nI think a more apt title would be mental health issues are not an excuse for being a toxic partner and you shouldn't feel the need to stay with someone just because they have mental health issues.",

            "OP knows most couples discuss getting married before someone proposes. Does OP think that the person being asked to be married REALLY has to consider whether they want to marry the person right then and there. Lmao",
            "To be fair, you can always say no... I wouldn't do it because I think it's an intimate moment but to say it's blackmail is a stretch, i think that if you feel pressured to say yes and then say yes just because there is people staring at you, you have other problems, so I don't really understand the pressure thing.",
            "Sounds like someone is single! Haha",
            "I don't think anyone proposes unless they're practically already planning their wedding together.\n\nThe \"no\" videos you see are often staged.",

            "I proposed to my wife in front of almost a thousand people. Knew the answer beforehand and she'd picked out the ring. All you've done is show that you think you know things should work but really you have no clue.",
            "If you fake a relationship for years to the point of a marriage proposal and manipulate someone so much that they are confident enough to publicly propose to you, and then you play the victim for the \"emotional blackmail\"  you are an absolute irredeemable piece of shit.",

            "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it emotional blackmail. The thing is when someone asks someone to marry them they heavily assume they are going to say yes and that it\u2019ll be instant rather than a decision they need to think about",
            "I just don't see the point besides attention grabbing. How does kneeling and proposing in front of bunch of people make it extra special or meaningful? To me, it's like having a huge extravagant wedding - to show off anything else over love.",
            "Well, even if there is no crowd the woman is likely to say yes cuz she feels bad. I\u2019m not an expert on proposals but that\u2019s my take on it. Imagine if the tables were turned and a woman asked a man to marry them would they honestly so no? They\u2019d probably figure a way out after the engagement. That\u2019s my take on it",

            "OMG THIS. It's because the partner will feel really pressured with the whole audience y'know? If this happens to me in the future I'll prolly just freeze on the spot or smthg",
            "Idk if you know this but if you were pressed to say yes, it is usually an option to NOT marry them.",
            "To be fair, most healthy couples usually are already on the same page about this before the question is popped. I think professing your love for someone in front of people is beautiful, if done right.",
            "There's a reason there's always a line to pop the question at Disney World. Some people really  want a public spectacle for their proposal. It really depends on the person, but I agree that putting someone on the spot is not okay. The couple should be on the same page with marriage already.",
            "It is. For some ppl.",
            "Plus apparently a woman likes it more when it\u2019s in a private place and nothing like tooo special but like more casual (if this is wrong and y\u2019all enjoy it in a romantic and special occasion lmk b4 I fuck up\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02)",

Public proposals are ok if you're sure they'll say yes and aren't shy, but otherwise, pick somewhere more memorable then a random restaurant or a mall. My father took my mom out to a nice park and did it on a bridge. Secluded, and memorable. (Its also close enough to go to, which is cool.) Personally, ill probably propose in a small group of our friends, because there are some people that I want to see their reactions when it happens. But, I will make sure we're in agreement about it first.",

            "I think you are wrong on this one. If you are to the point of proposing to someone, there have been conversations prior. You know what their answer is going to be, of at least you better.",
            "Definitely not blackmail for some people but it\u2019s too much pressure and there are definitely better ways. I think some people actually might think it\u2019s romantic and be oblivious to the fact that it is in poor taste and not romantic at all, so I wouldn\u2019t hesitate before I would generalize everyone as emotional blackmailers.",

            "Surprise proposal are the worse.",
            "Witnessing the proposal is honestly the only reason I'd ever think it's emotional blackmail, cause I couldn't imagine saying no in that situation, when what actually happens is, you don't want to say no. 9 times out of 10, the marriage is talked about prior or both have been together for about 2 years so getting married really isn't anything besides the title change so there isn't a reason to say no, you've both already committed to each other. \n\nThere is times I've heard of though where they'd only be together for a few months, or in one situation I remember a girl who went to my school made the mistake of dating someone from the rough part of the travelling community. He invited her to a funeral and proposed there in front of everyone, and incase you're not from Ireland, you don't say no when you're surrounded by a group of mourning travellers if you want to leave without a fair amount of hair ripped out of your scalp and a broken nose. Just like that, she was engaged to a chap she'd dated for 2 and a half months.",
            "I gotta say, from all personal experience and anecdotal evidence, you guys are damn smooth at figuring out little specifics (like ring preferences, sizes, e.t.c). Things that at the time are just little bits of conversation for some random, in the future event, and saving it up enough to still make the actual proposal event a surprise. Good going! Highly underappreciated effort and skill in my opinion.",

            "Im kinda thinking most the time it isn\u2019t really a surprise. They\u2019re expecting it.  Kinda like when a woman\u2019s friends throw her a shower. \u201cHey, let\u2019s goto this random place and hang out.\u201d They know what\u2019s about to go down.",

            "As someone who grew up in a former Soviet republic, it was really fascinating to see even the most trivial artifacts of American culture become powerful counter-cultural icons.",
            ">happened to hear lots of \"AmEriCa HaS nO CuLTuRe\" by self-hating american classmates\n\nThese people are probably quite sheltered and either haven't traveled much themselves, or aren't mature enough to learn and appreciate the vast differences in people, places and things within their own country.",
            "American culture can be difficult to pin down because it's such a weird admixture of other cultures, and it tends to be highly regionalized.  New York City is its own cultural ecosystem.  So is Los Angeles.  New Orleans is practically a foreign country within the United States.  Puerto Rico.  Alaska.  Hawaii.  The Pacific Northwest.  Appalachia.  We have dozens of microcultlures within our borders.  Having not traveled a ton abroad, I can't speak to how common this is, but most other countries seem to have this same thing.  The UK, for example, has four distinct countries within it, and within those countries you have further cultural subdivisions.  My ancestors are from Bavaria, which I understand is quite different from, say, Berlin.\n\nAll that being said, culture is a collection of customs, art, and shared popular mythology, and while the United States has a lot of regional variations, there are some common elements in everything from music (jazz and blues) to clothing (blue jeans), and that's to say nothing of the influence of American cinema and literature.  There is a mythos of the \"American Dream,\" we have a collection of origin stories, some of which are apocryphal.\n\nI suspect Americans tend to overlook their culture because the most distinct elements of it aren't part of our everyday lives.  People in Germany aren't wearing Alpine caps and lederhosen every day, either.  Or at least, I assume not.  If they are, I might need to accelerate my plans to visit Lohr am Main.",
            "Honestly a lot of people here don't have a grasp of what culture really is. Since our western culture is like you said, the norm, most don't recognize it as culture even though it is by definition.\n\n\n\nThis shouldn't even be an unpopular opinion because you're correct. It is very widespread to the point a lot of cultures are being forced to change/assimilate some of western culture to survive.",
            "I have a strong feeling that Americans who repeat that 'AmEriCa HaS nO CuLtURe' haven't traveled beyond the US ... or if they have, it has been to Canada or Cancun...\n\nI am an American born and raised state-side and when i lived in Spain for a semester, I developed a real appreciation for American culture only a week in to my study. Not b/c Spain was awful and i missed home - quite the opposite, it was lovely - but because I hadn't ever considered my homeland culture before! Nor had it ever been more obvious.\n\nETA a small anecdote: One gr8 (tumblr!) post once went viral b/c they were chatting about a staple of American culture i haven't seen mentioned which is FOOD!! More specifically, meals. In America, we are known form massive portions BUT our intent is to have leftovers b/c cooking and serving food is a massive act of love and connection. You get a massive portion because we will be GOD DAMNED if someone leaves our home hungry!Americans express their community and compassion thru communal meals. Stopping by for a visit? Take a doggie bag. Pot lucks, BBQs, bring-a-dish-to-pass... these are vital to building community in America! We emphasize food and portions not because we are all lard assess, but because we all have a Grandmother spirit in us to make sure our friends and companions never leave hungry! I hope i explained it well- Would love if someone could locate the post!",

Sure, there may be \u201cslightly less\u201d shit on your floors, but the reality is for all intents and purposes your floor is still dirty and full of bacteria and dirt- no matter what. \n\nUnless you are bleaching and pressure washing and scrubbing all day every day your house is always going to be filthy under a microscope. That\u2019s what the ground is for.\n\nHere\u2019s an analogy. You\u2019re comparing the difference between a public bathroom floor and an upscale office building bathroom floor. You wouldn\u2019t eat off either of them. You would find the same dirt and bacteria in both places. You would find *way more* in the space with heavier traffic, but not enough to make a difference.\n\nHere\u2019s another analogy. Imagine outside the ground is covered in bright orange paint. It gets on your shoes. You walk in your house and take them off. You step into your slippers and walk around as usual. Now imagine you do that every day, 2 or 4 or 10 times. How much orange paint has managed to make its way into your house just by virtue of being tracked around your entryway, etc? You\u2019re right- a fuck load. There would be orange paint everywhere.

Yeah, as far as recreational drugs go it\u2019s pretty harmless; it\u2019s less toxic than alcohol, not chemically addictive, withdrawals aren\u2019t physically painful, but it can still fuck up your life. Constantly getting stoned robs you of your motivation and impairs your ability to function like a normal person.\n\nIt\u2019s also way more difficult to quit than most people think, especially if you\u2019ve made it a daily habit. Trying to taper off rarely works because it\u2019s so easy to smoke casually that you\u2019ll never struggle to find an excuse for it. Going cold turkey sucks because you become irritable and impatient, your brain having been flooded with dopamine for so long that the things that would make a normal person happy have no effect on you.\n\nObviously it\u2019s not as bad as Xanax, meth, heroin, etc, but it can still mess you up.",

            "100% true. I quit a year and a month ago after smoking since I was 16... (4 years total). Gradually, my habit became a daily escape and addiction. And soon it was all day, and I was always high. Going a few days without, I could map out the withdrawal symptoms and mood swings, and the cravings were ridiculously intense, so I kept relapsing until April 5th last year. I didn't feel safe with my thoughts being sober, and was spending tons of money to keep up with my needs. \n\nI still get cravings from time to time, but remind myself the dependency I had was unhealthy. I miss the ritual of lighting up in my usual spots, alone or with friends, as it was sort of a meditative state and experience, especially inspiring many creative art inspirations. What I don't miss is the constant need to be high, the lack of neurotransmitters in my sober state to make normal life fulfilling, and most of all, the loss of respect I had for myself coming to school and work high, not performing well, and losing opportunities/ forgetting memories with important people and events.",

Like borderline tears, racing thoughts, and then at night he smoked and how incredible it was that that problem just evaporated and he wasn\u2019t sad at all anymore. I knew then that while maybe it wasn\u2019t a physical \u201caddiction\u201d for him, it was definitely an emotional crutch. An avoidance mechanism at least.",
            "Addiction is addiction.\n\nYou can be addicted to exercise, food, drinks, sugar, sex, drugs (legal/illegal, synthetic/natural, perscribed/recreational), caffeine, tobacco... literally anything can become an addiction, and can take away your quality of life.\n\nIf something has become uncontrollable, a barrier, interferes with you goals, causes you financial strain, causes problems with your relationships with family and friends, interferes with your physical or mental health, or has any kind of negative effect on your life, it's a problem. There is no \"just weed\". There is no \"just\" anything, if it becomes an uncontrollable addiction.\n\nIf something brings value to your life, you should include it. Many things listed can be used responsibly, and enhance your experience. You need food to live, so you need to establish a healthy relationship with it. Drugs can help you overcome the restricrions your body presents you throughout life, and can be useful and necessary. A healthy sex life is important for most people to thrive. Caffeine can help people feel energized to take on their day. Tobacco has zero positives.\n\nIf something brings value to your life, include it. If something restricts your potential, and brings negativity into your life, exclude it, or find a way to have a healthy relationship with it. \n\nI will say as a daily cannabis consumer, for me it brings value to my life, and enhances it positively. As a Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and chronic pain sufferer, without this medicine I could not function. The pain would be too unbearable. I wouldn't be able to bathe, to sleep, or to take care of my one year old. It is vital to me being able to control my pain, and without it, I would be bedridden and miss out on my son's life. I use it each evening, after my son has gone to bed. Those few hours before bed where my pain is controlled, keeps my sanity. The mild dulling of pain it provides into the next day allows me to take on the day, and function. I am greatful to live in Canada where it is a legal substance, and I am able to see a true MD who perscribes it to me.\n\nShould it ever have any negative impacts on my life though, I will reexamine its role, and proceed accordingly.\n\nEdit: Added a word\n\nEdit 2: Just a quick thank you for the awards. Not something I've experienced much. Thank you.",

They threw arguments they've seen online, like weed is not addictive, weed does not kill and alcohol does, weed is not harmful to health, weed is therapeutic, and is natural, and so on, completely in negation with their own addictions, feeding eachother with lies, while being always disposed to go in the middle of the night into guettos to buy weed because they couldn't sleep without smoking it. It sucked the life out of them, made them anti social, depressed and apathetic. 2 of them are basically dead inside. I believe there are people who can be in control and live a good life while smoking weed moderately, but I knew a lot of people who got addicted to it, and, of course, like any addict, their brains rationalized everything and did not allow them to quit because the world around them was so accepting of it, while with other drugs, because their consequences are so explicit and external, and weed does more of a slow psychological damage, it's harder to take it as seriously. The same applies to video games, I think, where the is also a culture that glorifies them, and many addicts who ruin their lives little by little because they are too ingrained in the culture to look at them from an outside perspective. And since many other gamers can lead good lives, it's harder for them to accept that they are addicted.",

It wasn't too long ago we thought that leaded gasoline and cigarettes were harmless. Considering how widespread pot use, internet pornography, and plastics have become, combined with just how little long term exposure to these things is understood, is a recipe for disaster.\n\nPot use, especially before the brain is full developed when you reach 25, has been shown to be harmful to brain activity. A close friend of mine who majored in physics told me that when he smoked pot in college, it was impossible to do difficult physics problems for a day or two after. Who knows how many people would have been significantly more intelligent if they hadn't smoked pot in adolescence, the effects of pot on neurological activity are difficult to measure because there's no telling how peoples brains would develop in its absence. \n\nInternet pornography is addictive and verifiably harmful, but discussing it is taboo outside certain communities and support groups. Pornography is an entertainment industry larger than the NFL, MLB, and NBA combined. Much of the research into pornography is funded by the pornography companies themselves, leading to massive biases in the results and a lack of thorough research into the harmful effects of internet porn. \n\nWe are only now finding microplastics present in the bodies of a large number of people. We have no idea what effects the chemicals leeching into our bodies from these plastics have on our health, reproductive function, and endocrine systems. \n\nWe think that we're somehow better than our ancestors because they had lead in their toys and played with easy bake ovens, but we really have no idea what the next thing previously thought to be harmless that is incredibly harmful will be.",

            "I was absolutely addicted and was forced to quit. Probably never would have quit otherwise. \n\nI ended up with cannibas induced paranoid schizophrenia. It was horrible. I was fine for years (~10 yrs of smoking) and then in about 6 months slowly declined from normal to rolling waves of psychosis. I thought everyone was plotting against me, was hearing things and even thought my job was fake. Even ended up on a 72 hour hold because I couldn\u2019t deal and tried to end things. I didn\u2019t realize the connection though. \n\nI ended up quitting because everything that happened forced me to move home where recreational wasn\u2019t legal. Within 8 months I only had residual effects left; extreme anxiety and obsessive thoughts. A few months later recreational became legal and I started up again bc I missed it. With 5 months I was worse than ever before and it was very clear that it was the weed. I was lucky to still have enough of my sanity left to know what was happening. One day after breaking out into a hysterical paranoid fit, I quit cold turkey and called my psychiatrist to get back on meds which I originally only took for 3 months. \n\nFast forwards 1.5 years and I\u2019m perfectly fine now. No meds needed either. No lingering side affects left. My mom and I even joke about how crazy I was lol. Finally reached that point of tragedy + time = comedy. \n\nBut when I was heavily addicted I would spend my last dollar on weed. Even overdraft my account. I think ppl forget that addiction sometimes has nothing to do with the substance itself. Some ppl just have addictive personalities. Shit, at one point I was addicted to working out.",

I would laugh and just enjoy it. Towards the end, it stop being fun. I was dependent, since they come in pens now, it was so easy to wake and bake. I was able to work under it. I always hated having to worry about having red eyes and looking dead. I told myself no more, and at first it sucked but I made myself busy to distract myself from the urge. I worked with stoners so it was easy to get it. Eventually I stopped and haven't looked back. It's been a year and have no temptation to go back. I started to get paranoid, I would reflect and start feeling like shit about it. I felt like a loser. \n Every blue moon I tell myself I'll get back into it but when the time approaches itself where I can smoke, but I know I won't and I'm happy I stopped it.",

            "Worked with kids in an after school program many, many years ago. Sometimes local high schoolers would volunteer and help out (the program was for 3rd - 5th graders). One of the volunteer kids was this 17 year old whose parents made him come. He started showing up high and I eventually found out he was smoking weed to deal with a shitty home life. His dad was emotionally and physically abusive to him and his brother. And his mom was in complete denial. Found him on social media 5 or 6 years later and he was basically a couch potato version of Jay from Jay & Silent Bob. Weed had taken over every aspect of his life. Very sad.",
            "I've heard from few people that are trying to quit (smoking everyday) that they pretty much fell into depression. Their brains were so used to relying on weed to create happy chemicals that without weed they suck at this now. It's really hard. So yeah I would take weed seriously. Legalize it off course. Let people smoke every so often, but used everyday, abused it can fuck you up.",

They straight up won't go anywhere if smoking weed isn't cool, they'll cancel plans last minute if they can't find weed I guess they don't see the point in leaving the house.  \n\n\nIt sucks because at one point we were all 3 best friends and somewhere along the line they chose getting high and playing video games (I don't game at all)  over friendships\n\nI have my own unpopular opinions on video games",

            "I remember a great post that went around a few years ago, apologies in advance for everything I misremember, that was a teacher describing why Marijuana was the most dangerous drug. His case was, to summarize, due to the general lax attitude towards it, ease of acquisition and convenience it's incredibly accessible and viewed positively (as a former Marijuana user and cigarette user I remember WAY more regret and taboo towards the latter than the former). The problem is once it instills itself as a regular part of your life it very insidiously robs you of your ambition. It makes sitting on the couch watching TV a satisfying, seemingly enriching experience when in reality such activities should be luxuries juxtaposed against doing stuff; be it practicing music, writing, going for a walk, reading or whatever. \n\nI know this isn't the case for everyone but it always stuck with me as in high school I hung out with the stoner click. A great group of people, but I was one of, if not the only, to go to college. So I left that behind to pursue a career in science. Now I'm not judging, not everyone should feel the need to go to college and theirs nothing wrong with smoking some of beelzebubs oregano. But what freaked me out is I came back years later, three to be precise, and they were EXACTLY the same. It was heart-rending to see my friends who had dreams of playing shows and writing songs have not moved an inch in their lives after three whole years. Again there's alot of factors at play, I was very lucky that I was able to go to college and I'm sure Marijuana was not the only thing involved in their stagnation. But I'm quite confident it was one of the key things that just kept them rooted to the ground. And I think that summarizes the lesser discussed bad side of Marijuana, it imperceptibly lowers the bar for accomplishment until you have no motivation to do anything at all.",
            "I went through this in college when I had to go on probation. I smoked like a science. Gravity bong hits were measured and I spent a lot of my life then high to various degrees of gravity bong hits.

I used them mostly for a sleep aid for over a year (and I simply enjoy cannabis), and for at least a week after I stopped I was having crazy temperature swings and night sweats. Some people get headaches and virtually everyone goes through some insomnia. \n\nIt's not going to kill you and the withdrawal symptoms are mostly just being uncomfortable for a bit, but it's still no joke. Cannabis concentrates are really easy to abuse.",
            "I know people who spend their last bit of money on weed all the time and ask multiple people to borrow \u00a35/\u00a310 to buy some weed so they can just \u2018smoke and chill\u2019, if you think it\u2019s not addicting you haven\u2019t seen it enough imo",

            "Overindulgence of just about anything can lead to harm. Weed is no different. If used in moderation, it is one of the safest recreational drugs out there. Using to excess can cause problems, just like anything else. I love trying new bakeries, but if I ate nothing but brioche and handmade donuts, I\u2019d probably suffer negative health outcomes as a result.",
            "I wish people spoke more openly about this. I smoke every day and it significantly improves my life. I have a pretty severe chronic health condition and horrendous insomnia that is only helped by smoking each evening. I really do find myself having an overall happier and more productive life because of utilising marijuana, but because of all the rubbish on both sides saying its totally harmless or the devil, I have absolutely no way of measuring if I use it too much. There's so much disinformation out there.",
            "Honestly its really easy to stop. You need to fill your time with something else that's the hard part. Also if all your friends smoke it can be more difficult.\n\nI enjoy how much easier it is to talk to people after having stopped and its easier to get to the gym when not feeling completely stoned.\n\nI'm speaking from experience I was so shocked how easy it was to stop a 10 year 3 joints a day habit. The money you save is a big motivator.  It is nice to have dreams coming back when sleeping as well.",

            "Anything addiction is a serious issue tho, like sex, computers, food etc. I don't think weed as a substance should be demonized. Especially since alcohol is way worse and is considered fine.",

            "Also, FWIW, if you have ADHD it really can fuck with you. Spent two years depressed af smoking, not thinking that was the problem since that was the only time I felt good. Went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD, and she told me weed will generally have a pretty negative affect for me since it's a downer/relaxer, and I need stimulants to actually maintain at a \"normal\" mental health level. \n\nI was pretty much smoking to numb myself, but then when I wasn't high I would get real sad... and then smoke again to numb that. It started at casual enjoyment but quickly got into dependency and a total lack of positivity in anything I did. I'm not against the occasional social smoking, but I'm so much happier since eliminating it from daily routine.",

This person is a young adult with the mentality of a 14 year old, and I\u2019ve seen them pitch a fit over not being able to get any weed. They regularly borrow money from their ill single mother to pay for their habit. \n\nLike all drug use it comes from a place of trauma and poor mental health, and addictive personality doesn\u2019t help either.

If you wanted to swap heads around you could. I mean it was all about imagination. As a kid some of my LEGOs were black, some asian, some white. Whichever face I felt fit the personality and look of the characters and something like skin color would just be in my imagination (just like the lasers they were all shooting at each other). \n\nThen everything had to have a skin color. I mean has anyone seen the black faces LEGO uses? You can't even see the features, it's a dark brown base with black features, just horrible design. All you can tell is that it's a black person, you can't really differentiate the faces at all. I hated that shit with a passion, I'd specifically get sets with yellow people, but unfortunately the Star Wars stuff was the coolest and they went with skin tone characters.",

Nobody is literally yellow IRL (except for the Simpsons) so that works just fine. I'd also be fine with blue and purple. Maybe not red, red indicates anger so it might not work. Green also indicates that you're sick or jealous. Pale blue and light purple would work well though.",

It is not a neutral color. Maybe having multiple race representative colors wouldn't have been necessary if the original emojis were a more neutral color (or every one was a different color), but they were designed and implemented by wealthy white men without a second thought.\n\nFor a long time, POC were forced to either use emojis that represented a callous disregard for minorities or to forgo them entirely.\n\nAt some point, this mistake was rectified and the act of doing so was a mark of society's progress. Now some POC (not all, maybe not even most) have adopted them as a means of expressing themselves and their identity. When they use a brown high five, they're not only giving out a high five, they're celebrating the fact that they can.\n\nRetconning these emojis for the sake of simplicity would be a terrible thing to do to the people who use them like that.\n\nThere might be alternatives that represent a step forward though, for example: if every emoji spawned as a random uncontrollable color and society accepted this as a symbol of equality. That would be awesome.",

Camping, cooking, hiking, archery, first aid, rifle & shotgun shooting.. just to name a few. \n\nWith good leaders and friends to go with, as well as parental oversight, kids can learn so many valuable skills in Scouting.\n\nEdit: (holy cow, this blew up) to help explain my vague first sentence.. there were some leaders, and older scouts who violated the trust placed in them, by grooming and assaulting younger Scouts. The BSA, when it was told, tried to deal with it privately, and failed. Instead of being transparent and making a point of not condoning the behaviors, they tried to privately deal with the leaders, and change policies to help the Scouts, and make it more safe; but they didn't publicize why and fully remove these leaders. So, these leaders could just go to a different unit, or violate it again. \n\nThe Scouting program, when done right, is very good.",

            "Imagine the American school system teaching anything that has any resemblance to a firearm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get where you're coming from. I myself am an Eagle Scout. I feel like my parents were afraid of anything like that so I only learned with others who owned firearms. I feel like instead of teaching everyone to fear guns and think they're dangerous meant for killing, we should be teaching how to use them safely, and how to respect the power they have. However, I would not trust public schools or frankly anyone who's not me or a trained professional in teaching my kids about guns. That's why I am going to get as educated as I can, be trained as best I can, and pass on what. I know to my kids. If they want more training, they can go to a professional.\n\nI feel like it just needs to be something that's more normalized to learn at home, instead of fearing the topic.",
            "I am a senior.  When I was a kid, gun safety was a right of passage.  Boy scouts offered a gun use and safety badge.  My high school had a shooting range and schooled its cadet corps in gun use and safety.   I'm not sure if Girl Guides offered gun safety training.  Now, my grand daughters took their training through a (Canadian) government firearms safety course and exam.",
            "I agree. I'm Canadian but discussed this with some friends who grew up in gun crazy towns. At some of those towns' schools, they could teach gun safety in the same manner that sex ed was taught to me: progressively with a focus on safety.\n\nIn early grades, I was taught what my private parts were and how boys and girls were different;. In later grades I went on to learn about the risks of sexual intercourse (pregnancy, STIs, relationships), put condoms on dildos, and where to go if I needed some sexual health assistance. Consent and the ownership of our own bodies was a very important topic.\n\nGun safety could be taught in the same way. Early grades, learn about America's gun culture and gun safety. Middle school and high school, go to shooting ranges and learn how to use guns and reinforce the importance of safety. I know that in some towns, schools are really close to shooting ranges.",

            "100% agree.\n\nAmerica likely has over 400 million guns in circulation. Literally more guns than actual people.\n\nWe know that \"abstinence only\" doesn't work when it comes to drugs and sex... So why do we continue to use the same \"logic\" when it comes to guns. Right now, the only mainstream education on firearms is movies, TV shows, videogames, and media that explicitly hypes real-world violence as a form of entertainment.\n\nEducating people on safe firearm handling, gun laws, responsibilities, and history is absolutely critical. It teaches people how to be proactive defenders of their community through knowledge, because how else can people identify if someone is breaking the laws if they have no ideas what the laws are? How can people know what irresponsible firearm handling looks like if movies constantly use dangerous firearm handling as entertainment?\n\nI'm a super pro-gun liberal minority, and I constantly get berated for my views on guns by people who *obviously* don't know anything on the subject. Our collective knowledge is seriously lacking, and it massively contributes to a lot of problems ranging from racism and police brutality, to gun murders and suicides.",
            "If you're talking solely about the States I think that's fair. Other countries are a completely different story though, and not in any way necessary. I'm 33 and the only guns I've ever seen living in one of the largest cities in Canada is on the hips of police officers. \n\nNothing wrong with learning (especially about safety) but not at all necessary in (I assume) most of the world.",
            "Totally agree. I think it should be treated the same way we teach driver's ed. After all guns are like cars in that they're dangerous tools, sometimes necessary, somewhat complicated to operate as a beginner, and are even in the same price range as many srudents' first cars. They're very accessible and that won't change anytime soon (ever tried repealing an amendment before?), so why not destigmatize them, keep the option open for responsible people to operate them, and make them systemically safer? We already have enough guns to arm every American so why not at least train Americans in their use (albeit in an opt-in manner)? I also learned to shoot in boy scouts and even though I don't have any guns of my own, nor do I really intend to (personally I really like air rifles), going shooting with friends in HS and college was a much safer process because we'd all learned gun safety one way or another. Also we should make bows popular again hahaha, but I'm a big medieval nerd so I feel like that might not catch on the way I want it to. \n\nAlso for the record I'm a liberal, in case anyone was planning on ignoring my points because they think I'm a MAGA hat wearing redneck or something.",

From what I've seen, I know the rules better than most of them. \n\nI support boy scouts though.  Plenty of life lessons and skills to be learn. I think boys should grow up with other boys and have male role models to teach them about being men. I know that's not PC though. Let's have Boy Scouts, Girls Scouts, and Co-Ed Scouts.

We make drivers take a test, get a license, have an age restriction, and keep cars registered. Schools often have driving classes to prepare students, why not guns, especially in areas where they are used more frequently.

So while it was helpful for hunter safety aspects, there was a major portion of the course that was firearms safety. I thought it was state wide requirement, then learned the teacher that taught did so because they lost a friend to a firearms accident because someone thought their gun was unloaded.

What some people don't seem to get is we can outlaw them, but only criminals would have them then.

            "I agree! I live in the UK so no guns here per say, but I was brought up from a very young age on air rifle safety. If kids always treat all guns as loaded and know they're not toys, it can prevent more injury than if you just hide them away.",

            "In more rural places where gun ownership is more prevalent, particularly fathers have to teach their sons to use guns to protect themselves and their property from mainly from animals but also from people. This leads to more responsible adults in the future with hun ownership and use. When you teach a  child and raise it right, there\u2019s very little chance that that child will become a bad person. I agree with you. More people need to be taught to respect guns and have to have it ingrained in them as kids that a gun should only ever be pointed at a person in defense of important things such as people or property. I can pretty much guarantee that gun crime would decrease by a shit metric ton. Get fathers back in the home to teach their kids proper gun safety and proper human behavior. This opinion definitely shouldn\u2019t be unpopular.",
            "I 100% agree. It would help us learn an important skill in the case we find a firearm and need to protect ourselves, and it would be able to help more people understand the importance of having guns and gun safety. It would also make more use out of our partially useless education system.",
            "My American friend took me to the firing range and brought out a large amount of firearms from a duffle bag and I asked him how many times he had to use those guns and you'd be surprised that the answer was less than one.",
            "I agree 100%. I grew up in MA which is a state that has very strict firearms laws and even as a minor I still encountered guns and dangerous handling of them. It's a much better idea to educate the youth about how to recognize what safe and unsafe firearms handling is and how to correct the situation or at the very least when to hit the eject button on the situation. \n\nFor example. My buddy got his MA LTC and bought himself a new pistol. Great. He pointed it at me and pulled the trigger. He laughed and told me \"chill it's unloaded!\" I kicked his ass, dis-armed him and tossed his brand new gun against a brick wall. I had never owned or shot a gun before this, but I knew enough from what my mom (who had some firearms experience) had taught me you don't ever point a gun at anyone for any reason (later on after I bought guns I accepted that you can point and use them against people for defensive purposes). My buddy got all mad at me and all I could tell him is \"don't you ever fucking point that thing at anyone, ever\".\n\nThe only reason I knew what danger I was in was due to my uncle. He did the old take the kid out in the woods, kill a squirrel and show them what guns can do. Not that I'd recommend that method, but it drove home the point to me. Guns kill and they need to be handled safely and responsibly. Doing so is also so simple! Four rules. \n\nKeep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to fire. Always assume all firearms are loaded and treat them as such until proven otherwise. And even once proven unloaded, don't point them at others and pull the trigger. \n\nDo not point the firearm at anything you do not wish to destroy. \n\nKnow your target and ensure what's beyond it will stop the bullet. \n\nKeep your finger off the trigger until you're on target and ready to fire.\n\nFifth rule. No horseplay with firearms.",

I also went shooting on a range to learn how to respect guns and see how much damage they can do. \n\nI do have to admit, I appreciate my mom for teaching me this, as boring as it was to hear the safety talk over and over, every time I see a gun I hear my moms safety talk again.",

You don't have to fire a gun as part of education, I can understand some people never wanting to even touch a firearm, but you should understand the reality of it in terms of ownership, using a gun, etc.\n\nI learned myself in college when I went to a range with a friend, on the basics, then took a proper first steps course down the line.

Water is great, you need it!\n\nEdit: I assumed this post would just die honestly because I thought it would be judged to be a popular opinion, and based on the majority of comments it is generally a pretty popular opinion if not too strong of one for personally insulting people by calling them infantile and immature. I stand by this modification: if you have clean water and insist on drinking something else with a bunch of sugar all the time you are behaving immaturely and childishly. If you do not have access to clean or drinkable water this absolutely doesn't apply. I posted on an old throwaway (not made for this post) because it stemmed from a very recent conversation with a few people who know my main account, and this old throwaway was also a water related AITA (I was judged to be TA, which I ended up agreeing and seeing the other side) so I thought that was a decent use of that old account. Please consider drinking more water and taking some of the suggestions within the comments for how to make it tastier without adding unnecessary sugars to it.",

Yes, socialism is on the same spectrum of communism but there is a big difference between both ideologies but you can argue that socialism is a middle term for socialism but you can have a Socialist Party that doesn't intend on becoming a Communist Party or even implementing a Communist Regime/Society.

            "As someone coming from Russia, and not the rich parts of it but also experiencing Germany for most of my life with some visits in Russia at my grandmas place once a year for several years. I think I am allowed to agree with your opinion because most people truly don't understand it and that goes for both sides.Socialism, and that is something I think is very important, just look at Luxemburg, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway even bigger countries like France and Germany, but also across the world on Singapur. All these countries have social structures veering on how they work and how much they do.But these are all capitalistic countries as well, Sweden is probably one of the most extremes of both. Yes, you read that correctly. Sweden is highly capitalistic but also very socialistic. Because they are not opposing, they are but not directly and not full on.Sweden has in my eyes one of the best political systems, because it did something most people would assume will never work, it is like looking at a big building and wondering what engineering went into it.\n\nBut back to the point. Socialism is not Communism. It literally means to have a fair social structure.But Communism is not good either. It fuels corruption, it fuels power struggles, it is pretty much capitalism but just behind the back. As a German I had a lot of access to data and history about the DDR, the eastern part of Germany, and you see a lot of things happening there that you would assume where highly capitalistic. And they were. Just behind the back. Special hospitals for politicians and important people, fully stocked with food the average person could never get because of shortages would be the prime example. It is a system that wants to make everyone equal, but also a system that allowed for the exact opposite to happen. You see this in extreme in North Korea. You may claim that this is not communism, it is. It just shoes where it goes. The important people there live a lifestyle even above us while 15 to 20 million people suffer. We don't even know the exact amount of people living there.\n\nBut the same goes for capitalism in its pure form it it is not contained. And you see a lot of it in the US. You have family clans, big cooperations, CEOs, etc. controlling the country, indirectly and directly. Capitalism just as Communism share one single thing in common. They allow a oligarchy to happen, to develop, to get a foot in the door and as soon as that happens, good luck changing it back. You pretty much have to wreck everything and start from 0 because these people, even if you take their money, even if you take their company, they will have their knowledge, their network and opportunities. They will fight to gain it back. And this is what most likely will happen in Russia when Putin is gone. It will be a dumpster fire, one you and I both would want to stay as far away from as possible.Russia, China, USA, are all gonna eventually crash politically. They are pretty much GOT but live and without dragons.It's about influence, about power, and about controlling the others.We are all just stupid figures in their game.\n\nI don't even know how you can believe that a extreme system is better than another. I mean there are probably worse ones, like a country lead by some fascists who kill millions of people, especially jews. But I am sidetracking here and you get the point.\n\nI am a firm believer that a system that is a mix of several systems is the best, just as Sweden which I named as one of my favorite examples. If it weren't so far north, I would probably want to live there.What bothers me in such discussions is that people don't realize that they are being played. They are fighting a war for someone else to profit. What do you gain form a full on capitalist country? What do you gain from a full communist country? Nothing.These are not for you, these are for the ruler to abuse. You are just a figure in their power struggles.  \n\n\nEDIT: I just reread it and remembered that I forgot to explain with what I mean communism is just capitalism behind the back.   \nHere are two examples:   \nIn the DDR the government had a special agency that pretty much worked on selling everything they could to other countries. Even things like blood.   \nThe more the country struggled the more willing they were to sell anything, literally their own grandma.  \n\n\nIn North Korea there is also a department / agency which whole job is to lead companies outside of it. You probably heard of the north Korean restaurants outside of NK, mostly in Vietnam, China and other Asian countries. But also pretty much slaveworker companies in Europe and other regions. They send their own people there, forcing them to work, all the pay they get, gets to the construction company that is hid in a way that it is not directly known that they are pretty much just owned by NK. And since NK enforces punishment on all people of a family if one single does something bad, these people are pretty much forced to work as slaves outside their country on the other half of the world, where they could flee, but they don't because at home all their family, their parents, partner, kids would be punished for it.   \nThat is something I would imagine some screwed up capitalism with a oligarchy like we had it centuries ago in most parts of the world would produce. But no, this is literally to what most systems lead to in their extreme.",

            "I'm not sure what my fellow Americans think communism is. Maybe it's authoritarianism/totalitarianism. Maybe they think it's just any society that gives free shit to people. \n\nAmerican politics is weird, we have two parties that are just reflections of each other but their followers hate each other. Not many people understand politics, and will just pick a side. Republicans for the conservative and democrats for the progressives (No the opposite of conservative is NOT liberal. Most if not many American \"liberals\" Don't appear liberal to me).\n\nMany who scream \"that's Communism\" Will say that anytime social welfare is brought up or offered to people. Often a \"fuck the welfare creatures\" Mentality arises and I'll hear things such as \"We should just get rid of welfare, the welfare people don't deserve it\" And I've even heard people say we should neuter them stop them from making more welfare people. \n\nI brought up a candidate I liked, Andrew yang, to one of these people, my mother, and all she had to say was that you can't give people free shit and had a whole rant about the government needs to stop doing that. \n\nNow so far when it comes to taxes, it seems like many people would prefer to keep a hold of their taxes and live in ancapistan before they help feed and cloth the poor. So maybe they would hate communism but I still don't think they quite understand what they're saying when they say, \"The corona virus is leading us to communism,\" Because while now we're all be taking care of by Big Brother, we're not going to become a collective. Worse case scenario, we loose freedoms and become further authoritarian, people will still call that communism, and DC politicians will laugh their asses off at the uneducated majority of Americans.",

People loose frame of reference, when you take money out of the equation. \nLike \u201cwhy work\u201d, or \u201cjust be a janitor\u201d the thing is communism comes from communal living of less than 1000 people per \u201ccommune\u201d living within/amongst millions of other \u201ccommunes\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019re a highly valued person, the community will award you better things, because you\u2019re value to society is greater. You don\u2019t need money, you need cooperation and consent. \n\nJust because there\u2019s no money does not mean people will become lazy, people can actually become free and pursue their skills without restraint. \n\nIn the end, communism might never work at large scale, bc it requires people to change their view of the world, stop being takers, and change to creators. In communism there is no tragedy of the commons because there is a sense of common ownership. \n\nThere is actual communism in Kerala India, and areas in Oregon, Washington, California, and other communities across the world.\n\nThe key is to switch mindset to economy of abundance, eliminate a medium of exchange, and live humbly.

They are their own ideologies, twisted abominations of true marxist ideals.

Hear me out. \n\nThat is because they think that communism is equivalent to the idea in their head of what they think it should and would be like. And there are as many definitions of that as there are communists, because small-c communism as hypothesized/prophesized by Marx has never existed. It is supposed to be the stage of history after Socialism, when \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need\" is the defining principle, and the state \"withers away\" because it is no longer necessary. Basically it is some kind of totally different way of organizing the economy in which classes are abolished and everyone's needs are met. But as far as details, we have no idea because Marx did not actually expound upon what it actually would or should look like. \n\nMoreover, there is no reason to expect, as a non-communist, that this hypothetical production scheme could ever be realized in practice. What we do have are plenty of examples of Marxist-Leninist regimes which implemented authoritarian state socialism. We call these systems Communism with a big-C (but no self-avowed communist regards them as actually communist to my knowledge - they are socialist which is even reflected in their names, like USSR). \n\nHere's the thing - from a realist non-communist or ideological standpoint, for all intents and purposes big-C Communist \\*IS\\* what communism is. Because we have no reason to think that Marx's prophesized next stage of history will ever occur (and even where communist revolutions did occur it was in backwards or third world countries not by the modern industrial proletariat like he thought). \n\nBut because self-avowed communists nearly all \\*disavow\\* actually-existing Communism in the 20th century as \"not real communism, they didn't go far enough\" (insert excuse here), but instead believe that communism is some utopian ideal that in reality will never be achieved, that means that \\*communsits themselves have no clue what communism actually is\\*. What it is, is what we have real world evidence that it is: authoritarian state-controlled centrally planned economies. \n\nCommunists will talk your head off all day about what their ideology says that communism really is. And that's fine, as far as it goes. But realists and skeptics who are concerned about repeating the failures of the past with the millions of dead bodies which resulted from Communist regimes, we need to keep in mind that these are fanatical idealists we're talking about here, and they really don't know what it is they're actually signing up for when (and if) their revolution comes.",

However, we can not ignore the racism or xenophobia of historical figures. It would do a great disservice to history as an academic area of study to do so. By learning and studying about all aspects of historical figures, good and bad, we gain a much better understanding of how the world we live in was shaped.\n\n For example, we can (broadly speaking) look at the racist and classist views of the founders of America, not to demonize them, but to help understand how those views could have influenced the revolution, the early Republic, and the contents of the Constitution. Understanding that gives a groundwork for understanding the social and economic struggles of Americans since then and how Americas currently political reality came to be. \n\nSource: 2 US history teachers I know and Eric Foner's \"Give Me Liberty: An American History\" (the textbook stresses the importance of not looking at the past with rose-colored glasses and frequently looks at what Liberty and freedom meant at various stages in American history as well as the struggles faced by groups)",

Like, I get that maybe we don\u2019t need to go as extreme as erasing people from history because they were racist, but it\u2019s still ok to acknowledge that and remember that its been a constant of human nature for a long time. For example, I don\u2019t give a fuck if we tear down confederate monuments, it\u2019s not going to make us forget who they were and what they thought they stood for, but we don\u2019t need to celebrate it either.",
            "I don\u2019t care about the racist stuff. Like yeah, so they were racist and that\u2019s really bad, but that\u2019s history, we have statues of all sorts of bad people and it\u2019s not like we glorify those aspects. It\u2019s the history that matters.",
            "Judging the actions of the past with the cultural norms and expectations of the present usually doesn't end well. Also, the fact that someone was racist doesn't negate all the good they did, or other positive aspects. Thomas Jefferson? Horribly racist, believed blacks were a lower species. That's terrible. You know what's not terrible? The Declaration of Independence. Hitler? Terrible person, decent artist. The world isn't black and white, and people aren't either."

        "selftext": "Gaming has a bad reputation for being addictive and frowned upon by parents since their kids seem to always be gaming and not doing anything productive. Although gaming can be addictive and a time sink, I argue that it's still much better to have a society interested in gaming, especially young adults, than all obsessed with social media and YouTube instead. Of course gamers also use social media and YouTube, but I'm talking about the hardcore users of these other mediums where they don't game and use that time to consume these other mediums more instead.\n\nSocial Media: Young adults using social media is terrible for their mental health. Apps like Instagram makes them feel like they need to show off fake affluence, stuff, or go on unnecessary trips to keep up with the Joneses. They need to document their life just because everyone else is and if they don't document it in a way that looks appealing to others , they're afraid of being judged. This is bullshit. On the other hand, if these people didn't put so much emphasis on social media and just games instead, there is no stupid competition between friends since the gamer doesn't value dumb stuff like that as much. They're too involved with the games to be interested in petty and vapid competition between peers.\n\nYouTube: Yes, everyone watches YouTube. But non-gamers who put more time into YouTube I argue can be bad depending on the content they consume. YouTube has all sorts of content, but a lot of the content is paid propaganda to influence people to believe their political agenda. A lot of channels try to get kids to fall down an alt-right rabbit hole without them even realizing that it's happening, they're just browsing videos on YouTube to kill time then all of a sudden they have these right-wing beliefs that they probably wouldn't have if they didn't fall down a rabbit hole. \n\nHuge channels are funded by organizations to spread influence about their political beliefs, it's not a fair balance. Google doesn't care as long as they're getting paid. If these impressionable young adults were just playing video games, they'd stay away from the politics for the most part and disinformation out there. They wouldn't be as vested into these channels and spend their focus on improving on games.",

            "Most of the 30 something year olds with kids understand because we were the first group to get to experience how fucking awesome gaming became to be. We were the first to truly get to enjoy the internet combined with gameplay. At the same time, we were  some of the first to use social media at its first peak. Moderate gaming can keep you sane from this world of hurt. Social media does the exact opposite....",
            "i still believe that almost everything is okay in moderation. being on social media every once in a while or watching youtube is fine as long as you don\u2019t let it influence or control your life. on the other hand, gaming can be a big problem if you get too addicted to it.",

They thought it was dangerous for children for all the same reasons they give about gaming today. \n\nKeep on gaming!",

I\u2019ve seen gamers sit in the dark all day and hardly eat anything. Also, if you don\u2019t have food, buy food and play the games you already have. \n\nIf you\u2019re favorite games aren\u2019t satisfying to you, the game isn\u2019t the problem. You probably need to clear your mind. \n\n(This is coming from someone who regrets selling their Xbox, but did learn how to meditate.)",

            "I'd argue it's just as fucked up that corporations like Riot and Tencent are earning billions off of micro transactions. Gaming as an industry is built off of getting kids addicted.\n\nThat's not to say social media and YouTube don't work off the same business model, but I kind of find it disingenuous to act as if it's fine to let kids play with what are basically just more child-friendly slot machines. I used to be an avid gamer, and I honestly kind of cringe looking at any game now, how much manipulation goes into keeping the player hooked. \n\nYes, games can be a great escape and a good way for awkward kids to socialize, but let's not act like most of them aren't being sent into the world by anything other than greedy corporations looking to suck as much money out of their young clientele as possible.\n\nEdit: to be clear, I'm not saying gaming is bad. I am saying that we shouldn't ignore who's making them and why. Companies like EA don't care about making good games, they just care about selling their yearly updates to players and tempting them into buying card packs to get that one awesome player for their team.",

            "I don't have any issues with my kids (teens) gaming as long as it doesn't cut into their responsibilities and being part of a family.  I often tell them, \"You need to come out and do 'life' for a while. It definitely has bothered me how much they have played during distancing, but I finally realized how much they really are socializing with their friends while they play.  I wouldn't be bothered if they had friends over and played Monopoly for hours on end every day.  I mean, what else are they supposed to do for hours upon hours a day?  Go outside and kick a soccer ball against the wall?   \n\nI prefer that they play games vs. living on social media.  I'm happy they aren't comparing their lives to what their friends' look like or tracking all the drama & gossip.  My youngest kid has a mouth on him and he's had some pretty real blowouts with a couple friends and he's one of those that bangs on the desk and yells when he gets worked up.  I don't love that, but it still seems better than them freaking out and raging about what so and so said on Instafy or Snapbook or whatever. \n\nGaming got a bad reputation when a couple of people claimed some kids' violence was the result of violent games.  Maybe that played a factor but there were so many other things wrong.  I think that has kind of subsided and the concern these days is more their physical health.  Digital devices get as much flack because kids (and the rest of us) live in them instead of living in the world.  So many claims that technology is bad and is ruining humanity.  But all that evil technology is what kept most of the world going around when this evil virus took over. \n\nThere is a lot of value in video games, and there is in social media as well.

And it is easier for parents to see what games are appropriate and inappropriate. And porn has been proven to increase suicide rates. So has social media.

Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkessian have been hired multiple times as advisors, whether you agree with them or not we can all agree that they are highly political.\n\nThe YouTube rabbit hole rubbish has been disproven so many times it's ridiculous.

Multiplayer games have the same platform as all social media, as in that you can get yelled at, insulted, critiqued, badmouthed, etcetera. You can put on a persona, pretend to be someone else. You also have the power of anonymity, making it very easy to say things you normally wouldn't say to someone's face. It is pretty similar, if not completely the same as facebook and instagram. Just as toxic, just as dangerous. Tbh, it resulted in when people now tell me that they play multiplayer games, I'm already a bit reserved..

Theres absolutely no reason a middle schooler would need social media. \nAnd yes multiplayer games can be toxic but u can turn off the mic and mute players. U can literally mute any player any time in any game.

            "#This is so true:\n\nTL;DR at bottom\n\nIMO, something like Minecraft has the power to heal people mentally and emotionally; Just the *mere ability* to take an either randomly generated or fixed world seed and be able to terraform, build upon, or destroy the terrain you're given is an incredible thing, and empowers people to freely and indepently express their vision for how say, their base looks.\n\nMinecraft has been there for me for what feels like my entire life and, whenever I'm in hard times, I just come on here and slowly transform my base according to my procedurally calculated desires and that always helps me out in terms of mental and emotional health. With something like Minecraft or Terraria, you get basically total and complete control of the world to modify at your leisure and according to *your* vision. Noone can tell you exactly how you *need* to make *your* base to satisfy *their* vision. It's up to you how you place and destroy each individual block; Whether or not to keep imperfections, *you* decide if you priortise aesthtics or function.\n\nWith social media on the other hand, especially with subs such as r/NoahGetTheBoat, r/mrpresidentthebutton, etc., I frequently find myself seeing some of the outlandishly horrible things human beings are doing right now and slowly losing faith that we can actually make morally good decisions. It's always headlines like \"6yo raped and body hidden\", or something *outright* ***disgusting*** like that; Don't get me wrong, social media *does* have its value; if you follow subreddits similar to the likes of r/eyebleach, you often find yourself looking at cute images of animals, which definitely helps restore faith, but, the vast majority of social media, at least that I'd argue anyway, is just horrible headlines, pedophiles deciding it would be a **great** idea to try and make screwing children acceptable, and just so many things that make me want to commit mass genocide and end us all.\n\nTL;DR: Games like Minecraft do more to actually help heal people such as myself emotionally and mentally, and the types of things I see on social media makes me want to kill everyone; If you actually read the whole thing, thanks for reading.",

            "Keeping in mind the risks involved in [severe gaming addiction](https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/teen-video-game-addict-dies-after-marathon-session-report/), I would say that everything is good in moderation. However social media compared to gaming is a little bit stretching, although we can all agree social media is in general a medium very prone to erroneous behaviors and adverse side-effect to its users.\n\nI for one found social media is a big no-no for everyone that likes to keep their sanity intact. I've been addicted to social media once, and it wasn't something I'm proud of. Now that I've stopped using it all that much, I became an observer of those who play social media a lot and to be honest, I don't like hanging around them so much. There is always this air of \"judge or be judged\" about them. They would sometimes make snide remarks about people, too sensitive to anyone saying anything remotely judgemental (because they've been conditioned to care too much about what people say) and every single decision they make usually would require some social media value in it (have to post it to Instagram, TikTok, or whatever).\n\nWhen it comes to video games, though, it requires a lot more elaborate discussion. You've got to remember that even in video games, you have 2 big categories that often define your experience: single-player and multiplayer games. This comes before game genres. Multiplayer games have a lot of social elements built into it, so the effects on people's psyche could be just as bad as social media especially when the game chat feature in the game is a lot more comprehensive than it needs to be. Voice chat is also a kind of sh\\*tshow on certain games.\n\nNevertheless, I can still see the value in competitive video games: it teaches you to humble yourself every now and then to know no matter how good you think you are, there is someone out there that will beat yo' ass up in a duel when you least expect it. I think this is a necessary bitter antidote especially for young folks, to learn how not to get ahead of yourself. I certainly got myself a lot hard-learned humility after I got myself rekt by random strangers online over and over again. It teaches you how to play fair too, and how to be wary of people who play dirty.\n\nSingle player games however, is a slightly different story. All it adds up to is a highly personal experience tailored to you by developers of the game with no fluff of social interaction. The experience you'll be getting on a single-player games will highly depend on the work being put by the devs to entertain or inspire you by its gameplay, story, and characters. This is especially true for RPGs. I believe this is also a very good interactive medium to learn the world by means of metaphor; to understand and follow a certain character's story arc, observe their journey and follow their struggle through, is to learn to put yourself in another person's shoes by means of role-playing them. You could also learn a lot about other cultures, architecture, technology, firearms, mythical creatures, legends and what not by realistic/historical things being put into video games. It is I think a very good learning experience for everyone, young people and adults alike. Believe it or not, I found out many things I didn't know about a particular culture/nation and eventually willing to learn more about them solely by trying out a game that depicts their cultural heritages and what not.\n\nVideo game is certainly a very interesting medium, that, if used correctly, have a lot of potential to teach yourself a lot of things about life. Certainly a lot more than what social media could ever do. That's truly arguable, seeing how much good coming up from social media on occasion, but still, I stand with the position that social media in general is a negative force. Or if you want an expert take on it, paraphrasing what I read from a book by Jaron Lanier, social media is at the end of the day a medium that does best in creating an illusion of great purpose and utility when in reality it isn't always the case.",

            "I think I agree basically. I think gaming whether multiplayer or not can be far more engaging and less of a time suck. There's just something inherently draining and addicting about social media that I don't find with games. I find it a lot more productive to play Metroid Fusion for six hours than to browse Twitter for that. I'm tired so I'm having a hard time thinking but I think this is a fairly complicated issue. I think gaming can be just as addicting and bad as social media so idk. I think the idea of interacting with people on social media makes the prospect of using it far more interesting and addictive than gaming. I don't play games with people, I only play them along so maybe for others interacting with friends is the best part of playing a game. For me there is something about interacting with people without ever actually speaking with them that is addicting and disturbing.",

            "I think you missed a bigger advantage of gaming over social media and YouTube: real social activity. \n\n\nGaming has this entire subculture around playing multiplayer with friends or just hanging out on voice chat and talking with your friends while playing single player. My most social time in my whole childhood, when I started making real friends was when kids my age all started getting into halo 3 and CoDV on XboxLive.\n\n\nObviously social media can be social but there is a performative element that hurts more than helps. Forget about it completely on YouTube. If you're going to sit inside on the computer it's certainly healthier to do it with some kind of social activity and connection with trusted people rather than just passively consuming video.",

            "I agree. Gaming for me as always been a great stress reliever. Whether the game was Dragon Age or Mario Kart, I always felt calmer and even happier after playing a round or two. \n\nI think gaming gets a bad rap thanks to the amount of toxicity that's associated with online gaming and the aggressive/competitive nature of e-sports communities. You also need to factor in that gaming has been around longer than social media and YouTube; therefore, more people are inclined to know what videogame is and been exposed to more of its related media. Most of that exposure casts videogames in a negative light by either addressing a concern over proper content guidelines or trying to blame tragic events on videogames. That's despite of all evidence that proves gaming in moderation to be beneficial for the development of social skills, help with anxiety and stress, and as a learning tool for children with ADHD and other learning disabilities.",

This can lead to kids not making friends (I know it\u2019s possible to make friends on games, but the amount of kids playing single player or playing against toxic people twice their age without any meaningful interaction is quite astounding) I know many parents who are seriously worried about their kid\u2019s social skills, grades at school, physical activity, sleeping habits, and just general well-being and development because they play games from the moment they get back from school until late at night. From what I\u2019ve seen this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with social media as much. I know that gaming addictions are probably symptoms of kids\u2019 social anxiety or other issues, but they definitely exacerbate the issue hugely.

It was easy as hell.\n\nI\u2019ve watched countless educational videos on music, and game development too. And don\u2019t even get me started on language learning. Literally almost any major-ish language you could ever want to learn has a someone who made a channel to teach their native language. I\u2019ve found Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French literally anything\n\nPhilosophy too. There are some great channels dedicated to teaching certain kinds of philosophy that I\u2019ve watched.\n\nWriting tutorials, book talks, honestly I could go on forever about how incredible YouTube is as a resource.

            "I think the gist of your assessment is correct, but I think video games are worse than the gaming community likes to admit. I'm a former therapist, and an avid gamer, so I feel like my experience is particularly relevant to this argument. \n\nGranted, I don't think sitting around watching TV is a better hobby than gaming. All of these \"consumption\" hobbies are based around taking in the content of others. That means you're exposed to the manipulation you're talking about; everyone wants you to buy something or sell you an ideology. Very few people actually want to empower you with the truth so you can make your own decisions. \n\nEven video games can be full of propagandistic brainwashing. They're definitely full of mechanics that create a false feeling of accomplishment, which assuages a mechanism in your brain that is responsible for stimulating *real* accomplishment. And that's to say nothing of the problems that mechanics like loot boxes cause. \n\nVideo games are essentially the hypothetical \"pleasure button\" that many will push instead of performing productive tasks. One common definition of addiction is when you put off things you *must* do (work, eat, sleep, socialize, etc) for the addictive action. I'm sure every gamer has experienced this to some degree. Have you ever stayed up late because you were trying to beat a boss? Have you ever skipped a meal or been late to work because you were too involved in a game? \n\nIn moderation, these are minor addictive tendencies that won't significantly impact your life in a negative way. But many people do not moderate these behaviors, and while we may not see the physically destructive effects of a chemical addiction, we can see the negative impact it has on their physical fitness, diet, earning potential, mental health, and so on.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I don't want to see a bunch of regulations thrown down into the industry because of the damaging effects video games have. I think it's the art form with the greatest potential of all forms of media. But I think there is a middle ground we have to find as gamers where it's okay to talk about the drawbacks of gaming. I know I personally would rather my son have a hobby that at least keeps his body in shape as opposed to the relatively intangible benefits that video games can have, but I would also like to see the art form continue to grow in a healthy way.",

If you're using 80/20 meat then cheese flows with the fat and enhances the flavor. If you use cheddar cheese it should be a single slice per 1/2 lb which is a lot less than most people use on a burger. For more lean meats you want less cheese. The fat from fattier burgers actually melds with the cheese and makes it spread into the burger. \n\nNow if you have veggies you want even less cheese.",

This has gotten so prevailing that most places don't even have hamburgers on the menu. I have to order a cheeseburger with no cheese. And sometimes when I order a burger \"plain\" they put cheese on it because they think a plain burger includes cheese.",
            "You could tell the same argument with ketchup, lettuce or anything you put in.",
            "Well you just answered your own issue there, didn't you?\n\n\"(Depending on what you like)\" \n\nCheese is a topping, just like the others. I like tomatoes on mine, but don't like onion unless it's some I sliced myself. I slice very thin, then leave them soaking in a container of red wine or balsamic vinegar, so they're flavorful and very soft. Also, I use sweet onions instead of red. Some people can't stand pickles. Some love dill, while others can only handle bread & butter pickles. Some love BBQ, some ketchup and mustard, some mayo. \n\nYour opinion here is probably unpopular, but really it's less \"cheese shouldn't be on burgers\" than \"I don't like cheese on them.\" To some, cheese enhances the flavor.\n\nThe various types of cheese and types of burger can make a difference, too. A melty and thick cheese may be less your style, but maybe a more savory and solid cheese would work. Maybe thin sliced asiago? Or maybe no cheese is best for you, just like no onion is best for me.",

That is, a single host in front of camera and occasionally in front of an audience, cooking recipes and teaching the audience how to cook.\n\nThe resulting dishes were generally set out to be as appealing as possible to get the viewer to want to eat said food but more importantly, watch the show tomorrow or next week or whatever. They weren't cooking up simple, inexpensive, healthy food for the most part. They were were cooking up dishes to make you drool, in the same way that porn serves up images of sex that make you horny.\n\nThus \"food porn\" as a phrase was born. It wasn't art, it was pornography. But with food instead of sex. While I agree that \"food porn\" as a phrase isn't appealing and doesn't make me hungry, I understand the context and why it's used.

            "Sooo it\u2019s fine to a point. \n\nHere is my little stream of consciousness about my life. I was okay doing this (working in a job you dislike) until recently. \n\nI am 33, and graduated with a degree in finance back in 2010, worked in banking my whole career (talking treasury/risk at commercial banks), then worked my way up to a job at the Fed. I hated it, but I was doing it because my family was not exactly rich, and my father had medical issues and it was kind of given he would be seriously ill within ten years. So I worked my way through college and worked my way up to a good paying job at the Fed over the course of my 20s. I was trying to put myself in a good financial position to support my family when the time came. Eventually, I paid off my debt and my brother and sister also landed good jobs so in early 2019 I decided it was time to quit and do something for me. I traveled around the world for a year... or so that was the plan. I hiked the pacific crest trail, and the week I got back, I found out my dad was terminal. I had already had travel plans to go to Spain and later to Asia, but most of my travel now got changed to simply be there for my family. I made sure to be home for Thanksgiving and Christmas and ultimately just stopped traveling all together after Christmas. \n\nI decided to start applying for jobs that I *wanted* to do (things like grant writing for nonprofits etc) but I had almost no experience in the field and because I worked so much O barely had any significant volunteer work to make my oddball finance resume stand out to a development manager. Fast forward three months, lockdown comes and I saw the writing on the wall for an economic downturn, so I had started applying to similar roles to what I had done for 9 years. I landed a job that started March 30 where I have been working ever since. My dad is still kicking around, but the reality of the expenses of healthcare in the US is more than anyone should have to face in five lifetimes. This whole ordeal has inspired my to get involved in politics. \n\nAnyways, I guess the moral of the story- if you are not doing what you want to do with your life, fix that right now *if you can*. You might not get a second chance. I am so thankful that I made the leap to travel while I could last year, because had I waited one more year... well we all know how international travel is working out right now and for the foreseeable future. Oh and call your dad and tell him you love him.",
            "Not to look down on it.  But truth be told, you\u2019re going to be spending most of your waking hours within your career. \n\nI think it\u2019s great to choose a first career for the money.  But if you are doing that, make sure you SAVE MONEY.  That way you can transition later on to doing things you enjoy without needing to worry about money.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to wake up one day age 45 wanting to do something different and not have the freedom to be able to do so.",
            "A lot of people who pursue a career linked to what they are passionate about end up hating their passion. My degree is in Multimedia Design and many of my friends from college ended up working for or owning web development or graphic design companies and they hate it now.\n\nThey don't work on what they want, they feel their artistic integrity is always being compromised, they work to unreasonable deadlines, and say the client always thinks they know design better than they do. I chose to teach Design which allows me to keep it as a hobby and still use what I learned to make money, the best of both worlds in my opinion. They earn more money than me, but I'm a lot happier and still enjoy my hobby. And I get a lot more holidays!\n\nSometimes it's better to work during the day to allow yourself to pursue your hobbies in your time off, is the point I was trying to make before the whole self-indulgent waffle.",

If you're in it for the money, then you just want money and don't care about the consequences of your job. For example: let's say I want to be a journalist or a politician. Both these jobs have the power to change society. If you're personally motivated to become one or the other, you do that most likely because you value that people are informed with accurate information (journalism) or that you want to make policy that does something good for your citizens (politics). If you're in it for the money, you don't care about that and that's a shame because the power of these jobs can be used for good. \n\nWith that said, I need to nuance myself: there are a lot of jobs that aren't like journalism or politics and that don't impact society that much. Furthermore, I want to say that even if I think differently, your career choices are your business and I don't have any right to say anything of it. So you do you and if you're in it for the money: good for you!",
            "I personally think it has to be a mix. You need some interest/passion especially if the job is stressful/competitive but money is a good motivator. At least for me I removed any job with low income ceilings and out of the rest found what I was interested in",

            "I completely agree, passion isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere in life unless you have a viable passion and luck on your side. I would rather have financial security and be able to raise a family on a good salary then be trying to fend for myself. IT may not be your interest but it pays well. It is easy to find a job as long as you have work experience. Go for it!",

Every time I\u2019d tell my family what I wanted to do in life id get shot down and told my dreams weren\u2019t feasible. It made me stagnant and fearful of the future. Now I\u2019m pursuing my passions and I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time. But I see where you\u2019re coming from and I hope it works out for you. Edit: spelling.",
            "The bottom line is: does it make you happy? If making money makes you happy, that's fine. The trouble comes when people chase dollar signs while deep down they have different priorities like a work life balance, for instance. As someone who grew up poor, it makes sense to me that someone would want more money. Money = security."

We didn\u2019t have money growing up but it was never a thought they would charge me, helping out yeah. My parents never wanted us to start life behind. I understand the aspect of teaching kids money mngmt but they taught me in various other ways rather than nickel and dime me. My friends were all in the same boat and now 20-25 years later we are the ones that are much more established and have a solid footing financially. I see my American friends still paying debts into their 40s because they could never get over that hump. Help out your kids as much as you can and set them up for success, I never understood why that concept was looked down upon.",

            "Yeah maybe. Also a 15 year old kid shouldn't be giving their first earnings to their immature parents. I grew up paying rent at 15. It didnt teach me anything about money because that wasnt my parents goal. Their goal was to have to spend less feeding me and my siblings or use it on their dinner dates or god knows what else. If you're going to take your kids money atleast teach them something. Or put everything they ever give you in a savings account or stocks. In general its just wrong.\n\nEdit: Didnt think this would blow up! To add to my comment for others to understand more... Yes, I was in a low income family. My mom worked often 3 jobs and my step dad 1. They had 5 kids to 'raise'. On top of helping my mom run her parrot rescue (feeding and caring for almost 30 birds at a time) doing all my chores and making dinner almost every night... I had way too many responsibilities as a *kid*. I had no problem helping my family out but my parents had their favourites. Some of my siblings helped and some of us got off scotch free. To me thats messed up. My step dad also insisted I \"didn't save my money\" yet took my money for rent and often times stole my money too (never paid me back either and gaslights me about it). Yeah, my parents were pretty shitty and still are tbh. Im glad Im not alone in this yet sad so many are cause its a really garbage feeling to have.",
            "Couple thoughts.     \n1. Charging rent to a kid under 18 is wrong.   \n2.  If the family is having hard financial times, it IS appropriate to ask any able-bodied individual to help support the families basic needs.    \n3.  It is appropriate to ask the teen (15-17, working age) to pay for any extras out of their own pocket. This could include cell phone, car, car insurance, gas, clothing, etc. usually done if the family is struggling with money.   \n4.  All of this also assumes the parents aren\u2019t wasteful. If dad is spending $100/week on smokes and beer then I call bullshit.",
            "I started paying rent at 18, when i started getting benefits from the gov, my folks told me it was to teach me and give me practice in all that rent, bill paying routine. One problem though, I\u2019ve never actually payed them by myself, my mum has access to my bank account, and can just take my rent out herself the day i get paid before i even wake up in the morning. I\u2019m 20 years old now, and still have no financial literacy, because i\u2019ve never had to do adult stuff with my money before. I\u2019m planning to get my mum out of the my bank account sometime this/next year. So my money can actually be MY money, and i can learn how to do these things myself, like the grown ass man i am. \n\nMoral of the story; if ya gonna make ya kid pay rent, tell them the amount they gotta hand over, then let THEM count it out, and let THEM send/hand it over. Too many of my friends are also in my boat of not knowing how to handle money cause their parents do it for them, leaving them with no opportunity to learn  how to do this by themselves.",
            "I live in Canada and never even heard of kids under 18 paying rent.\n\nIf the child has graduated and is working and the family needs help paying the bills, I think it's fine. Most parents here wouldn't ask for full rent though, just some contribution. When my mom was a teen, she had to get an after-school job to help her family out since her dad didn't make much money. But it wasn't considered rent, just helping the family out. I think if the parents are low-income, it's fine to ask their teen to work part-time to help out.\n\nAs for treating them like tenants, well, here anyway, if you share a bathroom and kitchen with your landlord you are not covered under the tenancy act. I also suspect you are not doing everything a tenant would do: paying full market value for the room, cooking for yourself, doing your own cleaning and laundry. So you can't expect to be treated like a tenant.",
            "Most of the time people seems that they wanted a baby, not a son or daughter. Once you grow up it seems that they regret having a kid and parents start doing bs like this.",
            "I assume this is an American problem. I am from Europe and have never heard of this. Here, parents have to care for their children until 26 if they're studying or until they get a job. It seems crazy to me that I should, as an 18 year old, pay rent, when I am not even out of high school. And even when at uni, parents usually pay their children's rent. My cousin, for example, lived with her parents until 27 and didn't have to pay her rent like this either. That is maybe why we don't have crazy student loans and why we enter adult life financially stable.",
            "My mom tried to charge me rent at 16 so I did, in fact, move out. I couch surfed for three months until my friend's parents called my mom and asked about adopting me.\n\nShe didn't charge me rent after that. Guess it was a shock to find out I wasn't totally unwanted in this world lmao.",
            "When I started working a summer job in 1975, at the age of 14, my stepfather started charging me rent. It was 50% of my checks, or $100 a month, whichever was more. Then when winter came around and I got laid off, he kept charging me rent throughout the winter. Once my savings was used up he started a tab. When summer came and I started working again I owed him a couple months back rent.  I moved out when I turned 16. Fuck you Phil, next time I'm near the cemetery I'll swing by and piss on your grave again.\n\nEdit: Because $100.00 a month doesn't sound like that much now, I found an inflation calculator, that would be just under $530.00 a month in today's dollars.

I find no matter what, children by and large have an expectation of privacy that basically does not exist. And even *renters* don't have an absolute expectation of privacy. Simply because you live there does not make the property yours, and the law favors the landlord, not the renter. Ask any lawyer.\n\nBut I do agree with you, OP, if a parent is a big enough piece of shit to charge their kid rent, then yes, there is a greater expectation of a renter-landlord relationship. But that's a double-edged sword, dude. What if they are late on rent or refuse to pay it at all? Can the parent evict the child, just as a landlord can evict a tenant who won't pay rent? There is also verbiage in standard leases regarding the behavior of the tenant. Landlords can dictate their tenants keep the place clean, not smoke, etc. or face eviction.

Us younger people don\u2019t get a discount on utilities and rent because it\u2019s just expected that parents pay for the majority of their kids expenses but it\u2019s also perfectly legal to kick them out or charge them horrendous amounts of rent. There is no cap on it and I think a cap on how much you can charge your children for rent should definitely be enforced everywhere as well.\n\nThe whole \u2018charge your children rent\u2019 thing altogether should be illegal if your child is under 25 and still in education. If they\u2019re considered a dependent then by law their parents should be paying for stuff but dependent student laws for both the UK and US don\u2019t do anything for students, all they do is fuck them over. None of them actually enforce what the law expects of parents, they just assume that ALL parents do that. But that law is perfectly willing to make damn sure that students who are struggling to eat or are disabled and can\u2019t work and can barely pay rent do not get any kind of financial help even if they are estranged from their parents. These laws make damn sure that they will pay out the least amount possible. \n\nIt should really be extremely socially unacceptable for parents to be greedy, selfish pricks and ask their children who are still in education for money or to not support their under 25 year old children the second they move out.",

            "Dad here.... \n\nIf you yell at your kids all the time they will yell back and over time you just changed how your child handles conflict.  Raising your voice as a parent should only be considered after you have exhausted your options to address your child and/or if your child is behaving in a way that could be dangerous to his/herself or others.  \n\nNot sure how I did it but if I raise my voice or change the tone my kids know I am getting mad at their behavior and they immediately reconsider their course of action.  I've only actually yelled possibly once or twice at my kids and I try very very hard to reserve those moments for peak instances of disobediance. Raising the tone of your voice, if done sparingly replaces the need to scream, yell or look like you lose control of the situation.  \n\nIn public places I don't vocally correct my children rather they get pulled aside and spoken to.  Discipline is reserved for the home, in private where we can talk through what happened and restrictions/punishments are handed out.  Nothing done at the moment of peak anger usually is good. \n\nBTW:  Raised by a stern latin mother and scottish father.  I was disciplined with a belt, belt buckle, spoon, etc.",
            "Yelling all the time will just have diminishing returns. It may work when the child is younger but once they are able to effectively argue their point, you\u2019re left just yelling back and forth and getting no where. \n\nThat said, my dad was very quiet, so a raised voice was definitely effective on me.",

Would you put your own interest before anyone else's?

For instance, I(27F) am happily married with 2 kids, working as a teacher, but I've decided I don't want to be a teacher anymore, so I'm preparing to study medicine. Most parents would be so happy to know their child is taking that path, but I don't want to tell them, just in case they'll judge. Same happened when my husband proposed, when I fell pregnant both times. I had to rehearse the story several times in my head before telling them. \n\nI do occasionally yell at my kids when they'rebeing really naughty.

            "Damn right. I wish more people, especially immigrant families (I'm Indian), would realize this. Fear and intimidation is no way to help your kid rectify their mistakes. Rather than facilitating your kid's learning and growth, this teaches them that certain behaviour will result in angry tirades from the big, scary, powerful adults in the house. They will seek to avoid such tirades at all costs. Firmly but calmly explaining *why* their behaviour needs to be fixed is the way to go. \"Tough love\" parents often repeat the same bullshit- that parents are not friends. This could not be further from the truth. A parent's duty extends well beyond their legal and moral compulsion to provide food and shelter for their children. A parent should be a loving, supportive, and when necessary, firm presence who acts as a mentor and companion.\n\nI maintain that no problem in human history has ever been solved by people losing their temper. Getting disproportionately angry will NEVER help matters. I used to have a really, really bad temper, and it took me many years to realize how many bridges that temper ended up burning down.",
            "This reminded me of this:\"When you're apologising you have to stand up straight so that your journey as a human can be straight.\" It basically means you should not have to do things to humiliate you or make you lose your confidence and can't raise your head to look people inthe eye and in this case, definitely being yelled at would make you lose confidence.",

But I'm getting better and no matter what, my kids and I always sit down and talk about what happened.",

I'v always found that simply talking or at the most if needed to raise your voice slightly for e.g telling your child to get onto the path when playing with their friends in the street is more effective than yelling, I also would use the naughty step but now my child is older I use a 3 sanction rule: 3 sanctions through the week for being naughty causes them to not have their electronics such as tablet or computer games on the weekend.

They love my siblings and me, and they are supportive of us in almost anything we do. However, my dad is able to get angry very easily, and my mom thinks she needs to know every little detail about what we do. I think it all boils down to my parents having really high standards for us, but my sibling can\u2019t handle it. We are all fairly smart children, so I am fine with the high standards, but I do get a little annoyed when I get yelled at for getting a B on a single standard in math. When my sibling, who, no offense to them, isn\u2019t as bright as me in the subjects they cover in school (they love art and are amazing at it, but just don\u2019t have the love for most of the other subjects that you need to be really exceptional at them), is held to the same standards, they crack. On one particularly bad occasion, they were playing with their friends. They had forgot to do a homework assignment, and that had lowered their grade in that class. My dad told them to work on it a few times, but they forgot to each time (they would finish their game, but they would forget to stop and do the homework, as they are rather forgetful). I don\u2019t know the whole story, but it eventually got to a point where my sibling had a panic attack under their desk, and could barely breathe, while my parents kept banging on the door (My sibling locked the door). On this occasion, I don\u2019t believe either side is completely in the right, as my sibling should have just put down the game for a bit if they realized they kept forgetting, but this definitely didn\u2019t help their relationship. There were a few other incidents like this, but none this bad. \nAs I mentioned, my mom likes to know ever little detail about our lives. I do think as our parents, she deserves to know some of this stuff, but she definitely took it too far. Last year (before they wanted to be called they instead of she), my sibling had just started dating someone (the dude ended up being a atonal creep who asked girls all around the school for nudes, and had random panties in his room). Because it was their first time dating anyone, my sibling was nervous to tell my parents. My mom, for whatever reason, decided to search my sibling\u2019s phone one day, without any warning or telling them, and found out about them dating. My mom didn\u2019t act too irrationally, but she did act like my sibling was completely in the wrong for not telling her about it, when my sibling had barely started dating. Again a few more incidents like this happened (when my sibling broke up with the dude because he was a creep, when they realized they were lesbian, and when they started dating someone else), and these all added up to make my sibling not trust my parents enough to tell them anything important, so much so that my sibling hasn\u2019t told my parents that they prefer different pronouns from what my parents call them, and just live with being called she.\n\nTLDR: My parents have made my sibling not trust them so much that my sibling hasn\u2019t told them they prefer different pronouns. (And a lot of useless run on sentences.)\n\n(Ps: if anyone has any ideas of what I could do to help with this situation, that would be greatly appreciated. I have talked with my sibling, but I will respect their decision to not tell my parents, so I can\u2019t think of what else I could do to help.)",

            "Coming from some experience (as the kid), I think the most common reactions are either \u201csubmitting\u201d to people when you are being yelled at (as you mentioned), or actually doing the opposite and being overly aggressive back to the person yelling at you or someone else, especially if your parents fought a lot (which my parents did/do).\n\nIt\u2019s also usually in that order too because, a lot of these kids look like they are submitting and just letting the words fly right over their heads but, in reality, they are actually catching every single word and letting them build up (kinda like a fishing net that you never take out of the water; it just sits there and racks up more and more fish) until they ultimately explode and let it all out.",

He has had less and less to do with me since I really just stopped being a whipping post through a mixture of ignoring him and telling him to fuck off when he pressed the issue. \n\nAlso, a lot of the screamers are classic bullies who rely on the fear of people who can\u2019t physically challenge them.

It's abuse.\n\nI was finally old enough at age 13 to understand that my father is a child abuser.\n\nI took a summer job delivering newspapers, back when that was a thing.\n\nAnyway... all summer I was dealing with angry customers who didn't want to pay for their subscriptions because their papers were always late.  My mother looked into this and found that the old drunk who dropped the papers for me to deliver was doing so between 8-9am.... way too late.\n\nSo, when school started in September, I was showing up for class between 9-10 after delivering as fast as I could.  That lasted a week then they threatened to suspend or expel me. \n\nTalked to my boss.  He promised to drop my papers first, but nothing changed.  I had to quit.\n\nOn my father's next court mandated custody weekend, I told him about all that happened.    When he heard I quit the job, he was cooking breakfast and I was sitting at the kitchen table.  He didn't even look at me.  He just spun around and threw the cast iron frying pan, full of food and hot grease at me.\n\nI dodged it, or he didn't aim well, I can't remember.  He stormed out.  My stepmonster (the drunk, gold-digging whore he knocked up two years before) was hiding just outside the room; listening, as she often does.\n\nAt that point she came in tell to me what a disappointment I am, my father is ashamed of me, I have no work ethic, lazy, .... you get the idea.\n\nThat's when I realized, I've been mortally afraid of him since as far back as I can remember, not because I'm a bad person; rather because he's a despicable person and a horrible excuse for a parent.",

            "Boomer here. My parents were yellers and screamers. My father would start talking quietly about something I did or didn\u2019t do that he wanted to correct and over 45 minutes would work himself into screaming, yelling, pounding things and threatening violence. Somehow he thought this was motivating. They were also hugely into deliberate shaming as they thought it worked. No. My father would say awful things to me like if I missing a few blades of grass with the hand trimmer (no weed whackers yet) when I was 11, this meant that I can do nothing right and will be lucky to ever find a job \u201cshoveling shit.\u201d A \u201cD\u201d in math on a report card, \u201cYou\u2019re a failure.\u201d Again, he somehow thought this was motivating.

            "Counterpoint:\n\nI spent some time as an army instructor, teaching young officer recruits. \n\nWe don\u2019t do the R. Lee Emery *Full Metal Jacket* stream of abuse any more, and the sexually charged language is *utterly gone* (and deservedly so - it brought *zero* added value). What we *do* do though is apply a measurable, hard standard. When you are tested, if you fail to reach the required standard, you *will* fail. Fail enough tests, you *will* fail the course. Do something stupid or dangerous, and you *will* be immediately corrected - again, not R. Lee Emory invective about your parentage or whatever, but the consequences of your actions will be pointedly explained to you. \n\nWe are teaching future leaders; getting it wrong has larger implications than a private getting it wrong. \n\nOver the course of my career, I have seen a notable decline in the ability of young officers to deal with stress, adversity, and failure. We don\u2019t expect you to get it right the first time - you are new at this, and what we are teaching are learned skills, not something you are born with.  But it is clear that for many young people, the first time they get it wrong (and have their failings pointedly explained to them) is the first time they have encountered failure in their lives. So instead of taking a deep breath, sucking back, and trying again, they go to pieces (in any number of ways). They simply don\u2019t have the life skills to deal with adversity. \n\nThe ones that do better frequently come from walks of life that are less privileged, or have provided some degree of challenge to overcome. \n\nSo while no child should be exposed to *abuse*, and constant, unremitting opposition teaches bad lessons as well, a child who faces *no* challenge or discipline, who is raised insulated from the consequences of their actions or never allowed to be placed in a position where failure is a possibility - those children are being disadvantaged. They will have a hard time facing adult realities and responsibilities, never mind leading soldiers in combat. \n\nLet me say it again - there is no place for *abuse*. There is a line at which additional exposure to adversity stops adding resilience and starts becoming deleterious. But *no* exposure to adversity is, in my \u201cunpopular opinion\u201d, itself a form of abuse.",

But I think it has something to do with the way I was raised.\n\nI remember the first time I spilled something around my boyfriend (yes, I'm a clutz) and he didn't even react. My heart was beating really fast and I was rushing to clean it up and apologizing profusely and he just told me \"relax, it was just an accident.\" \n\nFor the first time ever after spilling sometning, I actually didn't feel like a failure/fuck up; seems small or insignificant to most people, but to me it was a freeing feeling.",

            "Some other points about yelling, as someone who grew up in this kind of household: \n\n1. Using yelling/screaming as a punishment will give your kid anxiety around authority figures for the rest of their life. I would shake and sweat any time I had to approach a teacher/professor/boss in an uncomfortable situation. Your fight-or-flight mode activates. Both my sibling and I have struggled in our careers because we are so constantly stressed about doing a good job and not displeasing anyone.\n\n2. Want to push your kid away from you and never have a close relationship with them as an adult? This is the way to do it. Why would a grown person choose to be around someone who made them so unhappy? I can tell my father has realized his mistake, but it's too late, bud. We have an ok relationship now, but it will never be close.\n\n3. As others have mentioned, it makes you a very good liar. Only through therapy have I realized that I constantly lie (on autopilot, without knowing) to avoid displeasing people. It feels like you're doing them a favor, but people start to catch on. I developed this behavior to avoid setting off my father, and it just never went away.",

It would get to the point where I would get so sick of her pestering me about the projects or papers that I couldn't even bear to think of them, and just wouldn't do them.

I believe it's called a reactance, and it's the reason why reverse psychology can sometimes work. Basically you do something of your own free will, but when someone orders you to do it, it limits you to that task, and you no longer choose to do it. It's pretty common in people of all ages, but like most things, an extreme amount of it could be classified as a disorder.",

As he started leaning in to grab the trash back out of the container, I said, \"Hey, we need you to empty that trash now.\" It was beautiful. He paused and looked at me. I stood there grinning. The trash needed emptying. Emptying the trash would help the team. He wanted to empty the trash. But me, low on the totem pole, ordering him to take out the trash suddenly made his pride not want to take out the trash. It was a beautiful second or two that seemed to last much longer.

Would get last place in karaoke and the dogs would be howling. \n\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t say anything because she\u2019s a manager in a different area. \n\nI\u2019m just not a fan of people singing all the time no matter if they\u2019re good or not. If I don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s just unwarranted noise to me.\n\nEdit: wow thank you everyone for all the responses and upvotes. A lot of responses about how I should do something about it. Unfortunately that\u2019s very unlikely. I am a custodian on contract for a police station (among other buildings) & she is one of the supervisors in charge on site (not an officer). When she sings, i just go somewhere else to clean if I can. It\u2019s kind of a running joke among her crew that she does this. Also it\u2019s a really stupid job. I was actually demoted because a police officer accused me of something false, even when I had evidence that he was wrong and one of my supervisors agreed with my statement. Basically the officers didn\u2019t like that I called them out.",

It's not about you, we almost don't want you to hear us, which is why we keep it semi-quiet and find opportune times to do it.\n\nPeople who sing obnoxiously loud all the time, in your face, and in inappropriate settings are attention seekers and I apologize for them.

Oh yea, General Mattis happened.\n\nSide note- I understand that America is not perfect and that there is a lot of room for improvement, but that does not justify the outright hate America gets in the popular media.

A 16 year old wrote to the opiate sub, struggling with addiction, asking for advice on how to quit.  This person responded to that post by *giving them instructions on how to shoot up pills*.\n\nI told them straight up - you are a fucking monster.  You just told a child how to stay addicted to drugs.  A child reached out to you and you just gave her advice that could kill her.  How dare you have the audacity to call me a concern troll?\n\nSuddenly I\u2019m getting comments about how I\u2019m trash, that I apparently hate junkies, and then I actually looked at the r/opiate sub where the person wrote about me - people in the comments said that they looked through my comment history and found anti-abortion, anti sex ed stuff\n\n> I just went through Spaghatta111\u2019s history and of course, it\u2019s some pro life white male on Reddit, what a surprise!\n\n> LOL just went through his comments and he apparently hates sex ed, what an idiot \n\nI even responded to that person asking what I said that was \u201canti-sex ed.\u201d  They couldn\u2019t even answer me, just downvoted me and told me I\u2019m ignorant trash \n\n> I CANT BELIEVE SPAGHATTA111 DOESNT UNDERSTAND WHAT HARM REDUCTION IS!!

            "Reddit seems to be \"culturally\" dominated by adolescents and folks in their early 20's which means that Reddit's culture is basically a giant high school hallway echo chamber.  There is, of course, nothing wrong with being young per se, but it is a time often consumed by insecurities which can fuel things like bullying.   Add to this the fact that anonymous internet culture is practically synonymous with trolling and things can get ugly around here pretty damn fast.  \n\nThe young folks who jump on Reddit now learn how to be Redditors from the actions of the other, older young folks who jumped on just a few years before them who learned from the other, other young folks who jumped on just a few years before them, etc, etc.  When that happens, you get this weird, rapid distillation of culture.   \n\nI will say that there are still some good aspects of the Reddit ethos that remain throughout all this distilled insecurity and the toxic behavior that it inspire.,   At least here, there are folks who try to be civil and I think this is what keeps Reddit from becoming a total 4chan shitshow, but as an older person who has seen how Reddit has \"devolved\" over the years (my current account is not that old, but I have been on Reddit since 2011 or so), I am pretty sure that it will only get worse without ever getting better.   Granted things are better now than they were in 2016 when every fucking post on r/all was some stupid bullshit from r/The_Donald, but Reddit is still great place to come if you want to groom adolescent males for your groovy alt-right lifestyle or spend all day making people feel bad so that you, yourself can feel better about the fact that you couldn't carry on a conversation IRL for more than 60 seconds before freaking out from your crippling, helicopter-parent-induced, social anxiety.",

            "I'm pretty tech savvy, want my kids to feel they have privacy and freedom.  Yet at the same time my goal as a parent is 2 things, keep them safe/alive and also raise them to be good human beings.  A very distant third is their happiness, or I should say where their happiness coincides with my first 2 responsibilities..\n\nThis is why I don't let them eat candy before dinner, don't let them run outside naked in the middle of december and the million other things I do to keep them safe and teach them how to be good humans.  Many of those things don't bring them \"Joy\" or \"happiness\" but that's not my job as a parent and I think that is lost on a lot of the young redditos on here.  \n\nMost redditors are still too young to actually look back at what their parents did without looking at it as negative and restrictive.  For them it's just still too new, they can only see how \"they\" feel about the situation because they are not parents themselves yet, nor responsible for the raising of a child.  For them they cant comprehend the decisions that were made \"for\" them because they have never been in a position to make decisions \"for\" someone else.\n\nMy kids have lots of electronics and are not quite old enough yet to care about social media.  Yet when that time comes you better believe I'm going to have a ton of restrictions on what apps can be downloaded and used on their phones.  I'll talk with them about porn, responsibility and the dangers of their actions.but they are not getting access to facebook, snapchat, messenger, instagram or any of that.  When they hit 15 we will discuss it again and they will be told the only way they can have access to those platforms is if I'm allowed at anytime to look at it.\n\nDo i care if they are sending explicit text messages to their GF's?  Talking about going to a party?  Experimenting with drugs?  Maybe a little, but they will never be reprimanded for that.  Instead I want to make sure they are not exchanging child pornography between one another.  I want to make sure they are not driving drunk or high, that they are not putting themselves in situations that could get them in trouble with the law or other parents.\n\nI'm hoping the job I'm doing in raising them will help them make the proper decisions but I know better then to assume they will never make mistakes.  My job as a parent is to help them avoid mistakes as much as possible and to let them learn from the ones that are not detrimental to them in the long run.\n\nA lot of redditors like to play both sides of coin as most teenagers do.  Proclaim their youth is the reason why they make mistakes, still in school, can't buy their own things etc, but out the other side of their mouth is the complaint of not enough freedom or overprotective parents.  It's like they forget that their parents were their age, did a bunch of bad things and are doing their best to protect their children from making the same mistakes they did.\n\nI do the best I can to give my boys freedom but it comes at a cost of me knowing exactly what they are doing right now.  Once I don't know what they are doing the freedom they have is STILL my responsibility as a parent.  I'm still responsible for what they do, I might have to clean up whatever mess they get themselves into.  So yeah, as long as society dictates that the Parents are responsible for their child's actions you better believe their \"freedoms\" \"privacy\" and \"happiness\" plays second fiddle to my job as a parent!\n\nJust want most of those redditors complaining about overprotective parents to remember all the instances a teen/friend/family member/someone they knew did something bad and the first word out of peoples mouths were \"where were the parents?\"  or \"Why was that teen/child allowed to do x,y,z, bad parenting!\".  Because every action you make is a reflection on your parents ability to raise you and your faults get transferred to them, even if you're just an asshole.",

I refused to give over my phone partly because i didn\u2019t do anything wrong and partly because i didn\u2019t know if i\u2019d be safe without having a way to call for help. Luckily i hid it before she came and tried to physically take it from me, but since i wouldn\u2019t hand it over she decided the next best thing would be to punch me in the face. i don\u2019t even remember being hit, i just remember being thrown to the floor and seeing blood when i touched my face. i looked up and saw myself in the mirror, nose gushing blood, drunk blearly eyed mother standing over me still holding a fist. i grabbed my phone from the side of the bed, pushed her away and ran downstairs out the door. she didn\u2019t follow me. she broke my nose. my septum is still crooked.",
            "Yes and no.  If you're trying to protect them from something, then you have to have an actual conversation with them about what you're doing and why.  The basic problem that everyone has with that type of parent is making arbitrary decisions, and framing them in a \"I am your parent and you are a child.\" There is no communication, just a decision made and the invitation to just live with it.\n\nA good parent communicates, the insane parents just do shit and make up reasons.",

I was just raised to have moral values and to co-operate and not because it was a chore but because I *wanted* to help my parents when they were tired. The whole chore mentality is fucking disgusting. As if your 12 year old child needs to work for you in order to have access to basic rights like a roof and food because you can't put your shit together as an adult and manage your time. And if the child doesn't comply with your dictatorship, (which is indeed a dictatorship since there's not even room for discussion) you have measures and punishments. Instead I was raised to actually give a fuck and help with my free will and not because I was forced too. Thus growing up I developed into a caring responsible citizen and not into an 18 year old who just can't wait to start abusing the freedom he/she just found.

Parents getting mad at their kids for not checking in shows more their insecurity of their parenting skills, then actually having something to be mad about. Parents have to let their kids grow up at some point and if they are constantly checking in on their location, they are not allowing them to grow into a mature adult.\n\n>Dad took away your SnapChat because you\u2019re 14 and probably shouldn\u2019t have that shit anyway?

A lot of teachers use it to post assignments or notes, so restricting access to the internet could restrict their ability to do schoolwork.

There were already 14 hotel employees living in the 2 bed room apartment sharing a single bathroom. There were bunk beds everyone shared .

            "Dubai is nothing like what everyone here keeps describing.\nI heard the same stories before I came to Dubai, it's been 6 years of me working here. Here is my observation.\n\n1.only 20% of population are locals, so the majority of the interactions you have speaks little about the locals and more about the 190 individual cultures that exist here.\n\n2. The people: the locals are kind, educated and direct\n\n3. The freedom: you are free as long as you don't interfere with another person's freedom, sure malls have signs that say no PDA, people tell you to dress modestly, but this is not tyrannically enforced. As an Indian, I feel more free in UAE than in India.\n\n4. The security: you could leave your car/house unlocked, no one will rob you, you can walk in any part of the town, at any time without anyone ever troubling you. You cannot pick physical fights, neither can anyone else.\n\n5.The weather: it is 8 months of hell\n\n6. It's expensive: no it's not, food (western) can be had for really cheap, accomodation is slightly more expensive ( AVG 10k USD per year for a studio), cars are cheap. Now if you only eat from five star restraunts(of which there are plenty) it will cost you accordingly.\n\n7. Slave labour: I was literally against coming to UAE for this reason untill I came for a vacation and actually saw. Withholding passports used to happen a long time back, now there are strong laws with huge fines. Labor is difficult especially given the weather, so they have mandatory breaks during the day, basic facilities are in place. Pay is 10-20 times what a labourer would earn back home, I'm talking educating your kids, building houses, paying for weddings, take care of parents, in short provide a very decent life for family. Slave labour exists in the corporate domain, you come to the office at 8, leave at 6, ... Wait that's the same everywhere.\n\n8. Debt: easy access to debt, people literally used to borrow huge sums of money before fleeing the country. Now your debt is tracked, and if you terminate your visa without paying the debt, you have to explain how and why you plan to pay it off.\n\n9. The law: as long as you don't bother women,or anybody you are good. But what if you have an altercation, the cops come and peacefully resolve it. Cops literally dont have major crimes to tackle, so they are relaxed and easy to approach. You will definitely not get shot at for no random reason, even if you end up doing something to get shot at, they are trained enough to not go for the kill.\n\n10. Racism: put people from 190 countries in a hot box there will be racism. The good thing is everybody is an offender, everyone is racist \ud83d\ude02. This thread is more racist than the people in Dubai.\n\n11: healthcare: world-class\n\n12: infra : world-class\n\n13 : beaurocracy : minimal, but when you have to deal with it, it is confusing.

            "My opinion of someone plummets if they say they've been to/would love to go to Dubai. A disgusting place like something from Dantes Inferno, an orgy of capitalism and consumerism for the most superficial people all of it built on the blood and sweat of Nepalis, Bangladeshis, some of the poorest, most vulnerable people on the planet who go there with the dream of a better future, many of whom make one final trip home in a wooden box. Even the thought of the place makes me nauseous."

If she caught on I was gaming or doing something that took my attention away, the whole focus would turn on me. I am glad to see you have that healthy balance.",

I had to end a relationship with my ex bf because he was constantly shushing me in front of friends, telling me I was annoying and that nobody cared about what I was talking about.

Discussion is always fine, but she has a habit of turning something that can be said in 30 seconds into a 5-minute explanation. Don't get me wrong though, I know both men and women can ramble, but when there isn't a point or it's just \"talking to talk\", it starts getting under my skin a bit. I always try to listen, especially when it's critical or \"her life related\", but it isn't always pleasant when it's more or less just putting her brain on the loudspeaker without a filter.

            "I\u2019m going to make a guess based on your responses here that you\u2019re a teenager, either that or very inexperienced with women. Don\u2019t take that as me being condescending in any way because I\u2019m not.\n\nI just want to let you know that while that is great, you don\u2019t always need to feel that way. Everyone here is saying \u201cnow that\u2019s true love\u201d and different variations of that, but everyone has their breaking point. You\u2019re no different. I love my girlfriend to death - she\u2019s a big talker too - but there are times where by god I just want her to shut the hell up. We have a somewhat similar dynamic in that she\u2019s the talker in our relationship. She\u2019ll tell me everything about her day and I\u2019ll tell her very little about mine. Even if relatively big things happened during it. It\u2019s just my personality. I\u2019m not a sharer unless it\u2019s serious (which is coincidentally the area she falls flat in, she\u2019s a people pleaser) The only time I\u2019ll relay to her everything about my day is if it was exceptionally good or exceptionally horrible. And that dynamic works for us. But sometimes it\u2019s still a bit much.\n\nIf we\u2019re laying down about to go to bed, and she\u2019s talking my ear off while I\u2019m dozing off. Or trying to catch fifteen minutes of a documentary before falling asleep. I begin to get a little irritated.\n\nSo just keep in mind that once you\u2019ve been together longer than five months - if you make it - this honeymoon phase you\u2019re in where you hang onto her every word because she\u2019s amazing in every way imaginable, is going to come to an end. Then the real meat of a relationship begins. A lot of younger or inexperienced people (especially men) seem to mistake the golden age in the beginning of a new relationship coming to an end, with the spark dying and the relationship in general coming to an end. This isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s just where you find out if you\u2019re truly compatible with one another.\n\nHave fun. Just keep in mind that nothing is forever. I saw your comment about how you see this going on for decades, try and push that out of your mind. You don\u2019t want to set yourself up for disappointment. Enjoy every minute you spend together while the excitement is still so electric.",

        "title": "Generic feel-good phrases such as \"you matter\" \"you are loved\" \"you're beautiful\" etc. are insulting and emotionally manipulative, and they make me feel much worse afterwards.",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/n9tzv0/generic_feelgood_phrases_such_as_you_matter_you/",

        "selftext": "Seriously, there seems to be a trend among some parts of the internet and real life to just flash faux motivational feel-good phrases like these to get cheap emotional responses from people who are truly desperate enough to believe that somewhere on the internet or in their vague proximity there is a person who actually genuinely cares about them. Sorry to break it to you, but they probably can't. How can you care about someone you don't even know personally? They have no idea who you are and you have no idea who they are. You are therefore completely blind to any reasons why you are truly loved by anyone, which makes perceiving this feeling as genuine extremely difficult, and impossible for me.\n\nThe sort of people who would actually unironically find these phrases motivational are so devoid of any positive social interaction (which I am not saying NEVER happens but is such a desperate situation) that any string of words vaguely resembling a heartfelt compliment brightens their day. The trouble is that these phrases masquerade as heartfelt compliments but are such cheap emotional signalling that anyone utilising a sliver of their human observation and reasoning can see that they are being emotionally manipulated.\n\nThe other day at school, I saw a message scribbled on my desk that said \"Whoever sits at this seat, know that you are loved #SpreadPositivity\". The vagueness in the wording baffled me. If someone sits at this seat, by virtue of just being there, they are loved, and I, sitting in another spot, am no longer told that I'm loved? If I am truly loved by anyone in particular, then the message would have been a lot more personal, and due to the circumstances in which that message is being presented, it could not be. That message would have had some positive effect on me if that were the seat I was assigned to (which would make the message take on a new meaning, hence why here it was used so generically), but no, it was a classroom shared by 4 grades above and below mine and due to COVID we have free seating. The message is not personal; I don't think the writer even knows who I am, and even if they did, it was not targeted at me, so I cannot personally feel good about anything in the message. If anything, seeing that message made me upset, knowing that my feelings have been pandered to in an attempt to have a cheap emotional response elicited from me. I felt manipulated. It was insulting, too; I do not need anyone to remind me that I am loved, especially not from an anonymous entity I don't even know. The message implies that the only criterion that I have to fulfil to be loved is to sit at that particular seat, which makes me feel that I do not actually deserve the praise, since I have not done anything worthy of that praise. I have to work my ass off to get the grades to make my teachers and parents happy, be funny and genuine with my friends to make them happy, and meticulously plan every encounter to make my girlfriend happy. I know that in order to be loved you must be willing to put in the effort, and any \"free love\" you get is not at all genuine. Consider this to be akin to an infinite fountain of counterfeit cash: while you can take as much as you want, all you get in the end is some free paper in case you run out of tissue or toilet roll.\n\nThis is a wider problem on the internet, where out-of-touch celebrities, influencers and even some of you on Reddit collectively tell us that we matter or that we are loved blah blah blah. Alright then, if we truly matter, then we don't need you to tell us that we do because we should be able to feel that every day! If our feelings need to be validated in such a way, would that not suggest that we are in fact not loved by many or do not matter to all but one or two? I do not feel any better after reading your post, nor do I appreciate that somehow I am targeted to be emotionally pacified. You only use such generic phrases because you are sure that it would apply to everyone, just as if you were tasked with buying me a shirt without knowing who I am you would probably just buy a plain black or white V-neck because it's such a safe choice, with no polarising or remarkable elements. I have no interest in what you say about me without knowing who I am. I do not deserve to be loved simply because I exist, I should be loved because of who I am and what I do, and if being who I am means that I will grind more people's gears, so be it. Being who I am is expressing my personality. Existing is not a personality.\n\nA big part of what makes a compliment special is how personal it is. I cannot be made to believe that any celebrity, any influencer, or even that Redditor I have never interacted with before know me enough to genuinely compliment me. I know your intentions: You want to scribble something in real life or online, in the hope that someone would stumble upon it and you would brighten their day. But you did not brighten their day. It's an insulting, condescending and frankly manipulative genre of phrase that serves absolutely no purpose.\n\nAnyway, I am by no means saying that we should just stop spreading any form of positivity and self-love. I understand some people are going through tough times in their life and need any emotional support they can get. In that case, establish connections with them in private, make them feel like you give a shit (even if you don't!), DM them, make them feel better as a person with lived experiences, not a publicity stuntman because you either want some Internet brownie points or just want to demonstrate to the world how virtuous and caring you are. Promoting love and positivity only works well if there is even a fa\u00e7ade of reciprocity. If you were talking to a friend in great mental distress, your magnum opus surely would not be such a simple phrase overused to shit. So, treat people online as you would people in real life. Have a genuine two-sided conversation and step outside the box of virtue-signalling.\n\nThis new genre of feel-good phrases just doesn't work for me, and I'm very sure many other people feel the same way. I just don't see the majority of the Internet agreeing with this though (with all the positivity movements and shit), but hey, that's why I'm here ranting and you're here reading (hopefully). Thanks for listening :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: What makes a compliment special is how personal it is. Phrases like the ones in the title used between strangers are so generic that they lose any sincerity left in them. Therefore, the people who use these phrases are (willfully or not) engaging in emotional manipulation and the person who unironically feels good in the face of these phrases are really, really fucking desperate and they might need actual help. In that case, stop and talk to them as a person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: I see a lot of you in the comments commenting about how this is a symptom of a lack of empathy. I disagree. Empathy is when you can connect with someone's lived experiences because your imagination and lived experiences allow you to do that. In my case there is a complete lack of information: I don't know who wrote that on my table and the person who wrote it on my table don't know who I am (or even if they do, they most likely don't know I'm going to read it). When there is a complete lack of information, there is nothing to base empathy on.\n\nEdit 2: To clarify, there is a difference (which I have probably not made very clear in my original post) between a conversation between two individuals that one appreciate the other and someone being told by an anonymous random message that they are loved. When this message means the same to everyone, it means nothing to everyone. Telling someone that they are loved (or equivalent) is a personal sentiment. When you, while writing the message, don't care if it ends up in the hands of any person, it brings no value to anyone in particular because it brings everyone else the same value. Then, the message ceases to be personal because it means that nobody feels special after reading it.",

            "This is so important. An important lesson from psychology that is well documented by research is that people generally feel worse when they get compliments that they don't believe are true. So someone who doesn't feel loved, and who feel like they don't matter, will probably not feel better from a post like that. They will just (subconsciously) think \"No, I'm not loved. No, I don't matter\", and therefore feel even worse than before. And then you feel bad because someone wishes you well but you still feel like shit, so something must be wrong with you. The only people who feel good from those posts are the ones that feel good from before. So these posts are kicking down at the people who need help the most, and lifting up people who don't need it.",

Instead of saying clich\u00e9 dismissive positive statements like \"you'll get through this\", I will ask them gentle questions to get them to share how they are feeling. I will sympathize with them by saying stuff like \"I'm sorry that you went through that\"\n\nIf they want solutions/opinion etc then I will offer that as well as being sympathic.\n\nI also have got into the habit of letting people know how they can be supportive to me by saying something like \"I don't need any help with solutions, I just need to vent to someone. Would that be ok?\" that way I am letting them know what I need from them.\n\nI think people genuinely want to help others that they know but sometimes people might not know what to say or do to be helpful - especially if they have never experienced something like what the other person is going through. Being clear about what you need helps to make that less of a problem.",

            "I see two issues here.  One, these kinds of phrases are meant to be a form of support.  You can empathize with the idea of a person you have in your mind and that matters if it's followed up with action.  The problem is that some people don't mean it and are more interested in making themselves feel good that actually helping others.  That results in your troubles being used as a prop, which is offensive.\n\nThe other issue is the bigger one here:\n\n>which makes me feel that I do not actually deserve the praise, since I have not done anything worthy of that praise. I have to work my ass off to get the grades to make my teachers and parents happy, be funny and genuine with my friends to make them happy, and meticulously plan every encounter to make my girlfriend happy. I know that in order to be loved you must be willing to put in the effort, and any \"free love\" you get is not at all genuine\n\nThis is not true at all.  This idea is a huge problem in our culture here in the US.  Whether or not you are worthy of love is a moral question, and people subscribe to different philosophies.  It's not something that can be quantified, and whether you ascribe worth to someone as a person is something you decide for yourself, it doesn't hinge on some arbitrary material result.  This idea that you must earn love puts pressure on you to live for others, and you can't be free to be yourself when you are under that kind of pressure.  Even if the unconditional love that people express for you isn't genuine it doesn't mean you aren't worthy of that love.  That worth comes from yourself and is something that should only be *acknowledged* by others.",

            "I also dislike those generic compliments. They can\u2019t be sincere, and insincere praise is terrible. However, I think there are a few arguments in favor of them.\n\nFirst is that a statement like, \u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d can be interpreted different ways. Even though obviously not everyone is objectively beautiful, everyone deserves to feel beautiful sometimes. And beauty is subjective, as well - if you\u2019re a kind and patient person, then there is someone out there who will find you beautiful, no matter what you look like. In my experience, at least, attraction is malleable, and someone\u2019s physical beauty changes based on how attractive their personality is. \n\nSecond is that some people may actually get benefit from those platitudes. I\u2019ve seen hundreds of random Reddit comments thanking people (and bots) for unsolicited random compliments. As you point out, it\u2019s probably the people who need them the most that also benefit from them. If they actually improve someone\u2019s mood or self-esteem, then who am I to stand in the way of that just because I find them to be phony and annoying?\n\nThird is that giving compliments is a skill. Many people I know, including myself, have a hard time doling out compliments. It\u2019s really tricky territory - you can give false impressions (unintended romantic vibes), you can come off as insincere, you can make other people feel less appreciated, etc. It could be that practicing compliments with generic phrases makes it easier for people to give out actual specific compliments. The focus on \u201cpositivity\u201d contributes here as well.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree that platitudes can often be detrimental because they give a quick dopamine fix despite the fact you haven\u2019t actually accomplished anything. Subs like /r/GetMotivated are terrible in this regard. It\u2019s like fantasizing about winning the lottery - it makes you feel sated for a short while so you can keep putting off doing things that actually improve your life.

If they leave and never talk to you after saying this shit once. Fuck'm. If they just virtue-signal... fuck'm. If they come to you when you're in need and stay, keep your new friend. Don't misunderstand: I fully agree that these don't work as compliments, and that they're not personal- but they aren't meant to be.

I just felt like mentioning some of these people are as good-spirited as they put off, I don't know. \n\nAlso, onto my tangent! I'd say... don't stay with people you have to \"earn\" love from. I am a technical asshole at my nicest, a complete sadist at my worst, and when i was trying to off myself, they missed work, they came by. They don't even like me at many points, they still came, and they still check up on me now if things get rough. They missed work. Some of them met me the first fucking time in person... just checking in that i hadn't off and died. That's what actual love is like. I don't know what \"effort\" i put in... Because i honestly... Haven't? At that point I'd definitely taken more than given... Look, I can't say I've never gone out of my way for them, that'd be a lie. But i don't plan my encounters with them, ever. At all. I don't find myself choosing words to satisfy or putting on a mask. The closest thing to a \"plan\" I've gotten with any friends of mine still here is \"I'm off *day* and so are you. Wanna hate shit together for a day?\" When I was engaged it was the same. I just did... Me things. And that was enough. That's how people who love you work. The rest are there for what they like out of you, but there's more to love than just shit you like. You're gonna argue, you're gonna fucking near hate each other at points, love is far more multifaceted than \"make people happy.\" Love though, i don't know how to put in words. It's like that thought you get that says... \"I fucking hate you, but I'm still hoping your day is okay and things go well.\" (an actual quote from yours truly, the sneki boi) when you're done arguing with someone. It's that thought that makes you peek after a heated argument when your partner/friend/etc storms off, just to make sure they aren't breaking down.

Most of the time, they tell me I should teach. Where I live, teachers make about $32,000 per year. Which averages out to about $15 per hour in a 40-hour week. Anyone who knows a teacher will tell you they work much more than 40 hours per week, as a lot of that work comes home with you.\n\nIn hopes of landing a real job, I accepted a customer service position at a call center for an insurance company, starting at $12 an hour. For those who don\u2019t know, insurance company call centers are infamous for causing stress and anxiety. In fact, large centers have specific rooms for employees to de-stress on their breaks. Many employees are also on anti-anxiety medication as well. After a year and half and becoming depressed myself, I went back to restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, I average a little more than $20 per hour serving tables and take no work home with me. My days consist of jokes, story-swapping, and usually about five-ten miles worth of walking.  Bottom line: most people that tell me I should get a real job have no clue that I make just as much as they do for half the stress.

I find it sad that people immediately think less of someone who is actually working simply because they don't work in a job THEY deem good enough. Those saying \"do not use assistance\" clearly do not get it. Most people who work in minimum wage jobs have multiple jobs and don't really want to be on assistance. If they didn't do the jobs, you would not be able to stop and get lunch, get a coffee, or the like.

            "Edit: I never expected this much attention, haha. \nXocolatlchocolate.com\nThe bar I was talking about is called Magnifimint. \n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the support everyone. You all are amazing. Also, all of our chocolate is Dark Chocolate. If you're looking for something like an Andes chocolate, ours will be less sweet. Just a heads up for those of you that are ordering. Again, thank you so much for your support and love. \n\nI'm a chocolate maker in the United States. We make a mint chocolate bar, so I'd like to defend it a little.\n\nFirst, most mint+chocolate candies are made with shitty chocolate and shitty mint extract. A lot of times, it's the same mint extract that goes into toothpaste and mouthwash and other things like that. Perfect example is the Andes mint. Andes is owned by the Tootsie roll company. \n\nTootsie, Hershey, Mars, Nestl\u00e9 etc. source most of their cacao(if not all of it) from west Africa. Ghana and The Ivory Coast produce up to 80% of the world's cocoa. These trees were planted in French colonies to make getting cocoa to Europe easier(cacao is native to Central/South America, geneticists believing Peru to be the origin).\n\nOver the years, the cacao in west Africa was replaced by CCN51, a genetic hybrid developed to be disease resistant and require less work /money to grow. Unfortunately, the cacao tastes like shit. But it's cheap as hell and \"Big Chocolate\" buys it up, burns it, covers the bad flavor with sugar, vanilla, milk, etc to make a sellable product.\n\nThen these same companies spend very little on shitty mint extract to go into their shitty chocolate, and bam: you got shitty mint chocolate bullshit.\n\nThe mint chocolate we make is made with Nicaraguan cacao purchased directly from the co-ops in Nicaragua. We roast it gently, then grind it with organic sugar for 72 hours. We add organic dried peppermint leaves to the chocolate in the last 12 hours of grinding so it can be refined but NOT burned.\n\nThe result is a 68% dark chocolate bar that has a nice, mild, herbal peppermint flavor.\n\nTl:Dr Not all mint chocolates are bad. It depends on the quality and ratio of ingredients. Also SUPPORT LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES PLEASE \ud83d\ude0a",

Dark chocolates are earthy and sometimes chalky or acidic. And having a contrasting flavor, like mint helps me enjoy chocolates more. Chocolate has a naturally earthy flavor and a good flavor contrast would be something sweet like vanilla or something refreshing and bright like mint and orange (another favorite). These flavor additions can even enhance the flavor of good chocolates.",

You might as well say that you don't like sleeping on your side. Fine. Not interested in probing that preference of yours.\n\nI don't think food inherently makes for bad content on an opinion sub, though. \"Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza,\" while maybe a tad old and overused as a quip on reddit, is the type of unpopular opinion I find much  more interesting. This goes beyond stating a simple taste preference and posits that there are appropriate and inappropriate toppings for a very common and popular dish. It will garner more discussion and have more impassioned and entrenched sides. \"Pineapple on pizza tastes gross\" is just boring. Yeah, sure, ok. I disagree. Nothing more to say.",

        "selftext": "A pretty obvious opinion, but rather unpopular where I\u2019m from in the Midwest. I\u2019m thankful that my mother told me that if I ever needed birth control, she would get it to me. That was 7 years ago when I was 13. Now I\u2019m 20, in a long term relationship, and have been on birth control since 17. Might not like some of the side effects I\u2019ve seen (acne, bloating, slight weight gain etc.) But at least I don\u2019t have a child.   \n\nBoth of my two girl friends from high school were not allowed to be on any form of birth control. One had to get it through college, one didn\u2019t have an option till post graduation. \n\nMy point is, you are not going to prevent your kid from having sex by keeping birth control from them. If you as a parent truly think that, you are delusional. Teenagers/young adults will always find a way to do what they want, and their parents telling them \u2018no\u2019 is just going to make them want to do it more. \n\nAnd this doesn\u2019t just go for girls, I\u2019m only writing it this way because I am a girl, and I know firsthand. Give your son condoms if he needs them, and educate both your sons and daughters about being safe. \n\nEDIT: Took a nap and came back to all of this. Just wanted to point out a few things as I\u2019ve been scrolling through the comments. \n\n1. Yes, I am well aware the female birth control does have long term side effects. I\u2019m also aware that it\u2019s trial and error. I\u2019m on my 3rd type of birth control and I\u2019ve never been happier. It\u2019s hard to discover what really works for you and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to see a doctor and not order pills online like they have available now. \n\n2. I\u2019m well aware that female birth control doesn\u2019t protect against STIs. But here\u2019s the thing, condoms don\u2019t protect against babies either. Doubling up on both female birth control AND condoms is a great way to prevent both a baby and STIs. \n\n3. Some are talking about fertility and birth control. It is known that the birth control shot CAN increase your risk of infertility a bit more than most birth control. But let\u2019s think of other things that can affect fertility. Smoking, extreme weight loss, other types of hormones such as things we put in food, endometriosis. I could go on.\n\n4. Rape happens. If you\u2019re on birth control, chances are you\u2019re not going to get pregnant.\n\n5. Women can do whatever they want with their bodies. \n\n6. 20 y/o female living in Ohio, grew up catholic. For all you saying religion is the answer.\n\n7. This is definitely leaning more towards girls on the pill, instead of boys with condoms. If you are calling your FEMALE child a whore, slut or anything of the sort, there is something wrong with you. Women can have sex. WOMEN CAN HAVE SEX.\n\n8. How could I forget something so important? BIRTH CONTROL IS USED FOR SO MANY OTHER THINGS.\n\nEDIT 2: Lol",

I was sexually active, and my mom was wise enough to hand me a box of condoms and tell me to be safe. Of course I was like \"Eww mom! I'm not even having sex! Yuck get out of my room!\", or something equally ridiculous. I used them though, and I didn't get pregnant or get an std, thank god. \n\nGiving them to my son felt weird, because that's my sweet baby boy, but I'm trying to be reasonable and realistic.

            "My mom worked at Planned Parenthood when I was a teenager.  She would buy the big boxes of 100 condoms for $10 and put them in our guest bathroom.  She told me and my sister to let our friends know they were there because she would rather they use them than have another one of our friends announce a pregnancy like my sisters best friend.  I think she knew most parents weren't talking about it to their kids, let alone helping to provide the contraception.  I tried birth control for a few months when I was 16 as well, but ended up sticking with the condoms after the birth control turned me into an emotional wreck.",

I also am going to give them condoms as I believe it isn't always the guys responsibility to bring condoms. I was never given the option of birth control because my parents were strongly against it.

Her mom never would have gotten her birth control had it been for the purpose of sex, it was until recently that she finally came to terms with the fact that she can't control every aspect of her daughter's life anyway. But she did last year finally get her birth control just not for the anti baby reason. My gf (for a lot of reasons both known and not) had really bad and really irregular periods. Like her cramps would leave her immobilized most days, which I didnt even realize wasnt normal until i asked her to try and teach me about it. Her period would range from 3 days to 7 days (which she said is pretty normal, and she usually would be around 5 or 6 anyway. 3 was rare) but it would sometimes be over a week late for no reason, or other times it would happen 2 weeks after it ended and then again in another 2 weeks on \"normal\" schedule. \n\nLong story short, she needed birth control to regulate and alleviate her periods. Which was the only reason her mom agreed to it. \nSo as a man I say, PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR CHILD WITH BIRTH CONTROL ITS NOT JUST ABOUT SEX she was so miserable before she got on it and even though shes still working through finding the best pill (she doesn't want the implant or the other one. They scare her) she's way happier and way healthier now than she was before",

            "When I was 16 (and got my license) my mom sat down to have a talk with me about responsibility and being safe with my newfound freedom to drive around the county. She more or less said that she knows \"kids\" aren't innocent and we're going to get up to shit like she did when she was my age but she had two requests. The first was that I never drink and drive or ride in a car with someone intoxicated. She said that if I ever needed a ride because someone was doing drugs or drinking alcohol then to just call home and there would be no judgement or penalty. The second was to not get pregnant and to facilitate that she said that while she likes to think we can talk about anything, she went ahead and had a note put in my file at the family doctor's office that I could get birth control and it was to be kept confidential (from my parents). I don't actually know if parental permission was required for birth control for minors in my state at the time, but that's not the point. \n\nI ended up getting birth control in college for free later on. The university had a grant to give certain forms of BC to students at absolutely no cost to students at their health clinics.",
            "Good for you! For 20 you sounded very adult like in your edits and your overall post. I just gave my 14 year old Birth control pills and I don\u2019t feel bad at all. She\u2019s going to be in the ninth grade next year. She spends a lot of time home alone as my husband and I work and the eldest is off working too. She is a pretty girl and attracts a lot of boys attention. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I had a child at 20 I was not ready for and that was because I screwed up my pill pack so even BC isn\u2019t a cure all but I can tell you my life turned out better than some other women\u2019s because birth control was an option for me period. Women who are dealing with feeding 3 kids on a 30k salary a year plus child support if they receive any are miserable human beings and they can\u2019t get their kids any farther ahead in life than where they landed. If young women want more for their sons or daughters they will have less children, planned pregnancies, and be married to the fathers when they do so. Life would be better for everyone, unfortunately not everyone is that blanking smart. Don\u2019t have more children than you can afford, and don\u2019t bother having kids if you don\u2019t want them..it\u2019s even more horrible for the kid whose parents didn\u2019t want them than for the adult. I see so many kids who want to kill themselves because in a nutshell their life is complete shit and honestly most of the time I take five minutes with the parents and u see exactly why they want to kill themselves.",

            "I never understood not agreeing with birth control. Sure you want your kid to be abstinent probably, but once they turn 18 (heck, before that sometimes) you're not gonna be able to do anything and it's probably better mentally than an abortion (more on that *if* people ask for my stance) so I see no harm. It's better to prevent an embryo from forming than to tear it apart when it's forming.",
            "I asked my doctor for BC at 16, that doctor went out IN THE WAITING ROOM IN FRONT OF OTHER PATIENTS, and told my mom that I had asked about it. \nI was prescribed the pill, but on the drive home my mom made sure I knew I had humiliated and embarrassed her.\n\nPlease let your kids take BC if they are at the age where it begins to be appropriate. Dont shame them, and don't let their doctors discuss private medical decisions in crowded waiting rooms. Protect your teens and teach them to protect themselves without shame.",

            "I think originally he was created to be cute and sell toys, but holy shot does this weeks episode set him up to flip the show to a way darker theme. dude is traumatized",
            "The artist formerly known as \u201cbaby yoda.\u201d \n\nHis name is Grogu!",
            "Yea I mean you could say that about basically everything Disney makes. Everything is designed in a marketing room to trigger as many biological cues in you as possible. Big eyes and big heads to make you think of babies even with fully grown Disney princess.",
            "I feel like I should stop reading the comments now....I just got passed the spiders on ice episode.",
            "I won't lie that Disney definitely made Grogu (Baby Yoda's cannon name) to make The Mandolorian more marketable, but he is nowhere near as annoying as the minions...",
            "He isn\u2019t obnoxious tho like minions always are, he\u2019s more of a plot device that requires protection",
            "I think we possibly need a Baby Yoda megathread in this sub, at this point.  This is the second thread I've seen in less than 30 minutes.\n\nDisliking the little gremlin isn't exactly an unpopular opinion, although it probably is minority.  I personally think he's legitimately cute, but only in measured doses.  A shot of him with his ears blown back when Mando took off on the speederbike last episode for example, was fine; and I also actually like the fact that Mando speaks to him and treats him like a son, as well.\n\nI am more concerned with the apparent franchise tie-ins which we've been seeing over the last few episodes.",
            "Nope, watch the episode \"The Jedi\" , Grogu has actually a pretty dark past and probably his character will get developed, problem is that if he's a baby with 30~40 years, the Mandalorian will be dead before Grogu learns how to speak",
            "The Child is obviously tended to look cute, be adorable and sell merch. But you're wrong about comparing Grogu to the minions. Grogu is actually the center piece of the story and has seen character development. While I agree that doing dumb shit is meant to endear the public to him, it serves the purpose of convincing people this 50+ year old thing is actually still just a child.",
            "So a literal child is dumb, acts cute, and eats things? What an astute observation.",
            "I mean, the problem with Minions isn\u2019t inherently the minions.\n\nIn DM1 they\u2019re legitimately funny and work well as a side source of comedy. The issue was, as the series went on, they got more and more of the limelight, and the issues became more visible. Namely, being very annoying outside small doses.\n\nGrogu could easily enter that level if Disney pushed his scenes more and more in the show, but I think Mando shows enough restraint to not worry about that.",
            "Minions are already minions for geeks",
            "Hmm I see where you're coming from, though I disagree strongly\n\nUnlike minions which are annoying and unfunny, Grogu is not only hilarious and adorable, but is critically important to the story",
            "Acts dumb? Uhhhh what and speaking gibberish if that's the case everyone in the star wars universe who isn't speaking english is also a minion",

            "2 key differences\n\n1. Grogu (baby yoda) is actually cute\n2. He actually serves a purpose to the plot",
            "The thing is, baby Yoda wasn\u2019t designed to sell toys.  Disney was highly criticized last year because they didn\u2019t have a lot of baby Yoda items for sale at Christmas and they missed out on huge profits - his popularity was unexpected.\n\nThe creators of the show use him for comedic purposes, it is true.  Star Wars has always had cute comedy (ie R2-D2) - this isn\u2019t something new.\n\nBut, the forced comedy in the Prequel and Sequel trilogies was a bit \u2018cringeworthy\u2019 imo - it\u2019s refreshing to see it done properly again.",
            "Who is to say Minions is not minions for geeks?",
            "I\u2019m also pretty sure minions is minions for geeks",
            "I don't see how that's an opinion at all, it's a fact. Although not minions specifically, but it's in line with other Star Wars media, like those porgs in the sequels.\n\nAt least baby Yoda is a critical piece of the plot, not just some annoying creature shoehorned in to exclusively sell merch. Basically Disney hit the jackpot by creating a character that's both extremely popular, cute, well received, and an integral part of the story.",
            "The latest episode really gives his character new light. You should check it out",
            "basically anything and everything Disney makes is to sell toys",
            "Hmm I see your point but grogu isn\u2019t mindless like minions are; he is VERY powerful lmao. He is also what the story is written around. In the first despicable me, the plot could exist without minions, but that\u2019s not the case here.\nDo not come for grogu. I will defend him til the day I die.",

            "His name is Grogu and you will call him as such",
            "Agreed to a certain extent. To hardcore Star Wars fans, the kid is monumentally important for a ton of reasons. To casual watchers, he is most definitely just a green minion.",
            "I just like watching the differences between season 1 him and season 2 him because u can clearly see a cognitive difference there. It\u2019s more responsive and more capable. Minions are like grown and still dumb, this is just a baby, therefore, to me, it has a free pass to be dumb since it\u2019s learning",
            "Yeah but baby yoda isn't obnoxious like the minions and also isn't the entire focus at all times like the minions are",

            "I can't upvote this. While unpopular, its fundamentally flawed. \n\nMinions were made to supply slapstick comedic value. They are loud, intentionally goofy and over the top.\n\nGrogu is none of these things. There are moments hes goofy, but that's not the whole character.\n\nApples in fact =/= oranges. Nice try though!",
            "I feel like the latest episode disproves that. And also this argument that it was made to sell toys being leveled at everything as a be all for its suckage is not valid. You know artists and designers can design something that is compelling while also making it great for toys. \n\nSome stuff is designed just to sell toys but a main character has other purposes\n\nTake my upvote",

Not so much, you could write largely the same movie without them but the Mandalorian would be a distinctly different story without Baby Yoda. \n\nI believe in the industry this is known as \"good writing\".

A simple cover like \u201cFargo\u201d or \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d always peaks my interest. \n\nWith video games, every time a character is slapped on the front cover of a game, it sometimes looks super generic or uninteresting to me. A simple cover like Skyrim, Portal, or Red Faction feature memorable symbols that are easy to remember. \n\nThere are exceptions to this. For example, the Kill Bill cover is tasteful and Uma Thurman is photogenic. Uncharted (the games) is mimicking an action movie, so the covers tell you exactly what you\u2019re going to get. \n\nIn the end, art is subjective.",

I do care if you start picturing her as a Nordic woman or a Russian babushka.\n\nBut if the author takes time to describe someone or a picture of how they envision their character is on the cover...respect that.

I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?\n\nDisclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  I don't debate that and I have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. Not only respect, but gratitude.

            "Well, (basically) everbody agrees that poverty is a problem. Not everybody believes that homosexuality is \u00abright\u00bb, so when we\u2019re discussing homosexuality, we\u2019re not discussing a solution to a problem, but whether there is a problem or not. \n\nWhether there is a problem or not is an ideological question, which I think a lot of people find more interesting to discuss than solution to an established problem. Established problems We mostly leave to the people who studies these things and knows a lot about these things to figure out solutions. ",

His misleading emphasis on focusing on homelessness has nothing to do with logic or proportionality.  **He knows that anti-gay laws exist in Russia and he doesn't/won't question WHY something like that should exist - despite complaining about the world discussing gay rights when it affects a small population.**",

This is how the president is suddenly able to claim immigration is a \u201cnational emergency\u201d after two years in which it clearly hasn\u2019t been. \n\nWhile issues like abortion, immigration, and repeal of gay rights (at this point) may not affect lives as much as poverty/economic struggle, many politicians beat a dead horse in an attempt to secure votes. \n\nThe other side of this is that issues like gay rights affect individual\u2019s rights to civil liberties which makes that group and others understandably pissed. These are the people who begin doing the activism to promote a platform and force politicians to confront the issue. We\u2019re it not for true work, gay people would still be closeted, oppressed and ignored by politicians and media.

But in this current atmosphere LGBT support needs to be very strong considering rights are being taken away and there is a rise in hate crimes. It wouldn't be such a big topic in society if there weren't such big groups against what boils down to basic human rights. \n\nOn to your main point I think you are more pointing out how much of a mess identity politics has become and how that's all democrats vs republicans seem to care about (I'm Canadian but from my impression of American politics, don't get me wrong Canadian politics is somewhat similar) and I don't think that's a mistake, its easy to appeal to emotion and fear and use scapegoats such as \"the gays\" and immigrants, like wise on the democrats side it's easy to gloss over other issues and say well we are helping the fight and the cause, which is good but definitely not the only thing they should be doing. Obviously why not both, but current politicians need to stop using identity politics to dodge other pressing issues, we need to elect officials who are more responsible.\n\nI'm just going to come out and say I'm a fully on commy and I wholeheartedly agree with your suggestion of parades for the poor etc. etc. workers need to unite and I'd love more than ever to see parades like these. That's on us as a population to enact change and unify and organize these types of things. The LGBT community rose up and enacted change because of how dire their situation was getting and how long they had been silenced and unacknowledged. People were dying and the government at the time (nixon I think) was pretty much happy that aids was getting rid of the minorities and gay people, to them it was like a problem solving itself. All of this culminating into the stonewall riots and various parades after that. \n\nMy point is eventually the same is going to happen with the majority (the poor). As they say the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It's going to come to a breaking point sometime. I think we see this with the Gilets Jaunes.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to say, LGBT activism isn't just for LGBT people it helps free society from how constricted we all are with gender and forms of expression.

And this went on and on, it wasn't just one or two passing comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they don't want four more years of Trump, Democrats need to realize that most people do not give two damns how many minority boxes you check off, but especially so about gay rights, and trans rights. Trans rights advocates have honestly done a good job considering half the country discusses them on a daily basis, yet their only a fraction of a percent of the population. If you're a blue collar auto worker or a miner that has been laid off and can't find work in your area, it can understandably be frustrating when people in DC want to talk about trans rights, but employment in your town is 50%. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIronically, I think the dems have an excellent package to sell to voters, and especially blue collar workers. Higher wages, increased workers rights, etc. are all huge selling points that help under-privileged people and dems need to start selling these aspects as opposed to just sellin themselves as the \"party of diversity\".",

As if what we need is yet another law added to the plethora of laws that now control most aspects of our lives in our, supposedly, free country.\n\nPerhaps the solution would be to let capitalism work the way it should. Why do such jobs exist? Because there are people willing to take them. \n\nIt\u2019s like McDonalds. For years people have complained that the prices kept going up while the quality of food went down. Yet, everyone kept buying food from McDonald\u2019s. What possible reason would they have to improve their product when the people were voting with their wallets and their votes said McDonald\u2019s was doing a bang up job of providing value equal to the cost?\n\nSo, last year ( maybe it started a little sooner ) McDonald\u2019s sales started to decline. The numbers were rather concerning, when taken into perspective. And, suddenly, a few months ago, I stopped in a McDonald\u2019s to grab food late at night, strictly out of convenience as I was on a long drive through the area, and, lo and behold: I had the best quarter pounder with cheese I\u2019d ever had. It looked and tasted like it was really made out of hamburger. Usually, their burgers look like they were made from some sort of batter and barely resemble the taste of beef.\n\nAnd, it wasn\u2019t a fluke. I have tried their burgers again, a number of times since then and have had the experience consistently repeated. \n\nDue to declining sales ( people voting with their wallets ), McDonald\u2019s has improved the quality of their quarter pounder with cheese. And, I have voted with my wallet, again, in favor of this change.\n\nInstead of wishing for yet more government control and restriction ( an idea that goes against everything America was founded on ), the better idea would be to become active and campaign to get people to stop being willing to take such jobs. If they can\u2019t find qualified people to fill those positions for the money they offer, they will be forced to offer higher wages. And, that is a very American way to handle such things....a return to the ideas we were founded on.",

No one puts a gun to your head to take the job. You have every right to turn it down and look elsewhere. You voluntarily accept their shitty job offer which perpetuates the problem because now they know people will accept said shitty job offer for that much.\n\nIf people just didnt take those jobs and left them continuously looking for labor, those companies that try to pull that shit will realize no one wants to do that work for $9 and will either have to lower their standards or raise their wages.\n\nIt\u2019s always easy to blame companies because they are soulless and greedy but it\u2019s the people (labor) that enables them to do it because they apply for and accept those shitty jobs. A company\u2019s purpose is to make as much money as possible while keeping costs as low as possible.\n\nShitty on the company for trying to exploit people but also shitty on the people for voluntarily letting themselves get exploited and then complain about it.",

She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).\n\nIf you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.\n\nNow, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.\n\nI see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of \"moral well\" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.\n\nThis is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.\n\nReally, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.\n\nEDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.\n\nEDIT 2: This post is really blowing up, so I wanted to share [this video]( https://youtu.be/8K9Gg164Bsw) posted by /u/thefarrquad which I think applies to this situation.",

            "I agree, and it's been on my mind for a while (not in relation to her specifically but in general). I think instead of promoting the idea \"you are beautiful, she is beautiful, everyone is beautiful!\", we should promote the idea \"It's FINE to NOT be beautiful. You don't have to be beautiful to be happy, you don't have to be beautiful to love yourself and be loved by others. Not everyone HAS TO be beautiful\".    \nI'm not disfigured or anything, but I have some issues with my appearence, so I've been struggling with my self-image a lot. And people telling me \"Aww, it's okay, you're still beautiful!\" never helped, cause well, I have eyes, I have mirrors and if I don't see any beauty in there, no one can convince me otherwise. And even if they sincerely think I'm beautiful but I don't think so myself, it doesn't really matter anyway.    \nBut what really does help is understanding that beauty is not everything and not being beautiful doesn't stop you from enjoying your life in all its aspects and still being happy. So yeah, I wish this idea would be promoted more instead of meaningless \"everyone is beautiful!\"    \nSorry for the rant.",

It's, then, clearly about her disfigurement which puts emphasis on her looks rather than her personality. I think OP's opinion stems from this.\n\n\n\nThis behavior radiates the idea that she is not normal and needs special attention and positivity. It becomes hurtful in this sense. I'm guessing she would enjoy her achievements much more if people approach him as a normal person that she is, rather than with a patronizing sympathy.\n\n\n\nI feel this way about my own shortcomings, be it physical or otherwise. I may not be in a comparable situation but I'm trying to empathize. I'd like people to only know/acknowledge my struggles about  my shortcomings at most, rather than disregard them with obviously well-intentioned but humiliating compliments. I'd feel better if they realise I'm OK with them, rather than they think I need to be made feel OK by their support. She knows she won't be enjoying some advantages of being beautiful inside because she is not traditionally good-looking. Most of us do know this. I bet she's mature enough to be OK with it. \n\n\nSo, let's let her enjoy the strong and nice personality she had to cultivate and acknowledge/appreciate this by acting normal around her.",

In some ways, people who react in over-the-top ways to individuals with facial deformities posting a selfie or uploading a makeup tutorial are participating in inspiration porn.

You were *this* close to getting the point. ALL people, regardless of ability or facial normality, are worthy of love, respect, and dignity. All people are worthy of feeling beautiful. I encourage you to do some research and listen to disabled voices. A social media hashtag that I have found educative is #AbledsAreWeird, where disabled people recount times in their live that abled people were over the top and condescending toward them. All people are worthy of dignity and respect. Treating people as such spans from refraining from participating in condescension to refraining from spewing insults such as \u201cfreak show\u201d.",

            ">By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered beautiful\n\n- Not everyone telling her she is beautiful is speaking objectively and according to societal standards. And the majority that are do it out of pity or to lift her up, that's a humane reaction and there's empathy in that. Most of these people value beauty too much and base human worth of it, they are not to blame, we are taught that way. Not being beautiful shouldn't be seen as a negative thing, what these people are actually trying to tell her is that she is worth it - it's almost as if they are trying to go against what they are taught but it's having the opposite effect. She is fully aware of what she looks like objectively and is not deceiving herself is she thinks she is beautiful because people do have a different definition of beauty, believe it or not. It's hard to believe something and grasp a concept when you don't perceive it that way yourself. Personality plays towards physicality and there is beauty in being human. The way you move, talk, think, walk and just are. Some of us genuinely find beauty in her.",

You talk about knowing the poetic side of beauty, but there's also the idea that a person can have a beautiful personality or a beautiful worldview.

Seeing someone with such a deformity smile, go on with their life, make videos, put on make up like any other girl her age, and achieve things is beautiful. Society sometimes tells people with certain handicaps that they can't do certain things. And she is empowering other people like her to disregard those things. Your post seems very narrow minded. You would be right if those comments specifically addressed her face saying she has a beautiful face. They most likely didn't. They are uplifting a beautiful soul and that is the right thing to do. In the sea of nice comments only few get a lot of likes so why would anyone write something just to reaffirm themselves, when their comment will barely be seen and when they are just an annonymus account online. They do it because they most likely mean it. I think you're really digging in the negative here.",

I am on the other end of the spectrum and I\u2019m grateful there are people rallying to build her self confidence. The world is very cruel to people with facial abnormalities like this. I think kindness, and taking a moment out of your day to compliment someone or encourage them, is one of the best things you can ever do. Our world desperately needs kindness. But when you say things like, \u201cpeople flock to see the freak show\u201d - I think that says a lot more about you than it does anything else. I would never, in a million years, look at her and think freak show. Ever. She has a terrible facial deformity. It\u2019s 2019. Let her live her life.

I actually had friends tell me \"you can do better\" because I'm a pretty attractive guy (again by societal standards). Bit honestly, for me anyway, a hot girl with nothing going on upstairs just isn't attractive to me.",
            "Ya know, beauty is subjective. It\u2019s not disingenuous or patronizing or self congratulatory if you are telling the truth. Your truth.  What is beautiful to you may not be beautiful to me. Have you heard the phrase \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the beholder\u201d? This is a perfect example of that. \n\nI love Picasso\u2019s art. His subjects have not so normal faces and I find them beautiful.  Just because someone\u2019s face is not \u201cnormal\u201d or to societal standards does not make them ugly. Plus once you start to get to know someone the looks go to the wayside. You don\u2019t even see their imperfections or deformities. You see the beauty of who they *really* are and those superficial things no longer matter. This comes with emotional depth and maturity. As does understanding that others do not think the same way you think. \n\nYou telling someone else what you think is beautiful and discounting that person\u2019s opinion of beauty is what is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest and self-congratulatory.",
            "I find burn scars and some other scars to be so attractive and sexual. I literally blush when I see them on people. And if I\u2019m allowed to touch them even better. I\u2019m sure it comes off as creepy and weird when I tell them their skin is so beautiful but I really believe it. Maybe it\u2019s fetishizing them but I honestly believe they\u2019re beautiful.",
            "you're a cunt",
            "I can agree with you because I know the kinds of people the post is referring to saying these things.\n\nAlso, beauty means different things to different people. It doesn't mean you would bang them or find them 'attractive'. People can be beautiful for all sorts reasons - some of which are far from physical . \n\nMany 'ugly' people are beautiful\nand many beautiful people are ugly",
            "Translation: \u201c**I** can\u2019t get past this, so I assume that no one else on earth can either. Therefore anyone who finds some beauty in her must be lying, because I\u2019m as crippled by egocentrism as the average toddler and can\u2019t imagine anyone feeling differently than me about anything.\u201d",
            "Thanks for FINALLY speaking the truth. 100% agree. To add to this I see some B.S. on something like \"rate my beauty \" about morbidly obese people being \"sooooo beaaauuuttifullll\" and it's utterly disgusting. Bed sores and body odor are not good and you're sick in the head if you disagree.",
            "In all honesty, I'd much rather see this than people doing the opposite. And just being ass holes over the Internet through the protection of a screen.\n\nBeauty is a societal construct, just look at what the ideal female body was 100 years ago and follow that through to now decade by decade.\nI understand what you mean about scientifically speaking. But there is no bench mark or standalone definition. After many ups and downs throughout life I have came to realise a few things; looks fade, personality rarely does, like wine it gets better with time (before someone gets all scientific, I know there are sweet spots for wine), I have encountered many hot people who have had the personality and outlook of a feral ghoul which instantly ruined any sort of attraction.\nAnd I know this works both ways, I have met ugly people who have been nasty pos's which ultimately left me thinking, \"what a troll\". However, as I previously stated, I'd much rather people were positive over the Internet than negative.\n\n\nI think a good personality is far greater than looks. \n\nBut back to the topic, I understand your point although I disagree partly, nobody should ever let the words of others dictate how or who they want to be (within reason).\n\n~your reflection's perception is a projection of the media~",

            "I diasgree. I think we can deconstruct this image of beauty, and i wholeheartedly believe she is beautiful, like i\u2018m not saying this to make her feel good. I personally think there\u2018s many different types of beauty, and i so think this girl has some of them, if it\u2018s maybe just charisma or persoanlity, or a beautiful smile, idk. And i don\u2018t agree with the comparison of fat people, there\u2018s a difference in what someone can change or not change, and if it\u2018s healthy and putting them at risk by lying to them or not. This girl can\u2018t change how she looks. She shouldn\u2018t be made to feel like she should, or because she looks like this she will forever be ugly and can\u2018t have a certain type of beauty, because she can\u2018t change it anyways. When people make this argument with fat-acceptance people that saying they\u2018re beautiful is lying to them, they need to know the truth, etc, it sometimes seems like they gotta put it upon themselves to show these people how ugly they are, how they need to change, when really, they probably already know, or at least don\u2018t need to hear it from another stranger. Often these people just wanna get away with veing assholes really. Like it\u2018s not your responsibility for that person to get healthy, for you to keep saying how ugly they are. They probably already know. And what good does this do with a kid who can\u2018t even change the way she looks? Like really - what will it bring you, or her, to tell her she\u2018s not beautiful. What\u2018s the outcome. This really isn\u2018t a sarcastic question lol. Like i get it to a point with overweight people (i still dont think its ur place if its a complete stranger, but with a friend, for them to get healthy, and not saying it wvery 3 seconds, then yes absolutely i agree), but people who can\u2018t change their looks, and it\u2018s not dangerous for them in any way to be the way they are? What\u2018s the point? And why is it your personal problem to let her know she\u2018s \u201eugly\u201c (when beauty is subjective anyways)? Personally i think beauty is kindness and personality anyways, and being mean and rudw and out of place for no reason, to a stranger, doesn\u2018t really make you beautiful either in my eyes. \n\nAnd to the \u201eshe\u2018ll get delusional, she won\u2018t know she\u2018s ugly\u201c part - i mean, soes it matter? What good does it do for her walking around thinking she isn\u2018t ugly? This is a kid still. And second - trust me. She knows. She certainly knows. When you look like no one around you, no one on instagram, no one people calm beautiful - you know you\u2018re ugly. Or you think you\u2018re ugly at least. I\u2018ve had severe acne, couldn\u2018t get rid of it no matter how hard i tried for multiple years, i knew i was fucking ugly lmao. It hurt. And even if people close to me said \u201eyou\u2018re still beautiful!\u201c i knew i was ugly. Walking around my city, getring stares, strangers i met for a second telling me i should try this or that to get rid of this hideous thing, this let me know i\u2018m ugly. She\u2018s not delusional. When you look different, you know you\u2018re ugly, so that argument doesn\u2018t really make sense, to me at least\n\nAnd what does it matter. What does it matter if she think she\u2018s beautiful. If people tell her she\u2018s beautiful. Imagine growing up with this, in elementary school, always being different, being stared at. Imagine what that does to your self esteem. What does it matter if she found some people who tell her she\u2018s beautiful. \n\nI think she\u2018s beautiful, from a personality standpoint (which is a hige factor in determining beauty, as kitchy as that sounds) and her looks as well. Her smile her eyes, she is beautiful, even if a lot don\u2018t see her as this, because there\u2018s this one standard of beauty one should follow.

Out of the 13.7% of americans who smoked cigarettes in the past year, 80% of them smoke every day. There is almost no 'moderate' smoking in the long term. \n\nThat is why there has to be *far* more advertising against cigarettes. Once you start, its nearly impossible to stop. The vast, vast majority of the 80% of americans who drink are not alcoholics, and can stop whenever they want. With cigarettes, you have to attack it from the very source, to stop it from happening in the first place. \n\nAlcoholism is a huge issue. It needs to be targeted more.

Conversely, smoking *is* absolutely terrible for your health and highly addictive\u20143 out of 5 people who ever try a cigarette will become a daily smoker.  [3 out of 5 will become daily smokers](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180109214939.htm)  Add on top of that smoking kills an estimated 50% of all smokers whether through heart disease or lung cancer.  This means while alcoholism and smoking are both major detriments to public health, smoking wildly outpaces alcohol in deaths caused.  In 2016, alcohol caused 3.1 million deaths worldwide vs. tobacco\u2019s 7.1 million, meaning tobacco\u2019s death rate more than doubles alcohol\u2019s each year.  \n\nLet\u2019s not forget 1.2 million of those tobacco deaths each year are caused by second-hand smoke.  So, yes, smokers most certainly do kill people on a daily basis.  In my experience, most people don\u2019t give a shit if you smoke.  It\u2019s just another vice.  We do give a shit if you smoke *next* to us, people who did not consent to breathing in your toxic, carcinogenic fumes.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree there needs to be more messaging and support surrounding alcoholism.  But discouraging alcohol use for the general public isn\u2019t an effective strategy.  Pouring money into rehab facilities and social services for the unfortunate few who do get addicted would be an effective, targeted solution.  A national anti-drinking campaign directed towards the entire population?  That sounds like the perfect recipe for the most widely mocked public health campaign in history.",

If someone smokes a cigarette, they cause some harm to themselves in exchange for their vice. But that cigarette also produces smoke and particulates that permeate the environment around the smoker. Bystanders who breathe it in are also harmed, and generally are harmed significantly more than the smoker. Children and pets who interact with surrounding surfaces can be harmed. Sometimes as long as years and decades later if the residue is bad enough. And this is all ignoring the reality of people (including children) with respiratory problems like asthma, allergies, viruses, etc. \n\n\nThere's also the fact that a nicotine addiction can be handled with a dozen other products that don't produce the same secondhand issue. If you need your buzz, you can use patches, dips, gum. If you need the physical stick in your mouth, vape pens are easy to find. At this point in the world, there is absolutely no *reason* to smoke a combustion based nicotine product around other people other than you want to. And that's where the vitriol regarding it comes in; if you make the active choice to smoke a cigarette next to strangers who didn't give the okay, you're an asshole.\n\n\nAlcohol has problems too.

            "Isn\u2019t this a false equivalence? Most people that try nicotine will get addicted to it fairly quickly. It is insanely addictive, and you can\u2019t really explain to people that the easiest way to not get hooked is to avoid trying it ever. As a result, you have to kind of beat people over the head with it. Also, the message seems a bit more loud and silly (cool kids don\u2019t smoke, etc), because they\u2019re aiming it at teenagers susceptible to peer pressure. \n\nBy contrast, most people having a drink aren\u2019t going to become alcoholics. There are plenty of don\u2019t drink and drive PSAs, but they will generally be targeted at young adults and mid-30\u2019s happy hour goers, often focusing on the legal and financial consequences of doing so.

They were about 18,000 the vehicular deaths attributable to alcohol. Considering the 20 to 1 ratio in deaths it's quite justifiable to see the anti-smoking ads.\n\nPS - there are far more dangerous and destructive habits than alcohol. You sound like a Temperance advocate back in the nineteen hundreds.",
            "Alcohol is dangerous but it\u2019s by far the easiest drug to moderate. You know exactly what you\u2019re getting, and you can control what you pour for yourself. The same cannot be said of smoking however.",
            "i get what you mean, but since in moderate amounts, alcohol is acceptable, it\u2019s has less of a chance as being classified as something that necessarily needs to be taken care of. it is only in very large amounts that it may dub you as an alcoholic and be damaging to your health, as well as causing you to hurt others in your drunkenness. another thing to note is the fact that it has always been normalised, so it\u2019s just something that many people do in general.\n\nhowever, with cigarettes and smoking in general, it tends to kill people a lot more easily, it is in fact one of the biggest killers in the world. even the people who smoke in moderate amounts know that it\u2019s bad and damaging to their health, people are told this from a young age, which is why  when they do it despite that fact, they are seen as idiots. unless they seemingly don\u2019t know that, which proves the point of them being idiots. cigarettes are also quite considerably more recent than alcohol, so it hasn\u2019t been normalised as much.\n\ni agree that alcohol should also be something that we should be aware of, but by far smoking has had more of an immediate effect on our society and those who live in it.\n\nedit: also, not calling everyone who smokes an idiot, just explaining why they can be viewed that way",
            "There\u2019s a ton of reasons why this is the case. Number 1, smoking is way more addictive than drinking. You don\u2019t have people that just smoke once a month or with dinner. It\u2019s addictive for everyone that does it, alcohol is only for some. Number 2, second hand smoke is a problem and used to be much more. It\u2019s horrible in public for people that can\u2019t handle smoke, and would stick with clothes and hair for days. Number 3, smoking is way more of a health risk, which is what the commercials are meant for. Heart disease and lung cancer are extremely high causes of death, and smoking causes both. Removing smoking helps fix the nation\u2019s health. Number 4, smoking, especially e-cigarette and vapes, are still acceptable and thought of positively. Next to no one supports drunk driving or drunken violence. You\u2019re punished when you do those things and there\u2019s strong social stigmas.",

            "A large part of why these issues don't get solved is because we pit them against each other. Both are bad , both slowly kill you. They both not only affect the individual but they have consequences that affect everyone around them. Someone's who an alcoholic is a risk to those around them, So is someone who smokes, and both take part in risky unhealthy behavior. The thing is we shouldn't condemn the people who have vices, instead we need to recognize why these vices exist. Both are recognized to be coping behaviors for trauma. You have to treat the trauma and the chemical dependancy. The danger I see with alcohol is the stigma that exists around it, it's cool, it's fun, it's what you do, if you don't do it your boring, if you don't do it you don't get accepted. The same stigma surrounded cigarettes not 50 years ago. We're probably going to need another 50 years to start condemning alcohol as a society as well.",

I\u2019ve come out the other side of other addictions but nicotine is almost impossible to escape, and it\u2019s only worsened by the way people treat smokers. I never do it in front of others, in fact I\u2019m deeply ashamed and afraid of anyone finding out I smoke. I don\u2019t drink, and I find it abhorrent and hypocritical that the same people who are judgmental about my smoking let themselves get sloppy and out of control like that. At least I don\u2019t throw up on myself and need people to carry me home. Why am I a social reject but that\u2019s totally acceptable? I\u2019ve never hurt anyone by smoking, ever (though I suppose you could argue I hurt myself but I do realize that already and have absorbed it), and I don\u2019t understand the disdain. \n\nTreating smoking like a horrible taboo thing only encourages people struggling to quit to relapse. And the constant ads are so annoying they can\u2019t possibly be doing any good.",

We understood each others\u2019 bodies, no difficulty orgasming, but she was always sort of..unsure I guess, and it didn\u2019t really flow for either of us with much abandon or creativity or enthusiasm. \n\nWell, now years and many ups and downs later, we have gradually gone from being emotionally kind of dim-witted to emotionally literate and self aware, we\u2019re constantly aware of and caring of each other\u2019s mental situation and communicate easily about it.  And our love has greatly deepened and feels a lot simpler, in a way, and more constant.\n\nAnd, as if by magic (actually it\u2019s obvious why in hindsight), now we have more sex and the sex is fucking incredible.  Whole body, whole heart, no thinking, like a dance.  \n\nI think for many couples who have been together for a while beyond the initial novelty, being intimate and secure emotionally is a prerequisite for great sex.  Or perhaps for many people, period, based on their emotional makeup and perhaps bad experiences in the past.  This may be the case more for woman than men, at least initially or on average \u2014 although my own experience of sex has gradually become just as dependent on and heightened by emotional connectedness as my wife as I\u2019ve become a more open person.\n\nUh, I have no fucking clue if this will make sense to anyone.

            "Porn indoctrinates our society from a very young age. It doesn\u2019t just effect men, but the women too. I, and I\u2019m not the only one, grew up thinking the way to have sex is to splay over something and let the man do whatever he wanted to me. Good sex does not look like porn, but where are we to learn that? Furthermore, who opens the discussion when men believe they should be dominate bordering on violent and always be in control, yet both partners are dissatisfied? \n\nForeplay is more important for women than men, biologically speaking. However in my and most of the women I know, foreplay is usually just a blowjob. That gives me nothing. It actually makes me dry up because I\u2019m focusing on the task so much. I have to speak up and ask for attention, which is again not something we\u2019re taught is okay and I still struggle with it, and by the time my body has been prepared, his dick needs more sucking to get back in the game. Can\u2019t tell you how many blowjobs I\u2019ve given as the only course before sex. Luckily, my body gets wet very easily so while it isn\u2019t always the best, sometimes I\u2019m just able to completely skip everything and go to penetration. Which for women, doesn\u2019t feel as good as you might imagine. Those screaming pornstars are lying again. Most of the sensation and pleasure of sex stuff comes from the clit, and internal stimulation can range from good, to weird, to not much at all. Lastly, I have a huge dislike of semen. But I \u201cmMMmm\u201d and swallow it and rub it all around anyway, because I\u2019m supposed to. It\u2019s not unnatural to not want sticky, gross tasting globs of goo all over your face, stinging your eyes, making your throat feel raw, cooling on your stomach, sliding off your back. In fact, if you want to talk \u201cnatural\u201d that stuff should only go in the vagina, but women are expected to gleefully roll around it in and eat it for breakfast.

            "Oh, god.  Speaking as a successful male sex guy, there are worse things than a woman always wanting to be on bottom.\n\nThere are many, many women who want to \"ride\" and it turns out to be much more like \"sitting\".  It takes a certain amount of energy, fitness, and coordination to hop up and down on dick, much less well.  It's not overly difficult but most of sex isn't.  It's just that they imagine being a wonton sex pot and they gas out after 30 seconds.  After they try to keep going and it degenerates into a sad flopping, then weak grinding, then they lay on top of you wheezing and sweating trying to whisper / bite your ear.  EW.  Ladies, rest assured this is just as gross as when a dude does it and trying to maintain an erection during this is *not* easy.\n\nNot mentioned, *horrible* blowjobs are the worst thing that can happen to a guy.  Unenthusiastic gagging, teeth scraping, revulsion, and immature & overly dramatic disgust--like, there is nothing more boner killer than someone acting put out and angry about sex.  It doesn't matter what it is, it's a huge turn off.  I also find myself avoiding or not wanting to reciprocate-- and what a shitty atmosphere that brings to the table for something that's supposed to be about pleasure!\n\nWhich goes back to a simple formula -- men tend to be about quantity, and women tend to be about quality.  But some women loudly complain about lazy, bad lovers and that's accepted by default by society.  The problem, though, is they are selfish, shitty lovers and *that* was the reason they were sexually unfulfilled.  God help you if you try to tell them they're not a porn star.  Because they always displaced blame for their awful sex on their partner and the partner ghosts them.  Cue all the whiney FB / IG / Tweets about there being \"no good men\" and \"if you can't handle me at my worst\".  You can get any guy at any time?  OK great.

I really loved the work and got to spend my mornings doing fun, creative projects with my kids (making comic books, building cardboard houses, etc). I was also totally in charge of these kids schedules so I built in several \u201cwalks\u201d during the day where we just went outside and walked around, and like an hour total of recess. \n\nAt 1 I got to drive home and beat the 5 o clock rush hour. I had plenty of time to run errands or do chores. I went to yoga or went swimming at the lake almost daily. I had plenty of time to hang out with friends. It was really nice. \n\nThe unhappiest I\u2019ve ever been was during student teaching. Got up at 6:00, didn\u2019t get home until 5:30-6:00, plus I always had a few hours of lesson planning/grading/university work to do. Twice a week I had to go straight from teaching to a mandatory 3 hour university lecture on how to be a teacher lol. On those days I didn\u2019t get home until 8. I had to be asleep by 10:00 in order to function the next day, so I basically had 4 hours once I got home to do everything. (Less on lecture days)\n\nWhat really got to me about that situation was because I was spending 12+ hours a day on this \u201cjob\u201d in it became my whole life/identity. If I didn\u2019t do a good job, or something went wrong, it became a reflection on my worth as a person. I didn\u2019t have anything else to define myself by because I had no time for hobbies or exercise or even seeing friends. When there was a problem at work it totally consumed me and I dealt with some pretty awful anxiety that semester. It got to the point where I was waking up multiple times a night to practice my lessons because I couldn\u2019t sleep. I didn\u2019t see my friends for months. It was rough. \n\nI think a lot about how I could structure my life in order to be able to live permanently like when I worked at the summer camp. I think if I lived frugally I could make it work. \n\nBut I also want to save money, travel, and retire at some point so that may not work out.",

I was a UK Guardian reader from my student days onward, as a left leaning, educated young person, it was the obvious choice, for it's world leading investigative journalism and opinions. However I had been used to regular articles criticising the EU and telling me to question our involvement in it and had become a major skeptic myself, mainly by their reporting. However once the referendum happened, the Guardian (just like David Cameron) did a complete 180 pretty much overnight and went full on remain, and angrily attacking people who were voting leave. That was the first time I noticed comments being disabled - because they knew full well a tsunami of angry readers was about to engulf it. Since then the guardian has ceased to be a classic liberal paper which questions authority and appeals to normal grounded people and has adopted the extreme left militant ideology that big tech has been pushing. Today it is par for the course, 5 years ago you could comment on every single article in the guardian, now if you look at the front page, you will be lucky to find one with the comments turned on, simply because they have become head of the propaganda wheel and know their articles are full of hate baiting lies. I can honestly think of no bigger sellout in media.",

Mostly because of the only people commenting were wackjobs posting blatant lies and hate speech. There's no place for commentary on fact based, first to post journalism. Provided they have an open-to-all method to contact them regarding any misprints, news organizations should have the ability to disable distracting / detracting comments.  \n\nBTW, have you *read* YouTube comments? It's disappointing that the majority of the internet feels they can post anything they'd like without any repercussion (he claims on Reddit).  \n\nIf you want to share your opinion or have a thoughtful discussion, you can click the share button on YouTube to post it to Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter or otherwise find it already posted on those platforms. \n\nI read a lot of my news through RSS readers which strip out the ads and comments section. If I want to comment on a subject, I go to the original website or find the story on Reddit. Also, comment sections on many websites have built-in trackers. News organizations shouldn't participate in any tracking cookies. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe your local news channel is trying to drive you to their website to comment where they *can* track you and sell advertising and tracking information. \n\nThere used to be a time when people just kept their comments to themselves.

It's their videos so they get to choose the settings. I believe in freedom of being able to control your own things and not the enforcement of random arbitrary rules just because it suits someone's meaningless preference on something.\n\nAlso nothing is stopping you from linking to the video on a social media platform like Facebook or Reddit and starting a conversation there.

But the thing is, even if real people win the lottery, it's still a tax on the players.\n\nYou may not want to hear it, but the real solution is to just not have lotteries. Governments in particular should not be allowed to collect these types of regressive taxes on their most financially vulnerable citizens. Here in Texas, we collect more in lottery proceeds than in taxes on most major industries, and that's the case in most states. By the end of the 19th century, lotteries were banned in most states because everyone knew what a corrupting influence they were on state legislatures and how bad they were for the people. They started coming back in the Reagan Era to help make up lost revenue from taxes and now almost every state runs a lottery. It's dystopian.\n\nYes, it's horrible that lottery winners have to face harassment and even physical violence when the public learns their identity, but the real injustice is that the state is running these lotteries in the first place.\n\nEdit: No point trying to convince OP of anything given the sorts of comments he's leaving around here (which give the impression he's a lottery winner or thoroughly convinced of imminent winnings)... but no, paid actors are not a viable way to rig lotteries because they're too simple a scheme and would be immediately discovered by investigators and, even if they were undiscovered, they would be so expensive as to defeat the point - the organization would have to set the actor up for life or face extortion.

It made me genuinely angry to see people bitch about this stuff, when some of my students were r\\*ped or even sold by family members. I watched people starve.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID. I will always loath the logic of \"why are you upset- other people have it much worse elsewhere.\"\n\nYes, taco bell closing is stupid. yes, you can wait a few extra days for your package. But America is far from perfect, and shouldn't be held as flawless because it's \"worse elsewhere\".\n\nYou know how much medical care cost in my host country? nothing. it was free. If you got malaria, your anti malarials were free. HIV testing was free. ART was free. No one was homeless. the idea of homelessness was absurd. If someone was not able to take care of themselves, they would still be taken care of by a community.\n\nTLDR: Yes, it's much much worse elsewhere, and witnessing that will change how you feel about your own country (and probably traumatize you a bit).

For example, go live in Korea for a while, and get sick, or have a wisdom tooth need getting pulled, and suddenly you'll realize that what we call health care is an absolute joke and that they utterly dominate us in that area.\n\nBut then you'll see how school kids are abused and how mental illness or even just learning disability is ignored and brushed under the rug, and you'll realize we have that shit figured out.\n\nAmerica has a lot of problems, and America has a lot of things we truly excel in. It's totally fair to look at another county and say \"yeah we do X and Y better than them\" but you must also be willing to look at other countries and say \"you know what, they do Z better than us, we should learn from them.\"",

Unlike most other nations, we are based on individuals and not collectively.  There is a very complicated web in America, but the last thing we are is inferior.",

I think your thoughts about people who complain about America is just that these people have never experienced any sort of adversity or any sort of experience in other countries. I would say that's unfair for them; albeit I do suppose it depends what they're bitching about.

To tell the people who are asking for change in a country that they should shut up and accept things as they are because it is bad somewhere else in the world is downright stupid. Why compare America to a third world country at all? Why have this fake binary? If you do wanna compare yourself then do so with other functioning western democracies. Compare yourself with Scandinavia or Germany or Canada.\n\nPeople upvoting this shit makes me truly sad. Yes, America is a great place to live in when your govt is working for you but you aren't living in normal times right now. Your social fabric is getting frayed and institutions are under attack from your own govt. Stand up and fucking fight to maintain the sanctity of your institutions and improve them. You have all the means to bring about the change you want so don't squander it and especially don't fucking pat yourself on the back comparing yourself to the third-world. Be better.",

            "Maybe I'm the one with the unpopular opinion, but I respectfully disagree.  I personally love when books end on some sort of cliffhanger because although they keep me thinking for a while, I think that's the point.  It helps me realize that in life we don't always get closure and that's okay.  It's better to just move on and keep living your life because in the end there's not much you can control.  Of course, there are certain books or even series that are guilty of doing it the lazy way, but I do think there are books and novels out there that are meant to mean something to the reader.  I think the people who hate the meaningful cliffhangers in books are just in denial that not everything that comes their way in life is in their control.",

            "Joker is a great exception to your post. The movie is structured to make you question everything about the reality shown in the movie, and it ends with making you wonder what actually went down. But this isnt laziness. If anything, it fits with the very nature of the Joker.\n\nThroughout the film, we constantly see examples of events or relationships that never existed, and they exclusively reside in Arthur's head. If it turns out that the entire plot of the film was just a daydream that Arthur had in the asylum, it would totally fit. I honestly prefer the idea that Arthur created a reality in his head where he caused the death of everyone who ever wronged him, and that he practically becomes a god to the people of Gotham\n\nAnd I am happy with not knowing the truth. It gives me room to speculate and try to understand Arthur's character. But this doesnt apply to every movie and show.\n\nI dont think its always laziness. I attribute those kind of endings to be like a lot of paintings. Not all beautiful paintings spell out the meaning behind it. The artist wants you to speculate and find its meaning on your own. Its basically a \"Journey and not the destination\" type thing. It isnt as meaningful if someone just tells you what this story is about. You have to come to understand it yourself\n\nOf course other times the writer is too lazy to think of a meaningful ending, and they just want you to figure it out. It depends",

It's about this teenager that runs away from home and starts living on his own i the wild, and over the course of a year he starts having a life that fulfils him, and slowly but steafily mends his relationship with his father (who he ran away from).

Believe me, that\u2019s not how it works. It makes no sense at all dude. If a story ends in a cliffhanger it is because it was intended to do so. It was intended to spike up your curiosity or whatever emotions you\u2019re left with by the ending of the story. But I don\u2019t think even a 1% of stories are ended in a cliffhanger just out of laziness. It is absurd to think that way. Its would be like assuming that a not-so-good rear of a car was left that way out of laziness, but it never happens like this.

If it\u2019s a literal, physical ending like \u201cdid the character survive?\u201d then a cliffhanger is definitely lazy and unappealing.

Not judging you for going for frozens, I do it too, but I am a bit snobby about them. Frozen yakisoba, curry rolls, pbjs, mozz sticks, all have some great texture when prepared properly.

As someone new to this site, it seems to me that these do nothing to encourage the free exchange of ideas, and basically just exist to reinforce some kind of unwritten, yet universally understood consensus criteria which is executed unconsciously by members and by which everything is Judged.\n\nPeople seem to have a vague, instinctual sense of what the Hivemind wants, and play up to it for purposes of generating the social currency of Reddit which is Karma. Sometimes they get it wrong, or just resist it, and in such cases, they are instantly and viciously torn to shreds like an ant entering a stream of ants from a different colony  by other posters who apparently relish such opportunities to pay totem to the reddit Hivemind God, which validates this behavior and rewards their faith once again through the miracle of upvotes.\n\nThe net result is a kind of vapid, recycled echo chamber. The froth and dregs, but no middle. The same ideas offered up like prayers, in all manner of instances which may in some cases even be unique in their particularities, but usually aren't, and never vary in theme-- -Forever.\n\nIt's a collective beast of emotion operating on some algorithm of demented, utterly artificial and totally insincere pseudo-morality which is either the petard upon which it has hoisted itself or otherwise serves as an excuse to spruik inconsequential, meaningless drivel to the end of feeding its insane and profound addiction to a meaningless Fiat: Karma.\n\nI do not think, outside of a very select handful of subs, it is good for anybody.",

Facebook will ban users for things posted even in secret groups using their bot, and while I've never been banned for a comment on messenger, I rarely use it so I'm not sure if that really happens. I spent 11 months last year banned from the entirety of Facebook, and I'm on my second 30 day ban this year. \n\nReddit is kind of in between. It's becoming more and more restrictive as we gain more users, and those same users who are migrating away from heavily censored sites like Facebook are demanding more censorship here because they're morons. *But* Reddit still lets subs moderate their own content, for the most part. \n\nThat's what makes Reddit great. Yes, the overall user base leans left. Yes, there are subs like r/againsthatesubreddits that actively seek out and get Reddit to ban content they find offensive.

There's been one or two before then, like when /r/Politics banned some right wing websites and a lot of left wing ones, but that was the one that got the ball rolling.\n\nSince then, there's been a new one practically every year. Fun Fact, it's also had a *direct* effect of turning the site from the Center/Neutral stance that it's userbase once was, and turning it into the mostly Left stance it has today.\n\n* 2014: The Switch (Upvotes/Downvotes are changed to percentages rather than actual numbers.)\n\n* 2015: Ellen Pao (Reddit puts out a fuckload of new rules, banning a *LOT* of popular communites.)\n\n* 2016: LOTS of shit, a lot of it involving Spez, and a lot involving The_Donald. (Fun fact, before the admins started stepping in, T_D was the most popular sub by miles, completely covering /r/all. Reddit's hatred of Trump only happened Post-Election.)\n\n* 2017: Reddit bans /r/altright and inflicts more sanctions on T_D (I was in the hospital and away from the internet for most of this year, so I can't think of much more.)\n\n* 2018:Spez admits to hiding \"Russian Troll activity\" from users. Creator of Kotaku in Action removes all mods and privated the sub, saying it had become \"infested with racism and sexism,\" before Reddit itself reinstated the mods and the sub.\n\n* 2019: Tencent invests $150 million into Reddit and Reddit quarantined T_D.\n\nIf these don't sound too controversial to you, or specifically targeted, keep in mind that since it's inception, Reddit has claimed to be a \"bastion of free speach.\" Up until 2015, they had followed through on that claim. Since then however, Spez and kn0thing, the creators of Reddit, have tried to backpedal on those claims.

Everytime I would mention disliking it I would get downvoted, sometimes heavily. I say this to illustrate the fact that I understand why you might not like the system. People deciding to upvote/downvote based on whether they agree or not really annoys me (especially on this sub). However, even though the majority of people misuse the sytem (in my opinion) I still think it has merit,a lot of people do upvote/downvote based on the context of the sub (auch as unpopular opinions actually being upvoted). Its also importnat to remember that Reddit is made as much for memes and subs like r/thatHappened as it is for Political subs, so it makes sense to be able to upvote/downvote based on whether you found it funny.\n\nThe hive-mind thing does annoy me though.

Before getting one, however, I sat down with my roommates and checked with all of them to make sure they were all 100% ok with me having a dog, since my decision would affect them too. I made it explicitly clear that they could talk to me about it privately if they had any objections, and that if it was going to cause problems, I absolutely would not get a dog. \n\nEverybody told me they were fine with it, even expressed they were excited to have a dog in the apartment, so I went ahead and, a few weeks later, brought home my dog.\n\nAnd then one roommate starts avoiding me, glaring at me in passing, whispering to our other roommates behind my back, etc. I had taken full responsibility for my dog\u2014he was quiet in his kennel when I was away, I took care of everything for him and never once asked my roommates to do my job for me, etc. She had not been asked or expected to have anything to do with him unless she wanted to. \n\nAfter this escalated for several weeks, I finally confronted her and asked what the deal was. Apparently she\u2019d lost a family dog years ago and still wasn\u2019t over it, and so she didn\u2019t like being around other dogs because they were a \u201cpainful reminder.\u201d\n\nWell why didn\u2019t you tell me this months ago before I got the dog?!

            "I've found very few people who are actually like this (I'm only 23 but I've lived in some very liberal cities around high school and college students)- I specifically mean being snappy and rude about a trigger on the first incident. Or at the very least they may have been snappy but I could tell they were being as polite as possible in the face of having severe mental illness. \n\nI always treat mental illness like a physical one: some things, like a big cut, are temporary (seasonal) or often easily managed with a physicians care and make it rather obvious that rubbing dirt into the wound is off the table without first trying it. Other ones are more like allergy-caused anaphylaxis: it's generally permanent or unruly even with a physician's advice, has no outside warning signs until it's harmful to the person, and odds are if they're entering a sushi joint they're probably going to tell you about it long before you order the shrimp tempura roll for the table. \n\nThere's room in both of these scenarios for either the person who's ill or the one who's not to be the asshole: there are those who scream at someone for getting water near their bandage and those who rub dirt in someone's cut after they've been told not to just because they like their reaction to pain; someone can berate you for failing to account for their previously-undiscussed allergy and you can keep selecting places to eat where they feel excluded due to a lack of safe options for them. \n\nThat all being said, I do not mean to counteract what I started this with by suggesting an equivalence here: the ill or injured are often very self aware of how their condition impacts their function in society and will often do their best to adapt themselves. The healthy and uninjured, however, often lack the empathy and understanding to accommodate the sick and lash out at those already injured for encroaching on the lives of normal people by merely existing \n\nWhile I think the specific concept of your opinion is reasonable, it's problematic that you seem to be dedicated to this narrow, unlikely segment of interactions like it's a common occurrence.",

            "I had a somewhat relevant experience related to this. I haven't gotten around talking to a professional so I don't know what's wrong with me, mentally. I know there is something wrong. I just don't know what it is exactly. So my friends are having fun, but something they said just caused a flood of bad memories to rush back in. I felt like I was about to break down in front of them. I had to withdraw myself from the party so I just talked to the host, said my goodbyes, and explained to him what's going on. He understands and just let me be. It's not fair for me to demand that they stop having fun when I'm around. Sure, there are ways to ask them to be wary of bringing up certain topics of conversation but at this point, I don't even know what they were. So, until I get my mental health in order, I'm going to keep my distance. If they're indeed my close friends, they'll understand.",

They would make fun of my body relentlessly throughout that entire time. Not only was I the nerdy kid, but I basically had the body of a 11 year old until I was 16 and went through a major growth spurt where I went from completely flat chested to 32DD in the span of a single summer. So, my gym experience went from being made fun of for having a child's body to being accused of \"getting implants\" and further ridiculed the rest of my school life. Because it was solely my word against that of 8 other girls, the administration did nothing to stop it, even though the rumors spread like wildfire throughout the entire school. It's worth mentioning that i was extremely embarrassed by how fast my breasts grew, so I wore extreme baggy shirts to try to hide them. However, those attempts to hide them were moot thanks to the locker room before gym.\n\nThe worst incident crossed the line into full blown sexual assault. Four of the more popular girls circled around me and violently poked and squeezed my breasts, to the point where it was incredibly painful and they hurt for several days. It was some weird test to see if they were real or implants.\n\nI was molested by a male adult as a 7 year old child and, to be completely honest, the abuse I suffered from my peers that i just described was every bit as traumatizing as that. In a way, it was even worse because there was no escaping it. At least when I told my parents about the abuse from the adult, it was dealt with and I never had to see him again. With the abuse from my peers, I had to suffer for years. \n\nSome of you might argue \"that was an especially shitty crop of girls, not every locker room experience is like that\". Yeah, but a) the administration didn't believe me because it was my word against everyone else's so I had to go through this shit for SIX FUCKING YEARS despite making literally 8 different complaints. b) quite frankly, it shouldn't take a seriously traumatic scenario to justify the idea that CHILDREN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STRIP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE UNNECESARRILY WHEN THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE. c) if you think locker rooms abuse is rare, you are living under a rock.\n\nHonestly, I gotta say- I genuinely don't see how anyone, besides pedophiles getting off on it, could stand by the idea that we should continue to systemically force children to strip in front of each other.\n\nEdit: oh lawdy thanks for all the awards!",

Another girl was lucky enough to have a mother who had made her a towel with a hole in the top for her head that went down to her feet. She could get changed underneath it. Looking back, it was creepy and horrible. Kids at 12 or 13 are extremely vulnerable, and in my opinion showers should be optional.

            "The statement is said as a response to the mentality \"teach women to not get raped.\" Society consistently blames women for being raped while absolving their rapists of responsibility, so \"don't teach women not to get raped, teach men not to rape\" is the response.",
            "It\u2019s a simplistic statement for a complex problem. At face value yes, it\u2019s weird to target men as if they have some inherent rape gene. They don\u2019t, that weird. But culturally? If you stop thinking in the lens of the western world and think globally PLENTY of cultures worldwide emphasize rape-y values to young men, including disregarding a woman\u2019s consent or autonomy to her own body. In the same vein they teach young women that they don\u2019t have a right to their own body, that it\u2019s their duty to accept men whether they feel comfortable with or not. So really we should be teaching men that consent cannot be taken and women that consent must be given. And probably vice versa  since men can be raped too. But that\u2019s not as catchy is it? Loll. Tl;dr I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect or right but this phrase exists bc of the cultural values young men are usually taught.\n\n\nEdit 1: thank you kind strangers for the silver and gold!!\n\nEdit 2: the number of people who think the west has no rape culture is disappointing. I used my country as context but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist in the west. It may be more covert in the west but it does exist. Examples include the Epstein case, the 2019 S\u00faper bowl sex sting, the 2016 Yale chant \u201cno means yes, yes means anal\u201d, Harvey Weinstein. That\u2019s just within the past 3 years,The list goes on. To those saying that women can also rape- this is true, but that doesn\u2019t negate the existence of bad cultural teachings directed towards men. The two can and do exist together. As I mention in the original comment,consent should be taught to both men and women. \n\nEdit 3: to those that are upset that I\u2019m not continuing the discussion/back and forth with them, so sorry but I do have things to do today, can\u2019t spend all day arguing with internet strangers.

            "Its often not about teaching boys that rape is bad, its about teaching what is rape and sexual harassment. What is consent and how to be sure what youre doing is right. The amount of times I have heard \"well, she didnt say no\" is way too high. Young men are impulsive and teaching about what is acceptable and what is not, is not too much to ask. Most rapes arent done at gunpoint in some bush on their way home, they are done by people who know the victim. Rape inside marriage was outlawed in 1991, 19 fucking 91 until that point rape was legal in U.S, if the two people were married, and you still hear from time to time \"well its womans duty to have sex if they are married\"\n\nBut yeah, its not about teaching men that \"rape is bad, mkay?\" fact is young people need to be teached about bodily autonomy, especially when they may not have been teached the intricacies of consent before.",
            "I think what you're saying is completely right and justified. \nBut I'll just explain the context I've heard that statement in.

Sure, if you make all men think they\u2019re potential rapists that\u2019s obviously very wrong, but many men (and women) are very misinformed about rape, and more education surrounding rape and sexual assault and why it\u2019s not ok is good. \n\nThe easiest solution is to teach ALL kids that rape is not okay, and overall how to behave surrounding sex. Many people don\u2019t think theres anything wrong with fucking a black out drunk person, or trying to persuade a person into having sex with them after they already said no multiple times. Many people also think that once you gave consent you cant change your mind, and that the person now \u201dowes\u201d you to have sex with them because its \u201dunfair\u201d to change your mind. \n\nIn conclusion, we need better sex education for all genders\n\nEdit: changed some parts",

Hell, tell men to fuck off with being the majority of violent criminals while you're at it. \n\nWe've taught boys that being overly dominant and \"tough\" is what makes you a man for centuries now. The only way we fix these societal problems is if we acknowledge them and teach the coming generations of boys to not be like this. \n\nOr we can let the raping and the beating and the domestic violence and the lack of respect for women continue as to not hurt the feelings of a few cowardly men who want to put their heads in the sand and blame the issues on women or feminism.

            "without context, sure this makes sense. But I\u2019ve only ever heard these sayings in response to the victim blaming statements that suggest that women NOT do certain things in order to prevent rape from happening. For example, \u201cdon\u2019t wear that, won\u2019t drink too much, don\u2019t go out late\u201d. This mentality supports the notion that if women don\u2019t do certain things, they won\u2019t be assaulted. Instead, this message aims to put the fault on the perpetrator, which data shows to be men, a majority of the time.",
            "The slogan \"teach boys not to rape\" is literally just a response to \"tell girls not to wear slutty clothing\" its not this whole anti-men slogan its literally a response to literal victim blaming. In school they force a dress code on women: boys can walk around without a shirt on while women can't even show shoulders. In countries like Pakistan women are forced to wear clothing that covers their whole body. All these ridiculous laws and rules and do women still get raped? Yeah. So the slogan \"teach boys not to rape\" began when people finally realized that its not what women wear.",
            "I would say it comes more out of the idea that girls are taught (from a very young age) about what they\u2019re doing wrong (like wearing something \u2018provocative\u2019 or walking home alone at night). While boys are taught similar things it\u2019s not as pushed as it is for girls. Normally when I see that statements it\u2019s \u2018stop teaching girls how to not get raped and start teaching boys not to rape\u2019. Totally agree that it should be gender inclusive all around but I do understand its starting point.",
            "Showing the biases of Reddit. Just based off the comments I\u2019ve read on here:\n\nAlways comparing rape to black men. You don\u2019t see any examples of Latinos, Asians, or Middle Eastern (except in the title). Simply just white vs black. And the premise of this argument is that black men are correlated with rape and theft. Always, without data to back it up. It\u2019s just the assumption. White is the \u201cstandard\u201d to compare everything to. What a casual form of racism. \n\nAs for saying that men should be taught to not rape women, I will note that disproportionately, men will rape women than women rape men. We have messages in our society around the perception of value about men when it comes to sex. If you\u2019re a virgin, you\u2019re a loser. If you\u2019re submissive, you\u2019re a loser. If she drinks, she wants to be flirty and let her guards down, aka be seduced by you. If she dresses a certain way, she\u2019s going to get what\u2019s coming for her. The problem with the arguments here, is ignoring this big elephant in the room.\n\nWe have a culture where men\u2019s value is based off of their ability to get sex. And this same culture promotes women\u2019s value decreasing whenever she has a new sexual partner. With this mismatch, there are going to be frustrated men. Some of them become incels and others decide to become rapists.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger",

Also while we are at it, with the notion that \"blacks steal\" it seems that expectation leads to \"blacks to go to jail\" , and we therefore accept that\" blacks will be raped, and that is ok\" which is all kinds of fucked up because in the cases where men are raped in prison regardless of color there is no health check to determine if an std has been transmitted.

Regardless if YOU realize it, shit was and is still difficult to teach people. Same with mental healthy awareness and a handful of social issues that people roll their eyes at and fight against because they were a)Taught to by broken people and b)Are in denial of how it touches their own lives.\n\n\"Teach boys not to rape\" is a certain approach to a larger conversation about consent that is relatively new and needs to continue. Everyone needs to understand respecting their own and other people's autonomy. I got told a bit in school to speak up about weirdos and uncomfortable settings as a child and surprise surprise, for a lot of 80s babies that shit didn't work. So parents and schools and media need to hydra up and reinforce that shit.\n\nI think human nature is to disrespect that autonomy because we're animals gaming each other over resources, but that's a different conversation.\n\nAlso the comparison to poor blacks and Muslim extremists implies that all three commit crimes by nature or nurture. You're argument is fucked either way - if it's nature, then there's no point in having a conversation to stifle it. If it's nurture, then something broken in society NEEDS to be addressed, and for boys raping that would be rape culture and misogyny.\n\n*Due notice for isolated tribes, classical Greece and Rome, etc",

Take if from someone who grew up in one such culture.\n\nIt's not the same as saying \"Teach blacks not to steal\" or \"Teach muslims not to bomb\" because only in extreme cases are they being told to go do those things. On the other hand, it's extremely common for men to teach each other that if you want to fuck a girl and she's not putting out, you should get her drunk. It's commonplace to be told \"If she says no, she's playing hard to get. Keep at it and you'll get yours\". \n\nThese are disgusting mentalities, but it's what we are often taught by our elders. \"Teach boys not to rape\" is not saying \"all men are rapists\" or \"only men are rapists\". It's saying to stop teaching children these things that they will refuse to learn as adults. No means no. Only yes means yes.\n\nHaven't you seen how men react to being told catcalling isn't nice? Do you think they feel bad about what they're doing and are trying to save face by saying they mean well? Of course not! They genuinely think catcalling is a compliment.

Instead of seeing sexual assault as a crime committed purposefully and with intent by another person, we treat it as a force of nature that people just have to be prepared for, like a hurricane or tornado. \n\nOn the other hand, we already treat robbery and assault as crime committed by a person.

            "i understand your frustration in this and i'd like to try my hand at explaining why...\n\nculturally, sex and sex crimes has been more of a gray area than other crimes. there have been laws on the books that allow a married man to rape his wife. we have jokes in our culture like \"no means yes and yes means anal.\" women are taught to be submissive and be pursued instead of taking a more active role in a relationship. thankfully, these things are changing and aren't widespread anymore (maybe i'm living in a bubble though idk).\n\nwith crimes of rape, we've historically had the judicial system shift blame to the victim, which doesn't normally happen to victims of theft or terrorism. there was a famous gang rape case in Italy where the judge stated that because the woman was wearing jeans, if the men were able to get them off then she must not have been struggling enough. that judge completely ignored the idea that some people shut down when they are attacked in such a way.\n\nso to say \"teach men not to rape\" in a positive way, it would be like \"teach men to ask for consent\" and imo it's just part of a broader shift in sexual education that focuses on consent and putting the onus of the crime on the criminal (or ideally a potential criminal who is taught the proper way to engage in sexual intercourse) instead of the victim",
            "Teaching boys not to rape is a response to people talking about female chastity. And even if this was being used based on statistical variance, teaching boys not to rape would be accurate and demanding of a statement than the other two. Teaching blacks not to steal can be pretty much deemed as racist since the primary value that decides if you are going to steal is your level of poverty. By percentages blacks are way less wealthy than whites, but poor blacks and poor white/other ethnic groups commit crimes at a similar rate, I imagine with maybe blacks having a higher rate of being detained or arrested due to the level of police involvement in poor black neighborhoods vs white. Teach muslims not to bomb also would be categorically the same. While muslim extremism and western hate does exist it is mainly overseas. Muslims in the US are generally not a group that show statistical significance in regards to crime or terrorism, especially not from 2008 to 2016. The knowledge of crime rates in general in the US from the public generally doesn't reflect the data. People get a notion crime has increased, while it continues to hit lows. Muslim crime and terrorism are not extremely pertinent and we have a higher rate of terrorism linked to right wing extremism than religious affiliations. Now you can make the point that there is not an intrinsic value to men, similar to black etc, that leads them to rape. I would, for the most part, agree. Men, while being generally stronger than women, do not have a biological imperative to rape. The relevance of rape is probably more societal, due to a general disregard of women as equals and seen more as sexual objects, our culture has lead us to take women as a lesser authority and more as subservient to men. We have come a long way and do not find this to be true, but it doesn't prevent this form of toxic masculinity from perverting our shift into a better culture. We want to teach women and girls that they can be more than what men want them to be/do their jobs, and teach men to respect a womans right and agency in these positions the same way they'd act towards another man.",

Some studies have shown ([here's one](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/vio.2014.0022)) that men will admit to having raped someone if it isn't called rape, so we probably need to do a better job of educating men about consent.  I'm saying men here because something like 99.9% of rapes are committed by men, although of course men are sometimes the targets of rape too, let's not forget.",

            "I agree with this, because I think in this specific context (in America; I can't speak for other places) we are falling short in educating kids and teenagers about the most important topic in sex education: *Consent.*\n\nIn many places sex education is a fucking joke (pun intended) and simply preaches abstinence or talks about STIs. I was in high school in the 90s, and they never said a damn thing about consent. Kids need to be educated from an early age about what consent means, when it can and cannot be given (such as age difference for teens, someone being under the influence of alcohol or anything else that affects their judgement, etc), the key point that consent can be *withdrawn* at any time, marriage does not equal consent, the list goes on. \n\nI have friends with children who educated them on consent from an early age and I've been able to watch them do so. It's simple and easy to instill this concept in a child, regardless of gender. If all parents made an effort to do so, I think it would make a massive difference.",
            "No, because men are massively more likely to be the perpetrators of sexual violence than women. I've been having a difficult time finding the exact number, but it looks like 90% of all sexual violence is committed by men.\n\nIt's simply more effective to target the 90% than the 10%.",

I\u2019ve done orientations on two separate campuses, and this has never happened.\n\nThe \u2018teach boys not to rape\u2019 is often said in response to those who blame women for getting raped, with statements such as \u2018teach girls to dress right\u2019. \n\nYou\u2019re arguing against a strawman",
            "This a unique situation.\nFor one, you're trying to equate an entire gender, half the world, to a race and stereo types. \n\nThe biggest issue with your complaint is that boys who rape have other men defend them by trying to blame the victim. Eg: What was she wearing? She shouldn't have been alone, etc. \n\nI'm not saying men don't get raped, but the issue is that when men rape they have those victim blaming excuses. This isn't about all men are bad, it's about the bad men refusing to acknowledge that they where 100% to blame for what happened. Thus, teach men not to rape and don't teach women that they shouldn't dress how they want or walk where they want. Rape isn't a consequence, it's a crime.",

            "Consent is what they mean. This is a little pedantic.",
            "I don't think those examples you gave are the same. Here's why:\nThe disproportionate amount of rape against women is hugely influenced via cultural reasons. Some examples:\nThe expectatuon a woman should say no first to seem respectable, even though she really \"wants it\". The concept some men have of women as \"conquests\"...sex not being something they do together but instead something the man wins (and when it's done via lies and trickery as portrayed in shows and movies, we laugh along). These are specifically gendered culture norms and therefore need a gendered solution. It isn't about vilifying men, it's about making them allies for women and role models for other men. \n\nThere isn't any cultural element (at least not in American culture) that dictate it makes you more of a man when you bomb or steal. It's widely condemned. Rape is also condemned, when it's called rape, but consensual sex and rape is blurred largely due to cultural elements I gave above.\n\nAll that said, I agree we should teach both girls and boys what consent means and how to obtain it. And identify cultural elements that cause women to rape men (like the idea that men must want it cuz they're men) and debunk them.",

Yet having a hard-on (in your sleep or before you wake) is an involuntary bodily function. I woke up to her mounting herself with her sliding me inside her (she was on top). I immediately told her to get off and she refused. I proceeded to push her off of me and she pressed down, got close to my face, looked me dead in the eyes, and told me if I didn't stop fighting her she would accuse me of raping her.\n\nI cannot express the amount of fear that washed over me with that single statement. I'm no fool. I know damn well that socially and legally we live in a woman's world -- It should be a human's one, regardless of gender or sexuality, but if we're all honest with ourselves, it's not. -- Women today are to be socially and even legally believed by default. To even argue to the contrary seems like \"blasphemy\".\n\nYou're the man which means you **MUST** be wrong, you **MUST** be mistaken, and you **MUST** be the bad guy in nearly every story.\n\nIf it came down to a 'he said', 'she said' argument over who raped who, I do not doubt for a second, I would be unrealistically hard-pressed to prove it was her and not me.  And if there is any doubt by my meaning, I am saying, I firmly believe it would have been impossible to obtain justice.\n\nFor this reason, my wife had her way and raped me this way for **YEARS**.  It continued until she finally found someone else she (officially) wanted to be with.",

            "Reading these comments is heartbreaking, and yes there should be a  change into the ''teach kids'' but i also get the ''boys'' since males are often brought up to believe they can dominate women and typical mysoginistic behaviours. There is still so much to change in the way the majority raises childred. But that said, the problem definitely does not lie just in the male gender.",

            "I see what you mean about rape not being gender specific because it happens to men and women of all ages. But what you're talking about is kind of just a direct response to how often schools try to enforce policies of policing what women and girls can do so that the men and boys are not \"tempted\" which in and of itself is fucked up to everyone involved. It assumes women need to be coddled or shielded, and assumes men have no self-control the second they see a millimeter of exposed skin on a woman. Women aren't helpless and men aren't feral rapist cavemen. \n\nA lot of places try to emphasize consent through seminars and other things but they are so cringe worthy most of the time its in one ear out the other. The whole \"consent is sexy\" sayings like \"Do you consent to me kissing you sensually\" Its so unrealistic most of the time its almost counterproductive because you hear people just joking because they're not taking it seriously.

We shouldn't teach Muslims not to bomb, but we should teach Palestinians not to bomb. This is because the problems are way more widespread in those areas. \nWe should focus more on teaching boys not to rape because:\na) the effects of a girl being raped are worse. Girls can get pregnant. Not saying effects aren't bad for guys just not as bad\n\nb)it is far more common for a girl to be raped by a guy then the other way around. Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's more common.\n\nc) boys naturally tend to be stronger and larger then girls. Probably quite difficult for a 100 pound girl to resist a 160 pound man.",

            "Fact: yes, women are capable of rape, but statistically, men are far, far more likely to commit rape than women.  Even male victims of rape are more likely to have been raped by other men.  Teaching boys not to rape is simply a recognition of this fact, not, as it seems you believe, an attack on men.  \n\nAnnecdotally, I don't know any men who've been raped by women.  It's one of those things I only ever seem to read about.  I do know, however, many women, and a few men, who were sexually assaulted by men.\n\nAnd just so you know, your unwarranted use of 'blacks' and muslims to make a point about rape contributes to the negative stereotypes those groups have to live with every day and is itself a form of racism.",

Person 2 (the target of the statement) will take the bait and respond, often in a defensive manner as they feel attacked (***they were***, that was the point of the initial statement).\n\nI don't want to speak for you, but I'm guessing the wording didn't match your intent?  Stating something that challenges another's views is not an attack on that person, but a challenge to their views.  That is the basis of debate and general discourse which is necessary to move forward.  There is a way to do this civilly and not be an asshole, but even still an attack on an idea or belief is not an attack on a person.  A person may take it personally, for sure.\n\nIf you mean making a personal attack as a means to attack their views, that's different.  There is a difference between \"Blue is a superior color to purple\" and \"people who like purple are stupid\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is already longer than I wanted, but I do feel it is important to make the distinction.  If we were to say you cannot challenge another's strongly held view without it being a personal attack, then there is no point in any protest, debate, or working for change.",

If you call a white person racist for saying blue lives matter because of rising attacks on policr officers and  all lives matter more attacks on white people by poc. They give some statistics and a more logic argument why what you've said might be wrong.\n\n2. A dark humor joke betwee buddies and someone else butts in, and that nosie posie calls them a bigot.

I'm not some boomer trying to rag on the new generation because I have nothing better to do.\n\nEverything is so unnecessarily sexualised these days. Adverts for the most banal products, music, random sex scenes in movies that could have been marketed to younger audiences without them, you name it: there's a naked girl or a weird moaning noise or an obvious innuendo. It's kind of sickening.\n\nA lot of people argue that \"it's not over-sexualisation, it's sexual liberation!\" That this phenomenon is taking motion because people (mostly women, whose ability to do it has been hampered for centuries) are feeling more comfortable in their bodies and with expressing their sexuality. And that's great! \n\nBut we don't need it everywhere. Every second tweet coming across my timeline is someone oversharing on their sexual experiences for clout and every song and music video is geared towards some sort of sexual stimulation/release. Everything is just constantly screaming sex, sex, sex.\n\nNow, here's where my concern comes in: if the Internet was made up solely of people who had a sharp grasp on reality and on themselves, this onslaught of sexual content wouldn't be nearly as worrying as it is. But that's not the case. Younger, much more impressionable kids are using the Internet nowadays, and it's bleeding into the content I see from them.\n\nTake the biggest culprit as example: TikTok. What may seem to many of us as completely harmless because the constant wave of hypersexualised content has practically immunised us to its effects would terrify any mother, and I couldn't say I would blame it. Kids doing sexual POVs, inappropriate dances, and dressing the way that they do is all a cause of the fact that they see older people doing it, normalising it, and running with it. There have been countless times that I have seen videos of boys standing shirtless in their rooms lipsynching to sexual lyrics and girls dancing incredibly explicitly and then I click on their page and see that they're 13, 14, 15, or 16.\n\nThat is horrifying to me. It's basically a new wave of paedophile fodder, and it's the fault of society's hypersexualisation.\n\nI'm not here to pearl clutch and say that sexual expression should not be allowed or something. Of course not; everybody should be able to do exactly what they want to do. But we have to be extremely conscious of the people that are seeing our content, however fleetingly, and censor ourselves for their safety. I'm also not here to say that wearing certain clothes somehow constitutes immediate sexual intentions from other people: but you have to admit that nonces are more likely to go for children they see as \"easy\" and therefore vulnerable. That's why I'm so fucking scared for them.\n\nAnyway, this is just an opinion. Looking forward to the \"society has always been sexual\" comments.",

            "So, I grew up in Brooklyn and went to public schools. Had friends all having sex and one even got an abortion. Had a classmate who even got pregnant at 11. \nI was peer pressured from the age of 12 to be sexually active since my friends were but I chose not to. Had boys pick on me because I didn\u2019t try to \u201chook up\u201d with them like how my friends did. They tried to manipulate me but I had a close relationship with my mom and told her everything. She kept me on the right track and from succumbing to any of their bullshit. Told me her mistakes so that I could learn from them. She made many and desperately wanted to steer me in the right direction. She did. \n\nI made my own decisions. My parents gave me the proper conversations and bought me those books like \u201cwhere do babies come from\u201d and stuff like that. I was also exposed to sex at a young age because a few of my cousins were sexually assaulted by a family friend. Had to learn what that was and entailed at a really young age.\n\nPoint is- I had the knowledge of what sex was and what it entailed at a young age. My parents didn\u2019t sugar coat anything. I chose to not be sexually active in middle school/high school and waited until my early 20s. I don\u2019t regret a thing.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to keep kids from behaving this way. I think communication and honesty is the only method. It also keeps them safe.",
            "I agree with this, hardcore. I\u2019m 17 as well and it is definitely a real problem. The other day I was scrolling on Tik Tok and saw an example of a girl talking about her \u201cfavourite sex positions\u201d. She was 14 (her acc. was taken down). There\u2019s also been cases at my school where people have been forced into shit like this. Someone who I thought was a nice, innocent person there had her nudes shared amongst a vast majority of the people at my school which supposedly drove her crazy. This happened when everyone was 14-15 (heard this from someone else as I came to the school after it happened so can\u2019t say it\u2019s 100% valid but you get the point). It\u2019s a serious issue that NEEDS to be addressed because this is a horrible picture that society is unknowingly painting for younger generations.",
            "I agree with this opinion, but what I find most interesting is that despite sex being everywhere and accessible to everyone with the internet, teenagers are having less sex. Studies have shown that between the 1980's and today, the number of teenagers who reported having sex before age 18 has declined by 20%. Teenage birth rates are also at historic lows. More are practicing safe sex and using birth control products. One thing our hypersexualized culture has not done is make people have more sex. I wonder if expressing our sexuality on social media or gaming or media sort of fills in part of that basic human need, leading to less actual sexual experiences with other people.\n\nI would also like to state another unpopular opinion: You choose what media and culture you consume. Nobody is making you watch TikTok video's or look at Twitter. You are making the choice to use platforms that you know are feeding you junk. If you don't want to see the sexualized culture we have, then don't. You can filter the TV, movies, books, internet, etc. to avoid any of it. And it's up to every parent to regulate content for their own children.",
            "While I tend to agree, you need to listen to the popular songs from the 90s, 80s, 70s, and even the 60s. They're full of sex or about getting with someone momentarily, so while I think sex being a focal point of music has been around for over 50 years, music is more explicit now. I moreso think the explicitness of music now is due to shock factor sells and the fact artists can't write as poetically as they used to be able to.",
            "It's 100% the parents fault. I know an elementary school teacher who says the grade 6 and 7 girls are wearing thongs. Who the fuck lets their preteen wear a thong? And then the parents get all pissed off when older boys approach when they take their daughters out in public while they are dressed like prostitutes. \n\nAnd please don't give me the bullshit line \"you're blaming the victim\". Children should not be dressed up like strippers and prostitutes.",
            "I'm middle aged, and it has gotten the volume turned up a lot.  Before the internet, it was harder for kids to find explicit content, and most of them didn't have anyone except close friends & family to share photos or video of themselves with.  It was all more difficult, and there were higher barriers to entry.  Plus the AIDS scare kept a lot of people from getting too wild.\n\nI agree that explicit content is everywhere in a more overt way than it once was.  Parents let their kids watch Deadpool, porn is practically mainstream (it used to almost never be talked about in general conversation, only between friends when others weren't around)... and like you say, due to lack of parental oversight, children are putting inappropriate stuff on the internet without fully understanding what the consequences could be.\n\nOne of the things that worries me is how these videos can be saved by kids' peers or enemies, and later used against them.  And there are many more concerning aspects.  I for one am glad I didn't grow up in this kind of environment, where stupid things I did could end up being spread around the web and come back to bite me.",
            "I don\u2019t get how America is somehow so prudent but also hyper sexualized at the same time. \n\nIt\u2019s like we resist it and get all Puritan/Quaker about it and then people over compensate. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda similar to teenage drinking in the US vs Europe. They can drink 16-18 legally and their binge drinking problems are much less then the US where the legal age is 21.",

Families used to all live in one room, often sharing beds with a ton of people. You think they weren\u2019t having sex? Kids were even more exposed than they are today.\n\nTeen pregnancy is an \u201cissue\u201d in today\u2019s society, but more of a standard throughout history. \n\nSex drive is literally baked into our DNA. \n\nIs sex used heavily to sell products and media? Sure. But that\u2019s more of a commentary on commercialism than sexuality.\n\nThe reason people feel compared to religious zealots when they come off as prude is because it\u2019s a mindset that came from religious zealots. Even prudish behavior is an extension of secualization. Cultures that condemn women for showing too much ankle are just over compensating for the sexuality inherent to human nature.",

Want to watch a man get his brains bashed out with a baseball bat, or ISIS decapitating someone on live tv. On all the basic cable packages. At least sex and the human body are natural processes.

Teachers are human and they make mistakes, they have bad days.

            "If your so worried about the impact and influence teachers will have on your kids, find a school that shares your beliefs and values. I put all my kids through Church run elementary school because I wanted my kids around people who shared my beliefs and values and had an excellent and well regarded curriculum. By 7-9 grade, their foundation is strong enough to withstand most peer pressure. I spent years volunteering in the church nursery 3x a week for a tuition reduction. \n\nThat said, parents are integral builders of their children\u2019s foundation and futures. Abdicating your responsibilities to teachers then blaming teachers when your kids turn into little shits that struggle academically is blameshifting. \n\nUltimately, your kids are your responsibility and no one else\u2019s. If you\u2019re not going to advocate for your child, it\u2019s all on you.  If you\u2019re not going to hold your child accountable, it\u2019s all on you. If you\u2019re going to send conflicting messages (than their teachers) without an ongoing open dialogue with the teacher, it\u2019s all on you. \n\nTo compare bad teachers to drug dealers is simplistic and silly. For example, I dislike math\u2014calculus to be specific; however, my math professor was kind, caring, and patient. Alternatively, my piano teacher was pure meanness, Satan in an outdated skirt. There was a groove on the school piano from her beating the tempo with a ruler. I still took lessons from her for several years, and still play (still don\u2019t like her).  Yes, this is anecdotal, but in my experience the label \u201cbad\u201d is more subjective than objective. More often than not, there were underlying issues, that once resolved, helped your child have a better student-teacher relationship, a better understanding of expectations, and helped build trust between your children, their teachers, and yourself. \n\nObviously, there are bad teachers. Burned out for various reasons. Overworked. Underpaid. Lack of adequate resources. Too many students. Struggling on an emotional or physical level. And, yes there are a few teachers that should not be teachers for whatever reason. Instead of lumping them all together and writing them off as bad, explore your options to get your child the best education possible then pursue them. \n\nWe are in the midst of a teacher shortage, COVID, inadequate funding for schools, classrooms. Instead of pushing fault off on these teachers, \nwhy not step up, \nadvocate for your kid, \nadvocate for your teacher, \nadvocate for your school, \nwork with your kid\u2019s teachers to ensure success, communicate with your children, \nsit down with your kids when they do homework,\nexplain to your kids that it\u2019s ok not to like a subject but that they should still try their best,\nand explain to your kids that even though they may personally not like their teacher, learning is important. \n\nDropping the kids off at school is not like dropping your car off for an oil change, where you pay a mechanic to do all the work. Schooling your children is a joint effort with its ups and downs.",

I don\u2019t remember him being too strict except for a few times calling me out for petty things like putting my face in my hands when I was bored or drumming my eraser on my desk because I was again bored. Other than that I remember very little from that class but a lot from every other grade. It honestly felt like a year of summer school. 5th was amazing. Maybe it\u2019s because he was a male. Idk.

            "I don't really get affected when it comes to loving or hating a certain subject. If the teacher is a good one, cool! I'd definitely love the subject even more. However, if the teacher is a dick, I'd hate THEM and not the subject. This is a real example I'm experiencing at the moment. Last year, I had a biology teacher who used to work as an OB/GYN. I love biology and it's literally my life, but that teacher was such a spoiled dick. He'd throw a tantrum every time he ran out of markers he uses for the white board or when he's unable to use the projector. Then he throws the books at the students. Next, he yells at the headmaster and calls the entire school a \"piece of shit.\" Lastly, he kicks out students and verbally bullies everyone. He was so self-centered and wasn't even sorry about it, and what's worse is that when he assigns us with any homework, he doesn't bother to look properly at our books and see who actually done it and who didn't. Lastly, when COVID-19 starts, he goes MIA for over 5 weeks. No lessons, no homework, no tests, no NOTHING. Meanwhile the other classes are working hard and progressing well. It was tough, I gotta admit. Now you you think I hate biology, right? Wrong. I still like it and I liked it even back then. Since it was an online school, it was easy for me to attend classes with a different teacher. That was after I had tried hard to study the lessons that were neglected by our ass teacher and nothing worked.\n\nThe second teacher was really sweet and awesome! He's quite positive and makes the lesson funny with his amazing sense of humor, uses stories as a method of entertainment so that we don't get bored and works really hard that he'd dedicate so much of his time to help us. Istg we once had a six-hour online class with him where he told us he'd explain ANYTHING we wanted. You might be thinking that they were boring, but you're wrong. If I have to say, those were one of the best hours I've spent in my life doing something useful without hating it. Also, he doesn't mind explaining something over and over and over AND OVER again if you still don't get it. We literally spent an hour and a half where he kept explaining ONE question because many people couldn't understand it. And he's not just good academically; he doesn't treat us like kids but rather like his friends that he actually hung out with some of us a few times before. And when someone's feeling down he always manages to put a smile on that person's face. And he's very strict too. Not the type of asshole strictness. Nope. He'd assign us with so much homework and scolds whoever leaves it undone. Then he'd say, \"I know you guys hate me right now but trust me, all this effort will pay off. Hate me now, love your grades later.\"\nHe's more like an older brother than a teacher tbh. He's just 10 years older than me anyways. That's too little for a highschool *teacher.*\n\nLuckily for me, I have the same teacher this year and we attended our first real life class with him last week. It was sooooo epic that I can't wait to see him again! Obviously, I love biology even more than before now. \n\nIt's all about you. You're the one who gets to choose which route to follow. I had an opportunity to start hating biology but I didn't because I chose not to think using the asshole's ways. I chose the better person. Although I agree with you that teachers can turn a student's life into hell, you can't let them influence your decisions in life no matter what. It's YOUR choice. YOUR life.

            "I overheard this conversation between two good teachers last year at a Starbucks:  \"...(they) agree there are a significant number of teachers who just don't care, or resent that some students excel\" and though I had to read between the lines, I didn't interject to ask for an elaboration but days later it woke me up to the many memories of the teachers who truly were abysmal.  So let me leave you with a tidbit gleaned from Gatto:  it was for a time common in perhaps the 1800s in the US that the most derelict of a community would get stuck teaching children.  Now this surprised me when I read it, so look Gatto up, it gets even more fascinating!",
            "2nd Grade: We had been cleaning paper clippings around/on/under our desks. I had finished cleaning my area and sat down, waiting quietly. My teacher pulled me out of my chair by my shirt and shoved me on to the floor. Then she yelled, \"clean it up!\" before storming off.\n\n3rd Grade: Was copying down homework on the board in front of me. There was another board behind where I sat, which had a couple more things I needed to write down. I was writing as fast as I could. Teacher kept coming over to get me to hurry up, getting more impatient each time. I had just finished the one board and was about to turn around.\n\nBefore I could, teacher came up behind me and put her hands on either side of my face. She used her hands to force me to whip my head around and screamed \"look at the board\" in my ear. I was terrified she would break my neck.\n\nThese were 2 different teachers. I had 2 more terrible teachers after this. They went with a more psychological approach and seemed to enjoy humiliating me infront of my whole class.\n\nThe worst part was that the other teachers/principle knew what these people were doing and did nothing. I have seen it so many times where teachers form this \"us against them\" club against children. I understand you guys don't have any real power and can easily loose your jobs for \"interfering\" in a situation like that. But there was no comfort, no nothing. \n\nIf anything, the other teachers seemed to completely side with my abuser and treated me like I was a liar. Treated me like I was making all this up on purpose like I was an evil/bad kid. I was always quiet and well behaved. I was so excited to learn and they poisoned it. It took me almost 20 years to undo the damage they had caused.\n\nSo if you're a teacher, who knows another teacher is shitty and you aren't doing anything to help, you're an abuser too. If it's a situation where your hands are tied, at least make an effort to comfort the kid and explain to them why you can't help. It's better than thinking everyone wants to hurt you/no one cares.",

            "Everyone is using this thread to talk about the crappy teachers they\u2019ve had. While I\u2019ve had them too, I\u2019d like to focus on OP\u2019s unpopular opinion... and its obvious flaws.\n\nThe crux of your theory seems to be that \u201cdrug dealers sell to a very small percentage of the population, whereas teachers are going to impact much [sic] more people\u201d. \n\nThat is false. Let\u2019s take my high school of 500. We had two Algebra teachers. Mr. Gibbs was awesome. Mr. Card sucked. I had Mr. Card. So did ~62 other kids in my class. 62 people a year were exposed to a shitty teacher. By the time I graduated 3 years later, I had had two good math teachers (Geometry, Calculus) who got me right back on point. Because our Geometry teacher was good, he realized that our algebra skills were sketchy, and helped us with them as we went along. That\u2019s what good teachers do... fill in the blanks of others. My friends and I who had Mr. Card did fine, went off to great colleges, etc.\n\nNow, that drug dealer. Do you think he does not sell to ~62 people? The few drug dealers I\u2019ve known are successful drug dealers because they sell to a LOT of people. If they\u2019re selling weed, they\u2019re doing very little harm. It\u2019s a drug with no addictive properties. But if they sell meth, heroin, coke, etc., then yes - they are doing damage. LASTING damage. I know people who lost their lives to drug overdoses. Do bad teachers kill their students? \n\nBut let\u2019s say the drug addict doesn\u2019t die. He is just a meth addict for 2-3 years. Have you seen what that does to someone? Have you seen what that does to people\u2019s welfare, to their family, to their relationships, and to their criminal record? \n\nPeople who have serious drug addictions have serious life problems: debt, bankruptcy, criminal records, long-term health effects, etc. The families of drug addicts often lose money, savings, possessions, and their relationship with that person. That\u2019s why there\u2019s an entire support group for families of addicts.\n\nWe\u2019ve all had bad teachers. They don\u2019t destroy families and lives.",

That said, it depends on how bad the teacher was/how long they had to do damage, and how integrated an addict would be in their life.

Like I said, I struggled learning the material and it wouldn\u2019t help that he would call me out in class and belittle my intelligence. \n\nThis was a chemistry lab so we didn\u2019t have traditional desks, we had tables that sat 4 people and a sturdy writing surface is essential for copying down multiple white board loads of information. \n\nWell this man was angered that I wasn\u2019t doing well in his class and actually embarrassed me in front of the class revealing that I hadn\u2019t passed one of the \u201cace\u201d exams, whatever I didn\u2019t care but how are you going to have the audacity to embarrass me and insult my intelligence when he WOULDNT ALLOW ME TO SIT AT A TABLE. \n\nYes that\u2019s correct, even if there were open seats available, I had to take a chair, sit in the corner and take notes on my lap hunched over to the extreme. This made me hate him, chemistry, and just school in general. \n\nI started ditching his class because it was the end of the day anyways and I would just go to the gym and wait for football practice to start. And eventually I got kicked off of the football team because my grades started slipping because of my truancy. \n\nSo because I got kicked off of the team, I just didn\u2019t even feel a need to keep my grades up.

I almost failed.\n\n4: My teacher in Elementary School said that there is a student in class who will report everything to her if someone isn't behaving. Everyone tought I was this person because I was too shy and I didn't had friends. From that point everyone avoided or bullied me expect 2 boys I had a good realitionship with. \n\nI had many teachers who acted like bitches because they could. I had many teachers he made me hate subjects, myself, my feelings and made me mistreated by others. And I had many great teachers I love to this day, they made me keep going when nobody was there for me.\n\nTeachers can be your worst nightmares, or your best friends who gives you the best advice.",

My older brother was the school's poster it: state varsity athlete with a 4.0 GPA and 2000 community service hours. He even got a plaque on the wall of fame, I think. The VP and principal loved him. \n\nI get in at 7th grade and the VP immediately tries to buddy up. My town is small so the families all know of each other and each has influence on the town. One runs the local gas stations, the other may be the local dentist, another is an attorney, lots of powerful people. My dad is one of the best welders in the country and was highly sought after (He disassembled a nuke once!), while my mom helped run a local dog grooming business. The VP was into the politics (She wanted to be mayor eventually) and wanted to get good with my family, since we were new in the area and still had my younger brother yet to enter highschool.\n\nSafe to say, I wasn't my older brother. I rebuked her and told her to buzz off once I learned she denied a friend of mine with autism a proof of enrollment form to go get a learner's permit. She made my life hell since. In total I served 148 days of in-school suspension, 422 detentions, and three weeks suspension. She would hound me down for the slightest infraction. From then on I hated school and loathed going, almost making me drop out. Things turned around when a scandal came out about her mistreatment of handicapped students and her changing the grades of her daughter, but it was awful. Bad teachers can ruin a class, but an evil VP can ruin  your love for academics entirely.",

            "I hate these 'DAE likes good teachers and doesn't like bad teachers???', it always feels like OP is in middle school and got his first shitty grade. \n\nNo one *wants* to be a bad teacher. You know what makes a bad teacher? Kids. And general feeling of your worthlessness to society. No one gives a flying fuck about the teachers wellbeing: not the government, not the parents, not the school, and especially not the children. \n\nImagine a typical teacher's work week: you get to repeat the same shit over and over and over again to 10 different classes, because you're the only chemistry teacher in school. You get to contact with kids, 90% of whom *don't want* to learn, and it's not your fault or even the kids' fault, it's just how teenagers are most of the time, they don't want it and don't need it. You get shitty pay, working extra hours, no respect from the children or their parents for the things you do, but hey, some idiot on the internet thinks that you still have to love your job no matter what. \n\nA teacher's job is not creative or really diverse, most of the time it's a conveyor belt \u2014 same lesson, same classes, same homework. Every day, every week, every year. Now imagine doing the same stuff over and over again *forever* and still being cheerful and motivational. \n\nIt's just not happening. Some people are really like that, but you can't expect someone to be working a shitty, low-paying job with no respect given from the children you want to make better and still be grateful about it. Some say 'well don't be a teacher then', but people don't know this until they become one. And also, what if they *really want* to teach? It's just that society tries to stomp them into the ground on each step of the way, every day. \n\nSo before you judge a teacher, OP, grow up and look around to see the surrounding which makes them 'bad'. Why would anyone even become a teacher if they didn't want to? It's not easy, and it's time consuming, so again, no one wants to be a 'bad' teacher, it's just that it drains the fucking life force out of you and you rarely see any feedback. It's an abusive relationship which a lot of time breaks people, unfortunately.",

I have plenty of students who hate math because of a teacher in grade school, so they never want to even try to do well. It kills me to see that happen, or to even have to work in the same building as other teachers who probably shouldn\u2019t have gone into this line of work. \n\nI wanted to teach middle school because that\u2019s really the last chance you have to change a student\u2019s mind on how they feel about a certain subject. Once they get to high school, you can very rarely change their opinion of a subject area. \n\nI\u2019ve only been teaching for a couple years, but I have seen a difference in a few. The students that I see transform from wanting absolutely nothing to do with my class to actually trying and asking for help when they need it is what keeps me going.",

Now I'm not going to say that every drug addict is innocent and undeserving, but one hot shot of fentaynl will kill someone on sight. Of course most drug dealers aren't stupid enough to just kill their customers outright, but negligence can lead to a tainted supply that can leave multiple people dead in a single night off the same batch. \n\n\nSo yeah, bad teachers are bad, and not all drug dealers are responsible. But I mean come on, thousands of people died last year because they OD'd on a drug they didn't know they were taking. Sure some of this is on the user but drug dealers have people by the balls, they can sell an addict anything for the right price. Sometimes they unknowingly sell death. \n\n\n(Disclaimer I think there are lots of responsible drug dealers out there who care for their customers and those people actually do just as much good for society as a good teacher)",

And since they can give up a lot of money while still being able to afford whatever they want for the rest of their lives, I see no reason why they shouldn\u2019t either donate it or be taxed to the point they aren\u2019t quite billionaires.\n\nYeah you can say they earned it and it\u2019s their money but I think fighting poverty and funding public works are more important than letting the dragon\u2019s hoard be as high as the dragon wants.\n\nAnd this doesn\u2019t even get into the billionaires like Jeff Bezos who treat their employees like crap and are generally super cut throat and shady in the pursuit of even more money that they have no use for.",

If you cured cancer you should never have to worry about money, ever again, and you should be able to live a VERY comfortable and luxurious life. You should not, however, have more money than you could ever spend. There\u2019s just no way to EARN that much money, and nobody has that much value.

For one thing, NCAA scholarships do not take money away from academic scholar initiatives, and are a great avenue for bright, low income students who are also athletically gifted to afford their tuition.  \nIn addition, sport is important and difficult, far more important than this person makes out.  Sport has been at the heart of the human experience forever, and is a great way to better yourself and build a community.  Not everyone on a college sport team is going to the NFL, most aren\u2019t in fact, but they do it because they love the game and community.  They dedicate 20, 30 hours a week of brutal labor on top of their studies because they care.\nMethinks this guy has been watching too many 90\u2019s movies where the athletes are stupid, irredeemable assholes who don\u2019t do anything but throw duh football.

I had a terrible time for various reasons, but also it was exhausting to have 2 hour practices 6 days a week on top of everything else. And usually you need to maintain a certain grade average to stay on the team. \n\nPersonally, I do think that coaches did more to look for opportunities and scholarships for their students than regular teachers did for gifted students in their class. Our school always pumped up games and encouraged students to go and even sponsored trips sometimes, but almost never advertised the scholastic teams we had, even when they won. \n\nI also felt like the athletes got more passes for certain things, like getting their deadlines pushed a lot, having teachers offer them more help, even the nurses apparently let them take naps when they were feeling stressed. \n\nAnd I'm not saying they don't deserve the help, i just feel like everyone does, but a lot of students didn't get the same consideration. We had band/orchestra kids, choir kids, tech kids, theatre kids, etc. that definitely didn't get the same help even though they spent just as much time perfecting their craft as athletes.

I also wouldn't mind seeing a cap imposed on the total number of scholarships for sports and total spending, as well as salary caps for coaches and the like. Maybe even tie the number of academic scholarships to the revenue generated by the sports teams. The Texas A&M Longhorns had over over $90 million in profits last year. How about 25% of football profits are designated for academic scholarships? In state tuition is about $25k, so $25M would cover tuition for 1000 students. But the university would rather see the government back loans for everyone so they can continue to jack up the price at more than 3X the rate of inflation to continue to redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the liberal college strongholds. Force the middle class into poverty with college loans, indoctrinate them with liberal ideology while attending college, and ten you get a generation of young people who think the only way to fix their lives is with socialism while never realizing that the university that taught them this is directly responsible for their financial hardship. Has anyone asked why a college needs $25k a year on the low low end to educate someone? They know they can charge whatever they want and desperate kids will take out loans that can never be discharged to pay for it because otherwise they will live in even more dire financial straits than being saddled with over $100k in debt at age 23.",

These people might also go to Junior colleges to get their grades up before going to a D1 school and get their life on track\nThese people will a lot of times go to their homestate powerhouse team or colleges that are more known for football then academics so that specific school caters classes to them\n\n3:Your really good football player that is decent In academics, these people come from all over and they will be amazing at football and they arent horrible at school, they will typically go to schools In the Big 10 and have good college careers and if not they get a degree from a really nice university\n\n4:Your average football player with average smarts, they will go to a mismatch of teams across the country, no big powerhouses in academics or athletics, If they are a star at these colleges they will be drafted but if not they will still get the degree and they might've gone to these schools without football this is by far the majority \n\nAnd all of these people are all playing for free on national television and scholarships are their only form of legal payment, all of these people are improving their life through skills they have worked extremely hard for and they are finally reaping the benefits, think of football as a major in college because for a lot of people it is, it isnt taking away money from anyone they are earning their scholarship by earning money for the school like a sanctioned yearly fundraiser",

It doesn't include all the extra out of state students that come to the university because of the football program (Alabama used to be over 80% in state students, now about 60% come from out of state) which means they pay more in tuition and they have to pay room and board either to the university for a dorm or to someone locally. They also need a job, which stimulates the local economy. Then you have to factor in booster donations. They don't count as football revenue, but most of the time the donation amounts are tied to success on the field. Your team wins championships, the boosters donate millions. Your team underperforms, the boosters close their checkbooks until things improve. Season tickets are also based on yearly donation levels. If you don't want to wait 7 years and get nosebleeds, you need to donate $10k/yr+ to the university (at OSU or Alabama, not sure how it works for other schools). You aren't donating that money if the team is bad. I have never threatened to withhold donations because of the academics, I have written to the athletic director threatening to pull donations if the football program doesn't improve. As soon as academic students that aren't involved in any extracurriculars can generate $200M+/yr in revenue for schools, they'll start getting more scholarships. I also highly doubt that a school like Alabama or OSU with 38,000+ students and an NCAA limit of 85 people on football scholarship is sacrificing one for the other.

I do believe even students who have been provided athletic scholarships still must maintain a minimum GPA--and schools do everything they can to ensure they keep it.  Not sure other students have those academic aides available to them, but that's another story.\n\nIn general I don't think there is anything wrong with providing athletic scholarships, but I definitely don't think they should be paid large sums of cash to play ball for a college; FYI there is an asinine, but popular argument, which comes up a lot today from certain sports fanatics who have decided everything else besides the team they hold season tickets for is irrelevant.....if changes do come I'm willing to bet you're not going to like them SaltCantaloupe, in addition to getting a full ride to university in the future they'll likely graduate rich if sportsfans have their way.",

So good that a college actually thinks they can make them money off of more than paying to get in. You might think that the football player was just born good at football and stuff like that just comes to him naturally right? What about people that are born super smart and are just able to absorb information better than the average person? They dont work at hard just like the football player doesn't work as hard than someone who wasn't born good. Scholarships are for rewarding hard work; as someone who is a fuckin scholar and an athlete I can attest its definetly more complicated than just tossin around a ball and being violent",

They still have to go to class, do homework, study, and take the same exams. Then add on top of that, 30-40 hours a week of practice, games, and travel.

Even if you don't qualify for a scholarship you can still apply and theres a small chance you'll get it.\n\nIf you are really driven to make college affordable there are pathways to do that.

(Mona meaning Madam in Italian) Da Vinci originally had one girl model for this painting, but being the artist he was, took WAY too long to even get just the base of the painting down. He couldn\u2019t get the wife to model, due to her being pregnant and swollen. He managed to paint her basic form and some background before the girl got mad and quit. He was then able to convince the REAL Mona Lisa to sit and model for him after the birth of her second child. However the woman didn\u2019t fit the form that he had already painted, so there was a lot of flawed correction going on.  \n\nTL;DR: The Mona Lisa is actually a painting of TWO separate women!",

The detail in this painting was incredible, and it had so much more technique and skill, for example, the perspective lines and the lighting. And the difficulty of painting such a large painting is also impressive.

[This](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.etonline.com/big-machine-records-offices-shut-down-due-to-threats-amid-taylor-swift-feud-136467%3famp) article says that big machine had to shut down their office yesterday because Taylor fans were sending death threats. The article also quotes a label exec saying: \n\n> Taylor can 100 percent perform all of her catalog, past and present, at the AMAs. Big Machine has no issue with her performance going out on live broadcast because it recognizes it doesn\u2019t have the right to block her. Labels can\u2019t block any artists from performing any songs live.\n\nSo take it however you will. Lots of cool and differing opinions in here and I\u2019ve enjoyed reading them. Thanks for participating you guys \ud83d\udc95\n\n(**Original post below here**)\n\nhave a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the [recent news](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about Taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.\n\nTaylor Swift is always playing the victim. Almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.\n\nExample. She put [Joe Jonas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mNeKI) on blast over their breakup. Told everyone on Ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. But Joe Jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.\n\nOk, but she was only 19 with this happened. Surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?\n\nNope. I'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. They end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. Examples:  John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nLook at her feuds with other celebrities. Kanye and Katy Perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, the list goes on.\n\nLook at how she defends herself in all of these situations. She has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.\n\nAnd didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? Didn't it come out that Taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? It seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.\n\nNow she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. She is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.\n\nIt definitely could be true. And I do feel bad for her if that's the case.\n\nBut she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. Worth half a billion dollars. She could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. But she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). I get that people think this is an important message to spread. But the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.\n\nTaylor Swift reminds me of a high schooler. Her \"squad\" is a clique and she is their Regina George. She has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.\n\nTaylor seems to think everyone else is the problem. Nah Taylor, you're the problem. The common factor in all these situations is you.\n\nOh and her music sucks.",

If there is anything shady as hell that scooter and co. Have done that ein right she has to do right by herself and fellow upcoming artist's to make this public. \n\nCorporations , labels and companies in general are much worse than mean girls or genuinely just individual celebrities or co-workers with shitty relationship skills. TMZ just doesn't follow up on them cos that's not what people who follow gossip are interested in. \n\nI am however no music industry expert so I can't say I know this issue upside down. What am saying bruh is that it's true Taylor can be a real snake and has terrible relationship and perhaps social skills in general but that doesnt mean that we should immediately trivialise her claims as to not being able to monetize her own music. It's her music at the end of the day and America is a capitalist state. Girl needs to get her own. \n\nCould you however explain this music thing much better I don't understand it completely.",

            "I\u2019m of two minds with this.\n\nOverall, Swift is the epitome of self-victimization. Nine times out of ten she positions herself as the innocent bystander that other people use and abuse, even though all other accounts say the exact opposite. She\u2019s almost 30 and she still acts like a high schooler. I enjoy quite a bit of her music, but I find her personality insufferable.\n\nBut even so, she\u2019s not in the wrong here. This legal battle is disgusting and, assuming she\u2019s telling the truth (which I have no reason to doubt as of yet), she\u2019s shining a light on an abusive and damning industry practice. There is no reason an artist should be barred from performing their own material, much of which they wrote themselves.\n\nSure, she can afford world-class lawyers, but (1) the litigation process would almost certainly span years, and (2) that\u2019s irrelevant to the overall point that record labels are assuming unjust control over their artists\u2019 material.\n\nI hate Taylor Swift as a person, but right now, I feel as though everyone should stand beside her. (Though I say this with hesitation; anything could happen.)",
            "The post isn't even factually correct. She does make money when she performs live, as the writer, as do Scott and Scooter, who own the masters, as performances boost sales/streams of the songs. The whole issue is them blocking her from performing her own songs out of pettiness in an attempt to blackmail her to prevent her from re-recording her masters, which essentially makes their whole deal worthless since the only thing worth sh\\*t at BMR was Taylor's work. It has nothing to do with making money when she performs her old songs live. Taylor, Scott and Scooter all earn money when her old songs are performed live.",
            "She can't fight with lawyers that's not the point. When artists are young they don't have negotiating power against big companies and the artists need them as without them they cannot move their career forward. So the companies take advantage of it and sign make bad deals for the artists. Now a guy who hates Taylor Swift brought the company and her songs with it and is not letting her buyback her songs for some reason and not allowing her to perform it. She can only do is tell the people what is going on and people can judge if whose side they are on. Even though it is legal it is a bad practice. It's not playing victim.",
            "I'm a Swiftie, so sure, I'm biased, but I also feel like I've probably read and researched a lot more about Taylor Swift and on a number of these situations than you. So I would like to share some facts / additional information.\n\nFirst, I saw you write the below in a reply to someone's comment:\n\n>And yeah everyone is always like \"but she writes her own sooooongs\" like no. She has cowriters and producers. The girl can play basic chords on guitar and play piano at a 3rd grade level. She comes to producers with ideas and they turn them into passable music. She'd be nothing without them and look at how she thanks them for it.\n\nShe wrote her ENTIRE third album, Speak Now, when she was 19/20 or younger. She is the sole songwriter for every single song. She's also written plenty of other songs completely on her own such as Love Story when she was \\~17 and most recently several songs off her most recent album, Lover. When she made the move more into pop music, yes, you're right, she's collaborated quite a bit with co-writers like Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, etc. But to say she can't write or hasn't written her own songs is just flat out wrong.\n\nRe: Joe Jonas break-up, she was on Ellen within the last few months and at one point mentioned that whole thing (i.e. calling him out) as the most dramatic or immature (I forget exact words she used) thing she's done on TV or something. She's grown since then.\n\nRe: Kanye West, she's stuck to her story the whole time which is that she approved the \"Taylor and I might still have sex\" line in Famous but did not approve calling her \"that bitch.\" She talked about it in the most detail ever in a recent cover story for Rolling Stone.\n\nYour \"squad\" critique is like 4 years old - she said in her Entertainment Weekly \"30 things I learned before turning 30\" article earlier this year that she did not realize at the time how exclusionary or \"mean girls\" of a vibe it gave off. She admits in hindsight that's how it could've been interpreted. As a result she hasn't projected that image or publicized her friendships in that way for years now.\n\nRegarding the ability to purchase her masters, she was clear that Big Machine did offer her to buy her masters back - in the form of \"earning\" them back one album at a time by entering in a new contract with Big Machine where she'd earn her old masters back one-for-one as she put out new albums under the new contract. She wanted nothing to do with Big Machine any more (for obvious reasons) so that was a non-offer in her mind. In terms of knowing about it in advance, I'm frankly a bit hazy on that but my understanding is that the only way she'd know is through her dad who is a board member of Big Machine, but through non-disclosure he would not be able to tell her.\n\nSecond to lastly, and most importantly re: current events, **your edit to your post is WRONG**. She's gotten over that she won't own her old masters (making money part), that was from over the summer. Part of her contract is that she cannot re-record her old songs (create new masters) until November 2020. So now, Scott and Scooter are claiming that her performing old songs on a recorded/televised event (AMAs) is a form of re-recording, and thus are not allowing her to perform a medley of her hits at the AMAs where she's being honored as Artist of the Decade. So YES, something IS stopping her performing her old songs live, and that is Scott/Scooter explicitly not allowing her to (licensing the masters for a live performance). She was recently not allowed to perform old songs at a live event in Asia for this exact reason. She doesn't give a shit about money at this point. She just wants to fucking perform Love Story and songs SHE wrote. Fuck.\n\nLastly, I'll give you one thing and say one thing generally. First, I honestly don't know much about the origin or continuation of the Katy Perry feud, but one thing I felt was frankly very petty was Taylor putting 1989 back on Spotify on the same day of Katy's album release, Witness. So I'm not saying Taylor is perfect, and some of these situations we as individuals in the public will never know all the details, so I'm not saying she has never been at fault in any situation. But at the end of the day, I know Taylor is a very talented songwriter and musician, and for many people like me, her music is a bright spot in my life. Everyone has different tastes in music, so I don't expect or think everyone should like her, but the over-the-top, uninformed hate is really tiring.",

Also, she hasn\u2019t made a break up song since like 2017. She\u2019s been happily in love for the past three years. She\u2019s also since apologize for doing that to Joe Jonas and said It was immature.\n\nEdit: also she ended her squad because she disliked the message it put out.",

            ">Nothing is stopping her from performing them for an audience, she just won't make money off official recordings of it.\n\nThat just isn't true. She isn't allowed to re-record them until 2020, and she wanted to perform them at the American Music Awards. Which is recorded. Because the show is recorded, she isn't allowed to perform her old songs there. Your claim here just isn't true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Oh and her music sucks.\n\nWhether you think her music sucks is irrelevant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is.\n\nA lot of celebrities write songs about their exes. As for John Mayer specifically, it's pretty commonly known he's an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone\n\nShe's been around for over a decade. This \"teenage fan\" thing is getting old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post can be summed up as \"I don't like Taylor Swift. Fuck her!\". That's all you had to say.",

            "If you hate someone this much why the hell do you follow their every move?",
            ". . . Everyone writes songs about their exes, and more often than not it's about how awful they are. Hell, I'd go as far as to call it a whole subgenre within 2010 to 2015. But even then, most of her songs aren't actually about that, it's just the singles that are, and those singles are chosen because that's the type of music that does well.\n\nShe hasn't told any lies, either; the leaked phone call between Taylor and Kanye/Kim was edited, but even then it doesn't show what Taylor was upset about anyway. She knew of herself being referenced within the song, she thought it would be a fun little harmless, attack-less joke. What she didn't how, and what her issue was with, was the way she would be referenced within the song. She didn't like that she was being called a bitch, especially with the context of the song. The recording leaked also doesn't reference her a bitch either, unlike the official song.\n\nTaylor knew of her masters being sold, yes, but she didn't know to who, and that's her issue. There's been an, alleged, history of Scooter being cruel to Taylor. She tried to buy her own masters but the person selling them, Scott Borchetta, refused and instead tried to create another deal in which she would essentially be a slave to them, creating as many albums whenever they demand (AKA she didn't pass it up, she was refused). You say that the issue she has is that she can't perform her songs for money anymore . . . That's not the issue. At all. The issue is that she's literally not allowed to perform any of her old material because Scooter is abusing her contract which states that she would not be able to rerecord any of her material before the legal time, which is November of 2020. There are always cameras recording which he can use as her re-recording her material, regardless if it's a concert or a TV performance and not actually in a studio. \n\nThere hasn't been a situation in which would make her words \"unreliable\" like you claim. If you don't like Taylor then fine, but this situation is a bit bigger than that since it's abuse of an artist. She should have publishing rights--she's written a majority of her songs--but she can't do anything about it because while she is powerful, the people in control are ultimately the people in control.",

It's possible to think of a situation where they were both telling the truth. She already began talking about Joe Jonas in a different light a couple years later with the next album where she wrote a song about missing him without casting any blame on him. She was recently asked about the most rebellious thing she did as a teenager, and she said it was putting Joe Jonas on blast after their break-up, and that that was too much. She wasn't even saying that to try to get back together, they've both moved on and are now on friendly terms.",

Why do her fans care so much about her making more money off of them, she already makes more money then what most people with make in their lifetime. She makes money off her cats, so why is she looked at like she is this destitute victim. She should put on her big girl panties and sat with Scooter and Scoot to make a deal. Not go running to her social media to have her fans attack them. We all know that's why she did it that way and not the adult way.

            "[removed]",
            "Taylor Swift's career is actually studied in a music business course at OSU that I took...the original founder of Big Machine Records, Scott Borchetta split off from his previous company and wanted to start his own label. Borchetta was also friends with Taylors father. As a teenager Swift won a talent competition but kept getting turned down by record labels as she was trying to start a professional career. Borchetta knew about Taylor (and the fact that she was a hot 15 year old blonde trying to be a country music singer) and said that he would help her out. Scott Swift (Taylor's father) invested (a measly haha) $250,000 for a 3% stake in the new label, Big Machine Records. He then also advised that she go to Nashville and the label payed for her to work with songwriters. In these situations, the writers do not receive royalties or credit for the work they do they get paid upfront and do this for a living. She came out of these sessions with her first album (as the saying goes in the songwriting industry \"change a word, get a third\") and no one really knows how much of those songs were truly \"her\" work, except the people in those sessions. So, the combination of her appearance, those nashville sessions, her father investing in this startup label, and the know how of a professional (Borchetta who was repaying a favor to his friend, Scott Swift) rocketed her to stardom....heres where I take major issue with her fued: 1). She didnt have to sign with big machine records (but remember nobody else wanted to sign her). 2). If her father still owns a 3% stake in the company, his share is now worth $90 million. 3). Her signature is on the contract that stated Big Machine would own her masters (therefore she agreed to it)....with all that being said music is still a business and she wanted instant fame that her father was able to essentially buy for her. She has made a lot of money because of it. Her father has made a lot of money because of it. Big Machine Records made her career (and her father bought her a spot on the label). If she didnt want this to happen then why did she sign in the first place??? She was also given an opportunity to own her masters if she stayed with the label for another 10 years when her original contract was up. At this point she basically had two choices: 1) Negotiate a better deal (which big machine was probably not willing to do) or 2) leave the label and live with the choice (and legally binding contract) she made when she first signed with Big Machine. She chose the latter and is now playing up the stereotype that labels screw over musicians despite the fact it was her hand that held the pen that signed her name to the contract. She chose instant fame (as many artists often do) at the expense of not owning her masters. Also, there is nothing that stops her from playing her songs live and re-record them, but she does have to pay the royalties to the owner of those songs aka Big Machine Records....in a nutshell Taylor needs to grow the fuck up instead of blaming everyone else for situations that she gets herself into. She is a professional in a business where company ownership can most certainly change hand, in this case she simply doesnt like Scooter Braun so she threw a fit about it. She is trying to rally the support of her fanbase and slander Big Machine Records with millions of people at her side. Its shitty, dirty business on her part. That being said, labels do \"screw\" artists a lot, but only if you're dumb enough to let them.",

If anything these child-free groups have given me access to people I can feel comfortable around - I'm not going to have to sit there while they obsess over their children or insist I will change my mind about choosing to not have children.\nIt's a bit like people who obsess over sports - I don't like sports, I have no interest in sports, if I'm made to sit there and tolerate it, I'm going to get uncomfortable/irritable.\n\nLong and short, other people aren't necessarily interested in your kids.

It's not the children who are at fault most of the time, but the adults who fail to do anything.

So yes, I dont like seeing children period. Plus I think with our social and economic climate, I'm not going to be able to afford children or even be able to raise them as emotionally stable adults. Still trying to figure that out myself, I dont need another burden dragging me along",
            "You're waging war with a fictional character.  If you have in fact been privy to the highly improbable encounter of someone ranting and scolding you or any person on \"crotch goblins\", it surely would have only happened once.  Though if I were a betting man, this never actually happened to you, and you're just venting about a trope you dont know to be true in any meaningful way.  I think you are actually a karma-whoring liar.",
            "Yup you should see mommy groups when they say they hate other kids besides their own. Instant eye roll and they wonder why other moms don\u2019t invite them to play dates.",
            "Kids are fucking annoying. It's nothing personal, it's simply in their nature to be so. Dosen't mean I can't dislike them.",

            "I really just hate shit parents who don\u2019t know how to raise their kid to behave in public.",

            "Chubby cheeked shit machines.",
            "As annoying as people saying they want kids, asking you when you\u2019ll have them or can\u2019t stop talking about their own. \n\nWe get is, we\u2019re animals who reproduce like all other animals. Stop talking about it like it\u2019s something special.",
            "I think as a teenager it\u2019s a common mentality, almost like a contraceptive. Some people just have a hard time growing up.",
            "This is the most random opinion. I cant like upvote this because its a poorly defended statement even if it is unpopular",
            "I've never seen anyone who hates kids say it out loud for kids present to hear. We like to keep it to ourselves. Also, we don't care what you think about our opinions on children. On the other hand, the people who are annoying and cringey are the ones who go on about how you're the worst person in the world for hating kids, and shame you into holding their babies.",
            "There should be more separate facilities for people that don't like children, like:\n\n1. Flights\n\n2. Long distance public transport\n\n3. Restaurants\n\n4. Recreational facilities\n\n5. Beaches\n\n6. Resorts\n\nI don't mind children, but I mind screaming, annoying ones, why should I deal with them?",
            "I must be lucky I have never met such people.",
            "I agree. Here's the thing: I'm childfree. I don't like children really. I don't enjoy spending time with children. I just don't understand them. And I've never felt the need to reproduce. The whole thing makes me uneasy and i find children kind of gross. But I'm not going out of my way to be rude to them. \n\nI don't understand it when people make their whole personality about the thing they hate. That's not a good way to live your life. A toddler waves at you? Why are you offended? Alright, just wave back. Having a bad day? Ok then don't wave back. But don't act like the child was a demon for trying to interact with you. Yes, i also get annoyed at the screaming child in the supermarket. But you know what? I'll be gone from there in a couple of minutes and it won't be my problem any more.\n\nI understand the frustration of being asked about having children. I'm 31F and have been in a relationship for 8 years. Believe me, the topic has come up numerous times. Having children is the norm. That's a fact. And if you do something outside of the norm, you will be questioned. Is it annoying? Hell yeah it is. Would it be better, if we could live our lives just the way we want them, without explaining our choices all the time? Sure. But by focusing on this thing, people basically make their lives revolve around the thing they don't actually want. And that doesn't seem healthy to me.",

            "I'm going to try and choose my words carefully as to not be misconstrued.\n\nI feel as though children get too much of a pass to do bad things, such as throw a screaming temper tantrum in a store or at the movie theater, and when you do anything to try and make the situation less painful for yourself, I hate how everyone thinks you are an asshole.\n\nWhy is it okay for a kid to kick the back of my seat on an airplane, but not okay for me to tell his/her parents to get their child to stop?",
            "Just don't expect me to give a fuck about your kids, and we're cool.",
            "I hate everyone equally \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I don't hate kids. There are plenty of calm and chill kids around that are a million times less annoying than many, many adult people. However, the thought of ever having kids of my own is disturbing at the moment for some reason I can't really explain... Meanwhile, my girlfriend wants one before she turns 30. We are just 25 though, so my mentality might change in the coming years.",
            "I like kids but i think it is impossible to not react negatively to them sometimes. They can be very gross, loud, and consequently very annoying. It's easy to get fed up with kids you do not know.",
            "I dislike kids because of my sensory issues, but I will NEVER go up to a parent and tell them that. That is just being an asshole",
            "I hate parents who don\u2019t stop their kids from screaming or banging on the walls.",
            "Honestly, I always thought that I hated children until I really examined my feelings on the matter. I always enjoyed spending time with my younger family members and I find babies adorable, but there has always been a unique discomfort when it comes to interacting with children outside of my family. I now believe this discomfort stems from my perception of parents more so than children. \n\nA lot of parents concoct these arbitrary rules regarding how others are supposed to engage with their children, but they view said rules are unspoken as opposed to personal. So, it just seems easy to make a meaningless misstep. But hating kids is fucking stupid.",
            "I hate entitled parents who think their offspring is covered in gold and is adorable when they\u2019re committing murder",
            "I don't hate children, I just don't think every single meaningless birth is a miracle and that every single child is a prince/princess.",
            "Does this extend to me, a person who just hates the way some people think they deserve something for *having* a child? You know the ones... \"I should get to go to the front of the coffee line because I have a child and you can't possibly be as tired as me.\" or \"You don't know how hard it is to have children, I deserve more than you do because of that.\" \n\nI literally tell people that I didn't spread their fucking legs to have that child, that was a choice *you* made on your own. Lie in the bed you made, and stop acting like a saint or a martyr  because you squatted down and had a child. Is your child cute? More than likely. Do I like your kids? Meh, maybe, it depends on how they act. But I won't say they are awful unless they are indeed crotch goblins. Do I buy into that \"it takes a village\" shit and I should help you just because you've decided to spawn? Fuck no. Raise your damn kids on your own. Do I think I'm cool because I feel this way? No.",
            "I don't hate all kids. I hate kids that are so fucking annoying, screaming all the time, come to my house and make a fucking mess, take my stuff without asking me, and broke my fucking stuff. And the fucking parents, they just fucking drop them off at my house and fucking leave, do they have any idea that their kids is a fucking kid from hell?!!",
            "People who hate children/babies to the degree to which they take to social media to humiliate, put down, and complain about them totally creep me out. No doubt most of these sorts of people were treated terribly as kids, or worse. \n\nTo be clear I am not talking about people who simple do not enjoy kids, or choose not to have them. I respect people who choose not to have kids, for not allowing themselves to be pressured into something that would not be a good fit for them.",
            "I'm bad with kids , I don't particularly like them and have this fear that I'll hurt them somehow when they're near me and I don't wanna be responsible for shit . yes I know I suck .",
            "The parenting subs and groups where people obsess over children but also complain and vent their frustrations about them can be equally as cringey and annoying, hence why I, a childfree person, don't go onto those other than to remind myself why I'm childfree.",
            "I mean, I consider myself to be someone who does hate children. But it's not personal, and I would never openly talk about that hatred, especially not in front of an actual child. My reasoning is simply that I don't have the patience to be around screaming kids, and I would loose my temper with them very, very quickly. So, I simply avoid them at all costs, to spare both me and them from the situation where I blow up in rage at the fact that they won't shut the hell up. I hate kids, but that doesn't mean I need to make everyone aware of that fact. I just avoid kids and people who have them. It's that simple.",

There was a brief attempt at establishing an artificial religion (over to you Max Robespierre and your Cult of the Supreme Being) but that oddly enough, wasn\u2019t a massive success. What finally worked out just hunky dory, was the less radical politicians endorsing \u201cfreedom of worship\u201d whereby you are free to worship whatever and whoever you want. Or not. And so - the separation of the church and state was born.\n\nTLRDR; Freedom of worship is great- imposing atheism is as bad as imposing your religion of choice. People should just be allowed to believe what they want as long as that right doesn;t infringe on the rights of others. French politicians worked this out around 200 years ago.",

            "As an activist, I continue to hear this line: \"Why do atheists talk so much about God and religion?\" Or, \"Why would someone speak so often about a deity he/she doesn't believe in?\"\n\nIn truth, I suspect that these questions are deflections designed to make the questioner seem self-consciously obsessive...the sinner that \"doth protest too much.\"\n\nBut the reality is that atheist activism exists because religion exists.  Religion permeates our culture, shows up on our doorsteps with literature, scriptures and threats of eternal damnation, influences our science books, contaminates our political systems, indoctrinates our children and postulates that its doctrine must be followed, lest we be destroyed in body, in soul, or both.\n\nNon-believers are simply responding to the avalanche of religious messages that bears down upon us daily. And they do so by (surprise!) speaking on the subject.\n\nReligion gets carte blanche to be as vocal as it wants, to knock on our doors and accost us in our homes, in our places of work, in our personal and professional lives. Believers are charged with a life mission to preach, teach, disciple, shout it from the mountaintops and to \"go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\" Religion...is everywhere.\n\nAsk yourself. When's the last time an atheist rang your doorbell with the Good News of Humanism? How often do you find Richard Dawkins books in the dresser drawers of your hotel rooms? When was the last atheist temple erected in your neighborhood? Have you ever attended an atheist revival? Has atheism demanded 10% of your household income? How many dedicated atheist television channels come through your satellite dish? How many atheist verses were you instructed to memorize as a child? When's the last time someone thanked a FARMER (or even the cook) at the dinner table instead of God?\n\nOn a more radical front, what's the name of the last atheist who sawed the head off of an \"infidel?\" Or sentenced a shrouded woman to death for displeasing an oppressive husband? Or strapped explosives to his belt in order to kill hundreds in a public square? Or publicly executed someone for being gay?\n\nIt's everywhere. Religion is a pounding drum that has gone mostly unanswered for a long, long time. And religion is not satisfied with merely existing quietly in the homes and hearts of the faithful. Its very nature compels the believer to proselytize, preach, promote, convince, convert and prevail. If you play on the team of the religious, your game plan is to stay, always, on offense.\n\nThroughout our history, those who raise a simple hand of protest against these advances have been portrayed as the real problem. Religion has attempted to marginalize and defeat legitimate questions and concerns by indignantly portraying any resistors as misguided, immoral, rudderless, angry, miserable, lost and alone.\n\nAnd when skepticism challenges wildly improbable (or impossible) stories found in the Bible, the Qur'an and other holy books, the religious wail, \"Why do atheists talk so much about religion?\"\n\nIt's often like asking cancer survivors why they're advocates for cancer cures.\n\nWe ask, we challenge, we battle, we care because it matters. The facts and fiction of religious claims matter. The larger question, \"Is it true?\" matters. The countering of religious privilege matters. And the building of a superstition-free future matters.\n\nThe next time a religious person labels you as obsessed with religion and God (pick one...there are thousands to choose from), just remember that religion began the discussion. It amplifies itself before the world. It targets the vulnerable and ignorant. It often threatens all humankind with punishment upon its rejection. And it's making Truth claims that - despite all of the fluffy platitudes about \"faith\" - must meet the burden of proof.\n\nReligion started this mess. And if an atheist speaks out against religious claims, it's likely the speech wouldn't be necessary if the claims weren't made in the first place.\n\nCredit - Seth Andrews",

            "I agree with you. Atheism is not necessarily an ideology or a group identity that should be aiming to fill the place of religion. It\u2019s just the absence or disbelief in god or gods.

Similarly some religious organisations have done nothing but wonderful things and are respected. \n\nEasy go to one is the Catholic Church defending and hiding pedophiles as well as other sexual attacks. Supporting the catholic faith and by extension the church can be seen as you public supporting their paedophilic acts. And it\u2019s hard to separate the good from the bad, one does not cancel out the other. It really does not matter how many soup kitchens you put on for the homeless if you go home afterwards and rape a child. \n\nReligion is not 1 thing, and each needs to be treated differently. \n\nthe default human \u201cbelief\u201d is atheism. A baby needs to be taught religion while no one needs to teach you the absence of religion, you are born without belief. \n\nAlso capitalism, communism, liberalism, facism(etc...) are all belief systems similar to religion, just because they don\u2019t have a god doesn\u2019t meant they don\u2019t have mantras, beliefs, practices, traditions, holidays, songs, stories, and authorities like a religion.

Whole social structures in middle America pressure people into believing or hiding their non-belief, because they don't want to be socially rejected. \n\nAll atheists do is try (wrong-headedly) to convince you that God doesn't exist.

For awhile I found myself wanting to default to that. I would just remember looking so great in a certain cut of jeans or wearing brown lipstick and very matte skin and looking hot. But then I realize that I was 105 pounds and my skin was completely line free. More importantly it was the style then so it looked good. But at 46 in 2020? Not so much.

            "Historically, the 4AM wake up time has been about being ready and prepared to begin productive work when the sun came up. \n\nBefore electric lights, this was a very significant reason to get as much work done during the precious times that you could actually see.\n\nIt\u2019s still important in agriculture and other industries, but largely antiquated. \n\nThe time doesn\u2019t matter if you are a single person. \n\nWhen it does matter, is when you begin to add people to your family and work together to operate the household. People need to be in the same ballpark schedule or you\u2019re not eating dinner with your kids, helping with homework, spending your relax time with your significant other. \n\nThere are plenty of non-productive reasons to be moving around doing things from 6AM-6PM instead of 6pm -6am. Especially if you don\u2019t live in a huge city. \n\nBut a lot of that is becoming antiquated as well with internet banking, online shopping, and 24hr brick and mortar businesses. \n\nI think what the motivational speaker types get at, is sacrificing sleep for productivity. \n\nIt\u2019s far more efficient to sacrifice entertainment for productivity. \n\nPeople don\u2019t generally realize how much time they waste during their waking hours that could be spent improving their lives. \n\nI work only 12 hour shifts.\n\nBut because I have opted to work 12\u2019s instead of 8\u2019s or 10\u2019s I only have to go to work 14 days a month for a full paycheck. And I get 16 days off to spend as I choose. \n\nIt\u2019s not about worshipping the god of productivity, it\u2019s that doing everything you \u201cneed\u201d to as efficiently as possible.... actually gives you more free time.",
            "I think it's just perceived  diligence. The society believes that early risers value productivity more so they want to wake up and get things done. But this is not always true because peopel that get up at noon might be working or running errands all day hardcore for straight 12\\~14 hours until they hit the sack again at like 3\\~4am. So It wouldn't be accurate to just label them \"lazy\". But then again, I dont think it's completely baseless either. Often times (without any real stats, but based on personal experience), I find that people do get up late tends to be less productive than ones who do.

Some Type-A pilot starts commenting to me about how tired and rundown I look. I politely tell him that my team and I upgraded 105 laptop in to Windows 10 in three days and that I'm not a morning person. He begins to cheerfully chide me about how the BEST way to wake up in the morning is an ice cold shower. I tell him (again, politely) that I'm happy that works for him but it sounds like absolute hell to me. He looked at me like I was a communist but happily stopped chattering at me.",

            "Going to make my first post to share my experience with this. When I turned 18, my mother bought me an old 98 contour as a birthday gift, forced me to get my license, and then told me I had to get a job in order to prepare me for life as an adult as well as to help cover for insurance for the car as well as rent. How much did she expect? $450 a month. She was somewhat confused as to why I didn't appreciate the gift. While I had planned to go to college immediately after finishing high school, I decided to wait a year (which later turned in to two due to reasons), largely to help look after my little brother while she was at work. He was 7 or 8 at the time, and has some level of mental illness. At the time, not sure how to both get work in my relatively small town and watch a small child, my mother offered to get me in to a part time night shift janitor position at the local YMCA. This was min wage at the time, so around 7 dollars an hour. \n\nVery nearly every cent I made went to gas and my rent. Again, she wondered why I didn't enjoy my new found \"freedom\" that having a car gave me. Either way, years passed and I attended class full time at a local university. Eventually, I met a girl online, whom I dated for a year or so. Things seemed to be going well between us, but her family was terrible, and so after discussion with my mother, I suggested to her that she move in with us. Eventually she did, but then my mother decided $450 wasn't enough, and now she wanted $650. I tried to explain that even with the min wage having slightly increased alongside my having been assigned slightly more hours, I still could barely pat that, and I needed to save money so that the two of us could move out next year as I had finished my associates and no nearby universities offered my degree. No dice. 650 a month or my girlfriend would have to move back in with her family. While I was, by now 22 or 23, I had barely a grand saved up and so we were stuck. \n\nShe tried job hunting, but small town and one car between us meant she couldn't find a job while also attending college. We agreed her degree should come first. My college advisors recommended I keep attending class to knock out electives neccesary for my bachelor's that, while I couldn't actually progress on there, I could at the main campus some 2 hours west of us. And so it went that another year or two passed in which I barely made any money at all, even though I was a full time student and worked a part time job. \n\nEventually I finally decided to pull the plug and move out. 24 or 25, I had barely saved more than 2 grand. I bought myself two things from my own money in my 6\u00f7 years of working. A pair of headphones and a pair of sunglasses. How much was the rent of the apartment Iwe ended up moving in to? $410 a month. With a security deposit and a month of rent ahead of time, not to mention having to buy all the odds and ends you don't realize you need until you've moved out, we were damn poor for a good while. \n\nIm sorry if all of this is somewhat off topic, but I guess I wrote all of this to say one thing: Fuck parents who force their kids to pay rent. Looking back, I could have made some smarter choices, picked up a second or maybe different job altogether, but why the hell should I have had to? I was a kid fresh out of high school and immediately was barely making ends meet. What kind of parent would do this kind of thing to their own flesh and blood? \n\nAnyways, have an upvote OP.

They don't always think about all the consequences of their decisions. \n\nIf they trust you enough to come to you and ask something like this and you turn them down because you don't want them to have sex, youre just screwing both of you. Think back to when you were a teen, if you *really* wanted to do something and your parents said \"no\" , were you immediatly going to accept the answer? \n\nPregnancy is preventable, even more so with a doctor prescribed bc. If you deny it to her, you have no right to be angry or surprised when she tells you she's pregnant, because it could have all be prevented had you said \"yes\".\n\nEdit: Stop taking this post out of context.

However condoms can break very easily and an inexperienced person might not realise it until too late. Yes, you should *always* use condoms but condoms + another form of bc is best. That's what I'm talking about.\n\nEdit 3: I'm talking about *all (IUD, arm implant, ect)* forms of bc, not just pills.\n\nEdit 4: Yes, the teens are responsible for their actions. But if a teen comes to you and asks for bc then they are trying to be responsible. Getting on bc *is responsible*, they could go out and fuck with no protection, but instead they are taking appropriate steps to prevent accidents.

People  in Sweden didn't blink an eye at the idea that girls would be out trying to get laid.  It meant that in Sweden, girls got given all the support they need to ensure that when they inevitably had sex, because they were just as sex mad as boys, they would be safe.  \n\n\nAs a result Sweden has one of the lowest rates of teenage pregnancy in the world.",

I have had extremely terrible periods for the longest time and asked my grandmother if I could get on birth control.

            "Just a thought: a teenage girl asking to get birth control (even if it is specifically for preventing pregnancy and not to regulate hormones or any of the other uses) is an indication of responsibility. It is that teen saying \"Look, I want to do this, but I want to be as safe about it as I possibly can.\" If they are willing to approach their parent and have that tough conversation, couldn't you see that as an indication of their maturity - recognizing the risks and looking for a way to mitigate them, even knowing it will create a tough conversation that nobody really wants to have?\n\nI do not fully agree with OP in that I can't agree that the parent is totally at fault, but that type of action should at least be recognized.",

It\u2019s literally how their brain works thanks to their frontal cortex not being developed. If parents were to just give their kids proper birth control & tell them the risks of sex rather than screaming abstinence in their faces & nothing more, I feel they would be much more responsible.

If we're going to offer birth control as an option, we should be fully educating teens on safe sex. Lots of info I wish I knew about when I was younger. The obvious knowledge is possibility of getting pregnant or serious STDs like AIDs. But I had no idea some STDs could be spread just by skin touch and that some STDs could be treated. All I knew was what I saw on TV.\nI ken it's like still fully educating a person (usually a teenager) all aspects of driving and road safety, not just how to put the car in drive and put the foot on the wheel you know? And most parents educate their kids on responsibility by making them pay for their car, the gas or at least earn driving their parent's car privileges, which I feel encompasses a general, yet effective approach to driving edu. We need to do that with sex ed.",

            "If we care about all teens, then doing right thing by principle put into action should be based on the lowest common denominator and choice. The lowest common denominators are dumb governing officials, dumb parents, and dumb teens. The state has a vested interest in reducing teen pregnancies as it saves vast amounts of future funding taking care of those new families for every bit of funding spent at preventing them in the first place. It is well documented to be beneficial yet those elected officials will always pander to our next dumb crowd for election votes, the dumb parents. The dumb parents want no teen pregnancy for obvious reasons but can be sold on religious and state based abstinence-only sex education or believe falsely that they actualy have a choice in their teens choices and that by restricting the teens choices they will restrict an opportunity for a bad outcome. Then there is our dumb teen who may want to make good choices and does not want to get pregnant but does not have the life experience in dealing with their own libido when confronted with an attractive partner who is gently interested in having sex with them. That emotional hormone fueled validation is intoxicating and for good reason. We are mostly all hardwired to breed to continue our races survival. It is a powerfull instinct that is beyond perfect reason.

Yes, birth control pills help prevent you from getting pregnant. But they also regulate your hormones, which helps with a whole whack of stuff, including levelling out your mood, decreasing period length, intensity, cramps, etc., and so on and so forth. You can even use them to skip periods so you only have 3 or 4 a year, decreasing your downtime due to periods immensely. The fact that girls are being denied birth control (and that many insurance companies don't cover it despite it being a medical necessity for many women) is yet another example of men deciding how women should live their lives.",

            "While it's fair to say that the parent should've seen it coming, that's different than assigning them the responsibility. \n\nThe inability to get birth control might be a risk factor for pregnancy, but it is not the parent's fault. Since the individual chooses what to do, they are responsible for the result, not someone else who told them it wasn't a good idea.  Even if that person is a teenager with limited ability to judge risk, they cannot blame others for not preventing them from making a choice that didn't go as planned. \n\nAlso, a lot of comments here are basically promoting the false gospel that birth control or condoms make sex \"safe\". As if the only possible negative is unwanted pregnancy or disease. Anyone who tells their children that sex is just a meaningless physical act done for pleasure (either directly or by omitting anything else from the conversation), is not protecting them at all, even if they help them get birth control. \n\nIf we assume that there won't be any judgment or shaming from their peers, since we're so progressive as a society, there is still the issue of emotions. Sex is all but guaranteed to increase the already considerable likelihood that a teenage relationship will be obsessive, irrational and lopsided. Pretending that sex doesn't have emotional content, which may be very difficult for teenage brains to navigate, is reckless and stupid. \n\nTo say nothing of the fact every method can fail, even when used perfectly. The fact that it was unlikely won't make the individual any less pregnant.\n\nThe point is, there is more to be said than don't get pregnant / an sti. There is also - you are not just an object for the pleasure of others, nor are they objects for your pleasure. You can expect more from a partner than being just good enough to you for you to sleep with, while their initial infatuation lasts. Messages that are basically the opposite of \"it's fine as long as you use condoms\". \n\nIf the parent *just* gets a teen birth control, they are sending the message that it's totally safe to have sex as long as they use protection, which is just ridiculous. It's like getting a kid a phone and assuming they can only be hurt if the web browser isn't filtered.\n\n\nTangent:\nWe've all heard this message for a long time. \"Sex shouldn't be restricted in any way, except that both parties consent, and unwanted pregnancy is avoided. There's nothing abnormal except abstinence.\" The Kinsey reports were extremely influential in promoting and justifying that view. His reports said that things that were considered fringe or immoral were actually extremely common, and therefore totally amoral. That is that all sexuality has as much moral significance as kind of tea one prefers. \n\nSetting aside the silliness of that line of reasoning, it isn't widely known that those reports used samples that were by no means representative, and included documentation of child molestation. Not just accounts of prior molestation, but evidence that someone observed and documented it while it was happening. So the very commonality that the reports claimed was based on bad methods, and the person who conducted that research was a freaking child molester.\n\n**some articles claim that table 34 came entirely from reports from one pedophile. But if that's true, then those who reported being observed by Kinsey as they were molested are lying, and the time measurements are either made up or Kinsey encouraged a pedophile to use a stopwatch. There's no way to make the existence of such a record morally acceptable and scientifically valid.",

My parents never had to worry about me impregnating someone, so why should they not grant me the same luxury? If you're going to live under my roof, you're going to do as I say.

            "As someone studying both clinical psychology and gender studies and has written research papers on teenage sexual habits , I agree that you NEED to educate your kids on sex and give them access to birth control when they ask for them (educating your kids on safe sex leads to them statistically having sex later in life and having much less risk for teenage pregnancies, STD\u2019\u2019s, etc). Furthermore, teenagers do have tendencies to have sex because when in the presence of their peers (and only their peers) they tend to seek high reward activity and pay less attention to the risk - and sex is a perfect example of a high reward activity. Thus, there\u2019s not really a great way to prevent teenagers from having sex if that\u2019s your goal in life. That\u2019s not to say that they won\u2019t take risk into account - if you teach them ways to do high reward activities but with less risk (as with safe sex) they will often take steps to lower the risk while performing the high reward activity. \n\nTLDR educate your kids on safe sex please! It\u2019ll lead to them statistically having much safer sex and lead to less teen pregnancies. There\u2019s even evidence it statistically leads kids to start having sex later in life (for all you worried parents out there). If you deny your kids education on something so fundamental as sex, you are to blame when something goes astray because you arguably should have seen it coming. In other words, I would argue that you are negligent in your decision to NOT educate or give your kids access to birth control.\n\nIt\u2019s 4 am and I\u2019m typing this on my phone, but I\u2019ll get out my laptop and upload sources tomorrow when I remember so if you\u2019re curious please be patient\n\nAlso, I\u2019m NOT an expert by any means, but I have done a fair bit of research and if anyone has research that says otherwise I\u2019m happy to discuss it with you (low key love these kinds of discussions)",
            "> Edit 4: Yes, the teens are responsible for their actions. But if a teen comes to you and asks for bc then they are trying to be responsible. Getting on bc is responsible, they could go out and fuck with no protection, but instead they are taking appropriate steps to prevent accidents. And if a parent denies their child that safety then it's on them too.\n\nIf you're old enough to \"be responsible\" then you are old enough to decide whether or not to have birth control.\n\nWhat is fucked up in this situation is that a law would remove that autonomy from someone.\n\nThe situation in the UK, for example, they have what is called Gillick Competence. If a child is deemed competent (based on certain criteria, with certain default assumptions) then they can control their reproductive health including the contraceptive pill and abortion.\n\nThis \"people are my property\" thing seems really deeply embedded in US culture, unfortunately.",
            "I mean, as soon as most teenager are between 11-20 they are gonna do it. \n\nNow before my rant and advice. Teach your kids about CONSENT!

It\u2019s important to install this mentality. In BOTH guys and girls.\n\nIf you don\u2019t are that sort of parent that keeps them sheltered all they have is imagination. First thing is that no parent has control what kids do. Accept that fact and the rest comes easy. \n\nOf course keep it a positive mindset and tell them that there are preventions to pregnancy and teach them about how STDs and STIs are contracted. \n\nGirls can get the bar in the arm to stop pregnancy but that doesn\u2019t stops the sexually transmitted diseases. \n\nAlso don\u2019t buy a book... there are plenty of good resources out there online that not just explain safe sex but also preventions.",

At that point, if I'd had a kid accidentally I would have had to drop out of college and move home, and (as indicated by the manipulation about condoms) the dude I was with was a narcissistic abusive asshole who I would then have been irrevocably tied to for the rest of our hypothetical child's life. \n\nDon't rely on condoms unless it's your only option, and in that case, bring your own and don't settle for a dude who disrespects you by pulling some \"it doesn't feel good\" \"I won't be able to feel it\" \"I'm too big\" nonsense.

You wouldn't say no to giving your kid a first aid kit if they were going out on a hike or camping. The same applies here. They're going to do their own thing like it or not. They want to have sex?

I hope to offer my own, as well.   \nwhen minorities say we're proud of our race, we're usually implying and cherishing the cultural experiences that often come with being x skin color. it's a common depiction that black girls get their hair pulled by brushes due to having kinky and curly hair. while that example is possibly shameful to most, this is something they might find exclusive to the black community, along with other things that they suspect happens to no other race (e.g. white people never having to worry about the evil hot/pressing comb).  \nadditionally, in my experience, we often say \"I'm so glad to be x\" in spite of everything shaming us. minorities have dealt with constant dehumanization and it can be hard not to hate the skin you were born in. it's gotten a lot better with us being normalized as people through representation in media, but some still feel they have to stand united and our pride is a symbol of unity.",

No offence to airpods users but thosr things look kinda dumb.\n\nThen there are kids who have them in but aren't actually listening to anything but they're just kids so who cares but I've seen adults, full grown ass adults having them in just sitting there with them in like some sort of fashion statements when they're at clubs, or gatherings or dinners and such. Who tf puts in earphones at the dinner table with people you haven't seen in a while let alone a club or setting where theres music in the back. It's never some random brand of wireless earphones. It's always airpods. I just find it so immature and rude to be having earphones or headphones in at a gathering. \n\nLastly they sound like shit. The pros are not so bad but the price negates that. The long shower head ones sound like shit and cost an arm. Plenty of good wireless earphones that actually look decent \n\nEdit : Airpods and the copies look ugly compared to other wireless earphones. Wired in ear earphones hardly exist now. Also I'm talking about regular airpods. The pros are not as horrible\n\nTheres that percentage of people who use airpods as a status symbol or a hyped item like a supreme box logo t shirt that I hate.\n\nEDIT 2 : LMAOOO to those of you mentioning the hair gel scene in there's something about Mary.

            "As an audio engineer with a few apple devices, I would get them for ease of use and compatability with my devices. I have studio-spec equipment (near field monitors, flat response headphones, an interface with AD/DA converters etc) if I want to do critical listening.\n\nI also have the habit of walking around with headphones on/in without anything playing to reduce the chance of people talking to me as I\u2019d consider myself pretty introverted and don\u2019t like speaking to strangers.\n\nTake my upvote, as I think your opinion is unpopular even though I\u2019d agree with some parts of it.\n\nAlso the wireless earbuds that are essentially just ball shaped with the spongy tips never stay in my ears regardless of the size of tip I use. I think it\u2019s mostly due to the weight of the earbud as I can wear earplugs for gigging just fine. The showerhead shaped ones are the only type of earbud that I can guarantee won\u2019t just randomly fall out of my ear.",

Is it cause they are white?\n\nTo me they just look like normal standard earphones with a thicker stem and the wire cut off.",
            "Yeah. I really don\u2019t care what my ear buds look like as long as they work seamlessly, are comfortable and don\u2019t fall out of my ears while exercising. Air pods do all of that for me. If ear buds are a fashion statement for you there are plenty out there that look cool. I like reliability. I resisted buying air pods for years because of the price, during that time I spent the same amount on several cheaper products that failed after a couple months or wouldn\u2019t stay in my ear. Looking back I should have just spent the money on a decent product.",
            "I\u2019ve tried four brands so far and the apple ones are my second favorite. My only complaints are the sound quality and battery life. There are a set from JLabs for like $70 which are much more comfortable, better sound, and better battery life. When I loose the AirPods that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be buying next. Not mad at the AirPods causes I thought the skull candy Indy were fucking trash as well as the $20 Jl labs but they are for sure over priced and the white is tacky IMO.",

Buying it as a fashion statement is kinda dumb. \n\nBut for someone like me, they\u2019re a godsend. I use earphones every day. They come with ANC and transparency mode which I think is very clever. It works *absurdly* well with my iPhone and watch. I love how when I remove an AirPod my video pauses and then when I put it back in, it resumes. \n\nBefore these, I had the original AirPods and they worked like a charm for 3 years without a single hiccup. I buy them for convenience and I think they\u2019re a brilliant piece of engineering. \n\nRe: Sound quality. I love the output my AirPods give. But I\u2019m no expert. If you\u2019re someone who really cares about sound quality and can tell the difference between good and great, I\u2019m sure you have much better options for the same price.

            "Upvoted because I 100% disagree. I love mine. They\u2019re one of my favorite Apple products of all time. I think they look great, and their visibility is a pro in my book because I like to see if someone is listening to or talking on their phone so I don\u2019t interrupt them and so I know that they can\u2019t hear me if I\u2019m trying to talk to them.",
            "The biggest takeaway from airpods is that 100% of them can't be fixed with parts. They expect you to just buy new ones if they break. Shit audio quality too, can't even hook up a DAC. Wireless headphones are a scam.",
            "You people seriously need to stop having the \"people who use apple is just a fashion statement\". I believe some do but for the vast majority, we like to be almost certain we are paying for a quality product that will last for years without showing. I've used an iPhone 4 for 8 years with only a single scratch until its battery died out. Changed to a average Samsung (phone prices are getting in ridiculous ranges) and in 2 years the phone is slow, fast charging doesn't work and the phone is permanently damaged from using a silicon case. I can keep on ranting but I dislike to lose time on this kind of crap and troubleshooting so you're damn sure when this phone dies I'm back on a goddamn iphone.\n\nPS: I enjoy the smaller earbuds but I don't mind the ones sticking out like the airpods do.",
            "Just because you can't hear the sound coming out of the earbuds, doesn't mean they're not listening to anything. That's literally the whole point of them. I don't know of anyone who use air pods as a \"fashion statement.\" \n\nThey're relatively cheap and do not in anyway denote any type of status or wealth. What looks even dumber is when you tryna get wired earbuds out of your pocket and they're tangled and you have to untangle them, hence the invention of air pods.",

If they\u2019re so ugly why do you think people are wearing them as a \u201cfashion statement\u201d versus just wearing them because they like headphones they don\u2019t get tangled in? In fact, how could you possibly know someone\u2019s intentions for using a product? This isn\u2019t just an unpopular opinion, but a pretty idiotic one.",
            "I think they look ok and I like the sound quality, way out of my price range so I went for cheaper wireless earphones (stemless) and I much prefer them simply because they fit better, just as good sound and can control what songs are playing, when to pause and when u want the volume lower or higher using the earphones",
            "At first I thought they looked ridiculously stupid. But they've definitely grown on me. I think it's one of those new trends that takes a while to catch on, but eventually after seeing them enough they look normal to me.\n\nThat being said, you really have to commend apple on how recognisable they are. It's all part of their marketing brand, but there aren't a single other earphone that I recognise from all angles",
            "I have a pair and before you assume people leave them in as a fashion statement, they are so easily left in. I can stop listening to something then 2 hours later remember I have my AirPods in because I\u2019ve just forgotten they\u2019re there because I can\u2019t feel them.",

            "The interesting part is many people seem to think that AirPods are the only decent quality wireless earbuds on the market, as they don't think to search Amazon for other options when buying. There's also the tendency for people to assume that the ridiculous extra cost is worth it for an Apple product.\n\nI bought some $40 wireless earbuds off Amazon two years ago that sound great, have way better battery life than AirPods, and don't have the big white sticks coming out of my ears. There are hundreds of great options out there, so the overpriced AirPods do seem a bit like an Apple Fashion Statement (or sign that you maybe didn't do research when buying earbuds).",

The batteries they use cannot be thrown out, as they are HIGHLY combustible and a big fire hazzard in garbage trucks. Add to that, those same batteries don't actually breakdown over time when thrown out, causing umpteen other environmental issues.\n\nIf you consider all that on top of the fact that the sound technology isn't really all that impressive compared to less expensive options with more advanced technology on the market, and really the look of them is the least of their problems. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nThey're trying to convince people they aren't giving charges with their phones, to help the environment, meanwhile they're peddling tiny environmental disasters like candy.

            "There is so much happening here, and each probably falls into its own issue, e.g. adult virgin, saving yourself for marriage, free will over one's body, not being into casual sex, bullying, and it's all compounded by the term \"weird\", which is so subjective.\n\nBut, focusing narrowly on \"saving yourself for marriage\" and \"nothing wrong with you\", I have to disagree. Saving oneself for marriage is a terrible idea. Romantic relationships almost always entail sex, and saving ones self implies that the marriage will involve sex. (I'm setting aside people who are asexual and are virgins when married because they never intend on having sex.) Going into a sexual relationship without understanding (a) what you want sexually and (b) what the other person wants sexually, which is always the case because a new partner always brings out quirks in what you already thought you wanted and is compounded if they are a virgin as well, and then committing to only that person sexually for the rest of your life is a idealistic mistake.\n\nCan it work? Statistically, sure. You could have happened to pick any of the people that you're compatible with. Are you going to end up with someone that's fine but whose interests don't involve with you? Maybe. Will you find someone who is into completely different things and who you have no sexual compatibility with? Maybe. It would be idealistic to assume the first and ignore the latter.\n\nSexual preference doesn't just work itself out. It's not like, your first is your preference or becomes your preference. Over time, your interests will settle-ish. But, it's your life and your happiness. I'm not your parent and don't care at all what you or anyone does. But, I sincerely ask that you think about the consequences and possible outcomes to make sure you're really doing what's best.",

It\u2019s so hard to keep a guy around in this day and age once they know I\u2019m a virgin, which sucks. It\u2019s a conversation I like to have relatively early on because in the interest of full disclosure and honesty, I feel it\u2019s something they need to know. It\u2019s not like I put it on dating profiles or tell them first thing but if I\u2019ve been talking to a guy for long enough then i\u2019ll casually bring it up. \n\nI\u2019ve had guys on dating apps immediately stop talking to me or think there\u2019s something wrong with me. The most common reaction is, \u201cWhat?! How is a woman like you still a virgin?!\u201d And while it\u2019s admittedly flattering that they think I\u2019m attractive enough to fuck or that I at least should have been fucked before, it makes me feel like I messed up in the past or something like I missed my opportunity. Or the guys that say they don\u2019t think we\u2019d be sexually compatible because they\u2019re really experienced which is like...you know you can help me learn and teach me right? I even had a guy several years ago tell me that he\u2019d never heard of someone being 23 and still a virgin (bro what??) then proceeded to practically treat me like I was broken, give me advice on how to get a date/get laid, he even propositioned me at the end of the conversation and got offended when I said no. \n\nHonestly, all I want is a guy to sit down and listen to me talk about it without judging me for what should or should not have happened at this point in my life as well as give me some reassurance that he\u2019s there whether it happens sooner or later and have the patience to actually walk with me through that process.

Casual sex can be such a draining experience when you are sitting there the day after with no sense of emotional fulfilment.\n\nBUT, I definitely disagree on the idea of saving it for marriage.\n\nMarriage is a legal/religious/societal bonding of two people. It is really hard to reverse or erase. It is foolish to wait until after a marriage to see if you are sexually compatible.\n\nAnd sexual compatibility is a huge part of a relationship. Just as with casual sex, if the emotional and the sexual aren't both clicking you are going to be in a dead end.\n\nI think the best model is to see sex as a progression towards marriage (or some other form of commitment) where both partners have communicated their intent to work towards it.\n\nReligious people saving themselves for marriage purely on the idea that sex isn't kosher until the vows are asking for big trouble.

If you don't explore before a serious relationship, you are stuck with what you get, which can cause resentment and a feeling of missing out. Maybe you are lucky and end up gelling sexually with your life partner, but I wouldn't take that chance, the same way I would not want to commit to someone I have never lived with, as the way we like to keep house may differ. The same way I don't decide what my favorite ice cream is before trying a bunch of different flavors and seeing what flavor profiles I enjoy.\n\nI have experienced marriage and sex both ways, from a virgin and an experienced frame of reference. I grew up in a religious family, got married young and lost my virginity to my first spouse, 10 years later was divorced and got married again after I spent some time dating and having sex with many different partners. My first wife only liked penetrative sex, no matter how gentle I was with my tongue, oral was too intense for her. I had that unfulfilled craving the whole marriage. Even though I was a virgin before, as we experimented with each other, I discovered I REALLY LIKE going down on a woman. Because both of us were virgins, neither of us knew this particular preference beforehand. I also really like fingering a woman, and I like having my asshole fingered as well. It takes sex to a whole new level for me. After I was divorced, I dated women who don't like these things. I didn't take those relationships further, because now I know I really like them and will miss them if they aren't part of my sex life. \n\nI am now married to a woman who is down for all of these things and I love our sex life. There are other aspects of the relationship, and certainly there are challenges and difficulties, but when we have sex things are great. We both know what our preferences are and were able to discuss them and try each other out before we committed to each other. \n\nIf you explore and resolve as many possible points of contention before you commit to someone, i.e. sexual preferences, financial preferences, living arrangements, housekeeping styles, etc. then you are more likely to have a successful relationship.",

I clearly knew who a lot were because I never saw them dating or socializing but it wasn't a big deal.  Sex was never a race for me so I didn't feel like it should have been for anyone else.  A chunk of it was because most of us had known each other since we got into school.  Our schools were structured by \"zones\" that were based on your home's location.

She explained that she never dated a single guy until college.  It was obvious she was viewed as one of the prettiest girls so guys didn't have the thought of even wanting to face that rejection.  She went through college as a virgin because she was attracting the wrong guys.  She just wasn't interested then but had dated some by then.\n\nPeople just need to be themselves.

How about stop judging people's sex life",

            "Do whatever you want! Just don't build sex up to be this huge deal. It's not. Losing one's virginity is something people stress out over way too much. It becomes all about expectations and trying to live up to them and that just sucks and makes sex not very fun.  Like, if you've never held a saw and a hammer before, don't set yourself the task of building the perfect wardrobe as your first DIY job!",
            "I respect you for sticking to your own values/ideas. I think some people tend to become defensive when they face someone who chooses to abstain from sex because some people who do that tend to also judge people who do have sex. Religion for instance has for a long time, and some still do, judged people who have pre marrital sex. According to some religions, sex for pleasure is in itself a bad thing, especially for women.\n\nSo since society and religion for a long time stigmatized sex, its easy to associate abstinence with moral judgment against those who dont practice abstinence. Lashing out against those who chooses to not have sex can be a sort of defensive mechanism to protect themselves against feeling morally devalued. \n\nIm not saying this is the reason for everyone, or even most, of those who tease or bully virgins. But I do believe some people take it as a person attack or judgement on their own morality when they meet someone who chooses abstinence. Perhaps especially for those who take pride in how much sex they have",

At some point also made me question myself if I was asexual (which there is nothing wrong and I\u2019m not). Now I don\u2019t give much f about it but the fact that people feel entitled to speak to you about your sexual life like it defines all of you, whether you sleep with someone, many or no one bothers me heavily. \n\nAt the end of the day only I know the path I took to this day and I\u2019m cool with it.",
            "Honestly we need to get rid of the concept of virginity, it does nothing but harm people, men, women, NBs, everyone is either shamed for still being a virgin or for not being one. As someone who is ace and has no plan to ever have intercourse, I've had the \"you will when you get married cause that's gods way\" all the way to \"once we get started you'll change your mind\" the latter was definitely from someone you wouldn't want to be alone with.

And I can't say I regret it because I've got a boyfriend who loves and respects me and totally let me have control over the boundaries I am comfortable with and never pushes me. But it's not necessarily something you should really push yourself to check mark off the list and I feel sad for everyone judging each other regarding this specific topic for both guys and girls. Girls get called whores and impure for not having their virginity, and guys get made fun of for not losing it fast enough and vice versa.

If you wait for after the marriage with sex, you might find yourself with a person that wants to have sex in a way that's not enjoyable for you and vice versa. Then it takes a lot of work to find a middle ground and even after that, some of it might feel more like a chore than a pleasure. I've been in a situation like that and thankfully am not anymore.\n\nThat said I think there is nothing wrong with you at all. I'd just like you to make an informed decision.

Sorry, but I disagree.\n\n\n\nIt's a well known fact that there are over 400,000 children in foster care, and in 2017 alone over 100,000 infants under 3 entered the system.\nI think it's completely entitled and self-absorbed to think that somehow your miracle baby is worth more or deserves more love than any one of those infants. \n\n\n\nI know adoption can be hard, and that it should be made easier for the sake of children finding good homes, but you can't tell me adopting is harder than 4 rounds of IVF and multiple miscarriages. I've seen friends go through that mess and at the end they are different people.\n\n\n\n\nTldr: adoption may not be easy, but it's far better than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to perpetuate your genes.",

            "Adoption is complicated as fuck.\n\nWhere I live, adopting in your own country has an average wait time of 7-10 years. Meaning it could also be longer.\n\nAdopting outside of your country is insanely expensive. Plus, you have to travel to the place you want to adopt for weeks.\n\nAlso, depending on where you live, you are restricted on adoption according to your religion, marital status, or sexual orientation. Sometimes single people can't adopt, sometimes people have to be married and you're not ( keep in mind that in some countries marriage is less prevalent), sometimes you have to be married for X years, sometimes you can only adopt a kid between x and x years old, etc.  \n\n\nOn top of that, add that many adopted kids have big issues that not everyone is equiped to deal with.",
            "One of the misconceptions about adoption is that theres this plethora of infants being born, given up for adoption, and then just end up in the foster care system.  This could not be farther from the truth.  \n\nWhat happens in reality is that most of these kids in foster care were raised by single moms, almost always from abusive households with tons of substance abuse issues, and put in the foster care system as a result.  Occasionally, these are otherwise normal kids who could do well with redirecting.  Unfortunately, many of these kids have already been abused/neglected, have tons of destructive tendencies, and stay in the foster care system.\n\nWhich is why you have the disparity of the older kids stuck in the system, while adoption agencies charge people numbers in the 10's of thousands of dollars to adopt a newborn infant.  To be clear, it is through no fault of the foster kids that this happens, but there is NOT an abundance of \"clean slate\" babies that people can just scoop up and bring home.",
            "A good friend of mine has been trying to adopt for many years. In order to be considered more seriously, he and his wife agreed to foster children.\n\nThey've had six kids that they thought they would be able to adopt. However, their birth parents have been able to either get them back or they've been shuffled to a different family for other reasons. They're still trying, but it's incredibly emotionally taxing. They're raising kids for six months in the hopes that they'll be able to raise a kid for good, and then a few months later they have to start over. It's awful.\n\nThey were finally able to adopt a child of their own last year, but they're still fostering in the hopes of being able to adopt another one. (and, of course, out of the goodness of their hearts.) As someone who wants kids one day but might not be able to conceive, their story both inspires me and scares the shit out of me. I'm terrified of having to go through that kind of heartbreak over and over.\n\nThere's no such thing as \"just adopt.\"\n\nEdit: this blew up.\n\nI've gotten a lot of questions but there's not much I'd really be comfortable clarifying, since this isn't my story. However, a few things:\n\nWe live in America, but he's doing this through a private program that works with families in the area. I don't know much about how that program is functionally different than being subject to public adoption laws, but I do know that at least two of the kids have had special needs, so the process is a bit different there. \n\nA few people have responded saying that they find this story to be less inspiring than I do, because of the ulterior motive behind the fostering. And, I guess I can see why that may make people uncomfortable, but I simply can't agree. For one, I know this person, and I know that he puts the well-being of the children first and foremost. For another, some of these stories have ended with the children being returned to happy and improved families, and others have returned to families that haven't done so well. Below comments have highlighted examples of ways this can go wrong. Of course it's a good thing when a family can really improve the situation for the kids and grow into something it wasn't before, but the fact is that that doesn't happen every time. Finally, I can't criticize a family willing to foster children in need, provide them with clothes, food, love, and a safe home, simply because their motives differ slightly from the ideal. This is an arrangement they have made with the foster program - this is something the foster program has told them they need to do to prove themselves worthy parents to adopt. The alternative is for there to be one less house available to foster children in that county, or perhaps, a different house that offers worse conditions. \n\nAnd finally, no, they don't have enough money to just buy a child.",
            "I disagree. \nI work with foster children. \n\nDo NOT foster children if your entire reason for fostering is to adopt. The entire goal of foster care is reunification with biological parents, and children will ALWAYS be placed with family first, if family is safe to do so. This is painful for you and for the children, especially if the children realize that you want to keep them in their family forever. If biological parents or biological family are decided by the courts to be safe, it does not matter what the foster parent says or wants. \nIf you do foster, please make sure you are listed as \u201cADOPT ONLY\u201d. That way, only children who are adoptable will be placed with you. \n\nDo NOT adopt children if you are not equipped to handle their trauma. Foster to adopt children, even infants, often times have trauma that will be with them for the rest of their lives. Therapy can only get you so far. Infants who have experienced physical abuse will NEVER be able to react the same. It does take a very special kind of person to be able to handle the kind of reactivity that comes with physical abuse from such young ages. \n\nFoster to adopt children will never have a normal life. They come with baggage and pain and heartbreak. No matter what age they are. \n**Edit to add**: this is NOT to say they have \u201cno shot\u201d at a normal life. They do, it just takes more work and dedication to be able to overcome any barriers. You cannot change their past, but you can shape their futures to be \u201cnormal.\u201d \n\nI wish with all my heart and soul more people would become foster parents. I truly, truly do. But you have to understand what foster to adopt truly entails. Not everyone will be able to handle children\u2019s trauma, and that is okay. These children need safety and stability and more patience than is sometimes humanly possible. Don\u2019t foster to adopt just because you can\u2019t have children. Do it because your heart pulls you towards it. If you are unable to handle these children\u2019s traumas, then you will do more harm than good. If you\u2019re not mentally equipped to offer these children what they need, then let someone else who IS equipped do it. \n\nAdoption is not a viable option for every couple who cannot conceive naturally, because not every couple is going to be able to handle the emotional needs of a child that\u2019s been through what children whose parents lost their rights have. And that\u2019s okay. Adoption is not a viable option for every couple that cannot conceive naturally because some people are shallow and want \u201ctheir bloodline\u201d or whatever. And ya know what? If they couldn\u2019t love the child the same as a biological child, they shouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nEdit to add:\nIt\u2019s been pointed out a couple times in the replies that this comment paints foster children in a negative light. \nThat was not my intention, and I apologize for doing so. \nMy intention here is to highlight why not everyone should \u201cjust adopt\u201d. Not everyone is capable of handling the challenges of foster care. \nThe truths I\u2019ve shared above are the truths in *my experience* with foster care. Many children grow up to be happy and healthy. Please don\u2019t let my comment deter you from foster care or adoption, but please make sure you are prepared in the event of worse case scenario that a child you might take in could be permanently traumatized and often times, in my experience and the wisdom I\u2019ve drawn for others, it is a very long road to help the little human get to a happy, healthy place. \n\nThank you for the awards, I truly don\u2019t deserve them.",
            "Foster kids are ultimately there to be reconnected and given back to their parents. The majority aren\u2019t available for adoption. I\u2019m surprised how many people still don\u2019t know this information.\n\nPlus, the children that people want to adopt are newborns and they\u2019re EXTREMELY in demand, with crazy long waiting lists. It makes sense, since they cannot have kids they want the full experience, to have a kid from the beginning and name them. Instead, the majority of kids available for adoption are older, most likely have special mental or physical needs, may have previous trauma or attachment issues, and there\u2019s no guarantee that once they hit 18 they\u2019ll won\u2019t immediately ditch their family to see their birth parents. (You\u2019ve all seen the Reddit posts.) \nIt\u2019s much more complicated, messy, and more expensive.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the awards! This is probably my top comment :) Glad I could extend my knowledge!",
            "Adoption isn\u2019t the easy thing everyone seems to think it is.",
            "I wanted to adopt after 2 failed IVF treatments. Couldn't afford international or private adoption. Ok, ill just adopt from the foster care system. 12 years and 37 children later with 2 failed attempts, I finally adopted! Yeah, \"just adopt\", it's so easy!",
            "They should also make it easier/less expensive to adopt to go along with this",
            "Adoption rules can be ridiculous. Here myself and my partner can't adopt because I have a child abuser in my immediate family despite me being that persons victim and not speaking to them for over 15 years...\n\nAlso many people want to experience pregnancy and birth not just get handed a baby that they've got no current bond with.\n\nAdoption is good for those who want to adopt",
            "I gotta say i understand both sides...",
            "I am adopted, and my wife and I are now undergoing fertility treatments. Generally I would agree that adoption is a good option (it worked out for me, obviously) but adoption is typically much more expensive and heartwrenching than even a failed IVF run. Adoption costs can run into $40,000 pretty quickly, or more, and they drag on for years. Mine took two years, during that time my adoptive family was in constant worry that I would be taken from them (I was a foster to adoption case), they had to bring me to see my birth mother every week, and they had to contest her claims in court. The details not withstanding, she stood zero chance of retaining custody (not of her own fault) of any of her children but she still fought it and the court still needs to go through its process. \n\nIt isn't like these problems that make adoption expensive are particularly easy to solve. People want infants, they don't want a two year old who has been through the ringer. That is just human nature, the number of real infants (you used, incorrectly, infant to describe 0-3) is many fewer, and the competition is stiff. You still need to give birth parents (assuming they aren't willing) due process, and even if they are willing they can and often change their mind. Just because you end up in foster care for *some time* doesn't mean you wont end up with your birth parents or some part of your birth family, so to give the number of small children in foster care without that context is disingenuous. \n\nAdoption and IVF are simply not equivalent processes, lets not treat them like they are. I have issues with fertility doctors, they are expensive and exaggerate their success rates. They prey on people who have a bit of money who will do whatever it takes, even if it is not objectively rational, to have a baby.",

You make it sound as though there are giant orphanages filled with kids but the reality is that being in foster care does not mean you are available for adoption.  Kids usually land in foster care due to the fact that there are shit parents into drugs and/or crime and they still have rights to their kids for some reason. Again:  just being in foster care does not mean you are available to be adopted.",

            "With how absurdly expensive and invasive the adoption process is i think its absurd to get upset and demand people adopt.

            "This is indeed an unpopular opinion, but also very USA centric. There are many small countries like where I live where there is essentially no domestic adoption due to population size or bureaucracy. There were just 52 adoptions finalised in Ireland in 2017 - that includes domestic AND international adoption.",
            "Adoption is a long, expensive, and often heartbreaking process. This isn't even mentioning that many kids who are adopted have mental health issues, especially if they were not adopted as infants or babies.\n\nI have 8 adopted cousins (not all adopted by the same aunt, lol). I love them, I love spending time with them, but as an adult and I can see how difficult it is and how much harder their parents have to work because of the health issues these children have. People who adopt are incredibly selfless people, but just because you can't have children and want them doesn't mean you are a person who can handle adoption.",
            "So my wife and I had to do IVF. Unfortunately it was literally our only option we could afford. It was 10k vs 45k+ for an adoption. We would have loved to adopt, but it wasn't econically feasible.",

I'd work my entire life simply to have her in our lives.\n\nLife is nothing but a competition, if you're honest about it.  Those who choose to foster and/or adopt are noble for sure, but if they leave no genetic descendants, those traits will be lost and there will be increasingly fewer of those types of people in the future.  This is how Idiocracy begins.",

They're hoping for it to work the first time.",

We had to go through a lot of classes and training, and a lot of other couples were in the room for that. \n\nAlot of the couples were adopting because they wernt able to conceive.

            "Why is it only that people who have trouble conceiving need to adopt? Why not say EVERYONE should adopt instead of have biological children? Infertile folks shouldn\u2019t have to bear the responsibility of adopting just because they have medical issues making natural conception difficult or impossible. \n\nPeople who make statements like yours have no idea about the realities of adoption. They don\u2019t care to learn about the cost (often more expensive than a round of IVF) or the difficulty. They don\u2019t care to learn that ALL adoption comes with trauma (even newborn adoption). They don\u2019t care to learn that the goal of the foster care system is to reunite children with birth parents, not to adopt children out to waiting families. \n\nA child should be adopted because a couple feels educated enough and confident enough to take on the responsibility and unique challenges of raising a child who was adopted. It shouldn\u2019t be a default fallback option for all couples who struggle with infertility. \n\nStatements like yours are hurtful, ignorant, and privileged.",

Costs and paperwork to adopt are similar to \"miracle babies.\". \n\nWhat insurance covers IVF? Because everyone I have talked to and every insurance I have been on doesn't.",
            "I think it\u2019s also worth noting that with adoption, there is a fair chance you\u2019ll be dealing with the birth family in the future. Even if the adoption is closed, many kids search for their birth family later in life and there is always a chance the kid\u2019s introduction will be well-received. This can make for some uncomfortable and awkward to downright hostile situations for the parents who have raised the child. I\u2019m all for adoption, but I\u2019ve seen this happen numerous times.

Adoption is a long, arduous process that can take years for certain people, if it happens at all.  It can cost more money and be more emotionally devastating than IVF.  You have to pass home studies, take classes, pass medical exams, sign loads of forms, and then basically wait until a prospective mother picks you from the hundreds of other families also looking for a baby.  You have to be willing to uproot your life for multiple weeks to fly to whatever part of the country the baby is born in and when you get there, the mother can just change her mind.

It\u2019s up to the couple what they want to do in some cases IVF was less expensive than adoption, this depends on location and current socioeconomic status. I speak on behalf of the couple that tried IVF after being on an adoption waiting list for seven years. My parents were waiting a long time for even one word of a child in need of a home. They paid a lot of fees just to get on a list for a child. They even had applied for fostering and still no children were coming in. Then when their insurance changed in 1991, IVF was still not a high success rate but was now available. I was conceived through IVF and was the only one who survived. Born in 1993. \n\nI see both sides, also my parents weren\u2019t bad off either my father is a lawyer and my mother was a hospitality director for Holiday Inn before that she was a nurse. They passed every check on list and were approved but still waited a long time; there wasn\u2019t any children available. \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t picky either didn\u2019t matter if the child was white/back/Asian/Native or anything as my mom put it they just wanted a family. Eventually IVF was a better option and feasible for them to do, especially after paying so much in fees for adoption and fostering.

We've moved twice since and the others states don't consider it necessary so it is not covered. We are now looking to adopt because we can't afford IVF. I researched adopting through agencies and it seems like a years long waiting process. We're now going through our local human services office, it still seems like a huge waiting process. Plus, you may be able to find a child but there is a chance that child won't be allowed to be adopted, then they get taken from your home and placed in another foster care home.\nEvery lifestyle adds costs to healthcare premiums, I'm pretty sure the CEOs lifestyle adds the most to any insurance premium.

            "I was speaking to a lady last week, she had turned to surrogacy after spending $90,000 on three adoptions; through a reputable agency, and she had no baby to show for it. Each time, after paying all the medical expenses, buying all she needed for a newborn, the birth mom changed her mind and kept the baby. There are no legal protections as far as adopting goes. \n\nI am currently 10w pregnant, with a surrogate baby for an amazing couple. The baby is legally there\u2019s every step of the way. It is not genetically it legally mine in any way shape or form. Their sperm, their egg. They looked into adoption first and were told to \u201cexpect to be scanned\u201d a few times. With our extensive legal contracts there is never any option for me to keep the baby. They\u2019re legally guaranteed to get their baby the second he/she is born. \n\nAs for the adopting through foster care argument, yes it is cheaper, and it\u2019s also a crazy process full of heartbreak. \nI was sitting next to my co-worker when she received the call to pick up a 2 day old baby, born to an addict. We all scrambled to get her a car seat/stroller/bassinet. The mother refused to sign away her rights. Legally they have to give her time to get clean. 18 months. 18months my co-worker had that baby. 18 months she loved him, held him through his withdrawals, did everything for him. After 18 months the mom still wasn\u2019t clean\u2026 but an older aunt showed up from CA to take him. The aunt even admitted she didn\u2019t see it being a long term thing as she was too old to raise kids again, but because she was bio family the baby was handed over. Can you even imagine loving your baby for 18 months and handing him off to a stranger? \nThe next baby they had for about 8 months before a similar thing happened. \nIt\u2019s brutal and anyone going through it is an amazing person, but it is no ones fault if they don\u2019t want to commit to that kind of journey.",
            "My wife and I chose IVF which luckily worked the first round because it was significantly cheaper and easy than adoption. And that's even with years of hormone therapy and surgery to prepare for it.  Insurance didn't pay a single penny except for the birth.",

And while there is nothing wrong with infertile couples wanting to adopt, couples who are against adoption should not be pressured to do so. All that means is children get adopted by reluctant parents who see their adopted kid as a subpar replacement rather than as a genuinely loved and wanted member of the family. \n\nPeople will spend inordinate amounts of money on IVF and fertility treatments because they want a biological child and see adopted children as inferior. I think it's sad that they have such a limited capacity for love and compassion but I don't want innocent adoptive children raised by parents who won't accept them.

            "Adoption is not just some simple alternative. Adoption is HARD, and trying. It can also be extremely expensive, drag out for years, and should never be taken lightly. We adopted my youngest 8 years ago. Wouldn't change a thing. That said, events leading to children in need of adoption are nothing short of traumatic. Trauma manifests itself in so many different ways in these poor little minds and bodies that have no say in their situation. And as much as I wish it were true, love and understanding cannot fix all. It is impossible to be fully prepared to parent a child from trauma. You can take every class, read every study, talk to all the therapists. There is never enough preparedness for the real thing. Yes my child has been affected significantly by their early trauma. There are many issues we have to address daily.  However I know we are so lucky, bc they are amazing! They have overcome so much! I also know we are lucky bc we don't have to worry about our other children. We are not in constant fear for any of their safety, and we do not have to make the heart wrenching difficult decision to place them in a specialized group home. I have friends that are in this boat, and my heart aches for them everyday. Not only does their inner voice constantly torment them wondering where they went wrong, but they also get to hear how they are failures from arm chair ass hats that don't know fuck.  Ideally, yes, if one can't conceive naturally, adoption seems like the obvious 'best choice' .... But the fact is, some people are equipped to be parents,but that doesn't mean they are equipped to be adoptive parents.",

I find it rather insulting to adoptees as well, these children need a home that doesn\u2019t see them as \u201cplan b\u201d and is equipped, ready and willing to meet these children\u2019s every need. It takes more than just wanting to children to be a successful foster or adoptive parent. \n\nInfertility is a very lonely and often silent journey and there is so much stigma surrounding it. I try to be open about my experience to help support other prospective parents going through it\u2026but it\u2019s not easy. My son was born early at 29 weeks and I was documenting his journey but I received on more than one occasion messages that suggested and in some instances outright said that his early birth was proof that I wasn\u2019t meant to carry a child and karma for not choosing to adopt. They came are a time where I was trying to be strong for my son while he was in the NICU and those comments ate at me for so long. I\u2019m not as emotionally vulnerable and fragile now so those type of comments don\u2019t bother me they did then but at the time\u2026it was difficult.",

            "Adoption and fostering children is not the job of the infertile. People should pursue these things because they genuinely want to help out the child in question and not just to bandage a wound. Adoption agencies will even turn people away if they feel a couple has not explored fertility treatments enough. \n\nMy husband and I went through IVF with our own money and it literally only took one embryo transfer to get pregnant. I am 21 weeks along. It was significantly easier than adoption would have been.",
            "All specifics aside, I get the gist of what the OP is saying.\n\nEssentially, we are annoyed of couples that can\u2019t have babies, try so hard and are delusional that they are going to have a baby. And if and when it does happen, it\u2019s automatically a \u201cmiracle\u201d.\nWrong, it\u2019s a statistic and product of perseverance, not a miracle.\n\nI don\u2019t think we should force adoption on people who can\u2019t have kids JUST because there is an abundance of parent-less children.\nIt\u2019s not the infertile couples fault that other people can\u2019t learn to stop reproducing like morons and never decide to conceive when they are actually prepared to do so. \n\nLastly, there are some genes worth perpetuating. But that doesn\u2019t mean every couple has genes worth perpetuating, as much as they think they do. \nHonestly, I would say the majority of people in the US firmly believe their genes are worth perpetuating, and most of them are full of shit and themselves.",

They wanted to sell more flags, and so they needed a reason for people to buy flags. Francis Bellamy and the magazine released a checklist for how to properly commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus's landing which included a flag raising and the Pledge.\n\nAfter the Pledge gained fame, it was almost immediately modified to say \"the flag of the United States of America.\" Originally, it said \"my flag\" but there was a concern about an influx of immigrants to the US and their confusion about the phrase. Later, the words \"under God\" were added. It wasn't a common political phrase before 1940, so, despite Bellamy being a minister, it was not included until a minister in 1954 said we needed the phrase to separate us from the godless Communists.\n\nSo yeah, the pledge was a marketing ploy to sell flags, then to convert immigrants into proper American citizens, and then to promote an us vs them mentality. And now kids are taught to say it in elementary schools, not fully grasping what's being said.\n\nEdit: mistyped 1888 as 1988. Thanks u/frenglish2 and u/BeamerTakesManhattan for pointing that out!",

It is from this viewpoint that I see all forms of patriotic reverence as a type of ritualistic religion no different than Catholicism. I haven\u2019t been a catholic in my mind since the fourth grade but I still get the douche chills every time I go to a sporting event and hear the announcer say \u201cplease rise for the national anthem\u201d or some version of this.

Our problem is that people all over the world have obeyed the dictates of leaders\u2026and millions have been killed because of this obedience\u2026Our problem is that people are obedient all over the world in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity, and war, and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves\u2026 and the grand thieves are running the country. That\u2019s our problem.\u201d\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance is about ensuring obedience.  That's the fundamental problem.   As some of the defensive comments below just prove, it's about making people have blind faith in authority.  A healthy society would nurture critical thinkers, independent citizens, people who use their minds to hold people in power accountable.  Not people who \"pledge allegiance\" like mindless drones every single day.  They want to train kids to become complacent, to have a sort of mindset where they accept decisions from above. \n\nThe extreme worship of symbols is a big component of all authoritarian systems.

It\u2019s not the propaganda you should be afraid of, it\u2019s the human proclivity to consume propaganda; Moreover, many of the thoughtforms you think that propaganda is the master of are simply inclinations of human nature. In conclusion, it\u2019s not the idolized or the icon - it\u2019s the idolatry and the icon worship that you mean to attack.\n\nPeople will have blind respect for authority regardless of the propaganda implemented to gently massage the blind respect to the forefront of the biological beings concerns. The reason we all have that inclination is because our conscious experience is dominated by the ego. The ego either requires respect/worship for itself or it needs to respect/worship/align itself to what it perceives as a greater, albeit self-similar ego. Also, people will forfeit their individual sovereignty for someone else\u2019s if it means the RESPONSIBILITY or ACCOUNTABILITY for the BIG DECISIONS falls squarely on someone else\u2019s shoulders. \n\nYou can take offense to this if you want, if you blindly respect the authority of your own ego, but are you sure you understand the exact extent of power that propaganda has versus the arbitrarity that people exercise in their daily lives? The subconscious drives that propaganda plays like a fiddle? \n\nI don\u2019t think you understand the biological being enough if you\u2019re making narrow assumptions about a single piece of propaganda and it\u2019s absolute efficacy in allowing people to accept the ideas of genocide, slavery or imperialism. I mean, even if we analyze the Pledge of Allegiance, it\u2019s a rather simple set of slogans that speak of bare loyalty to a country. If bare loyalty to a country/principal/ideology alone is enough to generate your conclusions, then that strengthens my argument moreso that again it\u2019s the inclination in human nature that is the bigger culprit. \n\nI think there\u2019s other pieces of propaganda plus the inclinations of human nature itself that would have to be added to the total picture to reach the conclusion you are pushing.",
