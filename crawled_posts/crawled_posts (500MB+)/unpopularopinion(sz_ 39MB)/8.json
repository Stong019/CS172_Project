            "It stems from the concept that people, especially women, are only valuable when they are young. When women age, they lose attractiveness and value in society. It's why people, especially women, spend billions to try to look younger. We all want to stay relevant and wanted. Saying how old you are can go against that.",
            "This really doesn't apply to girls who clearly look young (and by young I mean teenager to early 20s). It almost entirely applies to women who are older, and it's because society tells us that women lose value when they age (which is absolutely not true). But because society tells women this, women are afraid to look old and have people know they are old. Not all women are like this, of course, and it's something that seems to be phasing out among women as the next generation begins reaching that age.",
            "The general rule is that you shouldn\u2019t ask an older woman her age, not someone who is young and possibly not legal.",
            "I recently did the same thing and innocently asked someone how old they were on their birthday, I immediately apologised, she said no offence was taken, she was 40 and already had kids. \n\nSo I think for many ladies the question is about being in the time frame to have children, which is personal and very sensitive. \n\nYou could also throw in the expectations to look young and beautiful. I\u2019m mid 30\u2019s now, I see a lot of girls my age posting profile pictures with heavy filters to make them look younger. \n\nSame for guys too, there\u2019s some vanity but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re pressured in the same way by society to look attractive and young.",
            "I agree, but i also have an unpopular opinion:\nSome posts on this sub are more only 50% unpopular. While your opinion is unpopular with some women, it is popular with some men",
            "From my experience it's mostly the older generations who are offended by that. I don't know (personally) anyone under the age of 30-35 who is offended by that",
            "I don\u2019t care if people know my age. It\u2019s just a number.\n\nMy mom though, it\u2019s a different story. I\u2019m 33 and when I turned 30 she said \u201cwe\u2019ll just tell everyone you\u2019re 29. That will make me seem younger.\u201d She hates tell people her age, but she doesn\u2019t look her age. She looks younger. She\u2019s 50 and looks like she could be in her early 40s",
            "In my experience it all depends on the context of how the question is asked. If you ask someone\u2019s age when it is inappropriate and irrelevant to the events/conversation currently taking place then it will be perceived negatively. If you ask a woman (or anyone for that matter) their age when it directly relates to the situation then you will not have any issues (your question of asking someone\u2019s age will likely not be perceived negatively). \n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is that asking someone\u2019s age should come as natural as asking any question. Questions that are asked inappropriately or poorly timed are almost always seen as though that person has an ulterior motive. It is about the timing of questions that affect how they\u2019re perceived.",
            "I agree with you.  It should not be considered \u201crude.\u201d  By saying it\u2019s rude, we are perpetuating the sad myth that older women can\u2019t have good lives and have no value.  No one\u2014most of all women\u2014should hold that belief. \n\nIt is a very western idea that people in general, especially women, lose value as they age.  Where I come from originally, people gain value as they age because they have more experience and wisdom, both things which generally scale with years on this planet.  People also tend to have more wealth as they age because they\u2019ve accumulated it over years, so they are objectively valuable to the economy.  So actually the only reason I can think of for youth being prized and valued has to do with sexualization and ideas that the youthful are more sexually attractive, which is used in marketing.  These ideas are also somewhat dark and not universally true, though by saying and acting like they are, we make them true as a culture, and I think that is highly unfortunate for a variety of reasons.\n\nHowever, if you ask a woman her age with the intent to \u201csort\u201d her into a valuable / not valuable bucket or otherwise try to ascertain her value in some twisted way, you are being rude.  It\u2019s not so much the question as the intent behind it and the context in which the question is couched, which may reflect that intent.",
            "Older generations (unlike us broke-ass millenials) generally cared about having children, and there is a cutoff age for that, which is where \"value\" comes from. Pretty sure women's good looks in their 20s is heavily influenced by the fact that the prime time for having children is asap. \n\nIt's stupid to think a woman loses value because of appearance. It's also ignorant to think it doesn't matter, especially if you're someone looking to have your own kid in the future.",

            "I agree there is nothing wrong. \n\nFor me.people just always assume my age, though xD They assume I'm between 16-18 when I'm 22.",
            "My mother in law is a real southern bell- she gets FURIOUS if she gets a clue that anyone knows how old she is. Once a friend of ours sent her a card for her 85th birthday and she didn\u2019t talk to my husband for a week. She just turned 90- I hope I am in as good of shape when I\u2019m 90, mentally and physically.",
            "In my experience, this has been the complete opposite. I'd ask men their age (bc they obviously weren't teenagers) and they'd get all sketchy about it.\n\nLike okay, predator.",
            "In my opinion if you feel the need to ask me about my age for \u201clegalities\u201d maybe you just shouldn\u2019t be talking to me. I\u2019m 20 but I look 16 or 17 and I will tell you that\u2019s how old I am if I think you\u2019re being a creep",

            "I\u2019m 17. The legal age of consent in the uk is 16. Even if a girl is a day under 16 and I have relations with her, I would be a criminal. It isn\u2019t rude. It\u2019s literally one of the first things you should know about someone when you meet them.",

            "I see a lot of people commenting is because \"beauty is the most important thing for women in this society and asking how old is her is like saying how much are you worth\"\n\nCome on, I've never seen nobody think about women that way any more because now we know women can work the same jobs as men and can even do it better also if it's the case the woman have more experience or academic preparation, We are no longer in the past where women would just cook, have children and clean the house...",
            "The grief I get for asking their weight! Jeeeeez!",
            "Epstein never asked.",
            "Ego.\n\nI agree with you OP, in that it\u2019s a social construct regarding age, and even more so with weight. \n\nBut yes, why is it considered taboo to ask a person\u2019s age or weight? \nBecause few people are comfortable with their reality, so they expect everyone else to sidestep their own elephant in the room.\nThe irony is that it\u2019s a balloon animal, and it would just deflate if we stopped pumping air into it.",
            "Goes for anyone but depends on how it\u2019s asked. \n\nSay if you\u2019re talking about significant world events from your lifetime, and you mention you were in school during (idk) 9/11 and someone says \u201coh you were at school then? Me too! What school did you go to, we must be about the same age\u201d that\u2019s fine. \n\nThere was also a girl I knew, I thought she was like 29...until she mentioned her 16 year old son...I then was like \u201csorry, what....you have a 16 year old?,\u201d turns out she\u2019s 36. \n\nI think those are fine but if you just ask someone you barely know with no context...it\u2019s maybe not rude but it\u2019s a bit unnecessary as it has no bearing on the convo",
            "If its ok to ask a male his age but not a female isn't that sexist?",
            "Because it's a social custom - which doesn't have to be rational and in fact often isn't.\n\nThat's what being in a community of people is, acknowledging some irrational customs and just going with it. It's not going to cause you undue stress to not ask people about their age.",

            "It is so weird because by telling people it's rude to ask a woman's age they're just further instilling the stigma of old age",
            "It shouldn't be rude to ask a women if it isn't rude to ask a man. Either way, it should depend on the context of the conversation preceding to the question. If their age is relevant to the conversation, ie they mentioned the time they grew up in, then it's not rude. If it sounds like you're going to judge someone based on their age, for example someone has just said they're a virgin, asking for their age could seem like you're going to judge them for not having sex by that age.",
            "I worked at a liquor store for a while, and our policy was ID *everyone*.  A little extreme, perhaps, but a useful shortcut such that I didn't have to constantly estimate ages for customers, and lose my job if I get it wrong.\n\nEven so, I still hated asking women of a certain age group because half the time they bitched \"don't I LOOK 25??!!?!\" (25 being the local age threshold recommended to ID customers) And the other half of the time bitching \"how dare you imply I'm older than 25!!!?!?!\"\n\nKaren, I don't fucking care if your internal measure of your own self worth is based on you being older or younger than your actual age, I'm just here to sell you your wine.",
            "It depends obviously on the situation. However, it's important to remember that wanting to know something about someone doesn't mean you get to know it. We have a really big problem with this in our culture. We feel entitled to always have our curiosity satisfied. I'm thinking of all the inappropriate questions that pregnant people get asked, or trans people. Women get asked random questions a lot by people who don't seem to consider whether the question is something she might not want to talk about. \n\nPeople are in control of their own information. It's always possible to imagine a situation where you need to know someone's age or other personal information. But the bottom line is that if you don't need to know you might not get to know. Just because you can't think of a reason not to answer a question doesn't mean that the question has to be answered. No is a complete sentence.",
            "You can ask a girl as it could be a legal issue LOL but don't ask old ladies",
            "Well, here's the thing. You're asking for a reason. Something caused you to ask. That is really why someone might feel uncomfortable...not the question itself, but the unanswered/unspoken *why* you'd ask or want to know. \n\nWhat does that number tell you, when ideally it's just a number? \n\nAlso, there's an obvious personal agenda implied when you ask a girl for legality purposes. If you aren't clearly in a sexual situation it's creepy. She might also feel intellectually belittled to be asked, like you're not interacting as equals.",

If you\u2019re worried about statutory rape issues, maybe find another person to play with.  Other than these two areas, the age of another person is simply none of your business.  Same thing with weight, race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.  \n\nJust because you want to know something personal about another person doesn\u2019t mean you have a right to know.  These are very intimate details that can be used against a person.  If those details are volunteered to you, you must respect that person\u2019s privacy and not go around telling others that information.  It\u2019s not *your* information to share, and it\u2019s certainly not *public* information.\n\nThe frustrating thing from my perspective is that people often think they have a right to women\u2019s personal details that they would never ask of a man.  Would you ask a man his age?  *Really*??\n\nSecond, there are still very clear systemic agist practices against women at work in the world - older women are less likely to get hired for jobs; they are let go from employment sooner than men of the same age are; they are not asked to lead or sit on boards anywhere near as much as men of the same age.  They are paid less, and they earn smaller pensions.  They aren\u2019t given voices on tv, film or other visual arts.  In situations where the woman is looking after herself financially all by herself, she would be shooting herself in the foot financially to solidify your awareness about her actual age.\n\nThirdly, older women have a harder time finding relationships. Men simply do not want to date younger women. And as my mother once said to me... the only reasons older men want to date older women is to get a free cook, nurse or maid....\n\nLastly, older women become invisible to others, so we tend to not speak about age to minimize that tendency.  Next time you\u2019re walking down the street, look carefully at the crowd. Your eyes are naturally drawn to the young people, then older men, and *maybe* you\u2019ll see the older women.... maybe not.  \n\nWould you date that \u201colder\u201d woman if you knew **exactly** how old she really was?\n\nYes, you can tell roughly what age bracket I\u2019m in if you\u2019re looking at me.  But you can\u2019t tell *exactly* how old I am, and your knowledge of my actual age will (like it or not) trigger some beliefs in you about my value and capabilities, and how you should interact with me.  I don\u2019t need or want you bringing those prejudices to our interactions.\n\nThink of it like Reddit... you don\u2019t need my personal details to have a fun or interesting conversation with me or any other person, but the minute you find out my actual age (or gender/weight/skin or eye colour), you wouldn\u2019t engage with me the same way. We would both lose out then!",

If I vibe with someone I vibe, and the older (slash further from the early 20s I get) the less relevant it seems to ask for someone\u2019s age for me. I personally hate when people ask for my age (since it\u2019s mostly just coworkers/clients) because it serves no purpose and often times (especially as a woman) hurts my business because it\u2019s like, \u201cOh wow I didn\u2019t know you were *that* young (read, you\u2019re too inexperienced for my business)\u201d or, \u201cOh wow I didn\u2019t think you were *that* old (read, for some reason this is a bad thing and I\u2019m making it awkward now).\u201d\n\nI think if people care so much about age, it should just be a normal exchange. However, people make age such an uncomfortable topic. Nothing is more awkward than having someone joking say, \u201cOh wow this is Selene\u2019s 21st birthday!\u201d When the woman is clearly in her 50s. Why are we so obsessed with youth? Pretending it\u2019s someones\u2019s 21st birthday isn\u2019t going to magically stop it being their 31st, 41st, or 51st birthday.\n\nIt\u2019s also a little bit insidious because men are shamed for looking too young for their age and women are congratulated for looking younger than their age. When someone tells you their age, for some reason it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d to comment on their appearance. To me it\u2019s similar to body weight/height. Imagine if we walked around asking people how tall they are/how much they weigh and then commenting on it when all of these measurements are sort of irrelevant anyway. Someone could be 5\u20196\u201d, weigh 150 pounds, and be 28 years old yet \u201clook taller, slimmer/more in shape, and younger\u201d than those numbers would imply and vice versa.\n\nI guess why people get so offended is the fact that these numbers mostly change nothing about the person and in Western society, age often has a negative impact on people.",

Asked her if she wants to file harassment charges against me. She freaking blew up at him! Told him that she isn't some hot house flower and asked if the manager would've brought two men in the office accusing of harassment with the same joke. She pointed out that she comes to work and expects to be treated the same as everyone else and that it was him who should be taking harassment classes.  \nShe is truly one of my best friends.

            "Hollywood doesn't do this stuff because they care about black or gay people. It's because in the US, black and gay people are exploited politically, socially, economically via media and academia.\n\nBlack Americans make up like 13% of the US population. Gay people make up like 4% of the US population roughly. The target demographic they're actually going after is the much larger left leaning ally demographic who support black & gay people.\n\nIn the 70s, this stuff was Blaxploitation. It went away but was revived when they imposed Political Correctness in the 90s.\n\nThey use the visibility of the black & gay demographics to pander to left leaning allies. It's why the US isn't integrated and why gay people are forced to be part of the LGBTQ community instead of just being individual equal Americans.\n\nIt's also a form of culture shaping. Hollywood pushes the obviously gay stereotypes as a way to sell up the value that gay people have to conform to the stupid social trends that get pumped out.",

            "As a member of the LGBT+ community myself I see where you're coming from. It gets frustrating when writers or producers just want to cash in and look fake woke or try to spice up their character roster by just throwing in a gay character now. \n\nBut I think that the meat of the complaint is actually just about shitty writing as opposed to there being gay characters; I wouldn't even have an issue if there weren't so many poorly written ones. A character with a well fleshed out story and background wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb, but we can easily spot a character who is 1D and obvious filler for plot service.\n\nThe issue here isn't that there is a problem with gay characters in a show, it is about how well or poorly they are written and integrated.\n\nThese days weaker writers figure simply claiming a character is LGBT+ is enough without doing anything to flesh out the character beyond that. They did the same thing with villains in films for American characters after WW2 being Japanese or German; it was an easy cop out to justify why the audience should dislike them without giving the character anything outside being a villain who dislikes the US. Plot service. \n\nThere was also a popular trend with POC not getting many serious opportunities for credible roles in Hollywood; there were and even in some cases still are numerous extremely benign, 1D and offensively stereotypical roles such as \"the funny Asian\", or \"the black friend\" -- again, plot service. \n\nThe problem with a lot of shows and films lately is, the company behind them just wants to tick a diversity box and get a cash grab. There is no care for story telling or character development in a cash grab, hence shitty story lines.\n\nFurthermore there are a plethora of straight poorly written characters in shows who are just stuffed in there to fill some plot hole or gimmick who add no substance (like those I listed above) but the current trend relies on LGBT+. At the end of the day it is not a straight/gay/poc character issue, it is an issue of a story or character being written poorly.\n\nIf a character or story is written well the story would flow naturally and effortlessly, regardless of their identity. So I believe these kinds of arguments are mostly ones about poor writing, not LGBT+ characters. I agree with you, lately it is a cheap cop out and the writers often show zero commitment in fleshing out a well rounded character and just slap an LGBT+ orientation on someone random to tick a diversity box.",

            "Sincerity mode: How exactly would a gay character enhance a story without their gayness being the primary contribution to the plot? How do you bridge that gap between \"character archetype\"and \"believable human being?\"\n\nMaybe I just don't pay enough attention to the gayness of gay people I know, or something, but I find the tertiary gay characters in media to be the most believable - because there's nothing inherently special or interesting about being gay. Or a woman. Or any particular race. So when shows and movies draw pointed attention to these features, it always seems to come across as phony and pandering to me.",
            "Hey, gay characters are allowed to exist without explicit purpose to the plot. Just like there are many straight characters / friends to the protagonist that exist without doing anything. They don't have to HAVE to have their own story - friends in many TV shows exist for the sole purpose of being the moral soundboard for the main character. \n\nOne of the best gay representations in a show is probably Eric from Sex Education. There's a comment here that he's a 'token gay character', but goddamn has anyone actually SEEN the show? His narrative is not only extremely important, but also highlights the side of romantic conflicts from a same-sex perspective which is EXTREMELY refreshing. \n\nIf you think that gay characters aren't necessary and are shoehorned in, I'm sorry that you think LGBT people aren't necessary in real life, I really am. The only reason you notice 'unecessary gay drama' is because they're not straight.",

Hell, he is the guy who inspired the character of Kaworu in Evangelion as far as rumors go lol) but there is an EXTREME difference between something like this series and your average Netflix shtick handle it.\n\nAnd anyway, it's not like you cant' write queer characters if the story isn't about them as queer, but you still have to be realistic and not just use them to gain some points with a certain crowd without being actual characters in the story.\n\nA more niche example is VA-11 HALL-A, a visual novel (not japanese, the guys are from Venezuela!) about being a bartender in a cyberpunk world (albeit a pretty light one. There is a country apparently founded by Kanye West lol) and serve customers.In such a context it's only natural that people end up speaking about their personal lives, ramble about their ex and whatever, and as such it's only natural that a certain character ends up being queer.The fact that a certain character is lesbain won't affect the plot, obviously, but it's just part of her character which is otherwise still 3d, just like the manager of the bar isn't less over-the-top just because she is apparently pansexual and doesn't give a fuck about who you are as long as you are cute or the biker that struggles with his newfound identity in an enviroment of macho men.In an inferior story these characters would punch you in the face with their sexuality, go on a tangent about how they are oppressed and yadayadayada, but VA11HALLA is superbly written and all these things appear as the character talks in a natural and simple way, and when they are part of their personal problems and issues they are touched with style and realism: even in 207X someone will be homophobic, but this doesn't mean that the character who faced issues due to this will be completely defined by only that event.\n\nThere is a good way to do something and a bad one.

Other minority characters are also embraced and included in the show naturally, without associating them with any stereotypes. I absolutely love this show and would definitely recommend it!!!",

It's called hyper awareness. this increased awareness is allowing us to know about things we never could have known about before, so it might not be that the world is worse now than before, it just seems like it thanks to our focus on sharing bad stories. And you could also argue that even though things seem more grim, it does not mean things are or aren't any grimmer than before, it's just what comes to our attention that determines this balance in our minds.\n\nBut if we compare general human suffering throughout history to now, you could find plenty of evidence for massive human suffering today that didn't necessarily exist in previous times of peace and prosperity. For a few examples, compare how many people can buy a home today throughout the last 100 years, or Compare how many people live in poverty throughout the last 100 years. You can measure suffering if many different ways, if we ignore current horrific events like the Hong Kong protests and wars in Africa to name a couple, you could definitely find evidence that suggest a worsening in the human condition. And you could also find evidence for the betterment of the human condition. It is hard to measure absolutely, and I believe we are better off in some areas and worse in others.",

World news (and to some extent even just national) had much less bearing on daily life for the vast majority of people, because media didn't rely on sensationalism to make money.\n\nNow there are global News companies competing across multiple media formats for the most views and viewer retention. This means every day, sometimes multiple times a day, you're told of the worst things journalists can find happening, and the internet makes this a lot easier.\n\nThen there's timing, no one would argue things now are worse than during the 2 world wars for your average person or anytime before that, but then we largely had peace for a couple of generations in the west comparably. Then suddenly we have modern media and we have a world's worth of shit put Infront of ours faces every day, so it feels like things suddenly got a lot worse and have stayed that way (and are going to get worse as ironically poorer countries become better off and their news gets shared too).\n\nOn paper things have never been better though, viruses being wiped out, cancer survival rates through the roof, child mortality way down, poverty down globally by an incredible amount etc...but that doesn't get views and progresses at a much slower pace than the shitty things that have been happening every day forever and still do. So things seem worse than ever, when they're actually better than ever but the cost of that is global awareness and multiple competing media companies.",

Since then they practically invaded the west, and not only in politics, they took over the entertainment industry, education, most of the media, now even parts of the banking system, and so on, and they use all these things to aggressively push their insanity everywhere. Like, if you told someone 10 years ago that in the near future an outrage mob will get them fired from their job if they objected to the idea that the state should sponsor transvestites (some of them convicted sex criminals) holding \"drag queen story hours\" to kindergarteners they would have thought you're clinically insane and that you should be locked up for your own good.

This was apparently due to the fact that her father had an affair. I mean I don't think she warranted that much hate seeing that she wasn't responsible for the affair and it was rather immature to hold it against her like that.

But instead of finding a compromise with their sister...they kicked their sister out of the car, leaving her to walk the rest of the way home.

If the person gain 10-15 likes for a dumb shit comment they think their idea is valid and keep on posting dumb shit stuff.  \n\n\nIf exist a dislike button, that same person would probably have 10-15 likes and 200-300 dislikes for example. The impact on that person would be devastating and would avoid to post stuff like that in the future or posting at all because of the feeling of shame or humiliation. This would result that Facebook would loose a traffic, it might not be impactful, but if the majority of people post dumb shit stuff and get downvoted to oblivion then facebook have issues to generate money and keep the platform popular. \n\nThat's my opinion.  \n\n\nSimilar goes for Youtube, you can't have negative dislikes but only 0 if everybody disagree with you. Reddit won't show how many likes your comment you have unless a certain time have passed to avoid the snowball effect that everybody gives an upvote to a popular comment or dislike to a unpopular comment.",
            "Disagree.  I like Reddit's setup, but it also creates massive hive mindset and suppresses a lot of people true feelings because they are too busy wanting to be liked rather than speak honestly and openly.\n\nAt the very least, you should has a dislike button but it shouldn't affect the post in any way.  I think it would eliminate a lot of the vulture signaling and hive mindset that pervades Reddit.  On other social media outlets, you can disagree with the mainstream and not have your opinion suppressed.  As it should be.  ,",

I think it depends on the scenario/platform.",
            "Wow, this post makes me feel really old. I was using Facebook when there was a dislike button on everything. I remember there being an uproar at the time for this very reason when they removed it(in the UK at least) - spread positivity and no hate and all that. Social media isn't quite as toxic as films like The Social Dilemma will have you believe, but it's still pretty, pretty toxic. Having just a like button and no dislike button is one of those 'we-had-good-intentions' moments which has really backfired because of the biases it causes on attention-grabbing algorithms. I was a social media strategist for a few years until 2018 when I was glad to move to a more fulfilling role. Good post though.\n\nEDIT: appreciate this post isn't directly about Facebook but that's where manipulating human social interaction on the internet became a real profit powerhouse so just adding my 2 cents worth. Or is it 10 cents? I'm British, I'll just give you 10p and be done with it.",
            "I've thought about this for years too when I was heavily using Facebook more. I've decided against it now simply because I prefer discussion more. Like with Reddit, the dislike button count needs to cap at -10, most posts I've ever seen never come back from that so why do they need to be shown going into the negative hundreds, people use the dislike button and it's just empty...so *why* do people feel the comment or post isn't relevant? Choosing not to hit the Like button is already a form of \"I didn't find this interesting/dislike\" so I don't see an actual need for more Dislike buttons.",

My mother, the sweetest woman who is somewhat sheltered, was so excited and said \"Oh WalkerIsTheBest, get my picture with him!\"  So he did his routine, was very entertaining, and as he posed with my mother for the picture leaned in and whispered into my mother's ear \"You better pay me for this picture.\"  It was almost like a threat to her, and in the photo of her and him, he's all Jack Sparrow and posey and my mother looked terrified.  Sullied the entire experience for her.  I had a 5 already prepped and didn't really understand why she looked so scared in the photo until after I gave him the fiver and he briskly exited the scene.  It was so shitty and scummy that even if a friend or family member wanted to entertain the idea, I try my hardest to talk them out of it.  \n\nTL/DR: A Jack Sparrow impersonator intimidated my sweet, naive mother for money and ruined an otherwise fun and wholesome experience.  \n\nGreat post, BTW.

            "I\u2019ll definitely side with this being unpopular. \n\nHere\u2019s my take. I work at a popular tourist attraction that can see tens of thousands of people a day. I don\u2019t personally think you \u201cowe\u201d them a tip if you take a pic or record them. They are in public spaces, them being recorded is bound to happen. I think if you like their performance it would be kind/a good thing to give them a tip. I mean most of them are talented and it\u2019s good to recognize that with a tip or an expression of gratitude. But you don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d them. \n\nOn the other hand I see several of these performers a day. And my absolute LEAST favorite is this one violinist who will completely stop his song and point at whoever is recording him and then point at his tip jar. In that case, I think you\u2019re just being a dick and do not deserve a tip. There are better ways to go about it that all the other performers do.

If someone is taking a video, I would want them to share it online because well, as I said my intention is to share. \n\nHowever I do appreciate your thought and I\u2019ve met many street performers with your mentality to the point where if they see someone is video taping them, they will stop in the middle of the performance and ask them to pay into the tip jar.

Does anyone remember those PSAs where they showed cancer patients with facial deformities and shit? They didn\u2019t suddenly ban cigarettes, they showed the people what it can do to you, banned it in PUBLIC only, and then the rest is up to the individual. I know a lot of people who quit smoking because they became informed through that campaign, the public ban just made it easier for them to quit.\n\nPeople are reading this post wrong, OP isn\u2019t calling for a ban. They\u2019re calling for alcohol to get the exact same treatment as cigarettes. That is not prohibition, that is just putting limits on where you can consume it and informing the public of the long term health effects.\n\nAlso, OP isn\u2019t saying alcohol CAUSES rape and DUIs, they said that alcohol CONTRIBUTES to those. It can and it does and it has.\n\nIf they had an anti drinking campaign as powerful as the anti smoking campaign I think it would make a huge and positive difference in the world.

Nicotine addiction is different. \u201cCasual smokers\u201d are not really a thing in my experience (regardless of who claims they only smoke socially). The people who claim to be \u201ccasual smokers\u201d are either already addicted or will become addicted to nicotine at some point.\n\nAll that aside, people\u2019s actions should be judged on an individual basis. Alcohol WAS outlawed in the U.S. at one point and all it did was create a black market for it. \n\nAlso, cigarette companies (when they were allowed to advertise in the US) targeted younger audiences without relaying the health risks associated with the habit. At least alcohol advertisements have to put the \u201cdrink responsibly\u201d statement in their ads while all alcoholic containers must acknowledge the health risks of consumption.",

            "I watched a childhood friend of mine ruin his life with alcohol, started as a result of a stressful break up when he was around 20-21, started drinking on the lonely weekend nights and it wasn't unusual for him to down 14+ standard drinks on a Saturday night before 10pm while we were playing OSRS or WoW. Him and his ex who were childhood sweat hearts tried to rekindle but he'd be too drunk to drive her to a look out on a Friday night after dinner. Ended up dropping in grades, failed his engineering exams.\n\nI've been teetotal my whole life, my father had drug problems which gave me a very repulsive disposition against substances. To this day I'm still somewhat surprised at how small of a minority I fit into as a non-drinker, especially when I was growing up and entering early adulthood, it's a norm for people to get smashed at every 18th and 21st.\n\nBut I think with all the stress, social anxiety, depression, etc out there many people are semi-reliant on alcohol to enable enjoyment at social gatherings. But it is also a colloquial standard amongst most normal people to drink, especially at parties or occasions. Which means it doesn't really have the grounds for a social movement, as people wouldn't support it, unlike cigarettes, which are a hinderance in their entirety, which don't really offer enjoyment outside of satisfying the addiction, alcohol has a swathe of incentives which deny the negative stigma.\n\nI wish it weren't the case, but I think the deeply ingrained nature of alcohol would likely mean the solution to reducing harmful alcohol usage is solving the problems in which cause the problematic behaviour to begin with which likely entails the betterment in quality of life for the people involved, which is an exponentially complex issue which will likely be hindered by a society which fuels impulsive and consumerist behaviour.",

You can\u2019t ignore your mental health if you start drinking to cover something.\n\nIn America, the main problem is the glamourised nature of drinking, especially binge drinking at high school parties or universities. Movies and other media make it look normal. Being hungover is used for a laugh, and so it\u2019s someone literally puking all over the place because they\u2019re too drunk. However, we don\u2019t teach kids the norms of drinking other than the \u201cyou will get pregnant and you will die\u201d mean girls\u2019 approach. A lot of other cultures have a calm attitude about it, parents let their kid have a bit every now and then, and they understand the effects of it before really \u201cdrinking\u201d for the first time. All too often, kids, teens, and young adults get a hold of alcohol for the first time and don\u2019t understand how it works and think they should drink half a bottle. They get into this frenzy and drink until blackout or someone gets alcohol poisoning. That\u2019s the problem when you make something popular into a taboo for only a certain age range or group. \n\nIt\u2019s like someone popping an opioid or being prescribed adderall. You\u2019re not going to be addicted, and especially not physically addicted, instantly. It\u2019s when you start misusing the medication\u2014taking it too often, doubling the amount, buying it without a prescription, etc.\u2014that you get yourself into a problem. You\u2019re an adult. Behave yourself, hedonist.",
            "I don't think alcohol contributes to rape or assaults. People with anger issues and rapists contribute to assaults and rapes. I know alcohol can change people's mood, but it should be at user discretion to decide whether they are capable of handling themselves on it. Most people I know gain confidence and loosen up with alcohol. The only people I know who 'become' bad people with the addition of alcohol are those who are already assholes.",

If you have a problem with alcohol, you need to have the presence of mind not to drink. You can't just condemn everything that YOU can't deal with. Caffeine gives me a huge buzz and then on my come down I am vile, moody and mean...so I don't have caffeine. Never once has it crossed my mind that because I can't deal with caffeine, it should be condemned for others.",

It just means that people who cause trouble aren't allowed out and those who can get drunk and behave themselves can. \n\nDUIs should have an unlimited suspension, minor offences like public urination or drunk and disorderly should only be a few weeks.

When I was in college it's all the Americans who never learned limits who got super belligerent and suddenly became asshats. All the international students just vibed at all the parties I attended. Perhaps as international students, many of our first experiences with alcohol were hanging out with out parents who taught us about safe consumption. Versus the Americans who were told it was bad until they turned 21 and are surrounded by peers who pressure them into reckless behavior. \n\nI think it has to do with the countries emphasis on alcohol, imo party culture drives alot of the abuse seen in the USA."

It also does not spy on you unlock Chrome. It does however look and behave like Chrome. You can also use Firefox and install uBlock Origin there.\n\nFor the entire system:\n\nIf you are on Android 9 or above, go to Settings > Network and Internet > Advanced > Private DNS and enter dns.adguard.com. Your phone will then use an adguard server to resolve domains that filters ad and tracking domains.\n\nOn older Android versions [Blokada](https://blokada.org/) might work for you. If you notice it having a negative impact on your battery life go to Adblock settings and turn on Smart List.\n\nOn iOS [DNSCloak](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1452162351) can be configured to use a filtering DNS provider as well. Search for 'adguard-dns-doh' and enable it or search for 'blahdns' and select the option closest to you. Make sure to select an ipv4 server (you can use ipv6 additionally, but ipv4 might be needed).

The fall off the monkey bars for a kid means some tears and a scraped knee. At worst MAYBE a broken bone. Make the monkey bars that much higher to be sized for adults and yeah... things get ugly real fast. The chance for injury is super high. \n\nAnd that's assuming the adults are sober.

It was in an old factory, so the inside was exposed brick and steel girders. The main playground was this huge wooden obstacle course that took probably 15 mins to run. It was exhausting, very much like American Ninja Warrior or something.  Multi-rope swings over foampits, army crawls, horizontal rock climbing. And there was other stuff to do in the same building, like a rock wall and tightrope walking, which is impossible. \n\nAnd the place was busy, maybe 100 people.

Success rate was maybe 75% but there would be some super hot occasions where I had to resort to the pin.\n\nOn the other hand, Face ID works every time for me. It got a bit less reliable when face masks started; but my phone got better at unlocking from my masked face and Apple completely resolved with an Apple Watch. Mask mandates are completely lifted in my state, so even the mask issue is zero at this point. \n\nI used Touch ID for 2 phones, Face ID for 2 phones, both are fine.

I think I get what you're saying though, especially with pop culture lyrics because they're so redundant and generally very shallow or materialistic.

I fucking hate watching people try to look impassioned while singing. They\u2019re like bad actors. I much prefer a singer who plays an instrument and just grooves with the music. Obviously there are exceptions, like Freddie Mercury, and usually people who sing and dance make it work (ie. James Brown, Michael Jackson), but I generally hate watching singers perform. \n\nMy favorite is Julian Casablancas of the Strokes since he underplays the performance element so much.

            "I have been sing since I was 5 and I get what you mean. I prefer big orchestral music to sing with and to listen to. Nothing makes me feel more part of a team and simultaneously powerful than singing in a gigantic choir and with a full orchestra. Listening to soloists and even small groups of people performing is not as interesting. I do think that they are only written into symphonies to stroke people\u2019s ego. The majority of music majors want to be the big shot that gets into these chamber ensembles. I\u2019m sure they get paid more there, but I think it is less fun. As someone who grew up singing, I can attest that about a quarter of a the population is full of themselves and will try, and ultimately fail, at starting a music career. Usually those people aren\u2019t even the most talented in the choir too.\n\nAlso as someone who was trained in classical music, most pop singers kinda suck to me. To the average person, they might sound talented, but if you have been training in vocal performance all of your childhood, you start to notice embarrassing issues with famous singers like uncontrollable vibrato, a tendency to be out of tune, or singing in a way that harms the vocal cords. Auto tune is especially ridiculous because it makes it so that literally anyone can sing. I do think that the majority of singers that people pay to see (A.K.A. The popular ones like Taylor swift and Justin Bieber) are literally only famous because they are attractive. People are also into good song writers or good dancers. These are good reasons to be a fan of someone. They could still be honest and call them song writers and dancers primarily rather than singers. They could also partner with someone who could actually sing. This is a bad example because he is a national treasure, but Bob Dylan is a master song writer, but was a crappy singer. He made his songs available though so that good singing but crappy song-writing groups could sing his songs, even at the same time he was performing them.",

            "I like singing if it is done by professional recording artists for a record or in some cases for live concerts. \n\nAlmost all other singing makes me cringe. You have to be one of the best in the world and have the right production quality behind it for me to not be uncomfortable.\n\nLike most live music you here in like a bar or something, I just feel really embarrassed for the singer. The singer never seems to be on par with the rest of the band when they band is good. And if they're all bad it is just a nightmare.\n\nAnd nothing on earth ever made me feel quite so awkward as when classmates in high school would sing the national anthem before a football game or whatever. And I get they might feel the same way about the people playing the sports, and in a lot of ways they'd be right to, but then again the only reason the singer has an audience is because they're leeching off the athletes. Also, as an athlete, if I never played in front of a crow I'd have been fine with it. But I think for the most part singers sing to be heard. \n\nI think musical theatre is usually pretty bad too. That'd be the one exception to the idea of leaving it to the pros. While I recognize someone like Idina Menzel has a great voice, that doesn't change the fact that everything she does feels really corny and over the top. From Wicked, to Frozen, to that godforsaken Geico ad. Something about the people that are drawn to musical theatre, and the way they compose the music just feels so phoney. It feels like a really emotionally inauthentic art form.\n\nAs for total amateurs who know they can't sing just singing along to a song they like or doing karaoke or whatever... also brutal. It can be fun and even I catch myself singing along sometimes but observing it is brutal.",

            "I\u2019m a composer and I can second this to a lesser degree. I\u2019m not a big fan of singing (at least in the pop sense of a solo artist singing under a track), but I understand people really like listening to lyrics and the particular vocal style an artist has. But one thing that always drives me crazy is how you can have professional artists that have an abrasive vocal tone (completely subjective, although many people will agree) and people will say that it sounds beautiful or amazing largely because of the music composed underneath. There needs to be separation of vocal artist from composer or band because the artist or vocalist often didn\u2019t do much or anything for the actual track that they are singing (ie, compose, mix/master, play the actual instruments), but not every artist is like this, so it all kind of depends. But overall, I agree with the sentiment that the vocalist or singer is overrated and takes credit whenever the credit was due to the guy behind the scene.",
            "Idk if your opinion is the same as mine regarding this but I hate when people do sing like in videos of a cover of a popular song. Like their voice is good, but the way its sung is sort of cliche and does make me cringe. Also knowing the fact they are looking for acknowledgement of their voice. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but there is no originality to it, no soul if you will.

            "Hey man, I just want to say I totally get this. I\u2019m a huge music head, grew up in a musical family, been into studio sound design & piano for most of life. As a kid I much preferred music without lyrics, electronic and soundtrack stuff big time. I didn\u2019t like being \u201csteered\u201d by a vocalist and straight up preferred there to be space for other (more interesting) sounds. I found it irritating that the default form of contemporary music revolves around lyrics cause most of the time it really makes me cringe. I just can\u2019t take a lot of that seriously.\n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve found tons of music with lyrics that I love from all over, different countries and time periods and that has changed my perspective on it a bit. For me, the inconvenient truth is most music just isn\u2019t that good and most vocalists don\u2019t have shit worth saying let alone singing about. Total anecdote, but what I\u2019ve observed is many people listen to music for the message, the narrative/story, to identify with something, and to socialize. But some people listen solely for how it sounds and don\u2019t care so much about the rest. I fall more in the latter camp, sounds like you might as well.\n\nAlways be extremely honest with about what you like and don\u2019t like, even if other people don\u2019t understand.

BUT it starts literally with a scene of two teenagers having sex (with little to the imagination). That scene provided zero value and was only for shock purposes and really unnecessary. To be honest, it almost made me turn it off, not because I am a prude, but because I figured it was just going to be another trashy show held up by sex and violence. I'm glad I stuck with it, because the show is great and honestly, its one of two sex scenes that I've seen in the show thus far -- it just happens to OPEN the show with it.\n\nThere was one other graphic sex scene in the show (that I've seen thus far) and it was the same thing -- totally unnecessary to the plot of the show and far more graphic than it needed to be. It really took me out of the show for a bit.\n\nWith porn literally everywhere you turn around, you would think that SOME television and movies would maybe think it wasn't necessary and leave it out... but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nIt seems like there are only two types of entertainment anymore: that which is strictly for children and dumbed down a bit and not at all enjoyable for adults to watch (or for children over the age of 5 to be honest) and graphic adult shows and movies...\n\nWhat happened to good movies and television that you could watch with your family -- real good stuff, not the garbage that they put out there today.\n\nIt's sad to me that we are a society that our entertainment NEEDS sex to sell.",

I really got annoyed and stopped watching it because of that, it\u2018s really irritating and you can\u2019t keep up. The sex-scenes in Game of Thrones atleast make sense. If they want a quick fuck, then they will get a prostitute and not start fucking their own friends. Also, the love relationships feel atleast genuine because most of them take the time to develope, e.g. Sam and Gilly, Grey Worm and Missandae, Jon and Ygritte. How To Get Away With Murder isn\u2019t even in the fantasy category like Game Of Thrones and yet they still have the weirdest relationships and get a pass as if these things happen often in the real world.",

No more paying child support faithfully for someone else\u2019s child. No more getting out of child support for your own choices.\n\nA paternity test should be required before the father is listed on the birth certificate, and there should be a legal responsibility to confirm or deny paternity on the part of the father.",

There is no doubt in who the mother is obviously, but proving fatherhood should have nothing to do with emotions but for medical reasons.\n\nEdit: considering the multiple responses regarding surrogate moms wouldn't be obvious, how would they not know?

But I also feel like even if it's proven that the SO of the woman isn't the child's father, it's likely the man will still have to pay child support if he chooses not to raise the kid. \n\nExample: in SC where I live, my aunt paid to have a DNA test on her kid that she KNEW wasn't her husband's. She then filed for divorce, and yet he still had to pay child support for 18 years despite the kid not being his.\n\nEdit: This was about 26 years ago now. I don't know if her husband knew until AFTER the paternity test. I asked my aunt's mom, my grandmother, about it, and she said he did pay the child support until my cousin was 18. She then went on to say that 2 months after she turned 18, my aunt's ex-husband ended up dying from a drunk driver incident.",

The govt?\n\nI'm also curious if in this scenario would-be absentee dads, or multiple men are chased down and court ordered to test, there is a benefit here of that man paying child support to alleviate the potential burdon on the state if the mum is single/low income/using welfare, and guys that were just going to dip out being forced to assume the responsibility that the mum has taken on. \n\nOr are we just talking M/F couples in monogamous relationships here?",

It's probably a statistically very small amount of tests that come back negative and are a surprise.\n\nI would say it should be routine as part of custody or child support proceedings though.\n\nEDIT: I thought of another problem.  Now every child's DNA is saved on some company's database to be sold to the highest bidder.  This looks more and more like corporate intrusion for profit than actually helping people out.",

Please never gain political power, OP.",
            "This fails to take into account the cost of medical care in this country and privacy concerns regarding having a DNA sample taken. If an aspirin can cost $30 a pill in a hospital, how much will a paternity test in that setting cost? Everything has unintended consequences and a blanket rule like this would cost SO MUCH money. Why should I/society have to pay for this (read: I don't care if your health insurance covers it at 100%, you're paying, society is paying, when we increase the cost of health care, we all pay for it one way or another through taxes and health insurance premiums and deductibles) when I will know beyond doubt who my kid belongs to? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDude can man up if he is worried and get this done on his own dime without making this a part of routine care for newborns.

(Both scenarios the couple was on a break and both parties had other people, so not the best relationships but they worked out, weird how similar though.) So I can totally support a guy who just wants to raise a kid even if there is doubt just because he wants to be a father. I get that's rare though so hence why I say available and not standard practice.",

            "The way it works in my country has somewhat of a work-around in cases where a man would not immediately become the father on the birth certificate. This is what happens when a baby is born:\n\nIf the two parents are married, then the father indicated on the baby's birth certificate is automatically the mother's husband. \n\nIf the two parents are not married, then the father is only indicated on the birth certificate if he fills out and gets public notarized a statement of paternity. If he does not, then the birth certificate's \"father\" field is left empty. I guess that would at least leave him the option to distance himself from the child if he suspects any foul play.",
            "I mean yeah I would be offended because that would mean that he thinks I'm capable of cheating on him and sleeping with another man - which I am not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I can see the need for certainty in a lot of cases though. Maybe not routine and required by law by default, but I could get behind it being law for a man to be granted a paternity test if they ask for it.",
            "There is nothing stopping men from getting a paternity test now though\n\nMaking it a requirement, the biggest pushback will be from men, because the test will be an additional expense. Either paid out of pocket or via insurance, someone\u2019s got to pay for that.",
            "It should go further than that. If you have your blood checked for whatever reason, and they very visibly find out you are not a match for your child because it's not your child, it should be allowed if not required by law to let that man know if he doesn't already. I forget where, maybe Britain (?), but recently a study had come out from a European country where an increasing number of men were raising kids that weren't their own and legally, medical professionals couldn't tell them.

Men don\u2019t get the same reassurance. \n\nBut let\u2019s not forget that some women can be abusive and/or controlling. \n\nThis may also be unpopular but maybe they ask the dad outside of the presence of the mom (much like they ask women in the ER outside of the presence of the guy if there is abuse at home.)

It's showing you don't trust me.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy final response before i start looping points is.  \"Trusting you, and wanting legal evidence are two separate things.  I can trust you more than anything else in the world.  But having legal documented proof for something as serious as parenthood has no downside to me.  And should offer no negative to you or the child.  As there should only be one outcome, and the purpose of the test is just to have it legally recorded.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery rarely has an argument continued past that.  If they do I just start saying.  \"Explain why you would not want a paternity test done?\"  Have only broken up over this once, and it was simply \"because you shouldn't need legal proof when you actually trust me.\"  And you know what, I just don't get it TBH.  There is no downside for the woman or child, and this conversation is done in advance of trying to have a child.  So it's not even that I'm suspicious of the pregnancy, or of her which I would feel would be a different issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHad this been during the pregnancy and said \" I don't think it's mine, I'm not going to take responsibility unless we do a PT\" I could see the argument.    But when it's made in advance, and stated that it's just for my personal preference in the situation.  I think it shows more toward the females personality and thoughts.  A quick test that has ZERO ways to backfire on a truly honest person should not be something to be afraid of.  So it's honestly more telling for me, if it is an issue.",

There should also be no time limits. I have seen many of the 23 and me stories where the truth is revealed and families are \"destroyed\". Men should never feel pressured in situations like these to accommodate the children or the wife. Move out, get your money, no \"fair\" 50-50 split, you get what you own. Because at that point the woman only used the man as a wallet and a cuckold (biological).\n\nFurthermore there should also be reparations paid for time spent, this should be in the millions.",

In the region I live, it's just under 1% according to a large scale genetic study a couple years ago.\n\nThis isn't a judgement about the OP's opinion as much as a fact. A lot of birth defects people insist on testing for are much less common.",
            "Absolutely. I had my first son with a woman whom I had only met a few months earlier. We were no longer together at the time she found out she was pregnant. After her decisions were made I chose to be closely involved in my child\u2019s life, which she and her family welcomed. We agreed to not involve the courts and made arrangements for care between ourselves. One of the first orders of business was to get a paternity test. Now, let me say this, I was 98% sure this was my child she was carrying, and part of the reason why I requested a paternity test was so my name could not be contested on his birth certificate. When I brought up the idea she took it personally. Her father, who was a nice man and I got along with, called me a few days later yelling at how embarrassed they were that I would even imply the need for a paternity test. Once my son was born I immediately ordered a paternity test, but the results would take a week and the hospital demanded printing the birth certificate before leaving the hospital. This meant we had to retroactively add me to the certificate a few weeks later, which wasn\u2019t a fun process.\n\nAnyways, yes, I think that paternity tests should be a normal or mandatory part of the process. It would help avoid arguments and legal issues.",

If there\u2019s a second father claiming he\u2019s the one they have recourse to go to court and get a test. But to require all couples to take a test is making them guilty until proven innocent. There needs to be due process. I don\u2019t know much about what burden of proof the second father might need to get a test ordered so maybe that needs reforming but there still needs to be due process.",

It was a big ordeal... sparked a fight... there\u2019s clearly no doubt that he is the dad, 7 years later as his son is almost literally his twin but a mini version. It did hurt though to be accused of infidelity, especially with all the BS that man put me through. If the testing was mandatory it wouldn\u2019t have even been an issue",

            "I have no issue with paternal tests becoming more mainstream. What I do take issue with is making it a government mandate. If your solution to a problem is \u201cmore government\u201d then you don\u2019t have a solution. You just have a bigger and more complicated problem.",
            "Absolutely.  Routine DNA tests should be required before a father's name goes on and a Birth Certificate is issued.\n\nEvery child/person has a right to know and love his or her own father.",
            "This opinion is slightly unpopular here on Reddit, but probably enjoys significant support in the population as a whole. While we\u2019ve all heard anecdotal evidence of this being a problem, it\u2019s legitimately only about 1-2% of births, while less than half of non-custodial fathers are paying their mandated child support in full and on time.\n\nIn other words, yes, this happens, but deadbeat dads are a far bigger issue. And if you are legally the father of a child that isn\u2019t biologically yours, and can\u2019t change it, get over it. Get strong visitation or even primary custody, raise the child to be a good person if you believe you are more qualified than the mother.

The test is done and the person who thinks they are the father finds out that they are not.   The state would have to identify the real father, and then sue for support.  Otherwise you will have a bunch of kids who are deprived of support through no fault of their own, which hardly seems fair. \n\nUpsides: It is very possible that just the threat of this test would go a long way towards reducing this problem.  Women, knowing the test was coming, would be incentivized to tell the \"father\" or get an abortion if there was even a chance that this could come back negative.  \n\nI don't think I agree with it necessarily, but it is interesting to think about.",

            "I do agree that a man should have the right to have a paternity test done but it is long and a little expensive and not necessary for every case. I remember a guy I knew dated this woman for a bit but they ended up breaking up. After the break up she immediately found another man and got knocked up quick. The new guy fucked off to England so the woman claimed that her ex was the father. He had to pay child support for 10 years even though he knew it wasn't his kid. He evantually got a court order for a DNA test to be done because she refused before hand so a police officer and a doctor forced her to provide a sample. The results showed he wasn't the father but being the broke bitch she was she couldn't pay it back in full. So the courts set up this payment process where she pays him 20 dollars a week for the next 12 years.",

            "Because of an anecdotal experience, I disagree. Forgive my sleepy writing.\n\nI know a woman who got into an abusive relationship. He was trying to get her off her IUD and get her pregnant as soon as possible. She did get pregnant, but realized he was abusive, even suspected he was a pedophile. Because they were married, she learned from her lawyer that she'd still have to tell him she was pregnant, even with divorce or anullment. She got an abortion to avoid chaining herself and her family to this creep for the rest of her life. If anyone killed that fetus (if you wanna think of it that way) it was the state.\n\nThis was also one of those cases where law enforcement was protecting predators.

Imagine being the child that has to find out this way that something so fundamental like who your father is is being disputed in the middle of a nasty divorce. After signing, or being named some other way, there's a time limit, usually 2 years, (from signing, not discovery), to dispute or be SOL. In some cases the signing itself is absolute, or acting in the role of a father can produce a duty to support, leading to (somewhat rare but not unheard of) instances of the adulterers getting married and having the ex pay for the child they had, or being made to pay support for a girlfriend's children after she gets back with her ex. When child support is overturned, the payments aren't usually refunded because it would harm the child's standard of living. The current system was made to reduce reliance on the state, and act in the best interest of the child, at the expense of the father's rights.

While I physically read (with my eyes) a ton, I would have had to be stationary, zeroed in on reading all the time to get through the load. Being able to listen to a book while I drove, cleaned, cooked, exercised, etc., was essential. I've also taught non-traditional or working class students who listen to their reading sometimes while they work, commute, or care for their child, and some of them feel guilty because this assery.\n\nSimilarly, for work I often have to skim a lot of texts and skip around--or conversely, I spend minutes at a time annotating and rereading a page of dense theory. In both cases, I am consuming the text but in different ways. \n\nSo yes, listening to an audiobook is not the same as reading it with your eyes, but as long as you are retaining the info and enjoying the story, differentiating between reading and listening is generally pedantic and elitist.\n\n[Edit: Thanks for the like and award!

Thanks for that world shaking revelation!\n\nIn all seriousness, I know that listening to audiobooks is not the identical action as reading the book but for some people (like myself) it is the only way to enjoy a book. I have tried reading many things throughout my life, but the way my brain works I can't remember previous info and read new info while trying to imagine it all and continue to functionally read. 10 pages in, I forget what I just read.

            "If you mean reading in the dictionary sense of visually deciphering symbols into words that mean something, then no it\u2019s not. \n\nHowever, I believe the spirit of reading or listening is the same. Kind of like the argument of whether light created by magic is as real as light generated by electricity and filament. Either way, you can see by it. \n\nSame with reading and listening. The goal of reading is to consume the story. To know the characters journey and go through a journey, climax, and resolution. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re physically looking at it or hearing it. It all ends up in your brain.\n\nI personally prefer visually reading a story as I\u2019m a visual person. I remember, retain, comprehend, and process better visually. Aural learning is the weakest for me. However, I\u2019m sure there are people out there who learn better by hearing than seeing.\n\nYou say that reading requires attention, where listening let\u2019s your mind wander to do other things. I\u2019ve know people who listen to music or watch tv while reading, so that argument doesn\u2019t hold.\n\nPersonally, I only started listening to audiobooks in the last few years. What I\u2019ve done is listen to books I\u2019ve already read. I listen in my downtime where I\u2019d otherwise loose any kind of reading time. I listen while I work out or travel. I listen while I mow or work in the shop.\n\nI have found there are pros and cons to both. Reading with my eyes let\u2019s me pick up on things that I know are there and still don\u2019t get while listening. On the other hand, listening can be amazing when I hear pronunciations I\u2019ve been messing up or when a good narrator puts life into a scene and makes it better than what\u2019s in my head from \u201creading\u201d. \n\nEven the dictionary definition says reading is \u201csilent or aloud\u201d. So I think either counts as \u201creading\u201d. Maybe it\u2019s the terminology you have trouble with. Maybe we should find a new term that means \u201cconsuming\u201d the media vs reading/listening.\n\nI do recommend that even if you\u2019re a pro-reading, that you try some audiobooks of series you enjoy. You\u2019ll get much more out of it. I\u2019ve really enjoy Stephen Fry\u2019s \u201cHarry Potter\u201d, Michael and Kate\u2019s \u201cWheel of Time\u201d, and Jeff Hayes does an amazing job with \u201cDungeon Crawler Carl\u201d.

However if I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m gonna happily listen to my audiobook while I get stuff done. I don\u2019t find one better than the other.  I also don\u2019t look down on people who primarily listen to audiobooks. They\u2019re literally just trying to enjoy their life. \n\nPeople who gate keep hobbies are losers.

Hey buddy, focus on yourself and stop worrying about what everybody else is doing.

The only difference is it\u2019s using other senses. So while your written/reading comprehension might not be getting a work out, your aural comprehension is running marathons.\n\nTL;DR;\nThis as an unpopular opinion, sounds more like you\u2019re mad people are able (thanks to audiobooks) to work their way quicker through literature than you can. \nIt\u2019s a hobby, let people engage with literature in the way they find most convenient.",
            "Ok .. does that mean that those who read in braille didn\u2019t really read it because their eyes didn\u2019t physically look at it?",
            "I agree with the main point.\n\nListening to a book *is* different from reading a book. They have similarities, but they have differences too. Reading is visual, while listening is aural, so they are not the same. Unless they have a score in hand, someone won't say that they're reading music when playing their Spotify playlist. With that being said, neither is better than one or the other.\n\nHowever, it is possible to read passively, and proper listening requires active involvement as well.",

            "I enjoy audiobooks. I have an app called Libby, through my local library and it is awesome. So many of the classic books are on there that I would never read in real life. I have hundreds of books tagged to that will last me years.",
            "\n>Reading requires an active involvement on your part - listening is something passive that can be done while doing other things.\n\nDisagreed. I constantly find myself reading passively and not engaging it with my mind, and I have to go back and reread. Same thing happens when watching videos/shows. It's exactly as hard for me to listen actively as read actively."

It was embarrassing and we got to the point where we just felt sorry for our classmate whose note was being read. \n\nI decided to fuck with him one day so wrote a fake note about how I helped a friend get rid of a guy that her dad had killed by taking him out on a boat and weighting him down in Lake Ontario. I put in all kinds of details to make it sound real though no real identifying information. I made sure that he \"caught\" me with the note. That fucker went pale as a sheet when he opened it and first read it to himself. The rest of the class was in on it so they all started shouting for him to read it out loud, lol. \n\nI served a week of in school suspension for that one but he stopped reading notes aloud in class after that so it was kind of a win.",

He was one of those teachers that no one took seriously, & honestly,  looking back,  it was well deserved. He read our most recent conversation out loud,  & went right over the part that said,  \"Mr. M needs to get laid.\" The whole class started laughing,  & he stopped,  asking what was so funny,  then reread that last part, suddenly realizing we were talking about him.  He was furious, & sent us to the principal's office. \n\nNow, lucky for us, my bestie & I were usually  good kids & good students.  The principal loved us, & honestly we all had a bit of a laugh at the situation.  He did tell us to  stop passing the notes though & asked us to apologize to Mr. M, but other than that,  we didn't get in trouble.  \n\nSo yeah, sometimes, teachers reading those notes out loud can backfire on them!\ud83d\ude02",

At the end of week every week she would open the box and read out the opinions.\n\nThere happened to be an *opinion* once that said \"Ana smells, she should shower more\".

            "Cant be positive but I imagine it has to do with burial depth. You cant just bury a corpse a few inches deep (hence 6 feet under). If we bury people vertically, the hole would have to be 6-7 feet deeper. In some places, that might not even be feasable. For example, where I live, there is bedrock barely 5 feet down. Our basements are literally driled into the ground. So if we had to go an extra 6 feet down, we would have to drill through rock for every burial. \n\nAdditionally, if you have ever been to a burial, you probably know that thw holes are now dug using a mechanical shovel. If we assume a person needs a 2x2 foot hole to be buried vertically, I\u2019m not convinced a shovel could dig a hole 12-13 feet deep at that small a radius without getting stuck because of the shape of the machine.\n\nFurthermore, if we consider that most people are roughly the same width and depth, but that height is variable, and that hole depth actually becomes an issue because of the extra 6-7 feet, cemetaries would likely want to minimize the depth of the hole to minimize difficulties with the shovel. As a result they would have to make holes of a custom depth for each person (6 feet + the persons height + 1 foot, lets say).\n\nUltimately, while it would allow for more burials, it would be far more inefficient and impractical to actually implement.",

            "Well, economically it doesn't make sense.You'd have to dig roughly 12 feet into the ground with a much smaller space to do it in. That sort of difficulty costs money. Right now a backhoe can take care of the job in a few minutes. Vertical burials would have to be done by hand for the most part. That would undoubtedly wind up costing far more than the current method.\n\nSecondly, the amount of space used for burials is miniscule. We're just not that hard up for space. It would cost us a fortune to apply this \"fix\" with very little payoff.\n\nIf you live across from a cemetery then you've noticed that no matter how many people die, these places always seem to have room. They don't take up anywhere near the amount of space you may be thinking that they do. And plots for burial are cheap in the first place so you wouldn't be saving much money.\n\nEither way, you must know that everybody who owns a cemetery must have thought of this at some point.

Keep stacking those caskets vertically, so that the 7th generation is an 8 foot tall pillar, and so that the 14th generation\u2019s casket is 64 feet up in the air.

Nowadays, Earth\u2019s land is sepia, its water gray, and its soil is unsustainable. It is a reminder to all of Moon\u2019s inhabitants that a planet can be ruined if not nurtured.\n\nOne day, at the local lunar pub, a bright young fellow has a thought: \u201cWhat if we started burying our dead in caskets, vertically?\u201d His friend responds: \u201cYou could stack them all the way to Mars.\u201d",

            "Logical in the long run IF we had robots doing the actual laying of the casket.  Saving burial space is a good thing.  Still, it is pretty difficult to dig an 8 ft hole when you're confined in a 3 ft by 3 ft hole. Also present is the difficulty, or at least inefficiency, of raising a hundreds-of-pounds casket and guiding it gently into the hole. Plus there's always the chance the casket could get stuck half way down and it be difficult to raise it out of the hole and start again. That is before we get to the notion that digging around the casket to let it slip into the hole could well damage the casket. \n\nAs for the missile silo comment, I know you're ultimately being facetious, but I have to comment about it anyway.

But there's now been such an over saturation of sex being used to sell that it's everywhere.\n\nAdverts - those perfume adverts for one. Why the hell does a perfume require two half naked people in bed and the man smelling the pillow as the girl struts off? Another example, in the UK, an advert for being bikini body ready was removed from the Underground for being too sexy. It was on a massive wall on the station platform.\n\nTV - Too Hot to Handle is my bugbear for this one right now. A bunch of sexy adults being told not to have sex for a cash prize and acting like it's the worst thing in the world. Also, reality tv in general has become about sexiness. The Kardashians, for one.\n\nMusic - The sheer number of inappropriate music videos is scary, not to mention the performances on stage.\n\nThe extent of sexualisation is profound. So much so that I think we as a Western culture have become used to it. I have a friend from Sri Lanka. When he came to the UK, he said that there was so much sexualisation that he was initially overwhelmed and was looking for sex everywhere.\n\nI really hope that in the future, we realise that we've exploited ourselves and our youth. I hope there's time to change.\n\nEdit: Holy shit this blew up, and holy shit my first awards! Thanks Redditors!\n\nWow, this one is divisive. A couple of points.\n\n1. Yes, genocide, war, slavery are definitely worse then this. But as a modern Western generation, we did not perpetuate these things.

I don\u2019t want to openly talk about sex to just anybody, I think that\u2019s why I value it and love it in my life.

They talked about sex constantly, they just found synonyms and comparisons so they wouldn't get censured. I'm talking TV shows that the family got together to watch too, things like What's My Line? Listen to any song from like the 1920s onwards, it's probably about sex or drugs but it only becomes obvious when you listen to the music.\n\nHell, Disney even did shorts way back when with the music singing about people being addicted to opium and crack.

Loving someone is not the same as lusting after someone, and while neither is inherently a bad thing (I don\u2019t see sex drive as evil so much as a natural thing that we need to learn to control), society in general seems to ignore the difference. I hate unnecessary sex scenes and explicit references in so many songs, it\u2019s so annoying. And another thing, not every girl and guy together are dating/sleeping with each other.

            "The prudish aversion to naked bodies and sex was a direct result of the Protestants that founded this country.  Just as in the Victorian age, where a stray ankle would set men into a frenzy, when sex and sexualized imagery, clothing, media etc. - when these things are restricted it makes the jouissance of the prohibited all the more enticing.  For this reason, media and advertising jumped on sexual imagery and innuendo because of its attention-grabbing nature.  Combine these factors with the American obsession with youth and beauty and you get media solely based on young, attractive, sexualized people regardless of the genre or the product.    \n\n\nWhat I find most interesting is that we are now saturated with access to sexual content, and of course everyone eventually discovers free pornography at the touch of a button.  However, I think that the titillation, or one could say the hinting or teasing of sexual content is sometimes more enticing than just watching two people making the beast with two backs.  It's a similar concept to men who say that women can be more attractive in clothes than stark naked, or women might say a man is more attractive in a suit than in nothing at all (I've heard the same from gay men and women as well).",

            "There is nothing inappropriate about sex. Media is not making us commodify sex, we are doing this to ourselves. We are blaming media and public relations when the product we are born with doesn't equal the amount we believe it should incur. \n\nWhat I mean is that we tend to put a price on our sex. We don't have sexual relations with each other because of attraction or cause we like someone, we base it on a whole host of other standards. Matter of fact let's think about the entry-level standards towards sexual intercourse, sexual appeal, and arousal, having a good looking body. We put hoops and obstacles around getting in shape in our society to create an artificial hierarchy.  We then shame people who can't complete the crucible of society standards we are enforcing.\n\nI can't even fathom how many people believe \"X\" Hollywood star or starlet is actually the \"most\" attractive because tv has bamboozled them into believing bull shit. Yes if you worked out and you had a stylist; you too would lust for yourself. But, you are tied to a job that saps your will and patience and makes your self worth the last possible option for pride, and thus you imagine being somebody else to be with somebody you want. \n\nUntil society gets over the need for external validation, to feel worth, sex will continue to be sold to us at a premium by a media apparatus that is built on selling you your dreams. Let's be honest sex isn't sold equally to everyone. Sex is sold differently in each society;  the dominant culture of those societies enforces the standards in which sexuality is seen as reasonable and profitable.  \n\nSo we have to be realistic; the overuse of sex as a tool for merchandising and transacting goods and services has been spurred on by those who purchase those goods and services in opulence.  We are commodifying ourselves, media is just following our lead.",

            "Forget about television or movies, how about real life?\n\nI\u2019ve had 12 different jobs total, and I\u2019m 24 years old. Weed gets you fired a lot, kids. First job I got when I was 17. I can recount many times I\u2019ve been sexually harassed at 4 of the 12 jobs, from 6 different girls in total. For the sake of not typing a huge story on here I\u2019ll just briefly explain some of the girls that did something that was definite sexual harassment. \n\nWhen I worked at a movie theatre, usually the action performed that made me uncomfortable was grabbing by the waist from behind, or the front but made to look like a \u201chug\u201d. There was most definitely more to those hugs than a typical friendly hug. \n\nOne girl at a Kroger deli I worked at had a habit of coming up to me at the slicer. She would bend over as close to me as she could when I stepped aside to weigh the product (a scale was on top of each slicer). This girl was even pregnant the whole time I worked with her. I know without doubt she was advertising her desire. Maybe even getting a little satisfaction out of rubbing against me, although it was \u201caccidental\u201d when I said something. \n\nAnother job I had at a major hotel\u2019s laundry department. It was always busy and there was always work for each department to get done. Always. My position involved going to some parts of the hotel that were very secluded and no one would ever be; other than an employee like myself with a task in that area of the building. There was two different girls that worked at the hotel, who would make sure to come and flirtatiously block the doorway, or even get right against me where I was standing in this secluded room. They wouldn\u2019t do it together just whenever either of them happened to see me in one of these secluded areas they would almost always come bother me. \n\nThis is getting pretty long now so I\u2019ll stop explaining all the situations. I think we all get the point. This stuff happens to guys too, we just don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking up. For a slew of reasons. A few examples would be; not feeling like anyone would care (or rather being aware they wouldn\u2019t), being treated as if you should want it because \u201call guys are pigs\u201d, not being taken seriously because \u201cshe/girls aren\u2019t the kind to do that stuff\u201d, or \u201cyou just think that because you like thinking girls want you\u201d. That last one really got to me the couple times I heard it, I\u2019m telling you how I don\u2019t want her, and that I\u2019m uncomfortable that she tries after I\u2019ve expressed my disinterest. One thing I heard a few times, which apparently to some managers is a good \u201creason\u201d for doing nothing about a sexual harassment, \u201cUnless one of us[management] sees her do it ourself we can\u2019t do anything, plus we already need more employees. It would hurt us to lose one who\u2019s already trained for everything if we don\u2019t absolutely have to\u201d. I will say, they never explicitly said they can\u2019t lose somebody who knows how to do the job even if they are sexually harassing, but what am I supposed to feel they mean when they say they can\u2019t do anything unless they see it themself. They aren\u2019t looking for it. They never will see it. \n\nSorry for the long comment, I just despise this double standard very much and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s affected way more people than we all would think.",

Growing Pains, Family Ties, Fresh Prince did a better job of portraying equality among the parents. IDK if television is a reflection of cultural values or if television promotes that attitude. Either way, physical abuse to men is dismissed (unless it is adult to child), and sexual abuse is trivialized. What's messed up is that society recognizes women are chastised after being assaulted (were you drunk, what you wearing, etc), but they are still chastised. Men are chastised as well, just in a different way (how could you be assaulted by a woman, you're a man, you wanted it) but that's not recognized as being wrong. Even with teenage boys who have sex with a teacher are almost glorified, not treated as victims. A Ted talk said that 1 in 4 women were sexually assaulted and that 1 in 6 men have been assaulted, but the numbers are skewed because of the lack of reporting. Approx. 20% of the population have been victims of abuse. 20% of your FB friends, phone contacts, whatever are either a victim or an aggressor. That's messed up.",

Therefore, a woman beating up or sexually assaulting a man sounds ridiculous because a man can easily overcome and overpower her.  This isn't my viewpoint, you understand.  This is what I believe has been the status quo for so long.  And you've got to admit, it still kind of is.

Her sexual assaults on Michael, aggression toward him, and abusive comments are NOT okay and the show should have emphasized that more. But I guess if they were making it seem realistic, it was a decent representation of how males in abusive situations are treated (by their partner AND those around that see it). \n\nTo their credit, the women of DM did tell Michael to get out of that relationship. They SHOULD have emphasized that he was being abused more, but they did try to help him.\n\nHowever, FUCK Pam and Jim for going to the dinner party, firsthand seeing the abusive situation Michael was in, and NOT offering him a place to stay and pretending they weren\u2019t able to help him.",

And then this was never talked about.\nThe Indian law has always, I mean always been heavily and irradiationally biased towards men. But somehow, the world, but most importantly, the Indians, still believe that it's the women who need more legal support.",

            "Male sexual assault is depicted this way in numerous tv shows and movies, two that come to mind right now are Wedding Crashers and Big Stan. \n\nI also remember a thread on reddit a while ago where  a bunch of men were sharing their experiences of not being taken seriously after opening up about being victims of sexual assault.\n\nI wish this was talked about more. As a woman it pains me to think that there are men out there who are literally getting laughed at, by their loved ones, and by their girlfriends, for having lived through a traumatic event.\n\nMy unpopular opinion is that a major fault in the current gender equality movements has been the lack of empathy for cis men. This is a generalization, but I still think it occurs enough within the entirety of these movements to be a serious issue. We take power away from women when we constantly peg women as the only real victims of society, while alienating cis men because we constantly peg them as the privileged villains. In addition, when we do acknowledge the struggles of being a cis man, we tend to do so in a demeaning or condescending way. Empathy needs to go both ways."

            "Games with voice chat and online contact usually have age ratings\n\nSo long as you're not swearing on Roblox, it os typically a lack of parent super vision.\n\nBesides, let kids hear swear words. You know they do at school from other kids, you know they do when they play out, and it's not that bad a thing. The more you make swearing a bad thing, the more of a negative effect it will have on them when they encounter it .. Of course teach them not to swear in class, in court, ar work, in a job interview and such reasonable places\n\nEdit; there is a difference between swearing and being a toxic asshole. The first is fine, the second is not okay regardless of the age of listeners.",
            "Hear, hear! Ultimately, parents need to take more responsibility for what their children see, hear and do.   \n\n\nWhen I was 13, I had already spent the last couple of years begging my parents to let me play WoW after watching them run around playing vanilla, but they always said not until I was older. When they finally caved, I got the biggest \"people on the internet are weird\" kind of talk. A lot of the current generation of kids would have parents that spoke in chat rooms, on msn messenger, had a myspace account and probably stalked something fierce on omegle. So how are there so many parent oblivious to the imminent chaos found on any kind of online game??",

            "Back in the days of Xbox Live on the 360 - when voice chat was a huge thing because a lot of us (teens at the time) hadn\u2019t really had a chance to use it, it was full - and I mean - full - of toxicity. \n\nOn any of the Call of Duty games, kids would say that they banged my ma, threatened to hack me because they had my IP address (lol) and all sorts of things.\n\n99% of the time - I rarely heard an adult say these things, it was mostly the youngsters. It reminds me of a single time on Gears of War - I chainsawed a guy, and got a barrage of abuse through a voice message - really fucked up content in there. A couple minutes later, a second one arrives with the guy informing me that his ma said he should apologise and not be rude to people. \n\nI do agree with OP, but we should also stop pretending that kids are these innocent little delicate things when they\u2019re often more robust and screwed up than the adults we claim to be protecting them from... (verbally speaking, of course). \n\nI was a kid once, I heard and said some pretty fucked up stuff to other people online. Eventually I grew out of it and just started to play without a mic and with voice chat disabled. Since then, gaming has been more about the game itself than the shit people talk.",

            "Almost completely agree, On that matter, I believe this should go for everything. From social media, gaming and even TV and radio. It is 100% the parents responsiblity to ensure their kids are taken care of. Their the ones who fucked each other to create the little bastard, I had no hand involved, Why should I suffer?\n\nThe ONLY caviot to this should be \"child friendly\" websites and games. Where it is 100% the companies fault when they allow pedos to do pedo shit on their shitty pedo games.",
            "Yeah, but if it\u2019s like a game meant for kids, you should kinda watch what you say. Or if someone, of any age, is like \u201chey, can you not curse or whatever, it makes me uncomfortable\u201d then don\u2019t curse",
            "At this point, it should be up to the company to have different queues.\n\nHave an \"adult queue\" and a \"kid's queue\" and let parents set the kid in the appropriate queue.\n\nYou can choose whether to be in a bar or a Chuck E Cheese in real life, in any sufficiently populated online game you should have the same choice",
            "On one end yes, on another if it\u2019s me and I\u2019m in voice chat CSGO or Rust and I hear a obviously younger kid I will always try and watch myself, kids repeat what they hear and if that\u2019s all they hear is toxicity that\u2019s all they\u2019ll reciprocate. Games inevitably are toxic and competitive I get it but you don\u2019t have to always be... that deep into it... just be mindful of what you\u2019re saying when you consciously know there\u2019s a younger kid listening u know",
            "I kind of agree with you, but to a point. Should a parent get upset if their kid hears an f-bomb in GTA5? No, and whoever said it shouldn't feel responsible, that is a mature game. But if it is a game literally marketed as family friendly, then you should behave as such. If you are one of the people who actively try to figure out ways around a chat censor in a game like Roblox or Among Us, then you should absolutely be held responsible, because those games are meant to be and advertised as a child friendly game. \n\nI'll use the analogy of a mall vs a playground. At a mall, it's more acceptable to curse, as long as you aren't just screaming it to everyone, because a mall is a place meant for adults, even if there are a few kids there. But you should definitely not be cursing at a playground, because that place is primarily meant for children.",
            "I'll never understand why people have the urge to talk shit in every kind of competitive game they play. Every game with a ranked mode is ruined by that, be it a moba or fps.",

I like to to have some drinks while I drive and people shouldn't be on the road if they are worried about getting hit.  \n\nIt crazy to me, I play a lot online and have never had an issue acting like a normal person.

            "Depends on the intended audiance of the game, if your talking like a douche on fortnite or minecraft it is your fault and you should be banned for it. If it's call of duty or something like that yea parents shouldnt let their kids play adult oriented games.",

In fact, I would add that if you can't even control yourself the minimum amount it would take to not say something offensive in front of a kid, maybe you should be the one to not have voice chat. I am not saying that you shouldn't be able to have locker room chat with your mates, but if there's a kid on the chat, maybe save it for when there isn't.",
            "This is fair.\n\nThough, I have to say, that if I hear tons of kids on a game I\u2019m playing I certainly censor myself. Just feels weird cussing at or around a bunch of kids. It\u2019s not my responsibility to \u201cprotect their children from the internet\u201d but it\u2019s just common decency not to use expletives loosely when you know you\u2019re in the presence of children. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just a game that they\u2019re playing, we just happen to enjoy it too. In my head, it wouldn\u2019t be much different from an adult kicking a ball around with friends at a park, and refraining from screaming expletives in the heat of the game. Ya know, cause they\u2019re conscious that they\u2019re in public and around children. Seems like the same thing, just a virtual setting.\n\nGuess I\u2019m just saying that common courtesy goes a long way; but you\u2019re not wrong, OP.",
            "Noo I should be allowed to call children slurs it\u2019s so unfair the parents are irresponsible :(",
            "It's almost as if an independent authority needs to come up with an age and maturity level indication for games.... Wait... Isn't that already a thing :D \n\nParents have no clue what their kids install. Hence the age and ESRB ratings have zero effect.",
            "True. But also, if you know there is an 8 year old in your team, then tone it down a bit.",
            "Not only is this true, I\u2019m going to take it one step further and say parents are responsible for everything for their kids. I used to get in trouble all the time because I couldn\u2019t self regulate (whether it came to food, tv, games, etc). As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s not a child\u2019s responsibility to know how to self regulate. Parents are responsible for teaching kids how to manage their time and stay safe. I guarantee you that these parents are going to lose their minds when their kids are somehow convinced to steal money or meet a stranger because someone said something on the stream. Parents have to parent. Until a certain age, pretty much anything your kid does is on you"

With all of the wealth currently being hoarded, the haves could *very easily* provide for the have-nots.\n\nSo why don't they? The most common answer I see is something along the lines of \"handouts will make people lazy and the no one will want to work.\" I wholeheartedly believe that anyone who says this has never experienced poverty a day in their life. To believe that the *majority of poor people* would be content to scrape by on the bare minimum for the rest of their lives is absurd. The underlying message to this argument is essentially saying that the answer to poverty is for poor people to just \"stop being poor.\"\n\nIt's as if some people think being poor is a choice. They absolve themselves of guilt by saying that poor people can stop being poor whenever they want if they just stop being lazy. Yes, they can just manifest mental health, a support system of friends and family, clean clothes, access to proper hygiene, a balanced diet, and reliable transportation--they just have to want it bad enough! Absolutely asinine.\n\nThe truth is we HAVE the money. We just collectively choose not to help because most of us have decided that it's not our problem.\n\n\"It doesn't affect me personally so who cares.\"\n\n\"Those people made their choice.\"\n\n\"They're probably criminals/addicts anyway.\"\n\nSentiments like this go against the very point of society: to collectively benefit from co-existence. Ten people living together in a community will thrive exponentially better than if they lived individually. This is because each person has something they can contribute to the overall good of the collective. So it is worth it for the other 9 to occasionally help out the 1 who is facing temporary adversity. The problem is that, at some point, we all decided that homeless people were worthless and that it wasn't worth it to help them. We decided that society would go on just fine without the poorest among us, so why bother wasting resources on helping them?\n\nWe've dehumanized poor people to the point that we are no more concerned about their well-being than we are about wild animals. In fact, I'd say most people are more likely to care about abandoned cats & dogs than they are about the homeless. Because those people \"chose\" to be homeless, but stray animals are merely innocent victims.",

But, if you\u2019re going to be upset about this then I hope you\u2019re equally upset with government mismanagement of funds - and many charities being absolute shams that\u2019s are basically collating money to pay admin fees. The amount of money raised for the majority of charities is staggering. It gets raised every year. Somehow things don\u2019t seem to get better in those place or for those people the money is raised for. \n\nSometimes you have to ask yourself \u201cwhat\u2019s going to allow this dollar amount to make a difference\u201d. Look at how much money is \u2018put towards\u2019 poverty every year. Why will it work this time? Billions a year. \n\nI grew up seeing the videos of please support children in Africa. You know. Those \u201cfor the price of a cup of coffee every day\u201d kinda videos. Hundreds of millions to billions of dollars raised to help them. It took a rapper, Akon, to get solar powered electricity to 25 African countries and has given electing to almost 29 million people. If people like him were involved in the charity process I might be less jaded - but companies like United Way and Red Cross have insanely high admin fees and are corrupt as fuck. \n\nSo yeah. What would make this money different.",
            "This seems like an oversimplification. There are many contributing factors to these issues other than apathy and selfishness. Such things as war, famine, political corruption, Anything that disrupts the supply chain. Mental illness, ect. You also mention addicts, which are a difficult group to help, considering many don't use the resources available to them as they are more interested in achieving their next high. Not saying they aren't deserving of help or that we should just give up. I think it is a noble idea to provide the resources and be giving to the needy.",
            "Not to be a contrarian, but I do want to bring my perspective to this as a non-American.  \n\n\nI'm from the Netherlands. We have a wellfare state, which means you'll get support from the government if you're unable to make enough money to get through the day. There are countless way to avoid being homeless, to the point that you have the right to stay in a homeless shelter if you really need to, no questions asked. Really, there shouldn't be a reason that you're homeless in the Netherlands, even when you're in crippling debt or unable to work.   \n\n\nBut still, there are homeless people. In a population of 17.000.000 people, 18.000 are homeless. In 2009, around 9.000 were homeless. That's an increase of 100% in 11 year. How is this possible?  \n\n\nTwo words: social provisions. The wellfare state has been in decline for over a decade now in the Netherlands. Healthcare has been slimmed down, wellfare has gotten less and less, houses have become extremely expensive and a rare commodity. So in a way, more social support from the government will lessen the amount of homeless people. From that perspective, I do agree with you that an extreme amount of homeless people is partially due to the failings of the society, or in this regard, the government.  \n\n\nBut to go back: even when the Netherlands was a socialist paradise, thousands of people were still homeless. This comes because a lot of people CHOOSE to be homeless. They don't want to work, they don't want to abide by the rules, they don't want to be part of society itself. A lot of homeless people choose the life they live. I still have empathy for these people and we should still all treat them as human beings, but it's not wholly on society at large that these people have no roof over their heads.",

And to lump both together as some kind of generic, global problem really misses the point. \n\nSuffice to say that in neither case is greed the problem.  Furthermore, the problem of handouts reducing incentive to work is two-fold.  Yes, it does rob the beneficiary of incentive and agency, and you can see this in the legacy of generational poverty within the welfare state.  But it doesn\u2019t stop there.  It also robs the DONOR of incentive to produce as well, because why would you invest more or build another factory or work extra hours to get ahead when your profitability is taxed at confiscatory rates to be handed out to other people.\n\nYour opinion isn\u2019t so much unpopular.

This is a miracle that we get to benefit from, but some people only focus on the negative. I find it ironic that in an age of unprecedented human prosperity the complaints are the loudest.\n\nEDIT: for all those saying basically that we should still be looking for ways to improve, I agree with you.

It is no exaggeration to say that for a 2-3 year period, as a single parent, if I had an extra $10 at the end of any specific month, it was a good month.  Usually I was able to manage my money well enough to have a few extra dollars, but if that amount was double digits - it was a fantastic thing.  Sure, you could argue that $10 was a lot of money in the 90's but no - no it was not.  \n\n>The truth is we HAVE the money.\n\nWho is \"we\"?  This betrays a child like understanding of fiat currency.  This position could only be accurate in a board-game type of sense.  Like: \"the game of monopoly comes with 'enough money' to buy all the property in the game!\"  But that \"money\" only has value in that game.  \n\nThis comment by the OP is the equivalent of trying to buy all the editions of monopoly and passing out the monopoly money to the poor people as a \"solution\".\n\nReal life, Fiat money (like the U.S. dollar) only has value in proportion to its ability to represent productivity.  If a person has \"earned\" money - it means some \"successful\" part of the economy has decided their productivity has a specific monetary value.  Every deviation from this paradigm necessarily erodes the value of the currency at large.  It is simple math tempered by understanding economics.\n\nHowever, it is true that there is enough \"slop\" in the economy to probably \"solve the problem\" for a day if not for a few months.  But humans are not static.  If people have \"enough food\" and \"nothing else to worry about\" - they will make more babies than they would if they had \"serious problems\" and faced \"significant scarcities.\"  It is a primal human drive to have freaking babies and it is impossible to stop without fascism or some form of oppressive laws like forced sterilization.\n\nIt is therefore literally a balance between human rights and \"solving\" these problems. For example, two of the most significant people in my life could easily be \"productive\" members of society if they had the right medication and simply followed the respective guidelines for stable mental health.\n\nHowever, they have freedom of choice and they tend to prefer semi-regular homelessness rather than admitting they have a problem or sticking to their medication.  They have the \"right\" to \"not be medicated\", but with just a little help, they can spend years having a \"normal life.\"  \n\nThe \"solution\" is very specific to each freaking individual in a way that is very difficult for a government to \"fix\" without directly violating \"human rights\" on the regular.",
            "It's much much more complicated than just throw money at the problem.  Many homeless people have mental health issues like paranoid schizophrenia which make them feel scared to live in a fix place. As for world hunger, take the situation in Ethiopia and Yemen right now.

To even get food to those people you need to stop the fighting first which is much much more complicated than just give them money to buy food.",

            "I\u2019m not sure that world hunger and homelessness should be grouped together.\n\nAs for homelessness, I\u2019ve spent years volunteering in homeless shelters (mostly in Austin TX and Minneapolis/St. Paul MN) and I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s a people problem. It\u2019s really not about the availability or cost of housing. If you don\u2019t believe me, then I encourage you to volunteer your time at a local shelter or soup kitchen - It can be a wonderful and heart warming experience! Even if it\u2019s only a drop of water in the proverbial bucket, it can help make your local community a better place \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAll the same, the prevalence of substance use and mental health problems is staggering in the shelters (at least the ones that I worked in) and almost all people experiencing homelessness were also experiencing \u201cfamily estrangement\u201d, which is a nice way of saying that their own family members have given up on them, and if you call a brother or Aunt on the phone to try to help them out, then they will tell you \u201cLeRoy is not allowed in my home and is not allowed to see or speak to my children\u201d. \n\nBut isn\u2019t this all due to a lack of assistance and/or inadequate government support? No, I don\u2019t believe so because everyone in the shelters (again, at least the ones I worked at) have smart phones with government funded data plans (\u201cObama phones\u201d is what the men in the shelters call them), food stamps for groceries, monthly cash assistance (think about the song \u201c1st of tha Month\u201d by Bone Thugs and Harmony), and free section 8 housing and/or a bed in a local shelter. What else can the government/society be expected to do?

Just that small increase in tax can deplete people\u2019s disposable income and even drop people into reliance on free housing/food. \n\nYou can\u2019t keep printing money either, otherwise you create inflationary issues to pay for free housing/food, decreasing people\u2019s purchasing power to provide for themselves.

We\u2019ve seen it can be done. But we also know what the long-term impacts of that are: high inflation, high debt and increased taxes.\n\nWe have to think from a utilitarian perspective.

Many work less because we guarantee that their needs will be met and they are no longer motivated to work out of fear or hunger. Others will work less because we will be reallocating much of the excess they produce to strangers and they no longer see as much of a personal benefit. Whatever the reason, people working less results in less excess resources to redistribute.\n\nExactly how much various levels of redistribution impact overall productivity remains an open question and I'm glad to see honest research on things like universal basic income to help answer that.

I'd also guess that prior to 1500AD, having your own house wasnt really expected...\n\nIn the early 1900s, people were often jailed for being homeless to prevent then from being homeless...\n\nThis all said, the current homeless rate of the world is currently about 2% or 100x higher than in the USA.\n\nI'd say, humanity is doing a pretty good job, considering we are the species that has the highest housing rate. As a country, we are doing very very well... No matter what, there will always be a group of people that PREFER to live outside compared to living under someone else's roof with rules like no stealing from the house...

First off, the amount of people in poverty today is WAY lower than it was 30 years ago, and it is gradually getting better.

Second, I\u2019m not sure if you understand how money works with the super rich, but most of it is in the shares of the company they own, not liquid cash, and even if they did have loads of cash, throwing money at the problem is unlikely to help due to the current way many impoverished countries operate",

            "Ok, hot shot. When I was released from prison, I was broke, and virtually homeless (I had temporary residence in a halfway house), not a place I wanted to be, so I did some research, and found information about organizations that help the down on their luck to get back on their feet, by helping them to find employment, residence (other than shelters), they provide clothing and food.. Of course, this involves work-- and I don't just mean employment--- you have to be willing to make changes in your life, such as giving up drugs, alcohol, and other addictive vices that bring you down, attend programs like AA to help yourself stay straight, and most importantly, you have to take responsibility for yourself and your life. \n\nWhen I was in that position,  I decided that I wanted to pay it forward,  but I will not give anyone any money, so that they can pump it into their veins. Instead, I would take the free lunches I got at the halfway house, when I was out on a pass, and offer it to someone in need. I would pass out information for these organizations-- all easily reached by the subway,  which they have no problems accessing-- and explain all they had to offer, free of charge.  But I was constantly met with people who refused the sandwich or threw away the information I'd given them, and then cursed at me for not giving them money. \nEverything in life is about the choices we make, and while I'm sure that no one has ever woken up one morning and actively chosen to be homeless, they made choices that led them down the path to homelessness. \n\nWhile I'm all in favor of helping the homeless, I fail to see the logic in taking money away from people who have worked hard to get it, and giving it to people who, by their choices, choose not to work, or who panhandle, sitting in a public place all day long, every day, holding signs that say \"I would rather be working,  but can't find a job\" instead of using their time to actually look for a job. I'm in favor of helping the homeless, but I say help the homeless to help themselves, instead of catering  to them, and rewarding their bad choices with free handouts.

They have very corrupt governments that hoard all the food for themselves and give it out to people as favors in exchange for them doing other things or the government just really sucks at dispersing food correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHomelessness isnt a money problem either and we have been lobbing money at this problem for decades or centuries even and it only gets worse.  Why?  Well 99% of homeless people are that way because of drugs, alcohol, mental illness, or a combination of the those.  There are a bunch of homeless people that actually like living that way.  Most homeless people aren't the downtrodden single moms who dont have enough money for rent or the forgotten veteran.  Most homeless people are drug addicted people who blow all their money on drugs, people who are so mentally broken they cant even cook for themselves let alone hold down a job or maintain a house.  Or they are complete dregs on society that have been in and out of prison because they dont give a fuck and they have no interest in getting a job.  People that dont want to be homeless usually take advantage of assistance programs and do whatever they have to do in order to get a job and get out of that situation.  The ones left behind are those that dont care or are incapable due to illness or addiction.\n\nSure you can throw homeless people into a free house but then what?  They cant hold down a job so how will they pay for heat or electric or food?  Who is going to fix stuff in the house when things break?  Who is going to clean the house?  What usually ends up happening when you do this, and you can look up all the cases during COVID when they threw homeless people on free hotel rooms, these places usually get completely destroyed, filled with garbage, used needles all over, and fights and even people killing each other isnt uncommon either especially when fighting over drugs.\n\nMoney wont fix these people.  Neither will free food or clothes or housing.  They need to get better.  They need to WANT to get better.  Even rehab wont fix these people if they dont understand that something is wrong with them and they dont want to put in the work to get off the drugs and get help for their mental issues and then work hard to get a job and get skills and save up money to get an apartment and maintain it.  Sadly we can't fix everyone.  Some people end up at the bottom and sometimes it takes them hitting the bottom to realize they are broken and need help.  Sometimes they never realize it and there's nothing we can do to fix them.",

            "Others have said it, but for more detail, when you pay for something with a card the money only looks like it comes out of your account right away. What actually happens is that your bank takes the money from your account and holds it with a bunch of other money from other peoples accounts that then get transferred all at once to a clearing house. It makes its way through financial institutions for a day or two before it ends up with the bank the merchant is using to process credit card payments. They hold it for 2 or 3 days to mitigate potential losses from fraud and then deposit it into the merchants bank account. So realistically when you pay by a card the merchant isn\u2019t getting that money until sometime the next week. \n\nRefunds work in much the same way, only you\u2019re the one waiting on the money this time, not the merchant. If the refund happens before the merchant gets paid out for your transaction it will never be deposited into their bank account. If it\u2019s a really big transaction that you refunded within the same day (like before midnight, not within 24 hours) as it was made you can sometimes call your bank and ask them to cancel the transaction. If they see it\u2019s been refunded they can cancel the entire transaction and it will never begin that process and they will just put the money back into your account. Your mileage may vary on this, depending on your bank, and the person you get on the phone. \n\nIf it begins the process of transferring it pretty much has to happen in reverse for it to be refunded. That\u2019s not actually what happens, but it\u2019s close enough for an explanation without typing several pages.",

The payee doesn\u2019t refund you until they get the money to clear, so they don\u2019t lose money if you\u2019re payment doesn\u2019t clear. Then the payee refunds your money and their bank places an X amount of time on it. So if it\u2019s a different bank, you\u2019re bank does the same thing. So these banks are making interest on your money during this X amount of time. \n\nI\u2019m not a banker, but if this is true then this is an example of the math.\nLet X=(amount of time the bank places the hold in days)\nY=0.25%(national interest rate as of late 2020, but I\u2019m sure a bank can find a better rate)\n\nSo 0.0025/365=0.000006849315068 that\u2019s per day of interest.\n$80X0.000006849315068= $0.000547945205479 per day \n\n$0.000547945205479X5 Days = $0.002739726027397 \nthat\u2019s how much they are making off of your $80 in those 5 days of hold time. 1/5th of a cent, doesn\u2019t seem like much.\n\nBut, of all the transactions they are making $6.85 per million per day at the current 0.25% national rate. Surly they are doing more than $1M worth of transactions a day and they can find a better interest rate than 0.25% (banks sets the interest). Also if they are holding every transaction for 3 or more days then there\u2019s a rolling total from the money they held from those days.\n\nLast year Amazon made $232.9 Billion, that\u2019s how much they made not how much money was transferred through sales of product and services which would be ALOT more. That\u2019s $638.1 Million a day, rolling 3 day would be $1.9 Billion.

When you use your card, the merchant is putting in a request for payment from hour bank, which usually shows as a pending charge, and is processed. A different area deals with refunds, and typically takes longer. In your case, a call to the bank should clear up any charges, since it\u2019s a simple mistake, and you can demonstrate that you weren\u2019t at fault. I\u2019d give that a shot.",

I\u2019m not sure how long ago this occurred, or how much you\u2019re in the red,  it if you are able to get money in the account within 24hrs then the fees are waived. This is because banks, as others have said, are really just placing a hold on your account. Many banks were hit with giant penalties for timing hold payments to deliberately overdraft; since recent lawsuits, banks are no longer able to do this and as long as you put money in to equal it out then the bank can\u2019t charge an overdraft. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not explaining it super clear but point is definitely get some money in there even if you need to borrow from a friend or family to do it. Plus, this would make a good case for the overdraft fee to be waived either way due to the duplicate charge. Assuming you have good account history.

That will be from Wednesday\u2019s sales.  Most processors have a 3-7 day lag on the money. The only processor I have encountered that was faster was Square, when I used them i would get Wednesday\u2019s sales on Friday. I could request an immediate payment, but that was roughly a 10% fee of the sales to do so, so instead of getting $2000 two days later, I could get $1800 right now. \n\nWhat you are likely experiencing is a \u201chold\u201d and not them charging you twice.

There's actually a reason for the separating it by months tho, as kids have different developmental stages, and in childcare specifically it makes a difference in where they are placed and what regulations govern.\n\nExample: 6 weeks to 6 months is an infant. 6 months to 18 months is still an infant, but in a different class since they're learning to walk.18 months to 36 months is a toddler that's learning to potty train. 2.5 years to 4 years is another separate class of potty trained toddlers. \n\nI know it sounds stupid to some, but the months do matter in context. For my purposes as someone involved in operating a daycare, the cutoff of saying the months vs. years usually is just whether Orr not they potty trained. Medical things may have different bench marks for development.",
            "What random people come talking to you about their children?",
            "These are used because they are the time scale of baby development. A 4 week old and a 6 week old would both be \"1 month\" but are very different. A 12 month old and a 15 month old are very different too. After 2 years it gets silly but before then it just makes sense.",

            "Some people go way overboard, but I don\u2019t see a problem using weeks for the first few months and months until they\u2019re 2 or so.      Then most switch to two & a half, almost 3, etc\n\nPregnancy is tracked in weeks, so are infant milestones, dr\u2019s appointments etc for the first few months, then by months.   Parents aren\u2019t going to change how they think of their child\u2019s age just to save op a second of math.    \n\nIf the math to figure out that 22 months is almost 2 years takes you too long, don\u2019t blame parents for being more aware.  And if If it\u2019s not important to you, if you don\u2019t care how old the kid is and we\u2019re just asking as small talk, why think about it at all?\n\nAlso, 38 weeks is quite a ways off of a year.    A year is 52 weeks, that 14 weeks is over a quarter of a 1 year old\u2019s life.    38 weeks is an 8, almost 9 month old.",

I really don't understand why, especially considering most of them end up sounding like popcorn machines or toy cars. Most newer cars don't even naturally have that \"roar\" to them, so you're basically trying to squeeze water from a stone when you try to make them sound like an older car.\n\nMotorcycles are especially bad, as it honestly just sounds like ear-splitting flatulence, and the only good use for that is when those bands of motorcycle riders went to military funerals and revved their motors to drown out the hateful chants of Westboro Baptist Church. Other than that, it's just a grating way of saying \"hey, look at me\" that doesn't end up making you look cool so much as it just makes you a nuisance. Don't act surprised if someone gives you a dirty look or yells \"shut up\" at you or something like that, cause you really deserve it if you go around revving your overly-loud noise bike just for the heck of it.\n\nObviously emergency vehicles are an exception, but that's so you can hear them coming and get out of the way. If your vehicle sounds cool by nature, you don't need to make them super loud to make yourself look cool. In the process of doing that second thing, you just end up making yourself into a nuisance.  \n\n\nEDIT: Welp, this certainly blew up more than I thought it would. Thanks for the awards and karma, and thanks for bringing up how noise can be a safety feature out on the open road when it comes to motorcycles (something I didn't exactly consider before posting). I may have come off as a bit heavy-handed in how I stated certain things here, so for that part I apologize if anyone was put off by it.

            "In car culture, the people who put straight pipe exhausts on their 90s civic hatchback trying to to sound like drag racers are called ricers. They\u2019re the same breed that put crazy body kits on cars, or generally do anything obnoxious or distasteful to their cars. \n\nI would like to make a point however that in many scenarios, a free flowing cat back (replaces all the exhaust pipes after the catalytic converter, including the catalytic converter) or any kind of muffler delete or catalytic converter delete is done to free up the exhaust systems so the engine can pump more air into itself. \n\nIt\u2019s like having a vacuum cleaner and plugging up the part that sucks in the air with your hand, the engine has to work way harder to make power, and one of the easiest ways to upgrade a cars power is just to give it a free-flowing exhaust system. \n\nSome people gain as high as 30-50 horse power after retuning the car to recorrect the air fuel ratio and such. Of course I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t think it sounds good, and that\u2019s not a reason why they do it, but a stock car with simple bolt ones and a free flowing exhaust can add a significant amount of power to cars without costing a ludicrous amount of money modifying the actual engine.\n\nSince people have begun debating what a ricer is in the replies to this comment, I\u2019ll leave a basic description from urban dictionary that I feel is accurate enough:\n\nImport vehicle that have been riced out typically have one too many mods that are only appealing to the owner of the vehicle. This includes body kits, euro tail lights, rear wings that are obviously to large for the trunk, possibly after market spray painted rims, and the car is usually more than one color if not it is a loud color; hot pink baby blue etc.\n\n*orange ef hatch with full body kit and loud exhaust rides next to you on the highway and tries to down shift as if looking clean.*\n\n*HAHAHAH wtf riced out piece of shit.*\n\nhttps://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=riced%20out&amp=true&defid=6429984\n\nIf this description is still not enough for you, imagine those four cars from the first Cars movie that were messing with Mack as he was dozing off on the road, the truck that carried Lightning around the country. Those cars would be considered rice cars, especially if the only modifications that were done to it were exterior, and it was still a 200 HP car. \n\nThat\u2019s mainly what ricers are after all. They watch a cool YouTube video of a drag racer with a fender exit exhaust and they want to make their own car look and sound like that, but they realize it costs stupid money to make a 1000 HP 4 cylinder Honda, so they just hit up their buddy\u2019s garage and he welds together a fart can to pump out that sweet sweet stock 4 cylinder bumble.

So, as far as I am concerned, any religion that depends on human delegates to spread its message cannot possibly be authentic, and should rightly be considered a cult - some more controlling than others.  I haven't encountered any religion that is delivered directly by its supreme being(s) but I like to keep an open mind, just in case I hear from one.",

            "I used to have this mindset but honestly, there is such a major difference here for women. My ex had 4 situations in her life where men just... followed her at night. She has men who cat call her and get aggressive and nasty when she doesn't respond to them. I've never had that, ever. I've never really worried about that. \n\nI also had a girl explain something to me which really opened my eyes. The vast majority of women are weaker than the vast majority of men, statistically. Even weaker men often stand a chance in a fight, and people won't often want to take that chance. But for women, they are constantly surrounded by people who can, for the most part, overwhelm them physically easily. And they know that for many of these men, the men want them sexually, and that if *they wanted to* they could easily overwhelm her physically for that. That gives a kind of inherent fear for them that I honestly don't think a lot of men will understand. The just general feeling of walking into a room and realizing that every man in the room could rape you if they truly wanted to.",

            "Look. No one feels entirely safe walking down a dark alley at night. However, the point women are trying to make is that women 1.) Feel a specific fear (sexual assault/rape) ON TOP of the regular fear both genders have when in a vulnerable position like a dark alley alone & 2.) Have to live with knowing that (ON AVERAGE), we are a member of the weaker sex, which leaves us MUCH more vulnerable than men in any situation. Men either are dominant over or equal to both genders, whereas women are equal to one and most likely to be overpowered by the other. Not too mention the gender than can overpower us is the gender statistically most likely to attack someone in a dark alley.",

            "I agree that both men and women are vulnerable. Women are vulnerable more of the time, we're not just afraid when we're in a dark alley, we're afraid most of the time. There's a huge size and strength difference, as well. All of that has been covered, so I'm not going to argue about who's got it \"worse\" since the answer is obvious and also just straight up doesn't matter. Men and women can both be victims and that is what it is important to focus on.\n\nAll I want to say is, every single time this discussion comes up on the internet, people say \"well men are victims of violent crime more than women, women are usually victims of sexual assault.\"\n\nIn what fucking way is a sexual assault not a violent crime, is my question? People say that men are scared they will be beaten and jumped and physically assaulted, but that is also exactly what happens to women when they are sexually assaulted, *especially* if they try to fight back in any way.\n\nSaying more men are victims of violent crime is only true if you don't consider sexual assault a violent crime, but it absolutely is. Being held down, being beaten or choked, having your genitals violated and possibly injured from roughness, etc are components of many sexual assaults (whether that's by a stranger or person you know), and yet somehow we act like women being raped is not violence, it's \"just sexual assault.\"\n\nThat's all I wanted to add to this discussion. Sexual assault *is* a violent crime. Women are absolutely victims of violent crime.\n\nETA: Please OP, give me your thoughts on this. Because you say clearly in your post that your fear is about dying or ending up in the hospital, but women fear sexual assault. Women *are* often beaten or killed during/after rape. Women do end up in the hospital as a result of sexual assault. Do you think sexual assault is just something that happens and only affects the person mentally? Women, in additional to external injuries from the attack, often have internal injuries as a result of sexual assault, they can get STIs, or they can become pregnant. So I'm not really sure why you're saying women tend to fear sexual assault and exclude the valid fears they have that they will be killed afterward or suffer physical damage in addition to the mental damage of sexual trauma.",

            "When women say that, they\u2019re not talking about strength or ability to fight someone off. If that\u2019s what you think it\u2019s about, that\u2019s literally what we mean by *you don\u2019t understand*. \n\nIt\u2019s because women are accustomed to being stared at in a REALLY WEIRD PREDATORY WAY or followed with the intent of rape. Far more than men are, statistically speaking. We are aware that just because you identify as male or look masculine, you may be unable to fend off an attacker. That\u2019s beside the point. It\u2019s more about rape dynamics.\n\nReeeeeeally broadly speaking, that\u2019s what we\u2019re referring to.

Let's say somewhere else at the same moment in time, an innocent person got sentenced to 50 years in jail. This person will also be devastated.  Nobody will ever say these two individuals' distress isn't warranted.  However, if the 1 year sentence person finds out about the 50 year sentence person and complains because 50 year sentence person is getting more sympathy, 1 year sentence person just became an asshole.  This is my problem with your post.",

Those encounters made me so paranoid that I now keep a knife on me at almost all times and ALWAYS have my car keys with me ready to go.\n\nApparently where I lived used to be the ghetto, and the cops were too busy busting parties to kick out sketchy weirdos just loitering around.",
            "Occasionally I have to walk through the crackhead part of town to reach my friends house. I'm a much bigger dude with close to a decade worth of martial arts. Unless I'm with a few friends, its fucking terrifying to see fuckng meth addict couples walking down the street (you can tell by the scabby faces and the skinny bodies). Even with a knife it's scary as hell. Cant tell if you're gonna get stabbed and robbed for 10 bucks to buy some crack. I'm planning to move to someplace new very soon, because that's like a good 40% of the town that has that kinda shit.",
            "The biggest thing I was able to teach myself from living in some pretty fucked up places is that a street fight is just that. A street fight. There\u2019s no refs. There\u2019s no one to stand you up, and there\u2019s definitely no one to stop a group from fucking you up. The only rule in a fight is live. That\u2019s it. Regardless of how strong you think you are, there\u2019s always a man who uses his brains instead of brawn. I won\u2019t be left on a street corner gasping for my last breath without a fight. \u201cRather be judged by 12 than carried by 6\u201d has never been more relevant. Stay safe folks.",
            "I feel like I\u2019ve always walked down the street comfortably, day or night. There are areas of the world where anyone should be vigilant of course. But as a 6\u20193 bearded ginger man, it\u2019s just not the same as a little person or a woman walking by themselves at night. I\u2019m aware of my appearance so instead of clutching a knife I actually pretend to be on the phone with my grandma. \u201cYes Grandma. I\u2019ll be there in 5 minutes to move the piano.\u201d Is my favorite thing to say as I\u2019m walking by someone. I feel like people, guys and girls alike, are at ease around someone going to help their grandma. To end this I\u2019ll say I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t safe brother. I\u2019m sorry the world is the way it is. It will get better.",

But I think saying that it\u2019s \u201cequal\u201d is wrong because if a guy pulls up when a gun (to a woman or man) then yeah they\u2019re both goners but if a man is being cat called (by a woman or man) they have a better chance of being taken seriously.

            "While I agree with most of the points made here and acknowledge that men are more likely to be targets of violent street crimes, I think OP is missing the context here. \n\nWhen women say or when I say \"men don't know what it's like to walk down a street,\" I mean that men don't know what it's like to be catcalled, eve teased, followed, eye raped or how it feels when a man walks near you and you immediately go on full alert, automatically fearing rape, murder or trafficking. \n\nIt's not like women don't get assaulted, mugged or murdered just because. They do and truthfully they are victims of these crimes lesser than men. But a woman's fears are more along the lines of being sexually abused. \n\nIt's not a competition of who suffers more, to me it's a basic observation that men likely don't know how it feels to go through all of that every other day of their lives.",
            "No doubt something can happen to a man out walking alone at night, but the truth is that it is much more likely to happen to a woman. \n\nWhen people say that, they aren\u2019t just talking about walking alone at night. They are talking about worrying they\u2019re being followed by someone when they leave their job during the day, worried someone might break into their house just to rape them, worried their boyfriend doesn\u2019t get mad and beat the shit out of them, worried someone doesn\u2019t follow them home in their car, worried they are going to get drugged at the bar, worried they won\u2019t be stalked, worry there\u2019s a camera in the public bathroom, worry there isn\u2019t someone peeping in their windows at night or under the dressing room door at a store, or up-skirting them as they walk down the street. \n\nYes, all these things can happen to men and you have every right to be afraid but the chances of them happening to you are far smaller. Just because you have fear to doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the same.",
            "This is a fair point.The fear of sexual assault is different than the fear of just getting mugged. Being followed by a man twice your size is terrifying. My hope would be that he just takes my purse and maybe throws a punch. I can replace my purse and live with a black eye.",

A guy can think \"if there is something scary, maybe I can fight it\". Maybe girl's think \"I really hope there is nothing dangerous, or else I'm screwed\".",

Now imagine that its blooms must be pollinated either by hand or a small variety of Mexican bee, and that each bloom only opens for one day a year. Now imagine the fruit of this orchid, a pod, being picked and cured, sitting in the sun all day, sweating under blankets all night for months until, shrunken and shriveled, it develops a heady, exotic perfume and flavor. Now imagine that this fruit's name is synonymous with dull, boring, and ordinary. How vanilla got this bad rap I for one will never know.\"",

So then they get to see all the beautiful adult things that Cardi B has to offer. So now your kids get to grow up to WAP and everything else. Now, before anyone's vein pops, I'm not saying that Cardi B can't or shouldn't do what she does. While I don't really care for it she's an adult and can do whatever she wants.

Someone like her has writers that write her songs, she wasn't playing bars and clubs struggling to do her songs that she wrote, and so forth. I doubt she plays an instrument. \n\nPop singers are a business and a bunch of dudes behind the scenes orchestrate their look, their image, and so forth. Someone is telling the child star turned singer to do sexual stuff on stage to distance herself from the kids' show she was on and so forth. \n\nIf you tell kids not to listen to a song, they will of course listen. I am an adult male and you could tell me Rihanna was totally naked in her video and I wouldn't give a single fuck, because at this point women singing sexual songs and doing sexual shit is BORING and cliched. \n\nI would rather listen to real music written by some dude with his clothes on, because at least I know it's real. \n\nSo, Rihanna is in fact marketed to kids. Her music and those like her are written by men, they purposely are told to make it sexual, because they are sort of like pedos grooming kids to like that stuff. Adult intellectuals aren't listening and going, \"Oh my, she really rhymed that word with clitoris expertly!! Cheers to her!\" it's kids listening to that shit.  \n\nAs I have said, you have pedo like people promoting \"musical porn\" to young people."

These classes teach critical thinking. These classes teach problem solving. These classes teach our students *how* to think about things. \n\nI understand the benefit in telling a student that is struggling in math class that he/she is not destined to be a failure because of it. But that is totally separate from \u201cbragging\u201d (especially around young people) that you don\u2019t use math in your career (even though you probably do even if you don\u2019t realize it).

School really isn\u2019t that hard if you really focus on doing well in it, especially in the American public education system (besides people who experience certain hurdles to their success such as low income demographics and minorities). \n\nSo if you\u2019re slacking off doing fuck all and telling yourself \u201cI don\u2019t need this for my career so I\u2019m not gonna learn it,\u201d I hate to break it to you, but you\u2019re probably not much of a critical/forward thinker to begin with and shouldn\u2019t be commenting on the topics we learn in school that you never bothered to learn.",

Yes, I\u2019m pretty much every job you will need some numeracy skills however a large portion of what you learn in maths and science you will need need unless you decide to go down a particular career.

It\u2019s completely insignificant.  There\u2019s no scientific meaning to it.  There is no magical meaning to it.  There is no supernatural meaning to it. \n\nIf Cesar Augustus had PMS\u2019ed a little harder one day 1500 years ago, he could\u2019ve decided August had 30 days instead of 31 and it would\u2019ve, and every number would\u2019ve shifted and today would\u2019ve been the 21st. (August = named after Augustus).  The system is meaningless and scrambled and jumbled and made up by a bunch of horny racist politicians and changed 100x times over the years. \n\nJanuary was named by the Ancient Romans after the pagan deity Januarus (who\u2019s feast day was Jan 1 and traditionally celebrated by making.   \n\nOctober means \u201c8\u201d (Oct) because it used to be the 8th month of the year.  But several Ancient Roman leaders\u2019 male egos needed stroking and he wanted a month named after himself so he shoved more months in there.  Now *Oct*ober is the 10th month in our calendar, because some Roman rulers got greedy. \n\nAnd even before then, the Roman calendar was completely arbitrary and meaningless.  In fact, it is LESS meaningful than it used to be, because at least in the past the calendar used to be based on the moon and sun and stars.  Now it\u2019s so chronically messed up, that none of our days align with sunrise/sunset, none of our months align with the moon (which is literally where the word \u201cmonth\u201d came from, it used to be translated \u201cmoonth\u201d) and the year doesn\u2019t match the rotation of the earth around the sun, so we add a weird extra \u201cleap day\u201d every 4 year because NOTHING mathematically adds up. \n\nDecember means \u201c10\u201d (dec = 10), it was supposed to be the 10th month in the arbitrary Roman calendar\u2014but another leader got a hard-on for naming stuff after himself and changed that too.  Now it\u2019s the 12th month for this same stupid mumbo jumbo. \n\nThe modern common calendar is nothing but meaningless arbitrarily chosen numbers, then those meaningless numbers got rearranged to mean even less.  The only reason modern society uses this meaningless (and honestly inaccurate and foolishly designed) calendar is that humanity has been using it for so long, that it would be a pain in the butt to change it to something else.

Every morning before I went to school my father would say, \"if I ever find out that you've hit that yeet, I'll thump ya.\"\n\n\"Yes, pa,\" I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing homework.\n\n\"Y'all hitting that yeet?\" he would seeth.\n\n\"No, pa,\" I would answer.\n\n\"Good.\" He would then walk out the room and shout, \"If I ever catch ya, it's a thumpin'.\"\n\nIt was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin' that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake.\n\nI would swallow my pride. \"No thanks. I don't wanna catch a thumpin' from pa.\" As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet.\n\nOne day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin' that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air.\n\nI breathed in.\n\n\"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!\"\n\nMy father burst from my closet. \"I told you I'd thump ya if I ever caught you hittin' that yeet, nibba,\" he ejaculated. Then, he thumped me.\n\nI haven't hit that yeet since.\n\nPART II\n\nUntil today. This morning was my father's funeral. At the procession, my brother asked me to say a few words. I told him I only needed one.\n\nWith confidence, I approached the podium. I gazed out upon the gathering of sad faces. I cleared my throat and leaned into the microphone.\n\n\"Yeet,\" I spake.\n\nSuddenly, my father leapt from his hand-crafted mahogany coffin, the gunshot wound still in his chest. He sprinted up to the podium with the energy of a man without a gunshot wound in his chest.\n\n\"Y'all hittin' that dirty fuckin' yeet at my funeral?\" he ejaculated. He raised his hand to thump me.\n\n\"Not so fast, pa.\" I grabbed his hand. \"Yaint thumpin' no mo'.\"\n\nMy father looked at me with eyes as open as the gunshot wound in his chest. A tear fell from his right eye, which also had a monocle. \"The student becomes the teacher,\" he said.\n\n\"The student becomes the yeetcher,\" I corrected him.",

His music is incredible. But even in his own lifetime (1813-1883) he was a deeply polarizing figure. He was an outspoken anti-semite, a bigot, a German nationalist, an unfaithful adulterer (and stole his best friend's wife), a habitual debtor, and a narcissistic egomaniac. His music was later infamously co-opted by the Third Reich, used in propaganda videos, played on loudspeakers in concentration camps, and held in high regard for how proudly German/Nordic it was. His music is now banned in Israel because if it.\n\n\nWhile I don't really agree with the sentiment that Wagner was a Nazi forerunner, nor did he advocate for the extermination of Jewish people in German society, I absolutely understand how terrible he was. He truly was Richard \"*Dick*\" Wagner.\n\n\nBut his music is out of this world IMO. It's some of the best ever written. I still love his stuff even though the man was an ignorant, self-righteous asshole. I can divorce my own perception of him vs his art. Nothing is absolute. Everyone is flawed.\n\n\nIf I can stomach *him* and still appreciate his work then it makes tolerance for anyone else that much easier to wrap my head around.",

            "I still like Louie CK's comedy for instance. I still liked Kevin Spacey's performance in House of Cards. Yes, some, maybe many-we don't know, because we don't know these people personally-of their actions weren't great, and should be criticized. Although, it's important to remember that we don't always know the truth. Some people have told me Louie raped some girls, some have told me \"he didn't do anything.\" All we have to go off is what the media tells us, and often it's fake news, meant to manufacture controversy and rile people up, for political purposes. So it's only natural that we should give more weight to what we can actually observe vs what we are told, IF we're trying to play the armchair judge, which we should seek to avoid anyway.\n\nObviously I think what people like Spacey and Weinstein do is horrible, assuming they did in fact do the things that have been claimed, and I disapprove. But again, I'm not the judge, jury, or executioner. There's no sense in getting emotionally ramped up about these things at all, and it seems most people who do this aren't acting in good faith, but rather seeking to elevate themselves by virtue-signaling, and doing so in a way that clearly reads like they're trying to say \"look, I'm condemning this, so you know I'd never do it. I'm a good person, believe me!\" Well that's a problem already, as **good, or not bad people shouldn't have to prove they're not bad**. That's The whole point of \"innocent until proven guilty.\" So by engaging in this selfish self-aggrandizing virtue-signaling, such people are artificially inflating the standards required for perceiving another as a good/not bad person, on a systemic level. They're perverting the way true justice is supposed to work, and that hurts all of us.\n\nPeople shouldn't be afraid to admit these things, but that's the influence of the media and politics. Politics, namely leftist politics, (though yes, some conservatives do it too, it's much less typical, and much less systemic; the leftist media has essentially made a science out of using fake news and propaganda. Every tv streaming service I've ever known has been chock full of propaganda) is ultimately responsible for this problem.\n\nEdit: and note how leftists only seem to want to talk about systemic issues when it affects *their* people, the protected classes typically. Most probably want to discount everything I said above. (SPOILERS ABOUT NETFLIX CRIME DOC) I recently watched the popular new crime doc on Netflix, and yes, what happened is tragic, and I sympathize for the victims and their family, there are some serious systemic problems that lead to scenarios like that occurring. It's not just that men are naturally evil and more violent as the documentary seeks to portray-that's the leftist propagandistic spin at play. (I actually correctly suspected what really happened very early, just looking off of actions/words, using basic psychology. Though I initially thought the doc would be a series like Making a Murderer, where perhaps the spin would presume someone was falsely accused, and maybe the film's direction would go differently. This was interesting). Look, while the victim didn't deserve what happened, it was insanely obvious she was a very hostile person to the guy, (and her acting like she didn't know why they drifted apart, and the way the doc tried to spin this in her favor, is just ridiculous) the guy tried to repress this, and eventually exploded. In a situation like that, a guy either kills himself or goes crazy one way or another, especially if he doesn't make much money to afford child support-and we weren't told much about their financial situation, unsurprisingly. Systemically, there needs to be a better way to avoid these situations, rather than just pretending all men are naturally evil and that the woman does nothing wrong. What happened is still very abhorrent, but that documentary is a perfect exhibit of propaganda in documentaries, so I highly suggest you watch it and reflect.",

While I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with \"love the art, not the artist\", is it not a good idea to at least think about where this art really came from and whether your'e okay with that, and more importantly **in what way** you're okay with it? \n\nAs a true left wing snowflake I will innovate in this discussion and proceed straight to talking about Hitler, but I think there is a lot of good old thinking we can do here. Mein Kampf is, well, fucking insane and pretty horrible, it's a nasty book on it's own and the fact that Hitler wrote it makes it worse, however, it is interesting. It gives you a deep and well articulated insight into one of the worst humans to exist, and in that regard I do *like* the book (I wouldn't cry at a blanket international ban though). In this example the only reason I think it's acceptable to like it at all is **because** I know the context of it and the person who wrote it, and I know why I see value in it. Liking it for the sake of liking it would be, like, literally Hitler.\n\nI think you should be allowed to like whatever you want, but I think it's important to know where it came from and, if you're okay with that, know why.",

            "Hobbies of every kind have been under assault by activists for years now. Usually by people from outside the communities that get welcomed in with open arms and then turn on those welcoming communities for \"Being too white\" or \"Not having enough queer folk\".\n\nIt usually plays out like this. There is a group of friends that plays D&D together a few times a week at a local comic shop. A new person notices them playing and asks to join. Despite being a tight nit group of friends they want to be welcoming to new players so they say \"Of course you can join!\". The night goes smoothly, everyone is having a great time until next week rolls around.\n\nIt turns out that new player you and your friends had such a blast with has other friends they want to introduce to the game! This new person knows nothing about how to play and put no effort into learning how. They demand to be \"taught\" how to play by the group as they go. Again, the group decides this is fine since it looks like Brian might be missing next week and it'd be nice to have someone to fill in. So they begin the long process of teaching this new person how the game works.\n\nA few weeks pass and this new person is catching on, if not slowly. Things seem to be fine and everyone seems to be getting along. Until that first random new person you invited to play with you starts receiving text messages about the group of guys playing every week. Sentences like \"This group seems pretty hetero normative, where are the queer folk? Are they even allowed to play with these guys?\" The new person you initially invited into your group is now in a weird place. They know this friend of theirs can be a bit much sometimes but they never thought they'd bring their fringe politics into a game of D&D but here we are. This new friend feels obligated to bring these issues to the group because they know their activist friend isn't going to let it go. So they awkwardly try to address the issue. The original group of guys has no clue on how to react to what are essentially accusations of bigotry and hatred based entirely around their skin colour / sex. Eventually the activist makes things so uncomfortable half of the group stops coming to play and the other half just decides to put up with being bullied by this Progressive Activist and slowly but surely builds up a staunch resistance and intolerance for progressive ideology, essentially accomplishing exactly the opposite of what the progressive activist set out to due. Create tolerance.\n\nYou can easily just swap out D&D with Magic the Gathering, the video games industry as a whole and basically any other hobby that exists in this world.\n\nHell, you can't even escape the social justice brigade in the world of programming.

            "I think recognizing this is even more important in that I've noticed creative people who make great big beautiful things are generally have/share more hot takes and controversial opinions than the average person. Being able to be a successful creative requires you to give less of a fuck about what people think of you since you're basically exposing your raw bleeding heart to the general public and that erosion of their internal censor transfers to the rest of their lives. And I think it's our duty as members of the public to make that painful creative expression as painless as possible, even if that expression comes along with disgusting opinions. And if you don't inhibit creative expression from the monarchs of malice and malcontent despite their emotionally disturbed opinions, you'd be able to better empathetically understand those kinds of people and prevent them from harming you. That and limiting expression leads to boring \"creative\" works. I like to remember that healthy forest needs wolves. \n\n\nOn a related note, I just really hate censorship. I get that people can be harmed by ideas and speech (and I am... All the time.), but I would never take away the ability for people to express them. Strange and hateful ideas fermenting unseen in a corner never did good for anyone. As long as there is communication, there is civilization. I get that we can be emotionally harmed by opinions and experience a lot of pain, but emotional harm is much more subjective where physical harm is not.

            "Hi, I've read through your and many commentators' opinions on this and I just want to voice my opinion on the matter. I always try to encourage people to consume media critically, which is to say, stay aware of what its messages are and if those messages are helpful or hurtful. You can still enjoy it, to a certain extent you cant really help liking or disliking something, I just think the least you can do is... acknowledge that aspects of certain media are, and I really hate to use this world but it works here, problematic.\n\nI also really disagree with the idea of death of the author as someone has already mentioned, especially when it comes to authors, directors, songwriters, etc. These creators all have to world build to a certain extent when they tell their stories, even if the story isnt fantasy or scifi, and the world they build will absolutely reflect their values. I'm not saying, of course, that Gilead is Margaret Atwood's ideal society just because she created it to tell her story, but rather to pay attention to the story's trajectory. What does the story condemn, what does it celebrate, how are characters heroic, and how are they despicable? \n\nThis is also why I so despise the \"curtains are blue\" arguement because it ridicules the critical thinking that goes into unraveling the authors message and encourages shallow engagement. At it's worse, it encourages you to leave yourself defenseless to these messages. Life really does imitate art! Please be aware of how media can affect your perceptions of real life, and never think you're \"too smart\" to fall for it. It's not about intelligence, it's about being able to recognize how insidiously prevalent the authors views manifest within their work, and how they can then manifest in your own world view as well.",

            "Mostly it's fear. Drama YouTubers, Twitter rumor-spreaders, and the mainstream media still hold immense power to influence how we view each other down to the root level.\n\nNobody gave a darn if some guy who streamed a popular game (let's say Call of Duty) was found to have injured an old lady recklessly driving his Mercedes. But with the uncovering of the -Steins (Weinstein and Epstein), people took it too far and began fearing everyone within entertainment subculture on the internet to be dangerous (aka guilty because I feel insecure).\n\nSo when a criminal in a subculture/fandom is exposed, people jump on the bandwagon before things are even fully clarified. If and when the criminal is found guilty, the mainstream media zeros in and releases all their articles stereotyping everyone. PewdiePie's anti-Semetism drama is the perfect example of this. So are a few furry/brony/FnaF artists/streamers/musicians who got caught sending nudes to 15-17 y/o girls in flirty, dating-oriented DMs.\n\nFear builds as a result, and self-fabricated nightmares of the cops showing up to your door and arresting you - all over you stating on social media that you're a \"Fan of such-and-such TV show/game/cartoon/fandom artist\".\n\nTL;DR Guilt by association needs to stop. 12-25 year-olds shouldn't live in fear by being a fan of entertainment and stating such on social media.

There's blood in some places too which is a damn bio hazard but to hell with safety I guess. \n\nThey also never heard or it was against their religion to use shower drain strainer/ hair catchers because they'd clog those up constantly too.

She said something like \u201cI\u2019m not sure if they got the roles cuz they\u2019re good AND female or just because of the latter\u201d and it really opened my eyes. \n\nThe current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like Wonder Woman being exceptions). I found Terminator, Power Rangers, Castle, etc. way cooler when they made them EQUALS with men and not simply trash them. Also, wasn\u2019t it more inspiring when women made it big back then? I remember when the chess player Judith Polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. Now, with a separate Chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. But I\u2019m digressing.\n\nPower Rangers vs the new Ghostbusters is my point. Females were part of the original PR team in almost equal numbers. They usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. That. Was. Awesome. The new Ghostbusters isn\u2019t. \n\nNow I\u2019m just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? Twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.\n\nEDIT: To answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, I\u2019m not making this up. Women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. Although this was challenged by Judit and now by Hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn\u2019t getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",

            "It's a lot more hamfisted now. Instead of simply telling stories about women who are competent/strong/etc., the stories are about why being women makes them that, or in the really bad ones, why being women makes them superior to men. The story doesn't flow naturally because they constantly need to shove \"I'm a woman!\" down everyone's throats. It's the old rule of showing not telling. Ripley and Sarah Connor will always be the ultimate badasses, not because they were women, but because they were fucking badasses.\n\nA perfect example of this kind of bullshit hamfistedness, I saw in an ad for Batwoman on the CW. Lucius says to Kate that the batsuit is perfect. She responded with something like, \"It will be, when it's made for a woman.\" Holy fuck is that some stupid dialogue. What possible relevance could gendering body armor due to it's effectiveness? Why is gender relevant at all to this discussion, and why must we imply the superiority of one gender over another? This is precisely what's gone wrong with a lot of this.\n\nWonder Woman was a great example of how to do it right. But I also feel like maybe she has less to prove, being fucking Wonder Woman and all. I think writers of other characters feel like they need to beat you over the head with the idea that these characters are badass because they're women. Which is absurd, because it also potentially enforces the stereotype that they are badass \"for women\".",

            "I think part of the thing is we only remember the exceptionally good movies from the 80s. 90 odd percent of films are schlock. They're designed by algorithm in order to maximize return of money, not quality. You acquire popular material from a writer and then ditch the writer. You cast based on whos got the best box office appeal at time of filming not whos best for the role. You make gender changes to maximize your eligibility for award categories. Add sidekicks and quirky comedy to go for broader appeal. Tone down sci-fi elements to avoid stigma of that genre. Then you strip out violence to avoid the dreaded R rating which would limit your audience. Finally you shoot a scene in china to open up that market. Boom you're done you have an immediately forgetable hollow shell of a thing with only a superficial resemblance to the source material. But its guaranteed to make more money than you spent so the studio execs are happy. Then, ultimately you're bought by disney.\n\nRemember that mad max, terminator, rocky horror etc were all relatively low budget movies, crafted with love by lunatics.

I think a truly amazing empowering movie is that that embraces the fact that women struggle sometimes,  women do have flaws, and despite all of that can come out inspirational and powerful all by herself.

            "The only reason movie studios are pushing the \"female empowerment\" angle is because they know the movies are crap and marketing them on their own merits as entertainment is a losing battle, so they're hoping that they can still turn a profit by appealing to viewers' progressive sensibilities. This works with movie critics (most of whom are very progressive and into identity politics; and in any case they don't have to pay anything to see the movies), but not with audiences. Even if progressivism was twice as popular as it is currently, most people buy movie tickets to be entertained: if they have good reason to believe that they won't find a film entertaining, they won't pay money to see it, even if it affirms their political sensibilities and worldview.\n\nI noticed something the other day when I saw a screenshot of the metacritic (or possibly rotten tomatoes) page for the new *Batwoman* series. The summary of critics' reviews at the top of the page mentioned how it was great for \"representation\". If you see a phrase like that in a review of a film/series/game, that's all you need to know to steer clear. I don't mean that you should avoid it because you'll disagree with its politics: I mean that, if it was an entertaining movie in its own right, critics would lead with that. Praising the film for its \"representation\" or \"diversity\" is a tacit admission on the part of the critic that the film isn't entertaining on its own merits, and is only a \"success\" (a heavily qualified success) in point of view of the progressive agenda. \n\nBy contrast, the original _Alien_ is a _great_ example of representation in cinema: 2 female characters, 1 black character, all are treated as equals, the protagonist is a woman and probably the most sensible and pragmatic character in the movie etc. However, *Alien* is a cinematic masterpiece, so discussions of the film tend to lead with that point, then mention its diversity as an aside. If _Alien_ was more notable for its diversity than for how good of a film it was, that would be good reason for suspecting it was a crap movie.",

I think the idea behind it is that people already love the characters, so why make new ones, but I think you should make new characters that people love. There's new generations now, not all of them are going to even know the characters. So just make new characters who are female that people can love! It makes so much more sense to me. If I was a girl, I think I wouldn't really be able to identify with the characters that are just changed to be female, because I know that that wasn't the character people fell in love with years ago. I don't totally know if this is a good example, because I haven't watched almost any of them except a new hope, but I think Ray was a good character, based on what I heard, and people didn't have to the am old character and make them female.",

            "Have you ever considered that maybe the reason the movie flopped was that they're just bad movies and not because they're female-centric?  For instance, the Ghostbusters movie.  If you replaced the female characters with male characters but used the same basic plot, do you really think it would have been more successful?  At the end of the day, it was just a bad script.  What I think the studios are doing is taking their shitty scripts and shoving female characters in there to drum up hype.",
            "Weren't like 80-90% of leading roles male back then? So maybe they were better but the literal jobs were few and far between and if you're a female actor you're sure as fuck gonna care about that. 51% of the population and 10% of the rolls \n\nI can understand thinking certain approaches are hamfisted, I'm not a fan of all of them either, but having media that is representative of the people that watch it is also super important. If your media presents a world that is more male and more white than reality that has huge effects on people who don't fit that bill. When the \"normal\" person is a white guy but at least 65% of Americans are not in fact white guys that's not great, and that's been Hollywoods default from the start.\n\nDiversity isn't a gimmick, it has strength and merits on its own and it's been sorely lacking for most of our media lifetimes. \n\n>Now I\u2019m just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? Twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.\n\nAnd yet we're just gonna assume it's male dominated completely by happenstance? If we're talking 20 years ago almost every director is gonna be male, a large majority of leads will be male, producers male, executives above them male. What are the odds that's a system that's gonna lend itself to men? \n\nIf you're gonna be skeptical be skeptical, there's little evidence of a meritocracy in Hollywood so don't act like trying to include women threatens some non-existent integrity.",

Same goes for Robin Wright in House Of Cards; Powerful, Badass female character written with substance and not just because they need to cram women in the show to tick boxes",
            "I think I get what you're hitting at, but when you say 20 years ago, are you specifically referring the comparisons to this year alone or this time period of cinema? I gather that you mean something similar to the latter, but comparing the culmination of films/shows from 20 years ago to those of a single year would almost definitely give a very skewed perspective on the overall success of female representation.\n\nAnyway, the point I want to make is that their are a lot of shows with female-empowering characters now (if not as much or more as former periods in cinema history). As I understand it, the dialogue was more about the comparative lack of thought-provoking material - one dimensional characters reduced to their sexuality - and the lack of opportunity for female centred leads in general and in certain genres. As It got more traction you eventually had more writers involved, some failed to do justice to the characters - this is more noteworthy in blockbusters  - and gave the vocal minority more attention than they deserve, comparatively overshadowing real merit.\n\nA laundry list of celebrated shows in the last two years include:\n\n* Undone.\n* Fleabag.\n* Killing Eve.\n* Stumptown.\n* The Good Place.\n* Sharp Objects.\n* Maniac.\n* Homecoming.\n* Big Little Lies.\n* Modern Love.\n* Russian Doll.\n* Unbelievable.\n\nA laundry list of celebrated movies in the last two years include:\n\n* Annihilation.\n* The Favourite.\n* Midsommar.\n* Hereditary.\n* Roma.\n* A Quiet Place.\n* Widows.\n* Booksmart.\n* Judy.\n* The Farewell.\n\nI'd wager that in those two years, their have been significantly less instances of controversial female representation in film/TV than their have been of successful work. Without getting into subjectivity, the merit almost definitely comes from the material - evidenced by reviews. Poorly perceived examples usually make up the vocal minority.\n\nLastly, I disagree with the assessment that characters need to be **equal**. A successful story can be told without putting characters on an equal standing, the assessment on Ghostbusters had to do with how poorly written the material was. Remakes and reboots are hard to pull off, and Ghostbusters was a failed attempt at that. \n\nThe writer(s) and director(s) are almost always responsible for how well constructed the work is. Oceans wasn't a great movie by public and critical merit, Widows was and the characters are in no way physically equal. Their is very little more to it than this in my honest opinion.",

My preconceived notions about a lot of pop artists and listened to them or learned their stories and she just doesn\u2019t seem that impressive or talented.

Her primary fanbase consists of the Black and the LGBT communities; these are the demographics that her music speaks to the most. Whether you like her or not, she is a global brand and the highest pop culture icon of this generation. She is without a doubt the greatest performer today and one of the few who can actually sing AND dance (on beat) for an entire show. I hate to drag race into this but it's the Elephant in the room. The majority of people who try to discredit her or talk down on her are straight white men (and sometimes women). She is a strong, powerful, influential, beautiful, black woman and that makes a lot of white people upset/uncomfortable. She openly talks about controversial subjects involving Black Americans and racial injustice while owning her femininity. She does not appeal to White America and she threatens the fabric of the American social system.",

People forget she is an amazing entertainer, singer, songwriter, composer, business woman, activist, etc. \n\nShe has some pretty uplifting and powerful songs that show love towards women. \nWhether that be Partition that shows women sexual sides need to be celebrated and normalized. \nIn Pretty Hurts, it talks about society\u2019s weight on forcing women to fight unfair beauty standards. \nIn Bow Down, it gives off bad bitch energy where you feel super confident. \nIn Diva, or literally ANY off of the b-day album will make you feel like such a strong independent woman who can have man but knows she doesn\u2019t need that to feel complete. \n\nShe has said in interviews that her fans praise her like god but since she is religious she said there\u2019s only one god and that\u2019s not her. \n\nAlso, she\u2019s had a successful 19+ year so the Icon level is kind of on point. \n\nHate her or love her, she is talented.\n\nTL;DR: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s FANS are annoying, not her.

I usually prefer when she is a featured artist rather than the focus of a song. Aaliyah was always my favorite along with Sade and that 1 Lauren Hill album. Currently I really like Sza, FKA Twigs and HER. \n\nRegarding putting Jay-Z balls in her purse, I don't like people who air their dirty laundry in public  just to maintain relevance. I thought Lemonade had a few good songs but 4:44 made it bigger than it was due to the \"wronged woman\" angle. And now one of my favorite rappers growing up is a shell of his former self. Man can't find the energy to get a fresh cut anymore. B probably won't allow it anyways.

She always brings her glove to games and we get tickets in the sections that are most likely to have fly balls.  If she was at a game and some middle aged man snagged a fly ball 2 feet away from her she would .... congratulate him and move on with her life.  The fun part of catching a fly ball is the catching it not having it handed to you by a random stranger.  So I have never understood why anyone would even want a baseball they didn't catch but I also like to imagine that the middle age guy who caught that ball was once a kid who wanted to catch a ball and finally did!

Little kids asking for a caught ball and people getting upset at the adult who doesn't give in.",
            "If you caught it like that, it\u2019s fair. It was shitty for that \u201cparent\u201d to send his kid begging to you for it. If he really wanted his kid to get one, get there early for warmups and the teams will toss kids pucks.",

I said no as we paid \u00a3200 to book our preferred seats (which is extortion anyway!), which the family also had the chance to do. Staff wouldn\u2019t refund the \u00a3200 we paid, so why should I move?",
            "It sounds like OP doesn't go to a lot of sporting events. The \"patron\" and \"sports arena\" usage are clues.\n\nTO BE CLEAR - For frequent riff raff at sportsball games, a code of conduct exists. If you are a male over 20 and you catch a foul ball or stray puck during game play, your decision flow chart is as follows:\n\n1. Are you at the game with your wife/girlfriend/mom/grammy? If yes, give the ball/puck to her. You are being a gentleman through and through and no one will fault you for this. If no...\n2. Give the ball immediately to a child 8 years old or younger. Do not marvel and examine your temporary prize. Do not wait until you have high-fived the entire section for the amazing catch you made. Ideally this should be done while you have the attention of other fans and before you can make any emotional attachment with the item.\n\nThe main problem OP faces is that a kid came up and asked for it. We don't want to condone this handout behavior at a young age. You shouldn't walk around like entitled little Billy and think you can just ask and you will receive every time.\n\nWhenever I am at a game, one of the first things I do after getting to my seat is looking around for little kids in the crowd.  This helps me both a) set a bar for how loudly I should be swearing at the other team and b) identify the most deserving 1-2 kids I see who I will gladly hand a souvenir to and make their day before little Billy can even come over and ask.",
            "No, you're absolutely not obligated and don't let them shame you for keeping the memento. \n\nBut if you trample or push kids out of your way to get the ball or puck, then you're just a dick.",
            "If the kid wasn't clamoring to get that ball with you, the entire section and especially that kid, can go fuck themselves. I'll probably never go to a baseball game but if and when I do, I'm doing this. I ain't giving that shit to anybody if I didn't see them put in the effort. Plus, why does the kid get to keep it? Might as well pass it around if it's taboo to keep something from a kid who didn't even bother to work to catch the ball.",
            "Just a heads up to people that might disagree with you, there are people that purposely take there kids to games to guilt people into giving them stuff and then turn around and sell it online. \n\nThere was a time in my life where I went to a lot of games in a lot of different arenas. It happens A LOT more than you think and is very common. To the point where players are very aware of it and I\u2019ve seen one even try to start the fight with the guy doing it.\n\nBut also even regular kids, don\u2019t give em shit if you don\u2019t want to, when they get there own it\u2019ll be that much cooler for them.",
            "That\u2019s totally justified, it\u2019s another thing if you boxed a little kid out or shoved them aside or something like you mentioned but no way would I give up something that flew directly at me to a kid or anyone else.  Kid\u2019s gotta learn anyway, and what you said to him wasn\u2019t rude or unnecessary.  I really have no idea why you got booed other than the fact the crowd probably just saw the aftermath of a little kid next to you and they assumed you shoved the kid away to get it."

The newer generations are not going to be wowed by the classics their older generations grew up on. \n\nI remember how blown away I was when I saw Jurassic park. I remember my parents taking me to the theatre and the joy I felt when I saw dinosaurs on screen. I think everyone deserves their \u201cJurassic park moment.\u201d You can\u2019t expect today\u2019s kids to watch Jurassic park and get the same feels that people like myself did. Because we\u2019ve advanced so much. \n\nApplying this logic, I think most successful movies can and should be remade so that everyone can enjoy them. Like I know the ghostbusters remake was not very successful, but the original was released before my time, so I didn\u2019t grow up with it. I watched the older ones before I watched the remake and I thought the remake made more sense in terms of whatever \u201cmovie logic\u201d there was and was more watchable because of the advancement in effects.\n\nPlus, the entertainment industry is here to entertain. Remaking movies will bring them money because they\u2019re making something, someone is familiar with. Parents will take their kids to watch remake movies they watched when they were kids. The entertainment industry makes its cash anyway, whether we think the movie was great or crappy.",

            "Many times the people who need medical treatment actually do intend to stop. \n\nThey are in a bad place and they are realizing the harm they are doing to themselves and possibly to others. \n\nWhen they are well again, addiction is addiction. ",
            "Ooohboy, let's unpack this. \n\nSo back in the day miners would get black lung - this was a result of years of working in the mines. Even with modern tech today, miners can still get terrible lung conditions as a hazard of the job.\n\nHobby and pro athletes will get head injuries, clavicle injuries, knee injuries - those are just the most common. Some of these injuries can end up life threatening.\n\nPeople who actively work in trauma situations develop mental disorders - PTSD being the most common. This includes police officers, EMTs, firefighters, and of course soldiers. Soldiers in particular are at high risk for expensive injuries. Even if the injury itself doesn't become life threatening, the PTSD and depression can lead to suicide.\n\nAnd hey, there are plenty of normal people who have depression, are stuck in the cycle and haven't been able to get themselves out of it, and so continue behaving in ways that may make the depression worse and eventually lead to suicide.\n\nDictating who and who should not get medical treatment based off what their lifestyle is, is a slippery slope. You can use it to argue that people with eating disorders shouldn't get treatment. That fat people shouldn't get medical support to lose weight (and doctor consultation/exercise programs *do* count as medical support). Pregnancy *can* and does kill - should we demand that prospective mothers not receive treatment for a pregnancy gone wrong because \"they put themselves there\"?\n\nSome of these you'd disagree with - of course we don't want to refuse treatment for a pregnancy that became dangerous - but others you're probably thinking, \"that's actually not a bad idea\" and that's dangerous thinking. That's what divides society and leads to discrimination, greater inequality, and a reversal of progress. We should not be striving for our systems to weed out the undeserving, they should be meant to catch as many of the needy as possible. If it means we get an idiot in there now and then, so be it. Better a field of wild flowers with a couple dandelions than a scorched Earth.",

For a time, it was my job to assist people with aids, schizophrenia, addiction, depression and just plan laziness in getting RADI and other forms of assistance.

I have no sympathy for smokers, diabetics who don't take care of themselves or those with HIV/AIDS who refuse to follow their treatment plan.

How amazing is it that medicine has progressed to the point where right now our biggest enemy isn't the Bubonic Plague, or the Spanish Flu, or any other of microbe that has killed millions of people? We can fix 99% of anything that ever happens to anyone, but at the end if the day, obesity and smoking are the root cause to 7/10 of the leading causes of death in industrialized countries. \n\nDisclaimer, I work in healthcare.

I'm specifically talking about today. \n\nFor what's it's worth, the current research in using phages as replacement to antibiotics is astounding. ",
            "Too many of the comments here discuss the fact that the patient should get care because he is paying for it. This is a scary argument which implies that people who *cannot* afford care do not deserve it, which is exactly the situation in America today. We cannot fall victim to thinking that resources in healthcare are so scarce that we can\u2019t properly care for everyone. Insurance companies, pharmaceuticals, the hospital industry, on and on, are all hoarding mass amounts of profits as they continue to drive up prices of care and insurance. \n\nYou have a duty as a medical professional to preserve life and relieve suffering. Do no harm and all that. This is a bad take from anyone, let alone someone working at a hospital. As someone who works with registered nurses for a living, I too see this mentality regularly. \n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, why should we blame the individual for a behavior that a billion people across the world engage in? If you look at smoking as a crisis of (once again) low-income people being unable to adequately provide for themselves through education, healthcare, mental health, work-life balance, etc. then who are you to judge them? To compound the problem, giant tobacco corporations lied for decades about the negative effects of smoking. We are just now getting over that hump, and smoking rates have plummeted worldwide since 2000. \n\nIf you start denying healthcare to smokers, it will literally never end. Only fit, healthy, wealthy people would receive the best care, which is how it was at least in America for a long time. ",

Why is he addicted to cigarettes in the first place? You act like the guy is getting away with something. He's dying from his habit and living in a 'decrepit body.' Should we also deny care to people who choose to drive cars even after being injured in an auto accident? If you don't like the way he lives then don't live that way.

I swear, it\u2019s like people had to redirect all of their hate towards a new direction now that we\u2019re finally cracking down and stigmatizing racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.\n\n\nTo be perfectly clear:  we absolutely *should* demonize bigotry and smoking is *not* the same as those things in any way, shape, or form.  That said, the near-overnight \u201cfuck smokers\u201d I saw starting in the early 2000s and overall level of vitriol really seems/seemed like a bandwagon hatefest more than any concern for the smokers themselves, society at large, or material harm beyond shit people don\u2019t like.\n\n\nThe other pariah group now that it\u2019s not okay (or at least less okay) to shit-talk people\u2019s former favorite targets is fat people, but even they have body-positivity and anti-fat-shaming advocates.\n\n\nAn *actual* unpopular opinion would be to call alcohol out for being waaaay worse for society than tobacco ever was.  It\u2019s just that more people like it so we pretend smoking is the worst thing ever.  It is really bad for smokers, to be fair.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a made-up boogeyman.  But there\u2019s disproportionately less empathy for smokers than for people who endanger themselves with alcohol, marijuana (that\u2019s actually treated as \u201cenlightened\u201d in some circles), poor diet, poor sleep practices, sedentary lifestyle, high-risk sexual practices, and even addiction to hard drugs.\n\n\nIs Reddit karma circlejerk opinions a sub?\n\n\n",
            "I usually just lurk, but I work as a Tobacco Treatment Specialist (TTS) in a clinic for people without insurance. Since you used the example of the smoker, I thought I would chime in.\n\n(NB: I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice, but I work collaboratively with our clinicians with prescriptive authority who prescribe them. I encourage you to talk your doctor to get on treatment.)\n\nIn my experience, there is a lot of misinformation and/or many clinicians do not feel comfortable treating nicotine dependence and/or are not willing to take the time. Additionally, there can be a lack of ownership on which specialty should deal with it. We know if you have a heart problem you see a cardiologist, but if you had to pick one type of doctor to treat nicotine dependence is it psychiatry, primary care, pulmonology? This can create an environment where they all say put their finger on their nose and say \u201cnot my job\u201d. \n\nA different way of looking at it: Imagine a see-saw with two blocks, one on each end. On one side is the motivation to quit smoking and the other is the compulsion to smoke, with the bigger block winning out. The medical world often tries to motivate people and make the motivation block bigger (\"You really need to quit smoking as it's bad for your health\" or \u201cSee these black, cancerous lungs, this will be you if you don\u2019t quit). However, they often do not deal with the compulsion side of it as they either experience conflict with patients or don\u2019t see patients being successful. However, the idea of the meds is that they help shrink the size of the compulsion so the motivation block is bigger and the compulsion block is smaller. This sets you up to resist smoking more easily and have more control.\n\nQuitting cold turkey is the exception to the rule as only 5% of people quit successfully this way. The best way to increase your chances of quitting smoking is a combination of pharmacotherapy (medicines) and behavioral support. For the guy who smokes with cancer, I think often we don\u2019t set him up for success.\n\n\\---------\n\nBelow is more info about meds, my approach, and some citations if you are interested:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the US, there are 7 meds:\n\n**Over the Counter (OTC):**\n\nNicotine patch, Nicotine gum, Nicotine Lozenge/Mini-Lozenge\n\n**Prescription (Rx):**\n\nChantix, Bupropion, Nicotine Inhaler, Nicotine Nasal Spray\n\nThe way I was taught to approach this was to compare it to treating asthma. In many meds people start at a low dose and work their way up as needed. However, in asthma, someone who is not breathing needs to get that under control right now! Breathing treatments, daily prevention inhaler, and a rescue inhaler and then overtime slowly step them down until it is controlled. Nicotine dependence can be viewed the same way and the goal is to control this compulsive disorder and control the compulsion to smoke and then taper off the meds.\n\nNow back to the asthma analogy, we want to treat it aggressively so we typically divide them into two categories: controllers and relievers and you want at least one of each.\n\n**Controllers:**\n\nNicotine patch, Chantix (varenicline), Zyban/Wellbutrin (bupropion) \n\n**Relievers:**\n\nNicotine gum, nicotine lozenge/mini-lozenge, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray.\n\nThe idea is that your controller helps control those cravings throughout the day and your relievers are there when you have those breakthrough cravings and have the urge to smoke. \n\nMost people we start with a combo of the 21mg patch and the gum or lozenge as most people are more amenable to this. Some people need multiple controllers and/or relievers or maybe even 2 patches -gasp-. (Clinicians often worry about an overdose of nicotine and I have to ask you, how many bodies on the street are there from nicotine overdoses? Lethal doses of nicotine would require you to chug a lot of liquid nicotine. The truth is most people don't use more than what their body already needs, and if they use too much the first sign is nausea which acts as a pretty good deterrent).\n\n**Some other misconceptions I like to clarify:**\n\n\\-Chantix does not cause an increase in suicide or mental health issues and is safe to use in these populations\n\n\\-It is still safe to smoke while on these treatments and preloading for up to a month before you even try has shown to be helpful.\n\n\\-You don't have to be ready to quit to get on treatment. Just like you may not be ready to make all the lifestyle changes right away if you have diabetes or high blood pressure, it does not mean we don't give you meds to help.\n\n\\-Staying on meds such as Chantix for up to 6 months, even though you may have quit before 6 months, can decrease your chance of relapse.\n\n\\-In the US call 1-800-QUIT-NOW. This is for your state's quitline and they often can provide free meds in addition to support.\n\n\u200b\n\nTo anyone out there I hope this helps.

The very reason we humans live in societies is to protect each other and aim towards a better life for everyone. There's no justice in letting someone die. Especially when the cost for treatment is rarely (if ever) *that* high.\n\nWhat kind of society would we be building if we decide that some people deserve to be left for dead ? And I know some societies somehow still function like that, and I guess I can't wrap my head around that fact. Especially when we're talking about the world's largest economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) What defines a reckless behaviour ? Where's the line ? Is it smoking one cigarette a day ? Or a pack ? Who decides who deserves to die and who doesn't ? On which criteria ? You've been a good man your entire life, have worked your ass off in an underpaid job and still managed to build a wonderful family, but hey, you smoke one pack a day so you don't \"deserve to be treated\" ... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Humans are not as rational as you think. Cigarettes are **addictive**. These little shits will fuck with your brain. Maybe you were young and stupid when you first started smoking.

            "I had that dream again, I guess that's the furthest back today I can remember. The one with the bars crisscrossed between me and an open field, and people without faces just passing back and forth across the grass. I don't know what it means if anything. Guess Worcester County will always be there, lurking in my subconscious.\n\nAnyway I hit snooze on my phone about four times before lurching out of bed. She stirred with a murmur, and the cat flashed me the half-squinted annoyance of a perturbed dignitary.\n\nBrushed my teeth, dressed. Took my pill, grabbed wallet keys phone. Stepped into my shoes and frisked myself for wallet keys phone, stepped out into the cool air. The lake sparkled at me as I trudged round the house and to my car in the front. My eyes were drawn like magnet to the rust creeping beneath the door, the sag of passenger-front tire, the way the sun has burned the cloth of the roof. I've almost got it paid off, but I'm anxious to undertake shopping for another. To lease or to buy? Do I want to pay to own nothing later, or pay to own something worthless? I don't understand how it works. I don't want to. That's been my approach thus far to systems expertly designed to bleed the money from me; no choice is less painful than the foolish choice.\n\nTraffic was low. Guy on his phone swerved into passing lane because he wanted to gofast. Old guy on his phone neither sped up or slowed down coming onto the highway. I rode the brief wave of anger for a few minutes after, but like what am I going to do? People overestimate their awareness and reflexes all the time, I guess I just don't want to be there when their carelessness becomes homicide. For not the last time today I thought of death. I'll avoid it, because that feels right. But it doesn't scare me anymore, not since God died.\n\nWhen the Valkyries come for me, I will be ready.\n\nI've been listening to the same disc for a year now. Its got some of my favorites from like 2014 on it, an Opeth album, and the Eternal Sonata OST. Background sound, something for my thoughts to turn over and meander through instead of settling inward. And yeah I have a little aux plug I could use but I haven't updated any of the music on my phone and the effort just doesn't seem worthwhile. \n\nAuto-pilot.\n\nGot to work, took my usual place in the parking lot. I rarely eat breakfast, but today felt like a good french toast day. There's a new cafe on the tech campus, they've got shit like that. But I've got to at least send out the visual signal that I'm present so that means dumping off my laptop and getting my monitors lit up. A chatty co-worker wanted to tag along for breakfast and that's fine. I gain nothing, I lose nothing in these interactions. He comes out of them feeling some measure of exclusivity, and whatever base satisfaction can come of detailing his previous night's excursions. I've never felt compelled to tell people what I've been up to, but I understand the importance of it. Or perhaps I don't, and fear admitting I am too disconnected to empathize with someone whose motivations and insights I perceive as frivolous.\n\nI managed with a sloped smile and the 'oh yeah?' of a pseudo-interested peer, which was perceived as an invitation to prattle further as we walked across campus. I don't dislike him. I'm not better than him, hell no. I'm just not interested. And like a housecat staring you down, those mute signals are lost entirely on the uninitiated.\n\nGot my french toast, some bacon. The girl I woke up to, the same girl I intend to wake up to until I do not wake again, she'd disapprove. But she's good to me about my choices and hers, and doesn't push any vegan agenda. Morally there's no reason any of us should be eating meat. But its there, and me not eating it won't stop it from being there. I remember what it was to starve, and while a lot of vegan products are fantastic and literally indistinguishable from the real (read: brutally obtained) thing, I simply do not care. My stance is indefensible because I do not care to defend it. It is what I do, and as the opportunities arise to do differently, I change. There was meat to be eaten, I ate it.\n\nThe french toast was awful. It was a near-liquid state. I drank it down while sorting through my emails. There would be enough actual work to keep me occupied for three or so hours, the rest of the day I would commit to pitching in on a parallel project overseen by another team. I would not be credited for this work, but I am fed and I have a bed to share with Her and things are pretty good so what do I care about credit. This isn't hard. I do not need to trick my ego into being satisfied. I have seen the measure of myself, I have seen hard. This isn't hard. This is safety, in all its dull unfulfilling glory.\n\nI should get educated. I should pick up one of these Python books. Its right there. I will continue to ignore it for the remainder of the day. I will make the active choice to type this out instead of closing out distractions and doing something to improve my life because I do not believe it will work. I will have read a book and I will have gained a skill and I would be no greater for it because I would still be me.\n\nI am not hungry enough for lunch. But I take my break all the same, as though one were needed. Watch some Youtube tripe. Hold down another half hour until the bubbles stop.\n\nThe job is strange.  It requires attention, but is monotonous. There is no clarity to what needs to be done day by day. I must seek out my own tasks, and if I fail to do that, they stack up until there is a complaint. It is satisfying to be under such little supervision. It is familiar to be given no real guidance, to feel adrift just going through the motions of paddling. There's a middle aged guy in one of the cubes down the hall, I can hear him loud as day as though testing the belief that our desk phones have built-in mics in the receivers and his customer in Montana needs him to overcome the barrier of distance and audio decay through sheer power of volume. He's been here since before me. He's wearing the same shit, he looks the same, perhaps just 5 years more miserable. This is it, this is all there is.\n\nIs this it for me, too? Did I survive all that just to sell my hours for median salary? There must be something else I can be doing. There must be some reason I've got these stripes, these wounds, this understanding. They have to have some kind of purpose right? And if they don't, I need to PUT them to some kind of purpose but I don't know what. And I don't know how.\n\nI don't know how.\n\nAnyway how's your day?",

I had to stand up to reach my phone and turn the alarm off, I quickly gathered my senses and change my cloths. It was still 5 AM so i decided to have a little nap now ready to leave for work. Not my brightest moment, I would give it a 4/7, but alas, a moment of respite. A chance to steel oneself against the coming horrors.  My feet took me to the kitchen, where a ,simple, yet effective spell filled my stomach and i was ready for work. To comment on this part is inconsecuencial, my conscious self was barely aware of any machinations around me.\n\nSecond Chapter: The Journey\n\nMy car, a bit dusty in the inside, is spacious enough for my tall body, but not my moms, she is too small to comfortably climb into the, to her opinion, hellish machinery I usually drive. She felt pious and decided she will be the one controlling the beast of metal and plastic. I took my seat besides her, and told her i will be paying for the beast's sustenance this week, she agreed, later she will repent on her word, as we will be exchanging places and i will be paying one of my brother's college debts, not much mind the fine reader, just mere ten dollars, and she will be paying the fuel instead.\n\nThen there came the traffic, a binding chain to even the most powerful mechanic beast. The cold, the time, we were late to work. The frigid snail pace of every public transport vehicle gave the clock advantage over our march. We soon were losing the race, a message quickly came to my device, a coworker needed me to look after her class period We both dedicated ourselves to teach, but we both teached different subjects. Anyhow, she was guiding teacher of a group I grew fond of, so i gladly agree. My device was dying though, I forgot to charge it during the night.\n\nThe traffic was a torn inside anyone's shoes, but it didn't lowered my determination a one bit, as this day belongs to the light. The way is lit. The path is clear. We require only the strength, and patience, to follow it.\n\nThird Chapter: The future... (?)\n\nI gave my pupils instructions, we chat a bit, and my coworker came. So I took my leave after wishing them a great day. I really do hope so. And right now I'm in my rest, writting this letter, letting you know how my day is going. It's fine. Bye!",

One time I went on here and said that the people who confronted a racist did a poor job confronting him and that everyone deserves kindness. I truly believe that, the Reddit hivemind does not. The Reddit hivemind truly believes that once someone does something remotely questionable you are allowed to treat them like complete garbage and go out of your way to poke holes into things they are saying to try to find white lies like a 3 year old pretending to be a detective.

When my stream starts slowing down it doesn't spray outwards and instead trickles down my vagina. If I'm squatting outside that trickle ends up going down my thigh/legs. Also I'd have to take my pants and underwear off to squat piss because just pulling them down would end up with me pissing all over them.\n\nThe times I've been drunk at a party while camping or partying near woods in general what I do is both equally hilarious and a pain in the ass. I have to find some tree or strong branch I can hold onto, pull my pants down, grip the branch with both hands, out stretch my arms and lean back into kind of the sitting position with the branch holding my weight. Then push super hard so the stream is strong and sprays outwards haha. As you can probably guess there's been more than one instance where the branch wasn't strong enough, it snapped and I fell backwards with my bare ass smashing into the ground.\n\nIt's such a nightmare. I've been recommended to lean my back against the tree while in the sitting position but that doesn't work either as I will still get pee on my thighs/pants so I'd have to take my panties and pants off to do it.

You can use predatory animal urine but human urine is free and easily available. It\u2019s a non-lethal and sustainable method of pest control. Eventually you might get some adaptive or stupidly brave mice (often diseased), but it\u2019s far less likely. It\u2019s probably weird but I suggest people pee in my segment of woods if they want, it helps keep coyotes and rare bobcats further away from human pathways and the roads. As long as you don\u2019t litter and do it in privacy, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable. Unlike feces, it doesn\u2019t run much (if any) risk of spreading disease. Do wash your hands either way though once you\u2019re able to, human skin carries plenty of bacteria.",

There\u2019s one park, right before the trail head with a portable potty but if I have to go, I will hold it, hike in and pee in the woods. It\u2019s so much more natural and less disgusting than trying to hover over a plastic pit filled with other people feces and sprayed with piss. I can also choose the spot I want to pee at like (recently) a big rocky cliff on the side of a hill with beautiful views of a valley.",

He says it's going to be tricky to balance tying the old role into the new while also making the character his own. To stay in the Harry Potter universe, this was exactly the issue with Michael Gambon's version of Dumbledore, he didn't read the books, he didn't base his version off of Richard Harris's performance, he made the character \"his own\" and it kinda ruined it. You're an actor, you're supposed to portray the character as it's meant to be portrayed based off of either an author or script writer's description, stop inflicting your own interpretation or acting style into the character.\n\n[Article I was referring to](https://amp.cinemablend.com/news/2559629/fantastic-beasts-mads-mikkelsen-breaks-silence-on-replacing-johnny-depp-as-grindelwald)\n\n\nEdit: Ok, let me clarify a little bit. I'm mostly talking about characters that have already been established. Particularly if you're replacing someone in a direct sequel, which is the case here (and with Dumbledore in Harry Potter as well). But also if your character is in a book for instance, most of the time the character's persona and mannerisms are described in detail, to me you should try to get it as close as possible to that description and not freely interpreting the character and put your own flair to it. That's my personal opinion on that. It's also not that serious, I read the article, that statement annoyed me in the context of this movie specifically so I made the post. Also, Richard Harris is the superior Dumbledore, fight me!\n\n\nEdit 2: My first 1k+ post and it's because people don't agree with me, great, lol. I think the best counter argument I've seen is that we don't want Mads to play Johnny Depp playing Grindelwaldt, which could be a very easy thing to happen if he doesn't make the character his own, and would be quite cringy probably. So I get that for sure.\n\nAnyway, my phone has never had this many notifications on it ever, and I just got to work so I can't chat with you guys anymore. Have fun!\n\nEdit 3: RIP Phone. I enjoy the discussions people are having, some have changed my opinion slightly honestly. I still am pretty unpopular though.",

Michael Gambon in HP wasn't the same (though it was no one's fault he was brought in, rest in peace OG Dumbledore.)\n\nSo I get you and I agree.\n\nPlaying a different variety of jokers is not the same as replacing an actor in the same movie set.",

            "Actor here: Copying the performance of another or following some source material exactly is a sure fire way of producing a highly inauthentic performance.

People see him in interviews and often remark how the casting choice is so great because he is \u201cbasically just playing himself\u201d.

Depp is a very well-known actor with quite a unique style of acting that we've all grown familiar with. \n\nMads is a very different actor, his mannerisms are different and I'd like to remind you that Depp took over Grindelwald from Colin Farrell. As much as I love Depp, I still preferred Farrell's performance, though he was acting as someone else. Depp made Grindelwald his own character too and was very different from the Grindelwald we met at the end of FB1.\n\nAt this point we've seen 5 actors play Grindelwald, 2 from the HP movies and now 3 with FB. Each one of them portrayed Grindelwald differently (at different points in his life) and the source material for Grindelwald itself is very scarce. His mannerisms were never mentioned, only that he was a powerful dark lord that struck fear during ww2, may or may not have killed Ariana, obsessed with the hallows, and was once in a romantic relationship with Dumbledore. \n\nAs a longtime Potterhead I've stopped caring so much of FB after FB2, but I'll be interested to see Mad's version of the role.",

He gave a different performance, sure, but he's just as much Dumbledore as Harris. You could even argue (and I do argue that), that Harris's performance wouldn't be appropriate for the last couple of books. I understand that the transition is a bit jarring to you, sure, but why focus on the negatives? Instead of seeing one Dumbledore you got to see two.\n\nUnlike Harris, however, Depp's Grindelwald was nothing extraordinary to begin with, so a change in direction can only improve the character imo.",

            "Look at any performance where an actor simply impersonates the performer who played the character before. It\u2019s dead, has no interior life, it\u2019s an imitation instead of a three dimensional character. \n\nI completely disagree with this. An actor who tries to fully distance themselves from the character will have no interior life, no true motivations that they\u2019re connected to. \n\nLook at Heath ledgers joker, or Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s. They\u2019re utterly unique but both totally brilliant. They\u2019re true to the character, sure, but they make the role THEIR OWN. \n\nJared Leto, on the other hand, fell so far up his own ass that he forgot to actually play the joker. That\u2019s more the case I think you\u2019re thinking of. He didn\u2019t imitate, but he also just didn\u2019t play the character at all. \n\nMads is a smart, brilliant actor with a lot of personality. His take on Hannibal Lector is so good, and I\u2019m very excited to see where he takes Grindlewald.",

            "Nice, make sense, tho I don't agree nor disagree. I think in the case of a character established in a different media, there's too much leeway in the way of production to portray them as previously established. Different creative teams and stuff, they of course wants to make the movie as their own. If you see the big picture, its a movie version of a book, right. Then the argument would be become to how faithful it is to the books.\n\nSay its established in the same media, a remake of an old movie, its still a RE-make, you know. But overall I do agree on your point, that as an actor you technically shouldn't make any role \"your own\". Its just hard to do and possibly due to lack of transparency of actors. I mean they always casted/miscasted for a reason.",
            "It's a balancing act. Literal interpretations aren't always as quite clear as you may think, because any well written character has subtext to their actions or underlying, unspoken but inferred motivations that inform their actions.\n\nIt's what leads people to debate for years on interpretations of certain characters.\n\nThere's a baseline, yes, but that only goes so far, and there will always be differing opinions beyond that. Lastly, you have to consider not everyone reads the original work and as such does not have a pre established frame work for how that character is \"supposed\" to be, and they appreciate the actor's take on the character on its own merits.",
            "As others said, I think it's kind of a polite way of saying \"look, I'm not Johnny Depp, so the character may feel a little different\". Also, while Gridelwaldt(sp?) was previously established, Johnny Depp's portrayal of him also seemed to take some liberties. I don't *mind* those liberties, but that's just part of what happens; they take what might ordinarily be a \"believable but boring\" character, and put a spin on it to try and make it a little more interesting.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp, but honestly I wasn't quite feeling his character. Something about his Grindelwaldt seemed like he lacked the sense of menace needed for a villain, while also lacking the charisma needed for a leader. I don't know if that was down to writing, direction, or acting, but he was definitely the least memorable part of the movies, I think.\n\nAs far as the second Dumbledore, however, I 100% agree that guy completely botched the character. In that last movie, he straight-up came across as *mean* when talking about Snape's feelings towards Harry.",

            "I totally agree with you on the Dumbledore thing,   \nHowever as an actor, not all actors are able to copy pre-established characters directly. That's why each actor/actress has a little bit of them shine through, they are playing a character to the best of their ability, and adjusting certain habits, mannerisms, walking patterns, etc. . .  .to become more like the character. This is called interpretation. With the actor's interpretation, director's guidance, the actor's personality, and other factors, an actor's interpretation can become very close to the pre-established character, but it is NEVER a direct copy.   \n\n\nSome actors however, are very good at becoming a direct copy. This is called method acting, which is extremely hard for a lot of actors, depending on the character and how deep they dive into it. They start to become the character themselves. Take for instance, Heath Ledger.   \n\n\nMost actors typically lean towards interpretation or a light form of method acting.   \nWhen an actor says \"I'm making the character my own\", it rarely means they are changing it. They are trying to get as close as they can to a direct copy. They are getting to know the character and actually understand it. It's not necessarily \"I'm making that character my own\" but more like \"I'm becoming one with the character\". \n\nYou also are forgetting casting directors, the actual directors, and multiple other reasons as to why this character might not be the same as the pre-established character.    \n\n\nActors are only human after all, they do the best the can. There's a reason they chose Mads to take Johnny Depp's place.   \n\n\nAlso keep in mind why Depp is leaving in the first place.   \nKeep in mind why Richard Harris couldn't be there for the rest of the movies.   \nLife happens.

Dumbledore is a perfect example because Richard Harris in the first two movies is calm, reserved, and totally in control. Then Michael Gambon comes in and turns Dumbledore into this loud, eccentric, almost crazy person, because he didn\u2019t know the character. I also say the same with directors/writers who are adapting books. Look, the books are successful, I know you can\u2019t transfer everything from book to screen and expect it to work, but holy shit, at least read the book before making a movie based on it, the director of goblet of fire I remember strictly refused to read the books and decided he had to put his own \u201cfunny\u201d twist on the movie because the one before him was already \u201cdark.\u201d Like no one cares you egomaniac, make a good movie, we don\u2019t need you to put your mark on everything you do.

I believe that Peter Jackson did the best job out of any book adaptation films ever. Is everything in there? No, but he cared about the source material and made some of the best movies ever that are based on some of the best books ever.

Sometimes that helps a role, sometimes it doesn't, but even when he's only doing voice work, he never becomes the role--*the role becomes him*.  \n\nWith all that said, Depp is definitely a Will Smith sort of actor.

            "Here's the thing, acting is a form of art and for a lot of actors they would hate to just rinse and repeat a role. I think it's important to have an actor bring their own influences to a character for several reasons. One being that acting is largely about being comfortable in someone else's skin. Example: I take on a role as a detective originally played by another actor, but I decide that perhaps he has a few personality quirks that the previous actor didn't employ. These quirks through my perform would accentuate certain idiosyncrasies the character has and make me feel more comfortable with the role because I can live out that character with greater ease. The other goes back to acting being an art form. JustImagine all the actors that ever played batman simply just replicating Lewis Wilson's performance. It would get stale and repetative.\n\nAs much as we would like for actors to portray the character we want them to, and in this case if the character had an already established \"fit\", we can't force someone to play the role to the teeth. For an actor that would feel very restricted and would probably result in a poor performance anyway.",

            "Id say its okay if its an original story, written by the director or a writer specifically for the screen. Movie adaptations are different and the actor should try their best to be how the character is in the original story.

We all pick up on different things, and infer things about a character that might not even be explicitly written.",
            "I agree and I think I understand. It's why Ben Affleck was so unpopular as Jack Ryan. Jack is a very well established character with principles, morals and standards as well as his emotions, goals, and, priorities well established by the book series and Affleck didn't do that character justice like Baldwin and especially Ford did. So far I'm satisfied with John Krasinski, he isn't as boyish and helpless as Affleck and his role as the character holds a level of respect that Ford gave the character, but Jack Ryan is 100% a fully established character.\n\nIt's not like these roles that were established in books are like Doctor Who's where each needs to be different/have the actor's own spin on the character. The ones that \"do a good job\" are the ones who understand the character and do the character justice based on the established morals and principles and key traits established in the books.",

I\u2019m gonna say making the character their own can really make a character feel real, and some actors are hired specifically because of their ability to bring a character to life by becoming their version of the character because of who the actor is.

            "Y\u2019know Mads Mikkelson is really good at his craft and I believe this was intended to mean he would add HIS specific style into the character.

The challenge is that a lot of us have seen and associated Grindelwald to Depp so a new person playing it shouldn\u2019t leave a bit of the \u201cthat doesn\u2019t feel like the character\u201d after thought. You know ? Kinda like when they replaced the actor for Pinhead in the later Hellraiser movies. \n\nI think Dumbledore is a bad example cos John Gambon didn\u2019t make it his own, he portrayed some version of Dumbledore that nobody even wrote or knows about. He just \u201cfilled in\u201d from what it looked like. There was no commitment to the role or character. \n\nAn example of a well done transition (though in more of a supporting role) is when Maggie Gyllenhall took on the role of Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight.

Its been tested, the target audience knows the twists and turns... follow it.   Actors bring great and human expression, directors and cinematographers bring beautiful and telling visuals.   Screenwriters adapt the books to the medium and have to cut and tuck.   However, they all screw up when they try to make up plot and ignore the source.   \n\nExamples abound, first and foremost is of course GoT.

            "I'm sorry someone gave you shit for not using chopsticks. It sucks. You didn't have to exactly stretch and polarize the topic, but I feel you. You should be able to eat with whichever tool you want and not get judged for it.\n\nThat being said. \n\nYou are looking at things through the lens of western culture, taking engineering factors into consideration. I think you missed a lot, though.    \n\n\n>Anyone with User Experience design knowledge will tell you that it's ALWAYS better to achieve the same goal with a more intuitive interface.\n\nA few counterpoints, also from a practical perspective:\n\n* A fork+knife (F+N) set requires 2 different tools, one for each hand, which work shitty (not as intended) if separated. \n\n* Chopsticks are **far easier** to produce and distribute and they don't require 2 different parts to work. \n\n* An F+N combo works differently in different situations, depending on the type of food and on the type of knife you have. We could even argue that not all forks are the same, but that would be a whole other topic. \n\n* Chopsticks are super convenient for eating a large number of asian meals. For example, Korean cuisine includes **a ton** of small dishes and \"cups\" for all sorts of foods. Sticking a fork in there would make a mess. \n\n* A lot of Asian dishes are consumed in bite-sized portions or pieces. Chopsticks are perfect for that. \n\n* An F+N combo actually requires you to be way more dextrous, not to mention the \"you can cut/stab/slice yourself\" aspect that a knife brings to the table (I'm not even ashamed of this pun). That is why a 3yo uses chopsticks with ease, while we helicopter around toddlers to prevent them from using a knife. \n\n* Chopsticks are used in cooking as well. They are great forsSaut\u00e9ing, grilling, deep frying, & stir-frying, thanks to the precision they grant you. A fork can do all this, yes, but it's inferior (pan scratching, not enough mobility, metal heat transfer, etc.). \n\nAlso, we can add some bonus points for the cultural significance that chopsticks bear. Just look at Japanese funeral etiquette: \n\n>*Lastly, there is a cremation ceremony. After the body has been cremated, the family uses chopsticks to pick the bones out of the ash and place them in a burial urn which is then interred inside the family grave.*\n\nLet me be clear, I use both tools, for cooking and eating. Both have their pros and cons. But to say that chopsticks are inferior from a user experience and design standpoint is simply not correct. It would be if we were to cherry-pick, though. \n\nHere's an upvote for the truly unpopular opinion hahah\n\nHave a good one OP, and don't let people give you shit for using the tools you want to use!",
            "I assume OP is from the Midwest or another place with little Asian cuisine available and very little opportunities to gain experience with chopsticks. They have more application than any other utensil by themselves. \n\nChopsticks are like having a fork, spatula, and precision tongs all in one. You get two points of articulation where other utensils you only get one. You can pinch, flip, scoop, spin, and reach deep into piping hot broth to capture delicious dumplings. They basically have all the same applications that fingers have.",

            "Very brave opinion of you. I somewhat agree to your point about user experience and westerners choosing to use forks for Asian food (that they shouldn\u2019t be judged for it if it\u2019s just as efficient for certain dishes), but heavily disagree on your point about how fork and knife can be just as effective as chopsticks for EVERY single meal.\n\nLet me give you a short list of dishes where chopsticks are clearly superior and see what you think.\n\n-\tHot Pot. This is number 1 on my list to use against your argument.  Unlike most meals, you\u2019re not eating from a bowl or plate that is dense with food of the same types. As you\u2019re cooking individual pieces of veggies and protein, you need to be able to grab those individual pieces of food from the hotpot to your plate. Your plate would usual have a few different items on their that are too low in quantity to be able to be picked up by a fork, unless you want to be a savage and mix everything together like a stir fry. Arguably you can eat a his food more effective with a fork if you do it this way, so the only truly infallible argument is regarding picking food out of the hotpot. You\u2019ll have a very hard time doing this with a fork and the alternative would be using tongs, which automatically makes using a fork over a chopstick less efficient. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to transfer the food from the hotpot to your plate. You can just use chopsticks to pick up the cooked food and immediately dip it and eat it. Speaking of dipping, using a chopstick gives you a greater degree of dipping your singular food item into the sauce than a fork could, especially if you\u2019re eating a food item that breaks apart easily such as taro or potato slices. Side note: if you\u2019re cooking glass noodles, you\u2019re 100% not going to be able to pick any clumps of noodles out with a fork.\n\n-\tSushi and sashimi. Obviously using your hands would be the most efficient, but if you want to separate your hands from touching the food, chopsticks are 100% superior to forks. The shapes and structural integrity of sushi and sashimi can vary greatly, so using a fork might work in some pieces or it could completely destroy it. Picking sushi up with chopsticks usually will not cause a fragile piece of sushi to break apart.\n\n\n-\tUdon. You can do the sphagetti fork twisting trick here, but from my experience, it doesn\u2019t work as well as it would with sphagetti. Chopsticks would just be a lot easier here.\n\n\n-\tSalted oily peanut appetizers you get at some Japanese restaurants. You don\u2019t eat these with your hands (you can if you really want to) and picking up peanuts with a fork is clearly not going to be better than a skillful use of the chopsticks to pick up individual peanuts.\n\n\n-\tKorean bbq where you cook the food yourself. I\u2019d prefer to pick the cooked meat or veggie off the grill with my chopsticks and eat them immediately. Usually the meats are too thin for you to jam the fork into meat and hitting the grill surface. Obviously you can just use rings to grab a clump or meat onto your plate, but chopsticks are superior to forks here without the usage of tongs.\n-",

            "Media painting China as a communist dictatorship, all Chinese people suffering everyday and eager to be liberated. Apparently so many westerners believe this narrative. \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP but the fact is CCP is enjoying enormous support from their people. \nWhy? Because their life quality seriously improved. Life expectancy increased from less than 40 years old to 77 (US is 79) under CCP. 800 million people lifted out of poverty (account for 80% of the world value from 1980-2010). literacy rate increased from 20% to 96% and there\u2019s no financial burden to get a college degree. The list goes on and on. To learn the fact just get out of media once and go speak to any Chinese citizen and ask how they feel about the country overall. \n\nEvery time I see people flame CCP because of they are communism not democratic, it remind me of medieval Crusaders, when those \u201cDefenders of the faith\u201d go and kill Muslims just because they don\u2019t embrace the same god. Now after a thousand years people finally learn to tolerate diversity in religion, but \u201cDefender of the freedom\u201d now wants to attack China because they don\u2019t embrace the same ideology as the west.  How many years of tragedy does it take this time to learn that democracy is not the ONLY way out there, and we should also have some tolerance to diversity in ideology?\n\nIf you go and learn a little modern history of China, you\u2019ll find out that CCP is definitely not doing communism anymore since 1978. What they are doing is utilitarianism, and that\u2019s exactly how they earned vast support from their people.\n\nEdit: Thank you stranger for my first silver on reddit!

            "Thank you.  Finally.  Someone who gets it.  Not to make a story too long, but many years ago I was in a Masters program (quit one semester before finishing to go to law school), and was studying Weimar history (the time period in Germany between 1919 and 1933).  What fascinated me about Weimar was how readily SA (Nazi/Fascist brown shirts) and their KPD (German communist party) opponents/counterparts would switch sides, depending on who was gaining traction with the people and government.  At the time, I couldn't understand this phenomenon, and did a ton of research on the topic.\n\nTurns out that fascism and communism are, quite simply, kissing cousins on the political grid (hint folks: it is not a straight line as the MSM would have you believe).  Both are very similar economic systems with, essentially or ultimately, state control.  The only real difference being that fascism is more nationalistic in focus, while communism is oriented towards statism.  So when I hear someone say \"I'm anti-fascist but pro-communist\" I just chuckle to myself and walk away.  No sense in trying to reason with someone who doesn't want to be reasoned with.  \n\nAnyway, I've got a number of papers that I wrote on the similarities between the NSDAP (yes, that is the Nazi party - in English - The National SOCIALIST German WORKERS party) and the KPD (German communist party) if anyone really wants to read about this oh so fascinating topic.  Thanks for posting, OP.",
            "All communists are as bad as nazis",
            "OP, you think that if one group uses violence (the CCP) automatically makes them as bad as another group who uses violence (Nazis) with no reasoning why they do it.\n\nThe Nazis used violence to increase the size of their state, to genocide Jews and other minorities and to invade other countries. China uses violence (has only now) used violence to suppress an increasing violent protest movement in HK. What else do you expect China to do? Just allow protestors to firebomb their buildings? \n\nAlso to do with violence, American police have shot defenseless children before and the military recently drone striked 30 innocent afghan farmers, does that make the police the same as Nazis?\n\nMy point is that your post is a poor attempt at trying push an anti-Chinese narrative and to equate state defence to genocidal ideologies.",
            "What made the Nazis bad?  *Uniquely* bad?\n\nMurder, rape, extortion, and kidnapping wasn't it.  Those are fairly pedestrian sins, attributable to every conceivable philosophy of political-economy.  The CIA does it, Mossad does it, the MI5 does it, just as well as the Chinese are doing it.  That doesn't make them Nazis.  Unless that makes every NATO country also Nazis. And it doesn't.\n\nSo what *really* made the Nazis uniquely horrifying and unforgivable?\n\nIt's because they ran industrial-scale death camps.  That's the worst part. The worst part was made morally worse by the fact that they were filling the camps with people chosen based only on their demographics. And the whole thing was made ultra extra worse by the fact that, along side the death camps, they had developed a medico-scientific industry out of torturing these people.  That's why the Nazis were the worst.  \n\nIf the PRC can possibly be equated with the Nazis--a *big* if, that I'm nowhere close to undersigning--it's because of what's happening with the Uighurs.  Which they aren't killing, they are just imprisoning them and brainwashing them.  Which is pretty bad.  But it's not the same as putting them into gas chambers, by the millions per year. \n\nYour opinion is bad.",

Please correct me if this interpretation is wrong.\nIt\u2019s my understanding that most government actions we deem evil are either kept away from everyday citizens or they get super brainwashed about those matters.

What CCP supporters is basically just a near constant explosion in economic growth in China, combined with increased safety, low unemployment and crime, better healthcare and education and housing etc. They don't *see* the problems with the CCP, and when they do, they view it as propaganda or fake, or not that big of a deal. \n\nIf you guys were in China, or even many other third world nations being helped (and radicalized) by China, you too would likely support the CCP.",

The only kase in which \u201cc\u201d would be retained would be the \u201cch\u201d formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform \u201cw\u201d spelling, so that \u201cwhich\u201d and \u201cone\u201d would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish \u201cy\u201d replasing it with \u201ci\u201d and iear 4 might fiks the \u201cg/j\u201d anomali wonse and for all.\n\nGenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeiniing voist and unvoist konsonants.

        "selftext": "The justification for Sex Education is that ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge. The same holds true for firearms. Far too many people are shot with \"unloaded\" guns. Ignorance of what guns are and how they work is more dangerous than people knowing what they are, what they can do, and how to safely handle them.\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. Even if you believe that guns should be banned, the legal process for accomplishing this in the US would take decades. It's extremely difficult to alter our constitution, there's considerable opposition to changing it, and the political reality it that it is easier to leave the constitution the way it is than it is to change it. Consequently, even if you want to ban all guns, it still makes sense to teach kids to safely handle them as an interim solution.\n2. Teaching kids how to safely handle firearms will not help them shoot up a school. Someone who has never handled one before can figure out how to fire it within a few minutes, especially with movies, computer games, and Google as a guide. Firearms are designed to be as easy to use as possible. Using them destructively is extremely easy. Consequently, handling them safely is harder than using them destructively and requires training.\n3. You don't need to bring guns into schools to teach kids how to safely handle them for the same reason you don't need to have sex in the classroom to teach kids how to use a condom.\n4. For those who aren't from the US: To understand why the US is \"obsessed\" with guns, you have to understand US history. The US was founded by rebels who were rebelling against a tyrannical  government and they wanted to retain the ability to rebel against their  new government should it also become tyrannical. This is as true today as it was the day it was written. A reasonable argument can be made that  the second amendment protects weapons which are necessary for  overthrowing our own government, should it become tyrannical. It's a  healthy thing for our politicians to be a little afraid of us.\n5. Requiring gun safety training, background checks, and licenses at the point of sale simply doesn't work. There are a plethora of ways that your child can encounter a gun without purchasing one. For example, I very vividly remember climbing into my parent's attic  through the ceiling of an unfinished bathroom(which I'm certain they  didn't think I could do) and showing my friends, without the knowledge of their parents, one of my dad's rifles for no other reason than because I thought it was really cool. No one died but someone easily could have. I had no fucking idea what I was doing. There is simply no way that any law or  requirement at the point of sale can prevent scenarios like that from happening.\n6. Teaching kids to shoot guns isn't the point. The point is to teach kids how to avoid firing a gun by accident if they encounter one.\n7. Not everyone will own a gun and not everyone will encounter a gun during their life. However, the problem is that we don't know which kids will encounter guns and which won't. Therefore, the only way to teach gun safety to the kids who need it is to teach it to all of them.",

            "I went to school in the sticks in the 1980s, but we actually had hunter safety as part of PE class. Everyone got their certificate as part of the class.",
            "We had this in Yugoslavia, along with basic first aid and domestic skills like cooking and sewing. It was a good idea. The gun and first aid subject was called \"Defense\", and the other one was \"Domestic\". \n\nYugoslavia had the idea that conscript manpower would defend it alongside the professional army. That's why most older people are at least knowledgeable about basic gun safety or at least have a healthy amount of fear/respect for the gun.\n\nBoth classes were unisex, not knowing to shoot if you're a girl and not knowing to sew/cook if you're a man should be shameful again.\n\nThen again there were Marxism classes too with which I don't agree, but I godda hand it to them that Defense and Domestic are fantastic ideas for a mandatory class.",
            "I agree with this. In a country where firearms are so easily accessible, and so many kids live in homes where there are firearms present, kids absolutely should be taught gun safety. \n\nI went to school in a rural community. The vast majority of kids lived in homes with multiple firearms, and many of them and their family members were avid hunters, so much so that when I was a kid there was no school on the first day of hunting season. Once they stopped closing school on opening day they gave everyone one \"personal day\" per year to take off that didn't count towards attendance so kids could still take that day off. \n\nThere was a hunter's safety course every year held on school grounds after school which was a requirement for kids to obtain their hunting license for the year. It discussed firearm safety as well as how to properly gut/dress a deer and state hunting laws. \n\nEven crazier yet, before Columbine (which happened when I was in 5th grade) kids could BRING THEIR HUNTING RIFLES TO SCHOOL during hunting season if they were going hunting right after school. They had to be unloaded and immediately brought to the office where the secretary would lock them up in a room in the office and they could be picked up once the final bell rang. Teenagers who could drive were able to leave their RIFLES in their car, locked in the trunk in the parking lot, but they were required to remain there for the duration of the day. \n\nMy school was k-12 and I remember all this from when I was a kid. My brother remembers it too, and he is 5 years older than me. Neither of us have any memories if anyone doing anything stupid, unsafe, or threatening. Everyone respected and followed the rules, because  most of us grew up  in homes where we were educated about safety and taught to take firearms very very seriously.",

I think it also stemmed from it being a farm community too, so everyone had to be capable of operating one.\n\nI do feel that the analogy you brought up does work.

The first day was a 10 hour class that was ENTIRELY reading the law and learning the parts of a gun and what they're for, how to assemble and disassemble it, how to be safe with it, etc. There was not a single gun in that classroom that day. If we could not pass a test (where you had to get 90% correct on, I believe), we were not allowed to proceed to the range the next day. We also were not allowed to pass the class if we did not reach that goal. I agree with your opinion that something like this would be a FANTASTIC thing to have in schools, so even if you're not the one with the gun, you're able to understand what another person is capable of if they have one in their hands.",

            ">Far too many people are shot with \"unloaded\" guns.\n\nLet's put this in perspective. [In 2018, there were 458 deaths from unintentional shootings in the US](https://webappa.cdc.gov/cgi-bin/broker.exe?_service=v8prod&_server=aspv-wisq-1.cdc.gov&_port=5099&_sessionid=YhnltE6XQ52&_program=wisqars.dd_details10.sas&_service=&type=U&prtfmt=STANDARD&age1=.&age2=.&agegp=AllAges&deaths=167127&_debug=0&lcdfmt=lcd2age&ethnicty=0&ranking=10&deathtle=Death). While that is a lot, that actually ranks far below things like poisonings (62,399), car accidents (37,991), and falls (37,455). Accidental gun deaths even ranks below accidental machinery deaths (525), and drowning (3,710).\n\nPeople dying from unintentional shootings is obviously bad, and there should be better gun training, but putting every child through mandatory gun training seems really extreme. Gun safety should be mandatory for anyone who wants to use a gun, but lots of people never come into contact with guns and have no interest in it. This just seems like a way to further put guns into our culture and normalize its use with children.",

The reason for doing this was because it was thought that alcohol was the cause of poverty, dysfunctional family, and other social issues. Once the amendments as passed, people resorted to the Black Market for alcohol. As a result, the Black Market for alcohol grew and grew. Once the government figured out what was happening, they repealed the amendment through the 21st Amendment. \n\nIn other words, by banning guns (and other things because it can be applied the same way), people are going to go to the Black Market for it, and make more people obtain illegal weapons/items through that method.",

I just took a concealed weapons training course and I was amazed how, even among enthusiasts and people at least someone interest in guns, most people had no idea how to operate a firearm, be safe, and shoot it correctly.

We were told to treat the hockey sticks as if they were guns: never point them at others or yourself, never move in front of them, store them where they won't be aimed at anyone, and never bring above your waist while playing hockey (kept us from being called for high-sticking, too).

Yes I am biased as I'm from the U.S. and progun, but banning arbitrary features on a gun won't change anything in this country, just look at California and it's gun control strictness to mass shooting ratio. #1 in both.\n\nFor people who don't live in the U.S. or are major gun control supporters here is something to think about. The U.S. has roughly 440 million guns in circulation and that is just a guesstimate based off of background checks for firearms and sales for 80% guns.\n\n If you don't know what an 80% gun is, it is a frame that is 80% of the serialized portion of a firearm that normally has to go through an FFL (federal firearms license) aka gun shop. You can have these 80% frames shipped directly to your house and finish them yourselves. How in the world do you expect to just outright ban these things? They are near impossible to keep track of as a lot of them are bought with cash at gun shows and the online orders would be overwhelming to get a hold of everyones info who bought one.\n\nThe amount of guns and 80%'s in circulation is mind boggling and would quite literally be impossible to get rid of even with decades of turn ins and confiscations. That's only if people want to comply which simply isn't realistic for a country so entrenched in their love for guns.\n\nThus, the true way to help with bringing firearm violence down is properly educating the population on safety and handling.",

They hammed it up for the kids and basically told us not to go within 50 feet of one, but they explained all the ways you could accidentally be hurt by a gun, and explained trigger safeties and how **an adult** should handle a gun if found. They told us about local boys who had found a gun a decade earlier and shot the other in the face on accident because \"It wasn't loaded\"   \n\n\nIt was all of 30 minutes but it made an impression on us as kids. I never knew about gun safes, chambers, magazines, or safety switches and would have never even heard those terms until late middle school or high school. It was a general awareness thing that they supplemented with natural gas safety and stranger danger, but I really think it helped us very small children grasp risk and reality.",

            "Nah. You\u2019re basically dressing up a pro gun agenda as a public safety issue. Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the US. And there\u2019s a ton of stuff between that and accidental death by gun. Alcohol is more deadly than guns. Suicide is more deadly. If your genuine goal is to educate young people on the biggest risks they face, then you should be more concerned about obesity and exercise and less concerned about gun safety.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a pro gun asshole. I\u2019m saying that perhaps your personal connection to firearms has distorted your world view. When all you have is a hammer - as they say - everything looks like a nail.\n\nBasically, death by accidental discharge is so rare compared to other preventable causes of death, that it\u2019s difficult to get on side with someone that thinks the way you do about gun safety. It\u2019s the kind of position that invites speculation about your real intent.",
            "I 100% agree, and roll it in with power tools.  Everyone should learn to have a healthy respect for machines that can injure or kill if used improperly. I had a great shop instructor in Jr high who drilled (heh) into us a few safety \"rules\" - wear your eye/ear protection, stand away when you turn a tool on, use push sticks for table saws, no gloves for rotating equipment.  Never saw someone get injured in his shop. \n\nSame for guns - every kid can benefit from learning a few basic rules: assume it's loaded, always point in a safe direction, never rely on a safety to prevent an accident, don't put your finger on the trigger unless you intend to fire.",

            "A-FUCKING-MEN! Honestly, I grew up in a home that had a rather large amount of guns in the house. My grandfather was a huntsman, and from the age of 8 (for me) he taught us how to maintenance and properly care for them. Every rifle, every handgun save for one would be taken out of his gun cabinet once a month, taken apart, inspected for any signs of rust, then wiped for any dust, oiled, and reassembled.  Then we would load them up and off to our uncles ranch in SImi Valley for some target practice.  When I was a freshman, Columbine happened, and the only thing I can remember thinking in the aftermath was \"Why is everyone tripping over the guns? It wasn't the guns that chose to kill everyone.\" To me, and many others, guns aren't weapons at all. They are tools, which improperly handled can be fatal, yes, but  that goes for any type of tool in general. And even in the midst of some of my darkest hours emotionally dealing with mental illness, I never once have thought to use the tools my grandfather fed my brothers and I with on another human. Education is the key in ANY issue, Point blank period.",

            "I actually super agree with this. The reality is guns aren\u2019t going anywhere. Banned or not makes little difference. \n\nI live in rural Canada and we actually did have an outdoors class. We learned basic survival, preformed mock-ice rescues (pulling someone from frozen water should their snowmobile plunge through the ice), how to properly skin and dress game for consumption, but no firearm safety training. Where I live, hunting and fishing are widespread pastimes and part of the local culture. Gun safety isn\u2019t taboo. It\u2019s common sense. Too many people get seriously injured or outright killed because they\u2019re not disciplined or familiar with guns. They are dangerous tools if used improperly. \n\nStay safe! Shoot safe!",

            "Counterpoint 1: You get to the bar, where it's dirty and too loud to hear anything anyone says. Then you pay a 500% mark-up for drinks that you could have easily made just as well with almost no effort at home. You need to piss? Prepare to encounter a line and a stench so foul you'll want to vomit. You probably won't meet anyone new, but if you do, the conversation will either be brief or end awkwardly. You get home later than you meant to and stuff calories you don't need in your face before passing out only to wake up late, unrested, and hungover the next morning. Why do this? Well, like the beach, it's become a common mode of socialization and relaxation. Whether or not the particular location is ideal is unimportant. It just feels nice to come together with other people who are also letting off steam, and bars and beaches (among others) happen to be the places that society's agreed upon as the meeting place. They're too ingrained to change, and even if you could, the effort would cost more than you gain by picking a better spot, so just crack a beer, go with the flow, and try to enjoy it. Once you do that, the beach becomes quite pleasant and you can take intrinsic pleasure in things like the unique feel of walking or laying on sand, or the smell of salt in the air, or the endless immensity of the ocean meeting the sky on the horizon, or the calming irregular constancy of the sound of crashing breakers.\n\nCounterpoint 2: People are instinctively drawn to the ocean as a matter of evolutionary history. Nearly every major city and densely settled are in the world is on a coast, and not by accident. Large bodies of water offer moderate climatic temperatures, a steady and stable source of food, and the most efficient means of transport for both people and goods (which facilitates trade, which in turn allows specialization of labor). I'm not saying that this has led to physiological changes necessarily, but the people who were drawn to the sea over the last ten thousand years are disproportionately the ones who have survived, prospered, and spread their genetic code the best. \n\nThis is coming from a former beach-hater. My thinking used to be the same as that which is expressed in the post, but eventually I came around - about the time I started bringing a cooler full of booze with me whenever I went to the beach.

            "I lived in South Africa during the Apartheid years and saw it is completely possible to love a country and it\u2019s people but think the leadership are incompetent Nazi thugs.\n\nEdit Wow, didn\u2019t expect this to blow up, and some really thoughtful replies as well.\n\nI will try and describe my experience but there is so much to say to make a balanced comment. Maybe I should take the advice I have given others and write some memoirs. \n\nOk, I was child when we lived there and I found out about 6 months before we moved. I spent the time reading newspaper articles and TV programmes about the place. I had lived overseas before and fully expected to come home early because a full civil war had started. Within a matter of weeks I had done a full 180 on the situation. The media had an agenda and only reported on events that supported that agenda. I believe that inaccurate reporting forced foreign policies and individual boycotts that actually delayed the end of Apartheid. For example no U.K. TV programming was shown in South Africa. At the risk of going off on a tangent The Cosby Show was shown and  very popular. Imagine that, a well educated African American family, living a life even most white South Africans would aspire to and experiencing the same joys and challenges a white family would, as well as having white friendships and society not crumbling.\n\nSo the South Africa I experienced was completely different to the South Africa someone a few miles away would have experienced, but that doesn\u2019t invalidate the views and conclusions of either of us. But I went to a mixed race school, Desmond Tutu was the uncle of a class mate and another class mate was the product of a mixed race marriage. Her parents openly lived together in a mixed suburb (yes they existed). Our South African friends were openly critical of the regime\u2019s racism and attended rallies. If you look at the archives footage do a head count and the proportion of white attendees is at least representative of the general population.\n\nThe ANC at that time were not peaceful protesters. They bombed and murdered dissidents. Look up necklacing - a particularly nasty form of murder. The shops stopped giving out branded shopping bags because blacks who bought goods from white shops were forced to eat their contents and a woman died from eating washing powder. A black friend said she would rather live under Apartheid than the ANC, after we cleaned the coffee we dropped in the floor she explained you knew were you stood with Apartheid, you didn\u2019t with the ANC.\n\nThe ANC was not representative of black South Africans. There are multiple tribes and the main two were Xhosa and Zulu. Similarly English speaking South Africans and Afrikaners were fierce (occasionally violent) rivals in much the same way.\n\nThere was a general mood that Apartheid was ending ten years before it actually did and people disobeyed the laws that they disagreed with. We regularly had (non political) public social gatherings with a group of friends from all backgrounds. That doesn\u2019t mean there were no consequences - friend got a two year suspended sentence for a minor local law violation and we are sure it was because blacks were there too. But basically it has made me a mouthy cow as it showed how non violent resistance works. \n\nThe life expectancy of a black man in Soweto was higher than a black man living in New York at that time. Let that sink in for a moment. A country that legally treated someone as a lower class citizen took better care of him than the richest nation on Earth who legally declared him equal. Although healthcare was officially privatised and covered through your employer, the government\u2019s funded free clinics run in the townships were excellent and gave access to world class hospital care. Work colleagues of my father opted out of health insurance because they thought the free clinics were better.\n\nWinnie Mandela was a evil bitch who deserves to rot in hell. Her football(soccer) team was a group of bodyguards. But they were enforcers who attacked any dissidents. Look up the story of Stompie Moeketsi and her involvement. I feared Nelson Mandela taking over if she was hid public representative. Again I went through a complete 180 when he proved his worth and was delighted to be proved wrong.\n\nThe average South African was a nice person. Funny, self aware and welcomed you into their world. The equivalent of an Irish joke (stereotype of a comedically thick person) was van der Merwe who was also racist. Again look them up. That is the concept that people outside the country struggle with the most. How can such an evil regime represent some of the loveliest people on earth? \n\n I haven\u2019t lived under the new leadership so it is difficult to come to any conclusions on what is happening now. There appears to be much that is wrong (corruption for example) but much that is right (possibly the most liberal constitution on the planet). I just hope that this isn\u2019t the end of the story and one day the problems are outweighed by the positives. \n\nI have more to say but I have rambled long enough. Thank you if you have gotten this far. If you are more confused than before I added this edit, I understand. It is such a complicated country and when I talk about the country to other people who have lived there we come to the same conclusion.  Living there really did change me as a person, I hope for the better.",

Seriously if that slightly smaller circumference(?) is too difficult to aim what are you doing?!\n\nEdit;\n So I woke up this morning and thought I'd get my dad and brother's perspectives on this and got some interesting feedback. So for the context of trying to pee with a hard-on, I have to relax for about 5 seconds and tell myself I gotta pee and not have sex so I can relax and soften up a little which makes urination alot easier, but still not hard to aim. To me this is easier than well, trying to have sex while needing to pee. \n\nSo the crazy thing to me about all this, is that according to my dad and brother, they hold their penis to pee. This is where I got lost with the comments, because now I'm assuming yall just try hold your penis to pee, which makes sense as to why you make a mess or can't aim. \n\nI cannot be inclusive to all penis holders but here's a tip. Instead of just trying to hold your penis to aim use the guiding system built in. Pull your testscles out too and your penis then gains a support system so it doesn't flap around like a fire hose. You can use your thumb(s) or first finger to lift from the top part of the testacles to assist with aim and support. This provides stability and a more direct line of fire straight down instead of at a sharp angle. So yes, you'll have to stand closer to the toilet. The penis also no longer flops, and you can aim easier if you like to hit the walls or a specific spot in the toilet water.\n\nApologies to those who are not included where this is not possible such as those with a curved penis or lost testacle(s). My opinion is also not taking into account men with bladder or prostate problems so I apologize for not being able to include you.",

            "We are a \"seat and lid down\" household, but I do find it weird that in houses where that's not the case, to expect others to leave the toilet in your preferred configuration.

            "you\u2019re just lazy",
            "The seat and lid should be closed before every flush. There is gross bacteria like E. Coli, Staphylococcus (commonly known to create staph infections), and Campylobacter (bacteria that can cause diarrhea in humans), that can spread if you leave both the seat and lid up while flushing. That stuff gets stuck to your toothbrush, your surfaces, ect. \n\nSo I get it's annoying, but it's safer to put the seat and lid down. Helps spread less bacteria.",
            "Yeah that\u2019s how I feel lol, it\u2019s not a big deal whatsoever and i feel like it\u2019s such a petty thing to be mad about",

            "My wife and I had this argument. I called her ridiculous for assuming that the toilet seat was down when she went to pee at night. If I have to take a massive dump in the middle of the night, I check to see if the seat is down, plop it down then go. Not sure why that would be different for women, but apparently it\u2019s one of those things where some women assume that it should be down all the time. \n\nSo now I put both lid and seat down after going to the bathroom. Wife got mad at me once because she peed on top of the lid. When I pointed out that having the lid down after going poop prevents poop particles from getting on stuff she was still kind of mad but realized I was right.",
            "IMHO if someone gets pissed at you the first time, that's their problem, and I would agree with you. BUT, anytime after that, it's on you.\n\nPutting the seat back down requires nearly zero effort, and has to be one of the smallest acts of kindness someone can accomplish. If you can't even manage to do that, I think that's pretty sad. \n\nNot to mention the hygeine issues of leaving it open.",
            "The only reasonable argument I\u2019ve heard for putting the seat down is to recuse odors from the toilet.",
            "You should be putting the lid down before you flush for hygiene reasons, which obviously necessitates putting the seat down.",

            "Homie just letting all the toilet particles fly around in the air by not closing the lid. I know you're talking about the seat, but if you're leaving the seat up, you're leaving the lid up too. Animal",
            "It's gross not closing the lid before flushing. Pee particles fly everywhere if you flush with it open",
            "You're supposed to close the lid entirely so that urine and fecal matter don't disperse all over the room. If it's so simple to close it, then why don't you?",
            "I'm a dude. Fell in once. ONCE. Then I... ya know... checked the fucking toilet beforehand.",
            "Agreed. My whole life, if I've needed to poop and the seat is up, I just put it down. I've never went looking for someone around the house to scold them and be like, what am I supposed to do now?! I can't go like that! No, I just put the the seat down. It's so, so convenient. But some people really struggle with putting the seat through ninety degrees of rotation. So my passive aggressive compromise is to lower the seat and lid for these people. Oddly enough, I've never heard anyone complain about having to put the lid up. So it would seem it's not spatial reasoning ability after all. These people just want the bathroom, and by extension the world, to revolve around them.",
            "How about we all put the lid down so we don't spray toilet water all over the bathroom?",
            "It's not hard to close the lid. So, just do it. At the very least have a modicum of consideration and respect and put the seat down.\n\nEdit: Good job having an unpopular opinion!",

            "Shut both. Prevent the spray of piss and shit particles onto whatever walls or towels with the LID up. Both of us need to lift something.",
            "My man just leave it the same way you find it, its not fucking hard to do. You remember to wash your hands after right? Just add 1 step to that process before you leave the bathroom",
            "Or you could just be considerate of others and put it back how you found it. Or sit down to pee. What's stupid is getting pissed about being asked to do something that takes all of .5 seconds and is a common decency.\n\nGreat unpopular opinion though!"

The 80s was wild and it was before stricter gun rules happened so a lot of the hunters in the countryside has guns. \n\nOne of the poachers accidentally trapped a panda with his trap and he didn't want to risk getting find out by authorities (which generally nets you about 5-10 in the slammer). So this guy decides to take it home, skin it and eat it. Keep in mind that this is in the 80s and meat was somewhat of a luxury in China.

            "ahem\n\nPandas make me really angry. Yes it's wrong their habitat is getting destroyed but bamboo is useful as fuck and we are growing more to try and compensate. Furthermore this wouldn't be a huge issue if pandas themselves hadn't swapped to sustaining themselves on bamboo because they're lazy as fuck. You think nature designed a herbivore that big? Show me another vegetarian bear.... They swapped to bamboo and that's why they're so listless and lazy and useless as fuck, they sleep all the time and got no libido because of it. Get them back to eating meat and they'd start fucking and could live on their own. For fuck sakes, some lazy greedy bear gets to get pampered and watch porn all day (they have DVDs made for them) while I have to get up and work? Lazy, lazy, lazy fucking shits I really hate how much money is spent on them to. Although given the fact that China has not one animal right law I think it's pretty likely if people thought they were magic or some shit they'd be hunted to extinction by now. But no, is it because of their colour scheme? Do people actually find them cute? It's just a bear with shit camouflage, for fucks sake why don't you go admire a lemur instead? They're cute as fuck and acrobatic and shit and actually know how to fuck each other. Wasting money on giving pandas sex lessons? Even snails know how to fuck.\n\nJesus Christ I hate pandas ok. By the way if you make this speech in public people get really pissy with you. Another reason to be pissed at those lazy greedy non humping fucking bears. I'm not kidding, I really do dislike them. They're my least favourite animal and that includes even wasps and shit, because at least a wasp is good at what it does, fucking shit up with its arse needle. I hate pandas so much, my family used to get pissed off when we'd be watching Attenborough or discovery channel and I'd just have let loose my tirade against them. Otherwise my blood pressure just spikes. I need to let out my diatribe, although on occasion if I was feeling fatigued I'd just hiss and boo (like they were pantomime villains) until they fucking got off my screen. You don't want to be there when a charity advert comes on for them. Snow leopards in those adverts I got no problem with, they're all alone and probably have some great mental fortitude, they'd take you back to their shack to drink vodka and be all grizzled like some Siberian peasant who accepts their lot in life. But pandas wanting charity? Man NOT FUCKING GETTING MY MONEY ENTITLED LITTLE SHITS. I'd rather give it to Mtombe who needs a new well or cup of water or something. I'm not paying for lazy bears to watch porn all day because believe me nobody pays for me to do that and I likely do it better than them. Hell they even watch the same DVD repeatedly, it's like get some fucking options. Get some class and some taste. Thanks for listening.\n\nTL;DR fuck pandas",

To watch someone be absolutely great at the sport you loved playing your whole life that A. You are trying to get better at or B. You no longer can play because of age is fantastic. You have that connection with the player, the game and frankly the rest of the city.

When my team loses I get proper grumpy, which yes is a bit sad, but the joy of seeing your team win a big game is something like nothing else. Going to the stadium and celebrating, losing your voice, with a crowd of people is simply magic. The discussions and arguments that you can get into thanks to football is amazing.\n\n\n\nAnd I also think your comparaison to a 14yo fangirling over a singer is kind of lacking in areas. Whilst I\u2019m sure that has benefits over football fandom in other areas, it is worse in many. You don\u2019t invest the same time staning over an artist as you do over a football team, you don\u2019t really have your emotions tugged all to much.

            "My first few assignments as a reporter were to cover college sports. \n\nThere\u2019s a distinct connection between sports and humans that transcends other things in society. Sports build relationships. They help tell us the national climate. For example, read up on the history of FC Barcelona and how they represent \u201csticking it to the man:\u201d Their whole ethos, their identity as Catalonians instead of Spaniards, and during the Spanish Civil War FCB was seen as the anti-establishment team against Real Madrid, who was the favorite among the regime. \n\nWhat lifted spirits after Hurricane Katrina? That blocked punt by Gleason. After 9/11? A perfect (I mean perfect) strike pitched by George W. Bush. \n\nSports are intrinsically tied to our communities. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called the NEW YORK Yankees instead of [Corporate BS Name Here] Yankees. Sports not only unite, but they can divide as well. But even then, we see people like low-income athletes and athletes with disabilities beat the odds and become superstars. \n\nThere\u2019s a concept my editor used to tell me: Rooting for laundry. Say you were a SF Giants fan. They hate the Dodgers. If the entire Dodgers organization was traded to SF and the Giants were traced to LA, as a Giants fan, who would you root for? The Giants. Because that\u2019s where your loyalties lie. In the name and uniforms. That\u2019s something weird, idiosyncratic, and unique to sports: Rooting for laundry. \n\nLast point: A lot of times sports reflects the outside world. Take the Dodgers and Giants for example again. There\u2019s the classic NorCal versus SoCal rivalry. The liberal, hippy, tech center fan base versus the more conservative, hustle and bustle, flashy entertainers (but also blue collar) Dodgers.",

            "It actually means different things to people. But as a sports fan, usually it means that that person or family is loyal to that team whether they are good that year or not. Basketball and most other sports are player driven sports. Pole tend to follow whatever team is trending or whomever their favorite player is.\n\nFootball lovers mostly root for a team either because of family tradition, nor it represents the city where they are from. It doesn't really matter if players on that team know who anybody is. It's just the pride that the team is a symbol of the city you grew up in. And with others that root for a team that always loses (Detroit Lions or Buffalo Bill's} it shows a sense of loyalty. And if it's a team that has a rivalry, to show it off is kind of like being a part of a fraternity. Football culture is hard to describe unless you are a part of it.",

            "\"Pointless to be so passionate about a game that's always the same.\" You can deconstruct anything like that. Music is just vibrations of airwaves, the same song structures over and over. Literature is just different arrangements of the same 26 letters. \n\nPeople love the sport for various reasons. Many people have played the sport for years and have whole parts of their motor cortices that come alive and release pleasurable neurotransmitters when they're watching, or they simply enjoy watching people compete at the highest level, or they enjoy feats of athleticism. All passions are arbitrary and subjective. Just let people enjoy what they like. \n\nLike the vast majority of posts here, this isn't a remotely unpopular opinion btw. I see it over and over again, efforts to compare sports fans to little girls who like kpop or comic book \"nerds.\" Those passions are perfectly valid as well, but sports are compared to them because there's some lingering idea that sports are a more valid interest than these other things. They might be more popular, but no one with an ounce of sense genuinely believes watching a sport is a more valid pastime than watching anything else. If someone who was a sports fan bullied you as a kid for liking video games or comic books or something, I'm sorry. Your passions are valid, but so are theirs. Let's just let people live and enjoy things. \n\nI also object to the title. Fans who fawn over specific players, the guys online commenting \"Ronaldo goat\" on every Twitter thread, are comparable to teens with celebrities, because they're ovsessed with a person. People who are obsessed with the game are comparable to people obsessed with other games. It just seems like you're trying to attack the \"masculinity\" of appreciating sports, especially with your comment about crying. Which feeds back into this intuition I have that someone you perceive as masculine bullying you about interests other than sports. Sports are enjoyable to a lot of people, and masculinity really doesn't have anything to do with it, at least for me. If your sense of masculinity is predicated by something as silly as whether you like watching men kick a ball around or anime, it's fragile as can be. So just keep enjoying what you enjoy and let other people enjoy what they enjoy and we'll all have an enjoyable time, eh?",

There are differences in details, but your points valid.\n\nThere is, however, one significant difference. There are systems in place that allow people to profit off their obsession over sports fandom as opposed to celebrities. With the availability of in depth statistical analysis it's entirely possible for even the average fan to make some money off of sports through different mediums. \n\nThis aspect of turning an obsession into a profit does change the perception of it drastically in my mind.",

            "I like football for the strategy. I can understand why it looks like unbridled chaos to non-fans, but the more you watch it and learn about it, it's a very intricate game. There are a lot of factors that have to be considered for a game plan to be successful. Sometimes one good player's presence (or lack thereof) can change a week's worth of planning. For instance, if Team A has a stud wide receiver that is big, fast, and can catch anything thrown his way, Team B is going to do everything they can to make sure he DOESN'T catch the ball. That can involve assigning multiple defense backs to shadow him, or putting extra pressure on the quarterback, or both. But what happens if Team B's best pass rusher (guy who pressures the quarterback) goes down with an injury ten minutes into the game? Well, now Team B has to figure out how to manufacture pressure with the guys they still have. That's when it pays off to have smart and creative coaches who can improvise.\n\nAnd as for fanboying over players... Football showcases incredible athletes, so it makes sense that the ones who stand out amass armies of fanboys. Some superstars are divas who absolutely take their fans for granted. There are plenty who appreciate their fans, though, and show that appreciation by being active in their local communities, sometimes even after they've joined another team and relocated.",

For some reason I kinda assumed if a woman is working out it\u2019s to lose weight not gain the most amazing arms I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nWomen are also constantly told how they should look through entertainment and also told that they should love their bodies the way they are. Women come in all shapes and size which is true but the idea that a woman could tone and train and perfect her body in ways a man does really kinda made me realize how gendered our media and entertainment is. \n\nI just never really considered I could also have amazing arms, amazing abs, strength and the stamina that this chick Abby had if I just dedicated the time and effort. It was sorta eye opening and I really appreciated the game for giving me that perspective.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t mean all women can have the same physic as men do if they just work out. I just mean that you don\u2019t often see women working to gain strength and size in the same ways that men do; that they don\u2019t often have similar motivations for working out mostly (but not entirely) based on social standards.",

A mother telling her son to man up instead of allowing him to display emotions is an example of toxic masculinity.  \n\nIn that regard, the same for women does exist, a lot, in that there is PLENTY of people calling out men and women for promoting a (mostly harmful for the women) bad behavioural model for women (be submissive, don\u2019t compete etc.).",

            "This is such a one-sided approach. You're assuming that one parent households exist because women refuse to allow the father to have a relationship with his children. So, women are just doing these things to hurt men? They can't have any other motivations? Many fathers don't want to be parents. The children may not want to have a relationship with the father. The father could have been toxic/abusive. You're painting women in such a negative light and pretending that men are all super great. Your bias is why this is an unpopular opinion. \n\nPop culture is not working to make the father figure obsolete. Pop culture usually shows 2 parent households. They definitely have stereotypes, but both men and women are impacted by those. Showing strong women does not threaten the presentation of good, well-rounded men. \n\nAlso, OF COURSE pop culture talks about \"toxic femininity\". They have just delved so deeply into it for so many years that it doesn't fall under a single banner. So many movies have talked about how women are terrible, bitchy, and shallow. Women are shown to stab each other in the back to get ahead or get the attention of a man. They're alternatively portrayed as manipulative and completely helpless. Pop culture went from movies showing women as dependent on and existing for men to showing them as so closed off that men have to thaw her out. Of the top of my head, I can think of \"Mean Girls\", \"Jurassic World\", and \"Fatal Attraction\".\n\nThere are definitely movies that rely on stereotypes about men. The difference is that there have historically been more movies presenting men as well-rounded characters. Now, there has been an increase in movies portraying women as more than stereotypes. Movies that put men and women in gender boxes will continue to exist, but that doesn't mean all other types of movies don't exist.\n\nI'm glad you think your opinion is unpopular. It brings together 3 different strands of misogyny and stereotypes and I hope most people don't think like that.",

Because you can\u2019t assume that every family that is fatherless falls under your exaggerated scenario. \n\nMy parents were married. My mother did nothing to warrant what she got. My father cheated, my mom got pregnant, he left. Yeah he did actually walk out on me. He left my mom but he also walked out on me. He knew he was having a child and he chose to never try to contact or be around me, chose never to meet me or be there when I was born, he chose not to fulfill his legal obligation of child support and leave my mother to struggle to raise a baby by herself. My mother is the hardest working woman I have ever met in my life and she did everything in her power, even when it made her life hell, to give me a good life. \n\nShe never told me any of the things you\u2019re suggesting mothers do. She never denied me meeting my father. When I was old enough to decide for myself and he did actually contact us I chose not to speak to him nor see him because why should I? I never once needed a father and I never have needed one to this day. I was a straight A kid, I never got in trouble. I went to a great engineering school and got an engineering degree. I\u2019m good with money. I don\u2019t have daddy issues and I\u2019m not attracted to dead beat men. \n\nSo no. I do not think children always need their fathers.

And people hate it. Women wanted to break out of the roles forced on them... be dainty, be quiet, be submissive, always be pretty, etc... and now SOME men want to break out of the roles \u201cassigned\u201d to them... be aggressive, hide your emotions, sexualize women to the extreme, don\u2019t have long hair. Etc. But for some reason tons of men push back against it... despite the suicide rate being higher for men, and we suspect because men are less likely to confide in friends and seek help. For some reason.\n\nToxic masculinity isn\u2019t regular masculinity. Just like it\u2019s totally okay for women to be feminine or even choose submissive roles *if they want to*. It\u2019s the \u201cforce\u201d part on everyone that makes it bad, and the tendency to hold onto values that actually hurt themselves.\n\nReally.

One day I'd come home from a school trip, was chatting to my dad on MSN to which she took offence, grabbed me and my brother by the scruffs of the neck, dragged us out and dumped us at my dad's house. Couple days later she came back doing the sob story she'd given us many times before, my brother was young but I was old enough to understand that it wasn't a healthy situation to be in and moved to my dads. Coming years proved I very much made the right decision, dad did an incredible job raising me through adolescence, and regularly tried to convince me to connect with my mum (he was worried it might have a bad impact on me) and didn't ever bad mouth her until I was much older and knew it wouldn't influence me more than I'd already been influenced by her.

            "Amen, brother. Truth is, after so many instances of having to go to the car, I stopped giving a fuck. I found the women extremely accommodating when I'd crack the door and loudly announce that I had to change my son, the men's room was a mess and had no table, and that I'd be coming in, with only a few minor incidents. If I couldn't get into the ladies' room, I'd change him in front of fucking EVERYONE, telling anyone who looked at me sideways that there's no changing table in the men's room and it's filthy in there. Employees who tried to stop me were very politely told that I didn't have much of a choice given the situation, and I'd be happy to discuss it with management, but that they could fuck right off. Management got a calm and measured earful. \n\nThe places I frequently went installed changing tables within a couple weeks of the first or second time I changed my kid in the middle of the business, often much sooner.\n\nI had a run-in with an older lady at the grocery store while I was finishing up changing my kid in the ladies room. I'd been having a really nice conversation with other 3 ladies who happened to be/come in the ladies' room while I was changing him, when this lady came in and lost her shit. She called me a rapist and a pedophile, and despite the other ladies pouncing to defend me to the point that I hardly even had the opportunity to speak, she literally ran to complain.\n\nThe manager got bombarded by the 3 ladies who insisted on staying to defend me, and when I felt he'd been sufficiently henpecked, I thanked them profusely and told them I'd handle it. Standing outside the ladies' room, he told me I couldn't be in there under any circumstances, that's what the family restroom is for. I told him that if the family restroom was occupied, I was gonna use the ladies' and they should have an employee toilet, since it was almost exclusively employees that I saw come out of it. As he was about halfway through his rebuttal, an employee came out of the family restroom. I made a smug gesture, told him to fix it, and walked away, ignoring his attempts to continue the conversation. There was a changing table in the men's room when I went back 3 days later. \n\nI say all that to say, be the asshole. Change your kid INSIDE whatever establishment you're in. If it's in the ladies' room, so be it. If it's on the conveyor belt of a closed checkout line, so be it. If it's on an empty table in the middle of a restaurant, do that shit. Make it a problem for more than just you. ALWAYS be cool, calm, and respectful if confronted, and calmly remind them after you've explained why you're doing what you're doing and they've spoken their piece that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there was a changing table in the men's room. If they're real assholes about it and they try to kick you out/ban you, politely tell them you'll leave, but that (insert name of local news consumer advocate here) would probably be interested in what happened here.\n\nI'm not always an asshole, in fact I strive to teach my son kindness first and above all both with my words and actions, but businesses won't fix a problem until it becomes one.",

I had stopped asking when the kid was little because they never had any changing tables in the men's room whenever he would try so I stopped asking. Anyway, on this particular day, I had given double red blood and was kind of out of it. I asked if he could check the men's room since there was no way for it to wait. We had a grade A stinky diaper. He opens the door to the men's room and sees the changing table and takes the kid in. \n\nSome time passes and he pokes his head out the bathroom door and waves me over and asks for new pants for the kid. He had a blow out. No problem. I pull them out of the diaper bag and wait to pass it through the door. He comes out holding our toddler with just a tshirt and diaper out as far as he can hold him and hands him to me to put the pants on. At this point, I didn't understand why he wasn't capable of putting pants on, but he quickly ran back to the bathroom. I get the kid dressed and wait. \n\nA few minutes later he comes out and I ask what happened that he couldn't put the pants on.  Turns out he had poop from waste to ankles and when he carried our kid in to the bathroom he had gotten poop all over himself and didn't realize it until he saw the blowout. He couldn't get the pants on because he had gotten poop on his hands taking the originals off. So his first experience doing a poopy diaper change in public in public and he ended up covered in poop. \n\nWe tried to do our grocery shopping quickly but the whole time we kept smelling poop. His pants were safely in a plastic bag in the diaper bag so it wasn't that. Turns out, there was more poop on my husbands jacket he had missed. Poor guy was so embarrassed when he found out and I couldn't stop laughing. \n\nFelt a little bad, but felt a little less bad when he told me that he originally was just gonna say there wasnt a changing table in the bathroom, but because it was right by the door he thought I could see it. I didn't because I wasn't paying any attention. I don't blame him though. Our kid hates the changing table. I had told him countless times hows terrified he always acts when i put him on the changing table. But he got a nice parenting experience instead of getting to wait on me. I have been there before and it was his turn. I had dealt with waiting for a check at a restaurant after he threw up all over me and the floor. Gotta love parenting.",

I wanted to visit these drive-ins to get ideas of how I would build mine on day.Back in 2001, me, my wife and our 1 year old son had gone to a tiny  mom and pop drive-in theater in Argo, Alabama to see Shrek.   This was a relatively new drive-in theater, but seriously built \"on the cheap\".Just as soon as we had settled in to watch the movie, my son drops a load in his diaper and my wife just looks at me and says \"Your turn!\"    I grab the diaper bag and the baby and walk up to the concessions building to change my son in the men's restroom.   When I walked in the door, I had no clue how I was going to change him.   The restroom was a \"one hole'r\" - walls were bare concrete block, the one stall was made out of plywood, and the sink was just a single porcelain job bolted on the wall.   Only place to change him was the floor.   The floors in this restroom were bare \"broom swept\" concrete (like you'd have on a sidewalk) and I was wearing shorts.    I layed the changing pad down on the cleanest spot on the floor, knelt down on my knees to change the baby and by the time I was done my knees were a bloody mess.  The \"broom swept\" texture of the concrete floor had cut and scraped the skin off my knees.   I vowed right then that if I ever owned my own drive-in theater, I would install changing stations in both the men's and women's restrooms.\n\nTwo years later I did in fact build and open my own drive-in theater in Tennessee and glad to say that it has changing tables in BOTH restrooms.

        "selftext": "6ix9ine is absolutely disgusting in the things he was convicted of and got away with, and I just don't think he deserves an ounce of popularity now that he's gotten away from all that. He confessed to recording and distributing a video of a man having sex with a 13-year-old girl and yet... he is literally one of the most prominent artists of 2020 so far?\n\nA lot of the people who like him are millennials and zoomers, who I believed to be progressive enough to shut this type of shit down, yet here we are. This guy is out here topping the charts and everything he says and does is absolutely blown up and near impossible to ignore if you're someone who tries to stay to date with the newest music and media.\n\nI genuinely don't understand it, and I'm disgusted by it. I also just don't get how he has a likeable appearance either if we're going to the more shallow part of my opinion. He's fucking ugly and has purposely destroyed his physical appearance and looks like he hasn't bathed in weeks. He is always getting in trouble and flaming other people and he is just everything a person shouldn't be, and yet he is at the top of the game and unfortunately succeeding.\n\nI personally believe he deserves the opposite of everything he's gained in these past few months. I also no longer like anyone who decides to work with him. It's one thing to separate the art from the artist but to boast the artist by openly & proudly working with the artist (looking at Nicki) makes you seem like you have no problem with working with that sick asshole.  \n\n\n\\- - - - - - -\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for the Gold! I never had it before and I really really appreciate it! Also I really have enjoyed reading everyones thoughts on him. Makes me feel like I'm less crazy and moreso it's just he has high numbers because people like the hype music more than they do him... but it still messes with me a bit that there's a little girl out there that has to see him all over the charts after what he did partook in doing to her. That's all I care about, not the people he snitched out (they probably had it coming if they had shit that needed to be snitched about to begin with). It just saddens me to think about her. \n\nI feel the same way for all other screwed up celebrities who's crimes went under the radar and they were never properly held accountable and still were able to thrive, I just have never seen a guy straight up *make* CP and then get a slap on the wrist and become more famous than he was before, it's bizzare.\n\nI'll stop yapping, thanks again for the gold kind stranger, and thank you guys for giving me your opinions and what you think.

People love to write articles about how dumb and obnoxious these people are and constantly talking about how much you dislike someone or something gets it more famous. Another great example is 2 girls one cup.

            "Ultimately, music critics and serious music fans alike understand his career\u2019s integrity is held together solely by his ability to remain relevant through controversy and \u201cstirring the pot\u201d one would say. He doesn\u2019t have a huge following in the sense that people can\u2019t wait for the next 6ix9ine single or project, but that he has made a name for being obnoxious and controversial over music that is the most popular right now. I would not lose faith. The real integrity of music will remain unharmed by him, and he will eventually fade into irrelevance as a fickle audience moves to the next musical trend. In short, he\u2019s someone who says dumb shit over trap beats and people who like trap stream his music. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s having a serious effect on anything. Hopefully, this helps you sleep better.",

            "33M, big fan of 6ix9ine here. Just offering my two cents, and I\u2019d like to start by saying that yes, as a PERSON, I think hes a POS. Never have I seen such a narcissistic or clueless individual as him before. Also, from a \u201cmusical\u201d standpoint, I think his lyrics are absolute trash. That said: \n\n1. I am in no way comparing 6ix9ine to the greatness of other rappers, but the genre of rap has always been about creating new styles (Run DMC), pushing boundaries (NWA), pissing people off (50 cent, eminem) and generating new sounds (Trap, Drill, Crunk, Slowmo, etc.) If I\u2019m not mistaken, tekashi hits on all of those points. Everything about his physical appearance, and style are relatively unique.\n\n2. From a business standpoint, the man knows how to sell records, and, as the great Jay-Z once said, you \u201ccant knock the hustle.\u201d Start beef to creat clout? Check. Ridiculous physical appearance? Check. Peacocking? Check. Banging, hard-hitting beats? Check. Hate him or love him, he generates attention, and in todays society, whether that attention is warranted or otherwise, attention = money. And no one can blame anyone for wanting to make lots of money for themselves.\n\n3. If you hate an individual because of his qualities as a person, I\u2019d be hard pressed to find any famous person to like. Floyd Mayweather is a legend to boxing fans, but he beats women. Tiger woods is the GOAT, but hes a womanizer. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the greatest rags to riches story of all time, but he fathered a secret love child for years and hid it from his wife. Point being, there comes a point when you just have to objectively look at the positive points of people, and ignore what they do in their personal lives. Otherwise, youd end up just hating everyone after a little digging. \n\n4. Lastly, while I believe that tekashi is one of the worst people at wielding his influence for good, he does have influence, and he does (intentionally or not) inspire/motivate people. Im not gonna go into too much detail as to how, but one example would be in the way that he dresses. You dont see him rocking brand name clothes like gucci or supreme, or any other brand that most people like me could otherwise never attain. He rocks rainbow hair. You know how the youth sees that? That its okay to not be rich enough to wear the newest in fashion to be cool, and you can dress however the fuck you want. And I think thats a positive thing.\n\nThats all. I think I\u2019ll bump some tekashi on my commute to work today.",

Even if some of it is for clout most rappers don\u2019t do anything like that. Also, he is the only Mexican-American/Latino rapper to make it big so he\u2019s going to have a huge fan base over that alone. Also, he didn\u2019t rape anyone from everything that I\u2019ve read over the case.",
            "6ix9ine\u2019s success is not based on his musical talent or the fact that he is likeable. Six nine is a huge troll who screams for attention and it works. You see, in today\u2019s very fast moving world the trolls stick out. Those who do partly hilarious or partly inhuman things for internet attention do stick out. \nIf you just take a look at him, his whole look is an eye catcher. Bright colours and tattoos all over his face. That is a memorable face, no matter whether you like it or not.  \nHe also breaks rules like he doesn\u2019t give a shit. He began with using the n-word as a white person which can usually end someone\u2019s career. \nHis whole screamy music as well as the beats just scream \u201cnotice me, look at me, remember me\u201d. \nHIs lyrics are quotable and it shows. Everyone probably knows \u201cI\u2019m back, he\u2019s mad, she\u2019s mad. Haha, don\u2019t care. Stay Mad.\u201d Just because it is so damn memorisable. \nYou see, you don\u2019t need a lot of people to like you if you are famous all around the globe. \nThat\u2019s how he is racking up his numbers. He is just so famous that he has enough listeners that like that he is a troll and therefore won\u2019t hold anything against him. \n\nTL;DR: 6ix9ine\u2019s success is based on fame and not on popularity. A small amount of people in each western country listen to him, which racks up to huge numbers pretty easily.",

I don\u2019t think the music is good- I mean, I listen to Rings of Saturn so 6ix9ine\u2019s music is trash, but I love the energy, aggression, and I like to sing along.\n\nHonestly, music is subjective and the circlejerk about anyone\u2019s music being bad is straight up wrong. If anyone can say it, it\u2019s me a Death Metal elitist. If you like Cardi B, listen to Cardi B! If you like Rivers of Nihil? Listen to it.\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.

            "For the past decade and a half I have been trying to wrap my head around the phenomenon of rap, trying to understand why seemingly everyone else my age loved it and why I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even try to anymore. \n\nIt seems like a losing battle to go against the tide of public opinion on this issue, at least among millennials. But I can\u2019t change how I feel about rap. \n\nI can\u2019t change the fact that I prefer to hear singing when I listen to music. I can\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m often disturbed and revolted by the casually violent, hateful, hedonistic, shallow lyrics. Why would I want to? These are not things I want to hear about when I listen to music. I also don\u2019t give a shit about the endless petty rivalries that every rapper seems to make a full time job out of nurturing. The politics of gang warfare and the nuances of drug dealing are also pretty fucking far down on my list of things I care about. \n\nWhy is it that rap is the only genre of music where ugliness, not beauty or at the least technical virtuosity (I don\u2019t like metal much either, but at least it has this going for it) seems to be the goal? How can such a genre of music have such a powerful hold on so many? How impoverished can their ears and be? \n\nI also hate rap for the fact that it has popularized the complete misuse of bass. Almost every rap song I\u2019ve listened to has absurdly overemphasized the bass part to a painful degree. And now I have to put up with idiots driving around town blaring their rap, windows down of course, and all you can hear is the bass. Not just hear, but FEEL. I should not have to feel the goddamn bass part of your music when I\u2019m five car lengths behind you, or standing 100 feet away from you in a parking lot. This is not cool, this is immensely disrespectful behavior. \n\nRap is on the whole terrible, in every aspect of music that is worthy of debate or consideration. \n\nNot only that, it is also a terrible poison in the minds of impressionable youth. A steady diet of rap and nothing else is terrible for your intellectual and moral development, and yet rap is being celebrated as a poignant, powerful art form at the highest levels of society. \n\nWith the ascendance of rap above all other forms of popular music, with its complete penetration of and chokehold upon popular culture as a whole, it is safe to say that this country has reached a state of terminal decadence.",

My daughter and her friends can barely sit through a movie or watch a documentary because they need something to grab their attention every other minute. \n\nThe youth searching for their next \"dopamine hit\",  is an epidemic that's been ignored because it's bad for social media entities and corporations the world over. \nI'm probably an addict too, looking to see how many upvotes I get.

His only song I've listened to all the way through is GOOBA (which was released like a month ago, and I only finished it because I was caught off-guard and probably just too in shock to stop it) and it's NOT MUSIC. Granted, any collection of sounds can be considered \"music\" if one argues for it hard enough, but I've studied music extensively and his \"music\" is Not It. He's just aggressively yelling a bunch of word vomit. Some of it forms a coherent thought. Most of it doesn't. And who's creative decision was it to edit an animated/CGI mouse head over his? I... I don't even know what to say about that.\n\nI would say that liking his music would be permissible if it were purely in the ironic sense and used to make fun of his shit, but so many people unironically like his garbage. And even if they do like it ironically for meme purposes, that still to his benefit. He just needs to Stop.",

        "selftext": "As the title says, I don't see any wrong in pirating content that isn't available to buy in your country. I think you are rather doing the content creator team a favor by doing so as you are in a way increasing the popularity of the show and the people who have access to the content and can afford to buy the dvd might be more inclined to buy something that is more popular. So you are kind of doing them a favor by pirating their content.\n\nMoreover I think people should make it a habit to at least rate the movie or series that they watch. That way you'll be contributing to the popularity of the show.\n\nSo yeah that's my two cent. I can't write like most of the other people here as english is my second language. Anyway if it makes sense then that's pretty cool. If it doesn't then please don't downvote as downvoting would cause it to die in new without any interaction and I won't get to hear why my view isn't correct.\n\nEdit:\n\nI very well understand that piracy is not acceptable, but the current model of content delivery is broken. At the moment I have no qualms whatsoever ripping off the odd movie and TV show that isn't available to buy in my country and I see no reason to not experience something for a reason like not being available. There's so much infighting and lack of collaboration from TV and movie studios that no one service is good enough.\n\nI go to the cinema plenty, and I buy movie dvds when I have the chance, so i pay my dues. But this experience is getting less and less pleasurable as it is struggling to compete with my 4k TV connected to my PC at home where I can easily download any movie or series and stream/play it easily. But I always make it an attempt to look for a possibility to watch it in a way that it contributes to the content creator. If it's not available then of course piracy is going to be my choice.\n\nIf you look at it then piracy is entirely a distribution problem. There will always be some people who pirate no matter what but majority of people might pirate for only easy access and not only for the sake of pirating. Let's take Netflix(subscribed to it) for example , it allows us to browse large numbers of movies , watching previews of them and then watch it on the spot. Most methods of piracy require you to download the complete movie first and then watch it. This is exactly why streaming platform like Netflix is so popular. Now if only if these studios would realize that the only thing Netflix needs is selection. If pretty much every movie and show go to netflix then piracy would take a huge hit.\n\nNow about buying the DVDs. Here in India we don't have stores where you can just go and buy or rent the dvd. And most of the tv/series and movies are not even available to buy on amazon/prime video , even google play. Anime industry is another entire problem. The ease of access is absolutely non existent.",

That means absolutely no regional restrictions or exclusivity. \n\nIf you're subscribed to some kind of streaming service, you should reasonably expect that whatever new movie/show gets released, it will be available for you.  No need to subscribe to 3 separate services to watch 3 different shows.\n\nIf you're not subscribed to anything, you should be able to digitally rent a movie/show by paying a reasonable price for a time-limited access to it.\n\nIf accessing legal content was always so easy and straightforward, barely anyone would pirate anything, maybe just some extremely poor people who wouldn't be able to spend money anyway, so it's not a loss for the creators.",

        "selftext": "Car Manufacturers and designers seem like they're just trying to cram as many electronic features in new cars as possible, for absolutely no benefit in an attempt to make their cars look and feel all futuristic. Here's my problems with them\n\n- Hand-brakes : used to be a handle you'd pull, super practical and easy to grab and pull / pump in case of emergency like a brake failure or bad road conditions like black ice. Now it's just a fucking button. No way am I finding it in time in an emergency.\n\n- sliding doors on vans : used to be you could just use the handle and pull the whole door completely open in half a second. Now I use the handle, try to pull the door open but NOOOO it's on its own tiny engine that slowly draws the door in open position over 3 full seconds. Useless.\n\n- windows : used to be a little rolling handle. If it broke you could change the mechanism for like 50$. Now if your tiny electronic window stops rolling down they gotta dismantle the whole door and replace the electronics for 5-6 times the price.\n\n- Trunks with no handles : WHY ? ITS A DOOR. WHY DO I HAVE TO GO TO MY OTHER DOOR TO FIND A BUTTON FOR THE DOOR I'M TRYING TO GET INTO ? FUCK.\n\n- trunks you can't just push down. The SUVs are really bad for that one, you try to close the damn trunk and you're forcing against whatever piece of shit motor they have in there to close it for you with a button. And no it's not about customer's height because most often the damn button is exactly where you'd grab the trunk door to close it. Just another useless feature.\n\n-  The seats : Pull the side handle to adjust seatback, pull underside handle to adjust seat distance. Moves almost instantly and follows your own movements. Instinctive and easy. Now it's again, 3-4 piece of shit plastic button that I have to wait for to do their job at a snail's pace and, just like windows, they will eventually  break (which I've never seen on the seat adjustments on older cars that weren't in accidents) and cost you 5-6 times the price to fix.\n\n- Cameras on 37 angles :  USE YOUR FUCKING EYES. 5000$ price hike *at least* to stick cameras everywhere just because people can't be bothered to take a 2 second look around before backing up into their own kid. And those cameras will never last as long as the car anyway. I legit saw cameras turn on when you put your blinkers and it showed *exactly* what the side mirror was showing. \n\n- self adjusting seat : the goddamn thing moves back when you turn off the engine, (I imagine to let fat Americans out of the car,) moves back to position when you turn it on. Why? WHYYYYYY ? If your seat is properly adjusted once, you should be able to get in and out of it and never touch the fucking thing again. \n\nEtc. Etc. Etc. \n\n\nAlot of it seems \n\nA) Fragile\nB) more expensive for no added benefit\nC) actually less functional (like the button emergency brake)\nD) a waste of time\nE) teaches people to rely on their car more than their driving skills (especially the cameras with the beeping noise when you're about to hit something because you're too much of an idiot to tell the difference between a safe distance and right on your bumper)",

            "For the last 25+ years I've been installing aftermarket electronics in cars, mostly for new car dealers. Everytime the aftermarket world comes out with something new that people like, car manufacturers start adding it to their cars as an option or standard equipment. In the mid 90's most of what I did was add keyless entry, alarms, CD players/changers, and cruise control. Then when most cars started coming with those features, we shifted to remote starters and in-car DVD players. Then it was back up (parking) sensors and back up cameras. Then it was heated seats, blind spot systems, and Carplay. \n\nMy point is, the reason car makers add all of this technology, is because consumers want it. If you have always driven an older car with only basic features, then you don't need any of the fancy stuff. But, once you drive a car with advanced features you don't want to go back to not having them. When I was young, I was fine with manual roll up windows and no cruise control, but there is zero chance I'll buy a car without cruise and power windows today. Car makers know that stripped down cars sit on their lots the longest, so they have moved away from building them. Simple supply and demand.",

            "That's why I appreciate the simple cars that aren't packed with tons of electronic gadgets and where everything is connected with one big touch screen or somethig, because there's less to break down.\n\nFor example: If my car's radio breaks, I can just get a new one off ebay or something for probably less than 30 bucks and replace it myself within a few minutes.

In my community last year two children were killed by their parents because they were A. Driving classic cars, and B. Had not noticed the child in their blind spot.

            "The hand brake was never intended for something to be used while the vehicle was in motion. I have no clue why you would use it on black ice. Not only is it considerably weaker, but usually only effects the rear brakes, which would make it a great way to spin out.\n\nABS has been mandatory for the last 10 years, near standard for the last 20-30 years. So there\u2019s also no need to pump the brakes.\n\nAlso mandatory on all new vehicles is at least 1 rear view camera. Kia\u2019s blind spot camera that displays on the dash doesn\u2019t show what is in the mirror, it shows what\u2019s in the blind spot.\n\nAlso not sure what power windows ever did to hurt you. Kinda ironic to complain about them while also complaining about how slow power doors/tailgates are. Hand cranks were slow as dirt and probably broke as much if not more.",

The beeping you can't turn off when you're close to something is the god damn worst and was clearly not designed for the city. My car does automatic high beams only unless you hold down the button so if the car doesn't deem high beams necessary you're driving in the dark or holding the button down until it turns off after 30 seconds. Windshield wipers are also automatic only so it's either a soaked windshield or wiping fast on a dry windshield so the wiper is tripping up the whole way across. The voice command button is very easy to accidentally hit on my steering wheel while turning so my music is interrupted when I make a turn half the time.

In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. \n\n\nIn those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.\n\n\n\nSaying \"colleges just want to make you well rounded\" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90\u00b0, not 45\u00b0, not even 1\u00b0.\n\n\nEdit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. \n \n\nIt honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. Allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",

            "I went back to college (as an adult who is a practicing lawyer) and took a biology course out of interest. One of the other students was a professor at that university who was also taking the course out of interest. When speaking with her and the professor leading the class, I learned of their frustrations with how the university president refers to students as \u201ccustomers\u201d and classes as \u201cproducts\u201d - and this was at a public university.",
            "I've attended 2 Bachelor's programs, 1 Master's and 1 PhD program, and am enrolling in a 2nd PhD program currently, so I know something about this topic.\n\nI'll say this: classwork almost never directly helps your career. Sad however it is, if you really want to succeed in your career, then you have to study hard on your own. The classes can only give you some general direction and some extra stuff that may or may not be helpful in the future, but in the end classes are auxiliary and are not a substitute for self-study.\n\nYou may ask, \"Why go to the college at all then?\" Well, first, a degree still matters a lot in many fields; in my field (mathematics), you are unlikely to get anywhere without having a decent PhD. And second, classes, while in themselves not providing a lot of helpful information, do teach you to work intensely, meet all the tight deadlines, etc. - the stuff you are unlikely to learn as well on your own, without constant external pressure to perform.\n\nAnd finally, don't discount any classes you are taking. They may not be immediately helpful in your desired career path, but you also never know where your career path will eventually take you. The university programs are not designed by morons, and almost everything is there for a reason. As an example, I took an extra-curricular course in economics during my undergrad studies, out of pure interest, thinking I would never find any use to that - and, what do you know, I've gradually grown very interested in mathematical economics!\n\nTL;DR: Don't expect too much from classes, but don't dismiss them either. Do your best in them, while in the free time studying on your own what you are really interested in. You never know what comes in handy in the future, and it is a good opportunity to learn working hard under pressure.",

Its sucks cause I'm a bio major and I need to take physics 1 and 2 and I only have 2 semesters left to take them now. I find physics pretty interesting and I'm really good at math but the teachers made the class unbearable.\n\nIn contrast, I had to take a class called cybernetics to fulfill a gen ed requirement. I wasnt particularly interested initially but that class ended up being one of my favorites I've taken simply because the instructor was incredibly knowledgeable, enthusiastic and engaging. It helped that some of the subject matter bled into my major too. It may not have been a class that I needed to take to have a successful career but I'm glad I took it.\n\nClasses like \"dont rape people 101\" are stupid cash grabs or just there for legal or PR reasons certainly but I think taking classes outside your major can actually help you in the long run.

In any case, the purpose of academia is not, was never, career training.\n\nGranted, since their inception American colleges primarily have been training facilities for some profession or other, and with some noble exceptions we've never wrestled out of that trap, largely because of money: originally the money of various churches, then later the money of generous commercial barons, and now the money of the government, which is to say the taxpayer's money. All this money seems to churn out not genius, not training, but merely a credentials. I won't call it a scam, but I don't think it's what Plato had in mind.\n\nIf at 18 you don't think you need to learn \"critical thought\" and \"problem-solving\" at all, you may be either way too smart or way too dumb for college anyway.

Toxic femininity exists as well and its the same thing just for standards of femininity its just that you don't realy hear the term as much becouse becouse the only time you realy hear people talking about these standards is when people talk about violence of some sort and occasionaly when talking about male suicide and those aren't exactly negative standards of feminine behaveour since those expectations are usualy that a person should be passive or timid",

Toxic masculinity is not just mean being toxic, its men being toxic because they\u2019re following society\u2019s script for them with too much zeal, it comes from what they\u2019re told to do to be men. So toxic femininity should only apply to toxic behaviors that come directly from how women are told to act, like how women consistently say they have lower confidence and less ambition in the work place, how the study that coined the term \u201cmansplaining\u201d actually found it was most often for other women to interrupt women, etc.",

She isn't vain at all--she complains if she has to wear makeup or dress up--but her idiot husband says he will leave her if she starts to look old (he's older than she is). She has been brainwashed into believing that she and her kids will have to take up residence in a cardboard box if she eats a Twinkie, and nothing I say can convince her otherwise. She is constantly posting things to social media so her husband can see that she is still attractive; he says it's important for his \"personal brand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, her husband has affairs with women half his age whom he meets at the gym.

I mean women can be toxic(can confirm that I am indeed a toxic bitch) but I wouldn\u2019t be an example of toxic femininity, I\u2019m just toxic and feminine\n\nToxic masculinity is being hyper-masculine(or hyper compliant to stereotypical expectations of men) to the point in which in hurts yourself and others. This would be like aggressively not showing vulnerability. Additionally, you can be any gender and toxically masculine.\n\nFor femininity, this is less obvious as steryotilcaply feminine traits while harmful in a broader context are harder to be harmful to those who comply to them. For example, lack of female representation in STEM fields is a bad thing, but being a women and wanting to go into say cooking wouldn\u2019t be toxic. \n\nThe only things I can think of for toxic femininity would be internalized misogyny or being \u201cwomotional\u201d. I see no issues with the former being considered toxic femininity although this wouldn\u2019t be a thing someone who wasn\u2019t a women could experience. The latter i think is more accurate to what people think when they think of toxic femininity, but I do think the premise of it is dangerous as it usually is used to put down men who want to show emotions/seek emotional support and suppress/undermine women trying to speak out.",

            "That behavior you described is definitely toxic as hell, but I don\u2019t know if it would be classified as \u201ctoxic femininity\u201d.\n\n\u201cToxic masculinity\u201d (even though I think the term itself is dumb and misleading) is when a guy does stupid shit because he feels like his masculinity is threatened. It can range from something as trivial as not wanting to wear pink, to something as severe as abusing their girlfriend/wife.\n\nMost men who have \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d aren\u2019t consciously doing it, and I would argue that it\u2019s not their fault that they have that mindset. Boys are raised to see femininity as a bad thing and to \u201cbe a man\u201d, \u201cacting like a girl is bad\u201d, act rough and tough, and to bottle up their emotions because it\u2019s \u201cmore manly\u201d, and \u201cnot gay\u201d. Oh, and the dumb \u201cboys will be boys\u201d phrase, to describe boys doing god-awful things because \u201chehe that\u2019s just being a boy!\u201d (which is downright offensive because that\u2019s saying that all boys are dumb or mean).\n\n\u201cToxic masculinity\u201d arises from misogyny (whether conscious or not) because they grew up believing that feminine things are bad and should be frowned upon.\n\n\u201cToxic femininity\u201d doesn\u2019t seem too common to me because girls are actually encouraged nowadays to \u201cbe a man\u201d and not wear makeup, not dress up, enjoy gorging themselves with food, go fishing, dislike shopping, play video games, and \u201cbe one of the boys\u201d. This is also because femininity is seen as a bad thing because of misogyny.\n\nYou might\u2019ve seen examples of that with all those stupid memes and posts like \u201cother girls wear makeup and go shopping, I like going mudding in my truck and going hunting!\u201d and they try to imply that wearing makeup and going shopping is bad or less respectable than the other things, which isn\u2019t even true. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being like other girls, because there\u2019s nothing wrong with other girls! Femininity isn\u2019t bad (and neither is masculinity). And men AND women should be allowed to wear, say, and do traditionally feminine things.\n\n\u201cToxic femininity\u201d I assume would be the opposite of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. Toxic masculinity is viewing femininity as something to be avoided and having very unhealthy mindsets involving \u201cbeing a man is better and we should try our hardest to be the manliest men!\u201d. \n\nSo toxic femininity I guess would be trying as hard as possible to be very feminine and look down on things that are traditionally masculine, and shaming both men and women for not being feminine. And \u201coh my daughter sexually harassed/raped your son? Oh, girls will be girls!\u201d I haven\u2019t seen too much of that.\n\nEDIT: Scratch that last paragraph. u/TheAudeze made some really good points about what toxic femininity is in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gnv8t3/toxic_femininity_should_be_just_as_much_of_a/frcg46x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that slipped my mind.",

For example, when men think they have to suppress their emotions or be strong all the time. Mostly, women IMO don\u2019t have the same restrictions that men do. At least not now. The whole point of toxic masculinity was to show the problems with traditional stereotypes.

Blonde, brunette, big ass, big tits, athletic. Preference isn't toxicity? You're confused.\n\nThe rest of your post is just horrible. You are just complaining about things you find irritating, not anything \"toxic\" \n\nLike so what some people talk about the same thing sometimes? How is that toxic? Its WAY more toxic to expect people to constantly cater to whatever you are finding annoying. The world doesn't revolve around you.",

            "Toxic masculinity isnt this \"masculinity is instinctively horrible\" notion that radfems push. It's an issue that I think a lot of men should take more interest in as it is literally a men's rights issue. It's about how boys growing up dont have the same access to healthy coping skills and the freedom to express their emotions in the same way young girls do. This is also the reason many people believe suicide rates are higher in men. Men are discouraged from sharing their emotions rather it be to family, friends or seeking professional help. This mentality prevents men who struggle with mental illness from seeking help and often leads to emotions being expressed in unhealthy ways. There is toxic behavior done by women but let's overall stop treating people talking about toxic masculinity as an attack on men. It's an attack on the horrible way young boys are raised to believe that their emotions dont matter.",

            "I feel like toxic masculinity moreso refers to the way our society upholds this standard that men feel obligated to fit into, and acting out in such a way that re-enforces this over-exaggerated masculine identity.\nIe. being aggressive, sexually, physically, verbally, etc. Stereotypes such as having to appear strong, unemotional, be a provider etc. Having to have control and power over women, entitlement to women\u2019s appearance, body, sex, etc.\nToxic masculinity refers to the very real ways this sort of stereotyping is acted out imo.\n\nToxic people are just toxic, men or women - the way women are toxic may lend itself to some sociological phenomenon but I wouldn\u2019t say femininity necessarily fits this polar opposite description unless you\u2019re referring the way women feel obligated to fulfill the demands of appearing and acting feminine?\nI could see that being:\nWomen demanding/expecting to be cared for financially, emotionally etc. (Which is really a consequence of living in a patriarchal society where women have only gained individual freedoms and rights in the last 100 years). \nWomen primarily being valued for their appearance therefore obsessing over it or using to to their advantage for economic means. (This would be a consequence of patriarchal society as well which obviously put a premium on beauty as a value to a future husband or family, and the economic piece is post-feminism; trying to monetize/commodify our natural abilities to survive under capitalism).\n\nThere\u2019s an enormous amount of pressure to be desirable in terms of finding a partner or fitting into society as a woman, and while these experiences are happening for men, the stakes are much different in terms of how we continue to be valued. It\u2019s too often that women are seen more for their physical appearance and less for their competence and intellectual abilities. (Adele\u2019s recent weight loss is a great example of this; as media primarily focuses on her weight loss achievement over her talent as an acclaimed vocalist).\n\nI think the concept of internalized misogyny is fitting here in that women often judge other\u2019s appearances and behaviour as if to try to act out the way that men have traditionally judged and valued women. Like by proximity or acting out similarly will put them at the same level of privilege and advantage but it just serves to further empower patriarchal values in our current world.",
            "As someone who used to visit a gender studies 101 class: toxic masculinity as a concept in academia specifically describes one hegemonic masculine stereotype, and the various (negative) consequences for all other kinds of gender/gender roles, which arise from the implicit acceptance/adherence of said stereotype. There are many other types of gender roles (which I forgot the correct terms for those) like the subservient masculine. The theory of toxic masculinity is mainly referred to as that because it's the hegemonic gender roll which all others are generally subservient to in context of society (see partiarchy etc.). The theory then also goes into detail about how this certain gender role hurts and benefits the other ones as well as to how/why it developed/is being continued and why it hurts society as a whole.\nSo that is why, in academia at least, there is no \"toxic femininity\", since it is a very specific term with many underlying implications, and \"toxic femininity\" also wouldn't be anywhere near as relevant as toxic masculinity is. But that's not to say that concepts of harmful behavior which would be related to traditionally feminine stereotypes don't exist, they're simply not as relevant.\n\nI hope I didn't butcher that to much, it's been a while since I visited that class. Please feel free to correct me if I got something mixed up.",

Toxic masculinity isn\u2019t about men being toxic people it\u2019s about how the ideas of masculinity is toxic for men, the ideas of dominance, aggression etc, instead of blaming the victims of these ideologies blame the systems which created them.

            "I agree that the behavior you're describing is toxic, but I think this is a false equivalency. I wouldn't call it toxic femininity and here's why.  \n\n\nWhen people talk about toxic masculinity, they aren't talking about men judging women and other men based on their appearance. Most people would just call that \"being a dick.\" Toxic masculinity is the proverbial box that society puts men into, where they aren't allowed to express (or even have) feelings and emotions. Where they earn masculinity points by performing behaviors that have historically been associated with masculinity (such as aggression, violence, and stoicism just to name a few), and where points are taken away when a man does something traditionally considered feminine, such as cry, communicate, express empathy or caring, or turn away from violence.  \n\n\nToxic masculinity is serious and people literally die because of it, at the hands of men who don't know that they don't have to live that way. If judging people based on their appearance and having shit-ass priorities was 1) predominantly performed by women more than men and 2) represented a clear and present danger to other humans, I think I'd be more willing to calling it toxic femininity.",
            "Kinda agree. However toxic masculinity has a larger impact and larger consequences than toxic femaninity. Your examples may show toxicity but are they as bad as toxic masculinity? \n When men are toxic, they can literally bring down nations( the reverse is true i.e when men display positive masculinity, it's impact is grand and can effect millions).  However the worst toxicity of women is what? Gossiping.  Being vain? The most reach toxic women have is with their small circle. This include families, their children, friends, coworkers and men they date. Because their impact is a much smaller scale it's easier to avoid . If my coworker is a gossip queen, I can switch departments or find another job. No if a man I dated is aggressive, my life can be in danger. I can be stalked, followed and killed. If a man refuses to deal with his emotions and is voilent, he can become a danger to society as a whole. I can't think of toxic women having similar impacts as toxic men.\nNow this isn't excusing toxic women. As a society we should work towards eliminating all forms of toxicity. However, this is why I think  toxic femininity is not seen as being as bad as toxic masculinity.",

            "As many have pointed out by now, \"toxic masculinity\" doesn't mean \"men acting toxic.\" Toxic masculinity is a phrase used to describe societal roles/behaviors expected of men, such as not being allowed to cry/express feelings, or having to get into a fist-fight to \"truly become a man.\" \"Toxic masculinity\" is used to express that these expected behaviors established by society are harmful to the male gender, and we need to stop making it the norm for them. You're way off base, so of course your opinion will be unpopular: you're incorrectly using the term.\n\nGoing by your argument of people acting shitty, rather than discussing harmful gender roles: we do *not* turn a blind eye to women exhibiting toxic behavior; in fact, it's like we as a society specifically *look* for it in women so we can point it out. As a woman, it baffles me that another woman can say that we ignore bad behavior when it comes to women, when we have *hundreds* of movies, songs, TV shows, plays, comedy bits, and other forms of media that depict women being superficial, \"bitchy,\" \"brainwashed\", and basing their worth off of their appearance. Also, the idea that a woman's worth is based on her appearance isn't \"growing\", it's been an issue for quite some time. This is also not an issue exclusive to women-- men also feel their worth is based on their appearances, and we should be addressing it from both ends.",

In order to accomplish this goal, they spend huge amounts of cash on makeup, clothes, surgery, and skin products. People who place their time and energy into shallow values, in my experience, become vain and self obsessed. \n\nIt just comes down to this. A lot of people are selfish and egotistical. It's not that wearing makeup, etc, is bad in itself. But the endless need to convince themselves that by having more: more 'likes,' more expensive clothes, more money in their bank account, they are BETTER than other people. Really it's just about the ego. \n\nBut I understand where you are coming from. I hate it too. It's hard to find genuine, kind people nowadays.

            "That's often a coping mechanism and a social filter. It makes perfect sense from their perspective.\n\nThey know that they will get laughed at either way, but by dressing like that they can choose for what they get laughed at. Instead of getting laughed at for something that would hurt, they will get laughed at for something that they deliberately presented as bait. \n\nIf someone laughs at them while they look and act completely normal it hurts, because they laugh at *them*. But if someone laughs at them for having pink hair they can just shrug it off, because that person is clearly just someone that's too conservative and judgmental.\n\nAdditionally it also helps them to keep judgmental people outside of their friend circle. They don't want to interact with shitty people and by dressing this way they make sure that only cool, accepting and open people even want to associate with them in the first place.\n\nIt's actually a really good idea if you think about it.",

            "It's funny, social outsiders got so sick of not being invited to hang out with the cool kids that they created their own outsider culture. And then big businesses got involved, appropriated all the outsider trends, and made them popular mainstream trends.\n\nHaving stuff like dyed hair or being into D&D or LARPS or even video games used to be aspects of youth counterculture trends that were made by 'losers' who stopped trying to be cool and just embraced their nerdiness and find support among other people who share the same trends.\n\nFor me, I developed 'social anxiety' long after I gave up dressing weird.",
            "Social anxiety is complex and you clearly have missed the point. Shy and anxious people sometimes get playful with easily changeable things like hairstyle and colour to stop themselves from feeling drowned out by humanity.

            "I used to dress out of the norm, and it had absolutely no effect on or relationship to my social anxiety. My social anxiety has always been surrounding actually interacting with other people and saying something \u201cwrong,\u201d rude, or awkward without intending to. I\u2019ve never cared whether someone stares at me because they think I looked weird. Let them stare. I dressed the way I thought looked cool, regardless of whether it was out of the norm. \n\nThe point is, people should be able to dress the way they like and express themselves, no matter how weird it appears to others, regardless of whether they suffer from social anxiety. \n\nAnd yeah, for many people the way they dress also serves as a signal to \u201cpeople like them.\u201d I always wanted to attract people who dressed like and liked the same things as me because they were less intimidating to talk to and had less risk of saying something socially inappropriate. \n\nIn my opinion it\u2019s just an ignorant assumption that people who dress weird or in a way that makes them stand out get social anxiety from people staring at them because of the way they look. Social anxiety is so much more complicated than that, and people should be able to express themselves through their clothes, hair etc in a way that makes them happy.",

They can be themselves: dye their hair or wear weird clothes or accessories and say cringey stuff, but when they talk to anyone, it makes them uncomfortable. The talking doesn't have to be about the hair or clothes, it can be anything. And the crazy stuff is usually like a coping mechanism from the anxiety. Like doing something crazy to give them sort of a high and kinda balancing out the low from the anxiety. At least that is the case for me, idk about everyone else. However, if they do do that stuff and complain about people giving them social anxiety *about said stuff*, then yeah sure they're in the wrong. They can't not complain about social anxiety as a whole tho cuz its seriously affects how they talk and act around people.",

            "Having social anxiety isn't logical. You can't just rationalize it in your head, that's the issue. My social anxiety is related to how I think others will judge my character based on what I say/do in a situation, not how I look in public.\n\nFor me, when I try to rationalize it and reason my way out of it, that just gives me more anxiety than I originally had because I get caught in thought loops. I don't do things that make me stand out in public, but who cares if others do even if they have social anxiety? Not all social anxiety is worry about how others judge your physical appearance. You should really do some actual research before forming an opinion on a subject.\n\nAnd why the fuck does it matter to you if people complain about having social anxiety?

I dye my hair as a conversation starter so I'm forced to talk to people so I can get over it, but most of the time my anxiety isn't because of the attention it's because I'm surrounded by people constantly and it overwhelms me (whether they pay attention to me or not). I don't try to stand out, I just like my hair the way it is, I think otherwise it's very boring and it makes me more confident in my appearance because otherwise I look exactly like my brother and my dad and I don't like to blend in. And while I agree that people who do weird things (like wearing tails or ears in public, acting like a toddler, etc.) and complain about anxiety and don't try to make it easier for themselves should reassess what is more important to them, expressing themselves or feeling comfortable. I've chosen expressing myself, I wear normal clothes (sort of, baggy dark clothes because I hate buying new clothes and it's all I have from middle school when I fit the clothes and liked those sort of clothes), I act normally like any other quiet kid who likes keeping to themselves, I joke around and talk to people so I'm not especially awkward in social situations. The only abnormal thing about me is that I have short dyed hair that is constantly changing because I like it like that and I enjoy showing it off to my friends and enjoying my life like everyone else because despite the fact that I have crippling anxiety I have to learn how to deal with it while also being myself because it won't cure itself and this is the only way I've found to get people to talk to me without stressing myself out too much.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to preface that while I'm called an edge lord all the time (because it looks like I'm trying too hard to be edgy.. duh) I'm not..

            " The garish appearance and the social anxiety are probably two symptoms  of a more deep seated personal instability. Ive met countless people of  this social type and something I notice is that they are frequently very  chaotic people. social anxiety is par for the course, so is depression,  relationship issues, family trouble, frequent drug use, and they are  usually on one or more medications. They also tend to be very candid  about these issues and seem to enjoy discussing them, which i think  suggests a greater than average need for attention and social  validation. The dyed hair and loud \"alternative\" style is another  manifestation of this need for validation, something you would expect  from a socially anxious person. The ironic thing is that these people  will often say they \"don't care what other people think\" and make a big  to do about rejecting mass market beauty standards. They will then pour a  ton of money and time into their appearance so as to deliberately and  conspicuously UN-conform to these standards. They probably spend far  more time thinking about social standards and what others think then the  un-stifled normie who just throws on some sports t shirt and doesn't  really think about it. The boring looking \"conformist\" is usually far  more at ease with themselves then the person who makes a lifestyle out  of hysterically altering their appearance . Finally, as others have  pointed out, these people are frequently kind of boring. In my  experience this is true. Even the ones with lots of personal issues are  pretty uninteresting once you get past the drama. If you're starved for  validation and you want to make an impression on people, it much easier  to pick up some manic panic and a septum piercing than it is to develop  non-tangible personal qualities. Of course dying your hair, while  providing a temporary self esteem boost and some desperately needed  attention from those around you, does not actually make you a more  interesting or self actualized person, and so the anxiety and personal  issues persist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: I pathologize the shit out of hipsters",

Not for attention, but the colours make me happy) and I dye my hair unnatural colours. If anything, taking control of the way I look has helped me feel less self concious and I dont mind people looking at me as much anymore, because instead of 'oh they think im ugly' I assume it's because my hair is green or my shoes are mismatched. However, as a general rule of thumb I dislike people diagnosing themselves with anxiety disorder or social anxiety simply because they feel nervous sometimes. Although in all fairness, a lot of my anxiety also comes from the general sensory issues that come along with being autistic (where there's people there's loud noise and overcrowding). For the most part though, I do certainly agree that if you're going out of your way to look in some way noticeable or unique, you can't get annoyed when others stare. If they're not being mean about it and simply looking out of curiosity, it's perfectly warranted.",

I no longer do it because people would not stop asking about it and it made me incredibly self conscious.  If people would mind their own business I would still be doing it, but people always start it with \"I just have to ask...\"  No you don't.  Obviously you can take things too far, but the social anxiety doesn't come from people glancing at them.  Hundreds of people glance at you every day and you don't notice.  Everyone is so wrapped up in their own stuff they don't notice.  What they do notice is when people talk about it or laugh.  Mind your own business.",

In groups of more than like two people I tend to be very quiet and can't speak up and I can never talk to strangers or introduce myself to start conversation. I tend to be very lurky and awkward not knowing what to do with myself and just wanting to leave. Forever I tried to blend in as much as possible so that I could basically be an NPC that nobody would know was there. In my mind, the less people noticed me, the better my anxiety would be.\n\nAnd then I said fuck it and colored my hair neon orange (and then green, and red, and blue, and pink.... You get the idea). Suddenly I didn't have to introduce myself because everyone wanted to talk to me first. I started to not see so uncomfortable speaking up in conversation, and I started wearing brighter clothes and different things other then jeans and a graphic T. Because my hair was dyes, I started styling it better and using better hair products and actually started a skincare routine (I was already standing at the sink for ten minutes might as well wash exfoliate tone and moisturize right?). \n\nI know the type of people you're talking about, and I don't go around with a tail or cat ears screaming about the avengers or superwholock or what the fuck ever, but for me, coloring my hair was actually really positive for my mental health and anxiety.",

            "Here's a hilarious story.\n\nThere's a theatre in my city that has a program called \"parents day at the movies\".\nIt is designed as a way for parents to get out of the house with newborns. My wife was so stoked. They publicised brighter lighting, lower sound, cribs in the theatre, and the ability to move around freely and feed the baby. A good way to keep a baby satisfied is to walk them around and feed them. It's like being in the womb. \n\nWe buy our tickets and head out gleefully for our first movie or date since the baby was born. We love Cinema and attended double features with regularity before the babe. \n\nWe get there and it is a bit odd. First, the ticket seller acts strange when we say we are here for parents day out. He works it out, saying oh yeah he remembers and gives us our tickets.  When we get in the theatre there are no cribs and the lighting and sound are normal. We think, ok well I'm sure they will change it before the show starts. We notice that normal couples and other \"regular\" movie goers are coming in. We comment how weird it is for people to come to a show knowing there will be babies all over the place. \n\nAn elderly couple sits down behind us, we hear the woman say to her husband \"why would anyone bring a baby to a movie?\" Like a gunslinger and much to my surprise, my wife whips out a flier from her purse, turns instantly and says \"this is the PARENTS DAY OUT SHOWING!!\" and sticks the flier in the woman's face. In addition, my wife starts bawling immediately. The woman is mortified, saying she didn't know and consoling my wife. The tears stop, my wife hands me the baby and storms out. Of course I am like oh shit. She was mumbling about the manager as she left. Five minutes later, the movie stops. GULP. All the patrons are looking around wondering what is up. In walks my wife with the manager, he nervously addresses the crowd as the lights go up. He explains that it is a parents day out showing and it was publicised and he is sorry to all the parents. Ushers start rolling in cribs. The manager walks out and the picture starts up. My wife sits down beside me and I realized for the first time that she is in fact a mom. I have never been more proud. \n\nBut yeah, other than that scenario people who bring babies to movies are morons. Especially the time I saw someone bring a three year old to Bad Santa. \n\nEdit: after that slow pan down the bar, with the greatest cursing dialogue in film in the background, right as the camera stops on Billy Bob in the Santa suit. I hear this little girl go \"Santi Claus?\" The parents are up and out in an instant. It was rates R people. Think, think. I bet that kid is still terrified of santa.",
            "I totally agree, but, I mean, I hate kids.  \n\n\nThe ODEON cinema chain in the UK have special early screenings for mothers and young kids, which are cheaper, have extra lighting, and lower volume (in what I assume to be) an effort to reduce sproggs in the profitable screenings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreat idea.",
            "I've got a 3 month old. I would never take him to a cinema until he was old enough to quietly watch a movie. However, I think parents should be allowed to take their babies places. You may need to be actively trying to comfort the baby the whole time, though. I exclusively breastfeed my baby, so I can't just leave him somewhere else. Even if I could, the only people that I'd trust with him are my parents. I couldn't just \"hire someone to watch him.\" I take my baby to restaurants all the time, and sometimes I have to sit him on my lap the whole time so he doesn't cry. Sometimes I have to get the stroller out of the trunk and walk around outside the restaurant with him to get him to go to sleep. Sometimes we go shopping and I have to hold him on my hip and push the stroller with my other hand so he doesn't cry. Parents are people, too. It's the parents that sit there and do nothing when their children scream and cry that need banned.",
            "lol Just ban parents dumb enough to take kids that young.  I have a 4 month old and I barely want to go out to eat with him.  Its getting better but its literally a flip of a coin if he is going to hate it or be perfectly content.",

            "I took my young baby to the movie multiple times between 2-6 months, he was a very settled baby who very very rarely cried. He did not make a sound during any of the movies we went to, if he started wriggling I\u2019d offer him a feed. We didn\u2019t go from when he started being a little more active until around 4. We chose sessions that were during the day and his nap time deliberately, and seats right next to the exit just in case. \n\nMy other child I wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of taking as a baby. I may consider taking him to the movies when he\u2019s 10 - he was very quick to make noise and took a while to settle. \n\nParents need to be respectful of others, and their children, and not put babies and the public in uncomfortable situations.",

There have been countless complaints about kids going in to the screens or being just generally loud but we can't do anything as when the parents see us go in to check they suddenly put effort into stopping the kid meaning a member of staff waits pointlessly for five to ten minutes in the screen only to be called in again the second we go off to actually continue doing work.\nAlso I've been asked a few times to watch or hold kids whilst I'm cleaning or checking tickets which always seem to end in the same way with the parents getting angry when I say no or them just leaving the kid anyway unsupervised.",
            "I agree. It's not fair to the movie goers or the child. What kid wants to sit still and be quiet for 2+ hours. It's hard for them to do that and be quiet because they're children who need to get up and move and play. Also not only that, but it is loud as fuck in a movie theater. Why the hell would you want to bring your 2 and under child where it going to be super fucking loud. I will never understand it.

They perceive their outrage to be virtuous, and that the more outraged they are about said topic, the more virtue they hold over you. The argument quickly becomes less about the topic and more about you as an opponent.\n\nMasking disingenuous motives under the guise of righteousness is what makes this behaviour particularly reprehensible. Two human beings should be able to have a civil disagreement on anything - even if one the persons views are seemingly ridiculous, (Earth being flat, etc). To be open minded you must try to understand _why_ they believe what they believe and maybe stand a chance of educating them, or at least coming out of the conversation better understanding the root cause of their misguided beliefs. Maybe I\u2019m too much of an optimist.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, this is obviously a generalisation and doesn\u2019t apply to all cases. It also does not appeal to the idea that someone who is outraged is wrong and someone who isn\u2019t is right. I could have the patience of a saint and still be wrong (and I often am).

I used to play an organized version of Battlefield 3 with a community 21+.  We organized in TeamSpeak since Discord didn't exist at the time as well as on our website/forums.  At our peak, we had over 100 people and would set up matches against other communities.  Not only was that some of the most fun I've had in my life, it's something you barely see anymore in AAA gaming due to how decentralized interaction is.  Servers used to be run by the community and it was absolutely better in terms of making friends.  It's a bit sad because I've had younger gamers respond in disbelief saying a community isn't you and a few friends, only to explain how it used to be, leaving them speechless.  I don't want it to be that way either, that's just how things turned out unfortunately. \n\n(There are discord communities as well as smaller games that support this kind of setup, but BF3 was one of the top 1st person shooters at the time so finding people was trivial.  Now the BF series is a graveyard by comparison.)\n\nVideo games let you experience things you never could in reality and it's only getting better with VR innovation.  I wouldn't shut anyone out of my life that wants to hang out, but if they want to remove something fun from your life, then it's time for them to either change or move on.",

I\u2019m nearing my mid 30\u2019s, and I\u2019m seeing my friends who have been getting divorced, having kids with multiple people, getting fat, etc. and now I realize I\u2019m actually pretty satisfied with where I\u2019m at in life. \n\nI still like Reddit way better than Facebook though.",

Unfollow all the stay at home moms who post multiple albums of their ugly dirty kids all day long, along with unfollowing anyone who complains. \n\n\nFor the good shit: buy and sell groups, local community groups related to your hobbies, basically just groups in general. There's some gems if you dig around and find the right ones related to your interests. Also, just memes. Yeah, there's occasionally bad ones, but if you're in the right groups, you'll find good memes. \n\nFor business, it's an unbelievable platform. You've got the above mentioned buy and sell groups, the extensive analytics and demographic targeting for ads, messenger, and a ton of tools that are incredible if you know how to take advantage of them. They're not collecting all that data for no reason. \n\n There's also no comparison to marketplace. Craigslist is absolute garbage now imo. The amount of successful purchases and sales I've made with marketplace is so much higher than what I've ever accomplished with Craigslist.

Being able to find old friends, keep in touch with extended family, plan events. It really was awesome. And the UI was clean and fast.\n\nThen it became swamped with high school kids and their drama, followed by all of the trailer and ghetto trash. And after that came the political flame wars, spam, soapboxing, ect. because everyone could access it.\n\nIt went from high-end boutique store, to trashy strip mall with 3 vape stores.",

It is also one of the only tools many have to communicate with the outside world and socialize on that level because tools like reddit are dominated by people in US/CA and Europe. \n\nI think Facebook (this will sound funny to us US folks) is a great tool for people in underdeveloped countries and countries with restrictive governments. In Latin America Facebook is THE social media platform and news platform especially in countries with corrupt news that is essentially state run.

It turned into a gross virtue signaling contest between people I had known my whole life and just became way more ugly and that overshadowed the nice things like sharing food or activities with family. \n\nNow over two years later there are apparently constant political ads and arguments or misinformation and has turned into a government propaganda tool full of bots from all over the world lighting fires and trying to create chaos where they can. Why be a part of that? Or support it by having an account? I understand you can ignore and block it all, but that sounds like a lot of work to what?

            "Same here, I was unhappy at home and bullied at school. I was awkward in college.\n\nOnce I graduated and got a job, everything changed. I didn't have to \"fit in\" anywhere. \n\nI enjoyed spending time at home reading books and writing. I went out and got into hobbies like Salsa dancing. I could afford to go to a therapist and realize that I had a shitty childhood.\n\nI enjoyed my twenties. I'm nearly 30 now, and the best is yet to come.",
            "Yes exactly! I'm 21 now and I love my life so much more than when I was in high school. I love being able to come home to a place thats just yours and not deal with anyone's shit.

Because I already live by myself and work 2 jobs and go to college full time. I'm pretty sure when I graduate I'm just going to have more free time and more money.",

At 28,my life is more enjoyable now than its ever been.\n\nSure, some stuff is a slog and a hassle, but that's just life. It can't be fun all of the time.",
            "Dude same. When I got my first paycheck, and bought my truck new tires, I felt like I was actually something for the first time. It was amazing. And honestly, every time I spend over 20 bucks for a purchase, I still feel that feeling coming back. I, too, love being an adult!",

            "My favorite part is that I can have sex without worrying my parents or roommates will listen.\n\nI used to get so much performance anxiety when I knew my roommates were listening. It got way worse when I moved in with all female roommates, I would use Adderall just to last longer.",

            "I'm still in college but I have a Co-Op, which basically means I alternate between semesters of being an adult with a job and being a college kid. Let me just say, I fucking love having a job way more than being at college. Being able to come home after a hard day's work and being able to just chill is so fulfilling. I got shit done so now I can chill. At college someone's always down your throat about something, you can't ever chill because there's always homework to do, and I've got to constantly worry about exams coming up so I don't fail my classes. The only upside of college is its way easier to make friends, but that's fixable.",
            "Well. I don't have that many responsibilities, especially since I began to work on my own projects instead of being a wage slave (Which is the only form of employment other than self employment in my country) but damn if I would rather not be a child again.\n\nI have less, yet more meaningful, responsibilities now. Since other than paying bills, all my responsibilities revolve around things I do care instead of some history homework that was just writing on a notebook what I just read on a book. Life makes sense now, and I got more freedoms than when I was  a \"child\" that is my teenage years.\n\nDid I like my childhood? Sort of. Not many responsibility, little freedom, lots of safety. Yes. It was comfortable, but dull.\n\nDid I like that period of biological adulthood when, by law, I was not an adult? Hell no! All those responsibilities, less safety, little help from others, and the same, if not less, freedom as in my childhood. It was annoying and confusing and nobody fucking cared about what I have to say.\n\nDamn if I love being legally an adult and therefore being treated with respect by others, having my own choices being heard of, choosing what to do in life, and knowing any and all responsibilities are an investment to my own prosperity instead of the whims of someone else.\n\nI of course try to treat teenagers as adults and listen to what they say instead of treating them the way I was treated. Some of them actually got great ideas, and a few even taught me useful things not even my peers understand.\n\nBeing legally an adult is great. Freedom, independence, I even have more spare time to work on my self improvement. Why do we keep teenagers of all that much needed enjoyment and fulfillment? Bet if we gave them more freedoms and meaningful responsibilities tied to them instead of confusing chores we would cure teenage depression.\n\nPaying bills is not nearly as mentally depleting as dealing with meaningless school projects that have no impact in your future.",
            "I've been telling everyone since I got into high school that I'm tired of this shit, I want to work and I want to actually learn things that matter to me in college, I don't want my dad paying for everything I want, I want to pay myself, I WANT to work and have my own money, and people always be like \"hurr durr poor child doesn't know what expects him\" yes, I fucking know, no free time to even breath (at least through college), I want exactly that, I have so much free time that I literally have nothing to do 90% of the time.",
            "People who say being an adult sucks were probably pampered or are the ones who peaked in high school.\n\nMy childhood sucked and was full of abuse and poverty. I was so glad to go off to college and have my own life. I have safety from being on welfare and can afford whatever i want. My current job is boring but very well paid. Adult chores are actually easy as fuck. Did my own taxes the other week. \n\nIt does get a bit lonely after college when you're in a 9-5 tho",
            "People who say \"adulting\" are usually the mental age of a child, so pay no mind to them.",
            "I think the \"pit\" of life is probably in teenager and college years, where you have immense pressure academically. Being a kid (<12), for most people, is obviously easier than being an adult. But being an adult, is a whole lot easier than being an teenager/college kid.",

I love being able to have control of my own life. I love making decisions about what I can do next. I love being able to pay my bills on time and see the results of my own hard work.

I'm in my 30s and I find life just keeps getting deeper and richer and more meaningful as I get older.\n\nSimple things like enjoying a meal with friends have taken on a texture and level of pleasure I never knew   in my 20s. I now understand the meaning of the words \"youth is wasted on the young\". And I consider myself very lucky to have learned this in my mid 30s. Some men find this out much later in life or sadly never. And this is predominately a male problem in my humble opinion. Women mature faster and realise the value and the pleasure in it much quicker. It's just the physical aspect of growing older that no one obviously likes. Otherwise the joys far outweigh the problems. At least before the age brackets where the body starts to fall apart. Even then it'd probably be easier to handle than some of the hangovers and come downs I've had to endure lol. \n\nSo nuttin' wrong with getting older as long as you're doing it gracefully. Many don't though and so the trick you need to learn and the courage you need to have is to be able to cut people out of your life when you realise they're just children trapped in adult bodies. There's a shit load of those zombies walking around and they do real damage to society and to all of us. Ostracism is the only way to deal with them. Don't be afraid to cut people out. Yes, it takes courage, but it's ultimately for the best. \n\nLong live life.",

People who dissect the spin put on news stories by the mainstream media and actually do a better job giving you the truth than billion dollar conglomerates.\n\nThere is absolutely a toxic side to the influencer community. Having independently successful people who are able to reach a broad audience leaves people open to all kinds of abuse. But at least that abuse is decentralized. \n\nIf CNN is the only news station you can watch, then you can't avoid the lies. But if even 90% of independent media are crap, at least you can find 10% that aren't. You're focusing on the bad and ignoring the good.

I look at their posts and can see immediately it's all just blatant narcissistic posturing designed to make people impressed, but also low-key envious and insecure. And perhaps buy some product or service as a result. It's all so nauseatingly fake, manufactured and narcissistic. I've talked to my gf about this and she's sort of aware of this but still can't help but be sucked in to it, because \"she's so pretty' and 'I wanna be like her'.\n\nThis whole culture causes a great deal of public vanity as well as secret feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. A culture where competitive people feel the constant need to \"one-up\" each other on instagram regarding who has the best life, the best job, the best partner etc. It encourages younger people to judge each other based on quite vain and superficial metrics. I guess people have always been vain and narcissistic to some extent But instagram and these influencers give this tendency an annoyingly pervasive amount of exposure and legitimacy.",

            "I do agree for the most part however idk if you mean it like this but you can\u2019t generalise all influencers because there are some genuinely good people on the internet. Like targeting a fake prank video for 7 year olds definitely needs more attention and girls showing their plastic surgery bodies on the internet shouldn\u2019t be a thing either. I would disagree with the video game part because it is good fun, can be educational and can be good for emotions.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am a math person and math/science is all I can do but that\u2019s not what EVERYONE should do. \n\nAlso, there is a point I\u2019d like to argue, about how playing video games is not productive. How is it not productive if it is their career? Just because they\u2019re not making a change in this world so it is not productive?",

Social media just made it easier for the \"normal neighbor\"\" to get famous. Plus the fact it is a lot of work involved and people that actually make it to being famous put a lot of work and effort into it.",
            "They need to be regulated and its starting to happen (UK advertising authority for example has gotten involved telling influencers not to use misleading filters when promoting products). \n\nInfluencers are just another form of paid advertising, and like cigarette packets, they need to carry big health warnings that you're watching sponsored content because young people/kids in particular will not be aware they're being manipulated.\n\nWe can hope that scientists, engineers etc will be elevated but the sad reality is the people interested in influencers seem to want escapism - beautiful young people apparently living the good life. It probably makes it all seem attainable and distracts from the reality of a broken economy and society which is holding young people back and making them poorer than previous generations. The influencers are a symptom of a deeper problem.",

No, as a guy who love watching YouTube videos, I get the point of SOME influencers. But man, some of the shit they spout is toxic. For context, I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m an attractive guy, and I see it when I look in the mirror. I am underweight although I\u2019ve been working out a lot to change that. But goddamn every time I try to talk to anyone about it I\u2019m never good enough. I was raised by my parents to not take everything for granted, to not focus on the superficial aspects of people and to understand them for who they are. But every time I have a conversation with someone of my own age group, very rarely will it be an actual conversation. Instead it\u2019s just a lot of fluff that goes on for hours in a weird creepy loop about the same subjects over and over again. The people that I\u2019m actually good friends with are almost all in their young 30\u2019s because they\u2019ve already been through that phase.

            "I agree with you in many ways.\n\nI personally quit Instagram a bit ago. I know lots of influencers and wannabes. It's not an accurate portrayal of their lifestyle as far as I can see and that false representation makes people feel like they aren't good enough at life. If it's even close to an accurate representation it's because these kids are wealthy af and literally don't have the same obligations most of their followers do. So is it okay for them to make posts promoting a lifestyle that is literally unattainable without a trust fund? If the pics are photoshopped and make someone look unreasonably better than normal but they don't disclose editing, what for that? Same for people who have access to equipment that basically elevates their pics to a near professional level? Some people hire small crews to light and shoot them.\n\nBut everyone's doing it these days, heck, in some professions it's basically a portfolio requirement. Now having a \"good\" insta gains you access to spaces because it's viewed as a determination of whether you have good tastes. But is this good or fair or beneficial? Can we blame people for making shitty choices if they are getting paid for them, I mean, everyone is doing what they can to get by. \n\nThis is why the problem is more systemic at this point rather than being the fault of a few select influencer types, and as individuals we've removed the responsibility to critically think about the long term and larger cultural impacts of behavior like this and what it means for what our cultural values are. How do you solve a problem once it's large enough to be systemic?\n\nEdit for another thought I forgot to include: what about the fact that we are raised to put such a high value on the superficial parts of ourselves and then that sort of behavior is what is positively reinforced on these platforms? I know from my own experience if I post something that I think is interesting and engaging or useful it won't get attention like a \"cute\" picture. I have seen some people lately setting traps, posting the cute or sexy but along with it saying something more substantial as a message. Not sure how I feel about this yet, but it's interesting to think about what it all means.",

One of my consistent comforts in life is watching my favorite YouTube streamer play games, and he is always getting mean comments about how his parents must be embarrassed by him, he\u2019s a 30+ balding guy playing children\u2019s games, etc. But it\u2019s his hobby that he loves.

I think it\u2019s terrible that we live in a culture where so much of your value as a human being is tied to the prestige of your job. When I was unemployed and playing games, I was the exact same person as I am now, but I was treated so much worse by certain people. \n\nI don\u2019t want to improve medical science so that children can survive to become useful workers. I want them to be healthy so that they can experience fun, explore existence on their terms, and discover their own sense of meaning and self-actualization. We shouldn\u2019t enshrine engineers/scientists/doctors etc. as desirable occupations primarily for their status, underscoring the message that if you have no ambition to chase these careers, you are a parasitic loser. This contributes to burnout, mental health problems, and going through the motions at the expense of integrity and quality. Who feels genuine drive to better a society that would hold you in contempt? \n\nOf course people would rather watch someone who simply wants to entertain them and share pleasure, rather than someone who will cause them to question their self-worth, wonder if they\u2019re not competent enough, or feel pressured to perform and climb to meet society\u2019s conditional standards for approval. I wanted to be a scientist when I was a child because I read a book called The Shark Lady. The book didn\u2019t say, \u201cTo avoid being degenerate dead weight like models and comedians, become a scientist.\u201d It said, \u201cEugenie Clark kept being told that sharks were a stupid waste of time and she should do other things with her life, but she studied them anyway, because she liked doing that.\u201d As an adult I lost sight of this. I remember when I used to go to work because I was afraid of what everyone would think of me if I couldn\u2019t say I was doing something important. I was miserable. It was only after I realized that my friends and father genuinely still loved and respected me just the same when I was unemployed, and that the only remaining source of shame was from my own insecurities, that I was actually able to go back to work because I want to help others with my skillset.\n\nIf we want kids to work to pursue education and improve our community, we should give them a reason to value it, and that means letting them have human dignity when they are doing other things, too.",

            "I'm curious to how you feel about video game theorists like MattPat, who pretty much do both. An influencer and educating the kids.\n\nPersonally my mind is just reeling back to early Youtube, before it was bought by Google. A lot of kids started making silly parodies of the shows they watched. They would dub over the show, script or no script, with bad mics. Sometimes it wasn't a parody dub of a show they loved, but a full on skit. Demand was popular, but most kids with high demand wouldn't continue for some unknown reason. Also, they got no money for this whatsoever. As time grew on there were kids who got more famous like Lonegirl15 and Shane Dawson. These people had videoblogs or skits and kids just ate it up. \n\nWhen Google bought Youtube they eventually added ads to the mix, and those celebs doing it for free initially rejected it, but eventually started utilizing them for cash. Influencers grew up and felt that they needed the money. Ads were really controversial on Youtube, and people still hate them. Now people use Youtube strongly for cash and likes. The fame was still a thing back then, but it was less important back then, because no one took internet celebs seriously. They weren't \"actual\" celebs like actors and musicians. Then people started getting smart phones, and they started using the web regularly rather then at home or if they were lucky enough to have a laptop and dumb enough to have a facebook argument at a restaurant.\n\nNow people use phones and tablets constantly. Because it's a constant factor in our lives social media has expanded beyond teens. Adults need those likes too. Parents use Youtube to keep their children entertained rather then giving them a real education. When I was a kid my mother bought me CDs like Reader Rabbit and Cluefinders to help educate me, and she still considers it to be educational. But honestly I was playing those games for so long that my brain got numb and couldn't do 2\u00d73 after 3 hours, never mind understand instructions for the new minigames being presented to me. Videos that don't educate are much better for a mind numbing experience of looking at a screen for too long (though that is a different kind of mind numbing).\n\nI think TV shows and video games being educational for the children who utilize them is incredibly important, but realistically the internet has always been a tug of war battle between adults and children. If you want children's shows to be more  educational, I feel ya. If you want the people who are famous to be scientists and other educators I understand, although honestly every college professional I've seen lately seems to have the same goddamn personality, and I can't like someone so bland. Maybe kids feel the same way, even if they don't know it. If you want less pranks, a lot of people are getting cancelled for pranks, but a different kind of poisonous mockery is spreading, one highly based on the evaluation of body language, speech, and evaluation of character. That is something spread both by influencers and children. A lack of understanding of what cyberbullying looks like in less obvious forms has allowed of children who are constantly bullying others on social media and seeking out to bully others. Really at this point, if you want educational television, you'll have to allow that educational video to be full of mockery to someone else. Without mockery, it's hard to provide something entertaining to children these days. It's just their culture, it's what they understand to like. But humor has always been a strategy teacher's use to get kids to listen to them. \n\nAnyways I went off and rambled, I hope you enjoyed it.",

Before the Internet came along, atheists were a very small minority, but that group has grown many times over due to the fact that the Internet allows for the spread of information (the debate format being one of those). As long as you don't expect instant results, Internet debating is possibly one of the best things that an ordinary person can do in order to disseminate your ideas and help them take root in the collective psyche of society.",

Correcting them does not fix the problem because they won't be corrected,  what blanks they filled in themselves are set in stone in their mind.\n\nFor example,  if someone posts that they are 2 years sober from being an alcoholic and you say \"great job,  it's a tough hurdle to get through!   I used to be an alcoholic\" they will firstly claim that you weren't a real alcoholic. That because you didn't need to go to aa there is no way you could understand the struggle,  and you deserve countless downvotes for telling the man congratulations and you can relate. \n\nJust have to let those people think whatever they want,  chances are they are mid argument with other people and they won't remember you anyway.

They are sitting in this class at 14 or 15 and learning about buying homes- something that many of them aren't going to do until they are 30.  Sure, you can make pretend budgets, but pretending you earn $50,000 a year is completely pie in the sky until you are actually doing it.\n\nI remember doing a budget in high school and saying that I would live in an apartment that cost $600 a month because it was the cheapest around.

            "My school had a Health and PE class. Basically had it every day, 3 classes a week being health, 2 being PE. The health classes thought us everything from sexual health/education, nutrition, relationship managing and even budgeting/taxes. The amount of times I see people from my school posting something like, \"I wish they taught me how to do my taxes at school rather than algebra\" is infuriating. I often comment on it saying, \"they did. You just spent the entirity of those classes messing around and complaining that it was a health lesson rather than a PE lesson\". Boy does it ruffle some feathers, but it's true, I genuinely remember those people fuckin about in class and whinging that we weren't out playing rugby. The fact that they can't even remember that we had those classes shows just how little they paid attention. We also had a whole optional subject called home econ, which covered budgeting and taxes much more in depth and went into various aspects of running and maintaining a household. It got shut down because nobody chose to take it.",
            "I agree that it's a stupid argument and a stupid thing to say in general, but not for the same reason. I think it's stupid because it's basically saying, \"they should stop teaching kids life skills, and teach them life skills instead\". Like, what? Algebra, along with other math disciplines, as well as science ARE life skills. \n\nI just think that they need to be better taught in *why* and *how* they **are** life skills. I wish I had all of the passion for science (and learning in general) that I have now, back in high school. When I actually applied myself to a class, I could get pretty much straight As in it, but I just didn't apply myself, for some reason. I couldn't tell you why, there were so many factors and my memory of back then is a blur. \n\nI still maintain that quite possibly the biggest factor contributing to poor performance in school is the start time being so early. I can tell you that I *NEVER* felt well-rested in school, except for during the summer when I could sleep in every day I wanted. That entire time, K-12, there was hardly a school day when I *didn't* fall asleep in class at least once, then you stack that on top of insomnia that sometimes doesn't let up for three or four whole days and ya got yourself the perfect recipe for a \"brilliant but lazy\" student.",
            "Schools should teach both.",
            "That\u2019s not true. In my \u201cpersonal finance\u201d class, we spent a semester learning how to write checks and how to budget an adults month. (Like I\u2019ll be paying car payments right after I graduate high school??) I wish there would\u2019ve been a class that taught me about loans for college, applying for scholarships and jobs, credit (22 and still have no clue about it!), resume building, and the advantages of trade school over college. BUT THERE\u2019S NOTHING LIKE THAT. Children are about to graduate and agree to debt that they don\u2019t understand, but have the ability to balance a checkbook (even though, most banks now have apps). That would have been well worth our time and helped so many people, including me.",
            "Disagree. This is fucking stupid. It assumes\n\n1. Nobody pays attention in class\n2. That if you don't pay attention you don't get any information\n3. That useless information you don't remember is somehow better than useful information that you don't remember\n\nAnd all 3 can be proven wrong. This is one of those unpopular opinions where it's unpopular because it's pretty stupid. I still remember shit from my Algebra 2 Trig and Stats class despite me paying zero attention and it being the easiest class in the world.",
            "People who think *algebra* isn't a life skill are the type of people who wouldn't pay attention to the rest of the classes, but there are lots of unnecessary advanced courses that result in blind spots when it comes to life skills.  \n\nPersonal finance obviously is built on Algebra, so it (and basically any other class where numbers are involved) would be pretty useless before passing Algebra. However, I've seen relatively smart people do *incredibly stupid* things when it comes to personal finance, like how half of our generation took out college loans that they couldn't pay back. Prior to 2005, I could give them the benefit of the doubt that the job market crashed with the economy after they had already set their plans in motion, but people taking out loans after that who had no idea what kind of job or pay they could get once they graduated are a casualty of a system that didn't offer them basic formulas for calculating loan payments and investment returns. That's not high-level accounting, but it is a bit complicated. Taxes are another class all together, IMO.  \n\nBasic computer skills are another thing that get skipped over a lot. I was fortunate to be taught about computers when I was 5, and went through computer classes in school where I learned some more advanced information about computers.  \n\nNext, I'd say that in addition to learning Government, I think it's extremely important to teach kids about how the law works. Maybe that class would be a little bit of what is and isn't legal, but also teaching about legal rights, the difference between a misdemeanor, felony, and administrative fine, and basically educating them on general legal practices. I know that seems like it's something that should only be an intro class for people wanting to become lawyers, but it would be very helpful in dispelling some myths about law enforcement as well as teaching students what their options are if and when they ever have legal issues as adults. When you go to court, they don't always offer you everything that you actually need.  \n\nAnd as a side note, a firearm safety course would be very useful.  \n\nAnd lastly, I'd say Mental Health or Basic Psychology would be a great class to add to high school in Freshman year. I don't think that psychology should wait until college- I think that a mental health class could do a lot for many students.",

It was always so interesting and fun being able to actually learn somthing we will all use. Everyone looked forward to going.

Maybe instead of drama teach something practical. \n\nI just think its there to give people the tools sure many wont take advantage of them but some will. We don't stop offering college prep course and other advanced programs ect because only handful of kids use it. Fact is all they need is to be offered the information. \n\nPersonally I think credit cards showing up on 18th birthday where people have no idea or concept of how it works really is sleezy that society not only allows but encourages it with lame excuses should have read the fine print ect."

            "False.\n\nWhy the slut double standard exists \n\n(and why it's correct) \n\nMEN \n\nIn nearly all societies throughout time, men have been the ones who are expected to approach and initiate contact. (Also note that is is true of nearly all mammals, and most other animals too). They must compete with one another, risk embarrassment and rejection, and the expenditure of resources (both tangible and social) in the hopes of finding a mate.\nIt is their biological role to seek out females, and win their favor for a shot at reproduction. If the man has poor skills or appears to be weak/sickly his chances to mate are greatly diminished. If a man is able to sleep with many women it is a strong indication that he possesses skills and traits that make him a highly desirable and valued individual. \n\nA man who is able to sleep with many women is essentially the pinnacle of what men are designed to do. Other men recognize this and will applaud that man's achievement even if they feel a bit jealous. Women, too, recognize this and may find themselves attracted to such a man - because if many other women want him he must be doing something right. \n\n\nWOMEN \n\nWomen operate on a qualifying paradigm. Because reproduction for women is time consuming, potentially fatal, and of a limited capacity, it is a woman's biological prerogative to be very choosy with whom she is sexual. She must be sure to secure the best mate she can, or risk the possibility that her children are weak or disadvantaged. When a woman sleeps with many men it's a strong indication that her ability to judge quality in mates is non-existent and she does not care about the possible consequences of her actions. \n\nMore importantly, men who are aware of her habits will be unable to trust her. At a deep instinctual level men cannot stand the idea of having a child with a woman who sleeps around because the paternity of the child would be in question. Loose women are looked down upon with scorn because they cannot be trusted.",

            "It's been my experience that a whole lot of that depends on where and what social circles a person grew up in. \n\nI had a doctor who swore all the time and it used to make me laugh. He was probably near 60, had a superb 'steel trap' mind to remember anything (hence a great doctor) but he'd say something like \"..and you don't want to get the disease because its a motherfucker\" or \"these salesmen are always here with some bullshit products but this one is good\"\n\nI was told he came straight out of an old school fishing village family. I know that area and that is just how they talk. They wouldn't even know they were using foul language because its so inherent.\n\nSo this is how it seems to be. \n\nIF you listen to someone like Dr. Jordan Peterson, you can easily hear someone who grew up in a small rural working class, hunting, sort of life who could not change that northern Alberta way of speaking but who modified it for .. well you know, professors in lectures and then those on TV shows.. so you'll hear him say things like:\n\n\"...and let me tell ya.. they wont give a 'goshdam' what the hell you think\" and \".. like I give a Flying...  a flying you-know-what..\"\n\nSo he cannot stop or remove it. He can just kind of replace what is his family, his friends, his townspeople's way of speaking entrenched in his being. \n\nAs for people being smart, intelligent, educated and all that bullshit - you will find the best of them are plainspoken and they will use foul language IF and when they understand it best communicates an idea. They just wont rely on it.\n\nBy the way.. that is where some people do go wrong - when they cant think something through and just rely on foul blurts and 'noises'. \n\nby the way, there are studies on this kind of thing (duckduckgo them if you want) but for one example:\n\nMost might be very surprised to learn that the way a 'Cockney dockworker' spoke was as complex, as nuanced, had as many bits of information, as many 'codes'  as large of a working vocabulary and lets say as 'Sophisticated' as Oxford University's top scholars and their parlance? \n\nSound crazy? No way?\n\nBut linguists can actually show that and yes it includes using foul words. The Oxford Master may very well use \"wholly preposterous\" and \"rings hollow\" and \"A Quagmire of overwrought assertions\".\n\nVs\n\nthe dockworker (and I don't know cockney so I will make up a generic one) but the dockworker can convey \"fuck that shit\"  and \"hes talking shit\" and \"its a clusterfuck of bullshit\"\n\nThe dockworker has communicated just as much information with just as much context, social textures, just as much information in just the same levels of nuance or specificity with just as much emotional sense as the Oxford scholar to another scholar. \n\ncount for count, rig for rig, part for part, target for target, data byte for data byte, they are actually both equally sophisticated machines side by side. \n\nOh and the Oxford scholar raised in the Oxford world and family would not be good at using the dockworkers foul words because (here again) they require a skilled way, tones, where and when they are used properly (yes, properly, the proper way) they would not use them at the right times or places etc. Conversely, the dockworker could memorize \"Paradigm Shift' and \"dubious attributes\" but would have trouble using them appropriately, in the right times, with the specific tone and twists to be useful. \n\nTD;LR  Fuck that, language is different and shit but that's fine.",

Humans didn't just randomly \"invent\" arbitrary reasons to \"\"hate\"\"each other and discriminating purely based on \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"the color of skin\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" is not and has not ever been a thing, ever. When black people in America were being kept segregated from whites, the people who did that weren't citing skin color as a reason lmfao. You would have to be completely and utterly ignorant of the history to think otherwise.\n\nThere are clear genetic differences between population groups. Science is clear on that, this is settled and uncontroversial. Different people create different cultures, and as a result conflict occurs when different cultures collide and aren't able or willing to come to agreements and compromises. These conflicts lead to violence and so in order to prevent violence, or end it, people in the past have used segregation and (ethno) nationalism to address these very real, i.e. not \"invented\" conflicting interests. The states in east and central Europe that were created after the great war are an example of this. In the US the federal government decided in the 1960s that in order to resolve the conflicts between whites and blacks it was best to deny the reality of the existence of these conflicts and declare everyone as equal. That was one way to deal with this problem, to sort of wish it away by force. As a foreigner I'm not sure if this strategy worked or not, but to say that humans invented these conflicts implying they did so for irrational reasons is absurd to put it mildly.",

Reading some of the top comments was starting to solidify that, but then it occurred to me- there is a limit to how far you can extend this logic, so I\u2019m not sure where it cuts off exactly. \n\nYears ago, my 3 year old dog needed surgery on her knee. It was so painful for her to sit, stand, or walk that she mostly just lay there. We had to carry her up the stairs at night. We opted to pay out $6000 to fix her knee. \n\nThe experience was awful for her. Many trips to the vet in the lead up, lots of distress. The procedure was a success, but she had a very painful recovery that took months, and for a long time she was in much more pain than she had been to begin with. Despite our best care and efforts, the plate became infected and had to come back out again after the bones fused together. Another $1000 and more painful recovery. \n\nShe is now 9 years old, and has had many wonderful things in her life since the operation. She loves our other dog, going swimming, and hiking. She loves to be with us. I think that if she had a choice that she could understand, she would have chosen the same outcome. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t the same as going through chemo, but the idea is the same. We put her through pain she didn\u2019t understand, trauma of being overnighted at the clinic, and a very difficult recovery.

He lived very happily and had no idea he was sick despite having a very aggressive form of cancer. My #1 concern with treating him was his quality of life. When the time came to euthanize him, I made hardest decision to let him go. I was in the position to keep going. I could have kept going until there was nothing left of him but I didn\u2019t do that because I\u2019ve work in veterinary long enough to know that I couldn\u2019t be selfish like that. \n\nYou don\u2019t know dick about this field and it shows.\n\nEdit: you are not a bad person if you choose not to treat your pet.

            "Does this view extend to all surgery? Dog needs leg amputated, going to wake up with the same emotions. What is the cut-off (*hehehe*) point when it's 'not enough life'?",
            "Earlier this year I took my eldest dog to the vet to have him euthanized. He was nearly 15, bordering on complete incontinence, and had largely lost the use of his back legs. The only reason he lived as long as he did is because I put him through chemo twice. At 4 years old, he was diagnosed with stage 4 (maybe stage 3, it's been a long time) lymphoma. As far as cancers go, lymphoma was about the best I could hope for, but the prognosis was not good. The vet said average remission time was one year from the start of treatment, with about 20% of dogs going over a year and 5% of dogs being \"cured\". Dogs that did not receive treatment tended to decline rapidly. As advanced as his cancer was, I felt I'd be lucky to get that year. I loved my dog, he deserved so much more than another year, and I wasn't ready to let him go, so I spent the next 6 months driving 2 hours both ways every week for his treatments. My dog was rather demanding when it came to attention from people, especially strangers/people he didn't see often. He was excited to go for a ride every week and barked at every vet tech who wandered by but did not stop to say hi and take him back to meet more people. Never once did he exhibit fear of the vet or reluctance to wander off with someone in scrubs who was wholly unfamiliar to him. Out of all the chemo drugs, only one hit him hard. He came home from the vet after that first treatment and spent the day shivering and sleeping. I made the vet aware of this reaction and they adjusted the dose. He never had that reaction again. After the first round of chemo was complete we had regular check-ups to verify remission. Two months after he completed chemo, he was testing positive for cancer again. Not good news. The vet gave me the option to attempt chemo again, but advised me that remission for the second round was typically shorter than the first (which was already shorter than average), but there was still a small chance of a longer remission time or \"cure\". Considering my dog enjoyed the attention from vet visits and seemed to have suffered no adverse affects from the chemo I decided he was worth a couple thousand more dollars if it meant he got a few more months. Six months later, chemo's done and he's in remission. A year later he's still in remission. Two years later he's declared functionally cured. I got another decade with the only creature in my life I could 100% rely on and I would do it all over again if I had to. This is just one story and may not represent the majority of experiences, but it certainly paints a different picture from what you assert. I think you paint a pretty grim and inaccurate picture of the professionals in the canine oncology field and the environment in which they operate. I think you misunderstand the experience of the dogs undergoing chemo and how well their owners know them. My dogs may not be able to speak, but you can bet your ass I know when they're feeling happy/playful/irritated/unwell/etc. If my dog had reacted to chemo the way you described, I may have had reservations and ended it early. It's about quality of life and his was not negatively impacted (my understanding is that dogs are not treated as aggressively as people). Again, this is just my experience and, as such, not necessarily typical, but I imagine you'd find many other stories out there just like mine if you looked.",
            "As the son of a vet and pet owner, I\u2019d have to say it depends. Some cancer cause them pain, so if I\u2019m it\u2019s pain either way, then I\u2019d recommend. Sometimes, chemo can extended their life by a margin of 5+ years, so I\u2019d recommend chemo. If the cancer can be completely destroyed by chemo, I\u2019d recommend chemo. If it would extend its life by just a few months or a year, no chemo. If the cancer causes little-no pain, no chemo. You get what I\u2019m saying?",

            "Wrong. My 8 year old beagle was diagnosed with lymphoma in Aug 2011, went into remission in November 2011, completed chemo in February 2012 and has stayed in remission since then. He had not one adverse reaction to chemo (no vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, etc.) Did he love going to the vet? No. Did he want to die at 8? Doubtful. He's 16 now and is in kidney failure. I give him fluids everyday. Does he love getting them? No. He still eats, wags his tail, rides in his wagon on our walks, is as active as any 16 year old dog, and is happy and pain free. I think that's worth the ten minutes it takes to put warm saline under his skin with a 20g needle. He usually falls asleep while I'm doing it. \n\nYour statement could be applied to many illnesses/maladies for dogs. Your 10 year old dog breaks a leg, you put him down instead of having the surgery?

            "I think you\u2019re just trying to be controversial here and your example is very generic.\n\nI have a friend who had a 15 year old cat.  It became ill, and she spent thousands (going into debt - not cash on hand) trying to make it better.  Within one year it died.  To me, that was a waste of money and was likely going to have the same result no matter what due to the cat\u2019s age.\n\nPersonally, I had a very young cat once (6 months old) who, I found out, had deformed hips, so her little kitty kneecaps would pop out.  I got one of her knees operated on, and the vet told me at the time that I could spend $6,000 to basically cut off her back legs, cut off her hip ball joints, put new ones on, and sew her legs back on.  I decided that would be too much trauma for her to go through, even at her young age.  After her one knee surgery, she walked still with a wobbly other leg, but she was not in pain and she was jumping normally and very loving and happy.  She lived a long time and never needed that invasive surgery.\n\nBut this is a totally subjective issue in general.  Most people with dogs, cats, birds, whatever, feel like those pets are their \u201ckids\u201d.  You would do anything for your kids.  We now have a Yorkie (he\u2019s 8 yrs old).  If he gets sick, I\u2019m sure we would look at his age, the diagnosis and the prognosis and make a decision that would hopefully provide the best outcome given the circumstances.\n\nBut the way you put it, sounds like we should never take an animal to the vet because it might be scary.  Our dog needs annual dental surgery.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s scary for him, and I\u2019m sure it hurts him to have teeth taken out.  He\u2019s lethargic and mopes around for a few days.  But after those few days, I can tell you that he loves us just as much and is happy as all get out.\n\nYour post makes sense maybe if you\u2019re siimply stating that old pets that are going to die anyway shouldn\u2019t get chemo.

He was the happiest dog you could imagine, and he died in my arms.

            "Oooh boy - there's a lot of misconceptions here. This was my job for many years, I was the tech that gave the chemo to dogs and cats. Here's the differences -\n\nWe can't cure cancer, you are correct that chemo extends life. An argument for you is time frame, let's look at lymphoma since it's the most common cancer we see. Without chemo your average survival after diagnosis is 1-2 months. With gold standard chemo you are looking at 11-14 months.\n\nSince We know we can't cure it so our goal isn't remission, it's quality of life. Cancer itself makes you feel \"off.\" As someone who has never had cancer I can't describe it to you but I've been told generally weak, kind of like a bad flu. \n\nWe use just enough chemo to beat back the cancer enough that they aren't feeling sick, but not too much that they get sick from the drug itself. If done correctly 70% of dogs have no side effects, 28% (not an exact number) have mild side effects that can be managed by some anti nausea  or anti diarrheal drugs, the remaining small % do need to be hospitalized because they were affected by the chemo too much. When that happens we decrease our doses before the next round. Doxorubicin is a common drug in humans and animals, the human dose per articles is 60-70mg/m2, a dog typical dose is no more than 30mg/m2, half of what people get. \n\nTime - very few drugs actually require a long session. Doxorubicin does need to be given over 20-30 min but in a typical lymphoma protocol you only get that drug 4 times. All the other drugs in that protocol I can give over 10 seconds or are orally given, pop a treat and ready to go home. \n\nYour dog is your dog but we build a relationship just as much. In our clinic we don't sedate, we minimize pokes, it's basically a cuddle session. We don't end as strangers. \n\nWhile I will never tell anyone what to do with their own pet (i just put my own dog down this past week due to cancer, no we did not do chemo, would not have helped) it is my job to inform people looking for options. Are you an asshole for not going chemotherapy on your pet? \n Absolutely NOT.  At least in my clinic our goal is to help you feel comfortable with your decisions and be there when you need us. The worst thing you can do is spread misinformation. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.\n\nEdit - rearranged paragraphs",

Hell if I have to put my dog through 6 months of feeling like shit so he can go on and live a further half decade filled with love and happiness then you bet your fucking ass I'm taking him to chemo. I want my pupper to live. If the dog is old then sure it's an asshole thing to do, but you're saying that chemo lasts years and that's not always the case. You're literally complaining about super specific cases of old dogs that get cancer that can't be cured with a round of chemo.

            "Veterinarian here who has worked  with multiple specialists for over 20 years, including oncologists (specialists that treat cancer). Before I went to veterinary school I thought we should not  treat doggos with chemotherapy. Since then, after gaining more experience with  the treatment options and seeing how much better dogs do during treatment vs humans I have changed my mind significantly. In the vast majority of cases they suffer minimal to no side effects unlike people. With that said, this level of care is \u201cexpensive\u201d (relative term) and our goal is rarely cure, but rather prolonging life with as much quality as possible thus there is no \u201cright\u201d decision.

We help them make decisions, but can\u2019t make them for them because everyone has different goals and thresholds both financially and emotionally regarding the extent of care they want to pursue. With that said, I have spent much of my career, as most vets I know have, counseling people against going to far trying to save their pet and putting them through too much when the prognosis is very poor.  Way to much to go through here- maybe I\u2019ll do an AMA one day- haha. \n\nAnyway- have fun trashing me if you disagree,, but I am so glad I chose this profession\n\nFirst comment ever- hope I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.",

            "Veterinarian here. The OP has some misleading information here. In human medicine, chemo is given in an attempt to cure with a hope to at least extend life. Because of this large doses are given and people get very sick from chemo. In animal medicine, it's just the opposite. Chemo is given in an attempt to extend life with a hope to cure. Because of this it is dosed in such a way that animals rarely get sick or feel bad after treatment. Additionally if they do end up feeling bad, the dosage is reduced on their next treatment to prevent this. No owner would stick with a protocol that would make their animal sick. \n\nLastly, I agree with others. It very much so depends on the type of cancer. Something like lymphoma tends to be pretty treatable and most dogs go into remission for a few years. However, something like osteosarcoma is going to take their life within 6 months to a year regardless. \n\nIt very much becomes an evaluation of the animals current age, quality of life, and type of cancer before you decide and that's what is vets are here for to help in that.",

Once reactions appear, the dose is reduced. You are right - animals don't have a choice in the matter - and veterinarians are not horrific people.

They are there with you through it all, they feel the emotions and know something important is happening.\n\nMaybe people should let their dog go in peace. Maybe they should try to save them.

He never once got sick or showed ill effects and is very happy now that he can breathe properly. Dogs handle chemo way better than humans. \n\nIf it had the same effects on dogs that it does ppl, I would agree. My wife had breast cancer and I saw up close and personal what it does.

We had a great 2 more years with her until the cancer caused her too much pain to walk and we put her sleep.",
            "I actually totally agree with this. Our basset hound was diagnosed with lymphoma a few years ago and we had to decide what to do. We could do chemo which would likely extend his life about a year and he would be miserable, prednisone which would give him an extra month or two, or to put him down right then and there. Our dog lived to eat. He loved food and knowing that the one thing he loved he wouldn't even enjoy on chemo it was pretty much a no brainer. We gave him the prednisone and he got all the treats he wanted. Want some of my peanut butter sandwhich, sure why not? Want some bacon, here's your plate. We spoiled him rotten in those last few weeks, and had a vet come out to our house to put him to sleep in the comfort of our home.",

            "Both of my dogs died from cancer a year apart, one at 8 and one at 9. It\u2019s incredibly hard to tell if chemo is the right thing to do.

The second died due to a stroke caused by a cancer we didn\u2019t know about so we didn\u2019t have time to think of chem. I think calling someone a bad person for this is way out of line, should you put your dog on chemo? It really depends on the cancer but I would usually say no.

This went for 2 days until my mom figured it was time to take her to be put down. When she got there the vet, understandably, required a check up since this vet never saw our dog before. After checking her out and a x-ray he determined she had a massive tumor in her lower intestine. My mom understood and assumed this is what caused her recent dip in health, and if anything assumed this was the nail in the coffin. But, the vet said since he assumed the tumor would be cancerous, he suggested and eventually pushed treatment onto my mom. Chemo on a 16 yr old Bassett Hound. Not to be heartless to my family dog we've had around forever, but whats the point? To make her miserable? The whole experience was hard on my mom and even harder with the judgy and pushy mentality the vet office held towards her.

She couldn't understand what happened to her leg and was depressed. The cancer had already spread into her organs, and she lived her last 3 months in pain and suffering.

Woke up to her screaming in pain and seizing on the floor. I rushed her to the vet at 5:00 AM and he said he could save her if I really wanted to. But the way she was looking at me, her eyes glazed but pleading, I had to let her go. It was the hardest decision but also, strangely, the easiest one. Because it was *her* decision, not mine.

The typical image of a human with no hair undergoing huge bouts of nausea and general misery with chemotherapy does not apply to dogs.

Every day he caught at least one Maus in the fields and he loved to run in the woods. The doctor told us that he would probably die soon, but that we could give him a few years if we'll make him go through chemo. My parents decided that it was better not to do so, because it was selfish to make him go through this just so we wouldn't have to give him up so soon. And he was good for a while. We treated him with sausage and other things he loved... Because we wanted him to die happy. He became 17. But from one day to the other he was just laying there. He looked like he was in pain. And he peed all over the bed. My Mom and Dad drove him to the vet and decided that it was time to put him down. I didn't know that. I came home from school to see that my parents weren't home and when they came my big brother was laying in my mother's arms not moving anymore and she told me I had to say goodbye. I cried my eyes out.  And I blamed my parents for not doing the chemo. I think I was around 11 and I didn't understand what he would have had to go through.

Do you refuse to give your dog antibiotics to clear up a UTI because they don't want to take the pills? No, you make them take it because otherwise the infection will get worse.

I tried some medications as a last resort, then let her go. But if chemo would have helped her get another 5-6 perfectly healthy years with a manageable amount of discomfort in between?

            "My wife and I had a 4 year old Corgi who was diagnosed with metastatic lymphoma.  First sign he showed was severe diarrhea and quickly after he stopped eating.  Our vet kept misdiagnosing him.  We ended up at a new vet after about 6 weeks and by that time it had spread from the lymph nodes to his liver, spleen, and intestines.  They offered us an appointment with an oncologist, but stated that it would probably only prolong his life by, at most, 6-8 months.  We opted to give him a huge dose of prednisone and pain killers, which got him back to feeling himself (eating normally, running around, being a generally sassy Corgi) for about 3 weeks.  During that time, we were able to say have some time to say our goodbyes, get some pictures of us (along with our then 2-year-old daughter), etc.  Had it been diagnosed quickly by the first vet, the chemo may have been a more viable option, but it was explained to us that it still probably wouldn't have cured him.  I like to think we still wouldn't have opted to do the treatment.  The bottom line is that it's a personal choice.  Only you know what's best for your family and your sick friend.",

            "I think you are misinformed about what treating an animal for cancer is like. I was exactly the same way until my beloved cat was found to have an agressive and mysterious tumor in her spine. That\u2019s when things changed for me.\n\nFirst of all, they would not spend hours getting treatment. The goal of treatment for pets is over all extending the quality of life for an animal, not lengthening it. Almost every vet will agree with this. \n\nActually, most treatments for pets is only to slow the growth of a cancer, not to cure; which makes treatment way less aggressive. While a cure is always a plus, medical professionals know that is not always an attainable goal. With lighter treatments than humans, around 80% of the animals experience no side effects and the side effects that are experienced are much shorter and less devastating than that of a humans chemo therapy treatment. \n\nThis \u201ctorture arena\u201d you speak of does not exist. IV chemo treatment is exceptionally rare for pets. Most are done by quick injection and is very similar to a regular pet visit. The injection is a couple seconds. \n\nI actually was very lucky to live where I do when my cat\u2019s growth was discovered. The area is actually at the forefront of animal health care with state of the art facilities. We had every specialist at our disposal. Cat oncologists, neurologists, surgeons, all of it. But every single one always let me know my full set of options. Never did I feel pressured to put my cat through a traumatic treatment. It was always up to me. I can see in someone else, someone not as ready to accept a fatal death sentence as my Cats, taking it much farther but- in doing so my cat might still be alive (and well/happy) today. Would the weeks of life saving rehabilitation been worth it to my cat? I don\u2019t know and it\u2019s not really up to anyone else to say what they do for love of their animal. Especially if the outcome would in fact be another 2 - 5 years of a happy life.",
            "When we treat cancer in pets we use much lower doses of chemo drugs than we would in people for exactly this reason. If we are giving enough that they are feeling unwell then we are failing. We know that we aren't going to get to a cancer free state like we do in people, we just try to slow the growth or reduce the size or effect of the cancer enough to improve the quality of life if the patient. Please don't rule out treating your pet for fear of making them feel worse, we can't tell them that they will feel better once it's over so we always only give treatments that will make them feel better and improve their quality of life. \nSource: am a veterinarian",
            "As a veterinary nurse who has worked in an oncology department for years (though not currently), you are misinformed on a few levels. The vast majority of animals don't experience any side effects from chemo beyond perhaps their fur changing texture. Some can have mild GI issues that resolve in 24-48 hours. There are rare occasions where side effects become more concerning and need further treatment or even hospitalization. Their human counterparts suffer way more than most of them ever will, however.",

If they are still young-ish and it would hurt them then yes, put them through chemo so they can live longer and happier. But my most recent lost cat was 17 and was in pain because of the cancer. Because of the pain and her old age, we had her put down. It really just depends on the situation, but if a dog were 5 and had cancer, then i would do chemo.",

If a dog has optimistically two years to live and it gets cancer, shortening its predicted lifespan by half, it\u2019s imo just cruel to put it through chemo or surgeries to POTENTIALLY extend its life a few months. Same with really old people. It\u2019s a drain of resources, time, and expertise with no real outcome. \n\nChemo is painful. Recovery from surgery and chemo is hell. I\u2019ve seen a dozen people go through it, I\u2019m going to see dozens more, and I\u2019m dating a doctor who sees this shit every day. Old people, old dogs, have a much harder time recovering from major procedures (or minor for that matter) than younger pets and people do. \n\nIt\u2019s likely that, by giving Old Rover chemo, you\u2019re not lengthening his life. You\u2019re just putting him through worlds of pain, confusion, and sickness in the hope that he gets a few more miserable days for YOU to have with him. That\u2019s selfish.",

I find than many of them (not all) are insightful and carries some sort of message about the human nature beneath the superpowers.\nWhat I can agree with is that the action genre is definitely taking over in terms of numbers, and unfortunately many of these movies are so shallow and only about the explosions and the biggest budget. Do we really need a 15th fast&furious, the nth transformers? Half of the movies with The Rock are the same to the point if you get random scenes of different movies and you put them together nobody would notice. So yeah it's not about cinecomics.",

They might package it up with CGI and sci-fi story elements, but under all of that it\u2019s still the same old themes that are at play.",

Movies are stuck at ~2 hours, and the only advantage they have left is spectacle.  Thus huge superhero or sci fi movies.  \n\nThink of it this way the first star wars Darth Vader had about 10 mins of screen time to establish how evil he was so he choked his own dude to death in the first minuite.

Doping in sports and drug addictions? Celebrity worship? The power, influence and revenue generation of the Jesus cult?\n\nOr are you gonna tell me victims of rape and police brutality aren't the people with real emotions and struggles you're looking for?

            "A core aspect of movies has always been escapism and fantasy.\n\nI'd argue that as the world has become more complex and life has become more stressful, the rise of escapist movies was inevitable.\n\n* Superhero movies create a world where right and wrong is black and white. Even movies like the Nolan Batman movies or Joker movie play on the subversion of the black and white nature of morality.\n* Superhero movies create concrete villains who can be blamed for the problems of the world, rather than the more nebulous historical, social, economic, and political forces where it's difficult (or should be) to pinpoint a specific cause. When you can identify a villain, you can solve the problem by defeating him.\n* Even though people rant about \"spoilers\" we all know how the movies are going to end - and it's comforting. We know the heroes will win - it's simply a matter of how. In the other types of movies, there may not be a \"happy ending.\" In more complex movies, there is no guarantee, and let's face it, finding out what Sophie's choice actually was is pretty disturbing. For what appears to be the majority of the movie going audience, spending days afterwards thinking about it is flat out depressing.\n\nFinally, your title says it all - it's the film INDUSTRY. By definition, the lowest common denominator has a better chance of appealing to the most people and being the most commercially successful. Additionally, superhero movies lend themselves to merchandising which is a HUGE driver of the economics.\n\nIf other genres of movies were able to generate that kind of profit, they would be made. Some comedies and rom coms do well because they are much cheaper to make and market, even if their box office isn't as high.\n\nThere will always be room for \"prestige\" movies because their economic value goes beyond the box office to lend their credibility to other films as a sort of halo effect for quality.",

The film industry is a good way for us to obtain helpful information but I must disagree with you.

As a personal fan of superhero movies, I enjoy going to the movies and watching Avengers Endgame per se.",
            "I see your point because I love superhero movies and really the only superhero movie that had me think about it days and weeks after was Endgame. So I agree that superheor films are dominating too much but I disagree with one part. \n\nI would really say that a film that shows cutural and historical events are not really Hollywoods forte. (Im not sure if you mean the Hollywood films but here's my opinon on that) In my opinion hollywood constantly romanticizes films like that and do a poor job on convey the exact events that happen. They add a lot of drama to it to make the film more interesting. Not to mention a lot of those hollywood films paint a white savior narrative (ex: 42, The Help, Last Samurai, Hidden Figures). And I'm not saying these films aren't amazing or that there isn't any films that can do that genre justice I'm just saying that whenever I see those kinds of film I say take it with a big grain of salt.",

Stories suck. They've been going downhill since the second Iron man (in my personal opinion anyway). BUT. Theyre fun, easy to watch, you don't have to pay attention at all because you figure out the plot in the first 15 mins max. I understand why your average Joe likes and enjoys them. Its an enjoyable experience with minimal effort and you get movie theater popcorn and forget about whatever is bothering you without trying. Same with Disney which have also been going downhill since tangled or princess and the frog, that time period. Drives me nuts af but its understandable. I just hate that movie theaters end up with several theaters for the same movie, usually more than 3. A necessary evil to please the crowds i guess.",

There are movies that make you think within the superhero genre just as there are within action movies, westerns, sports movies and every other genre that has been popular. \n\nSuperhero movies are just in right now. Their reign as blockbuster hits IS happening at a time when the only kind of profitable theater release is almost always a major blockbuster, due to streaming radically reshaping how people consume films, so they\u2019ll probably last as the blockbuster du jour for a bit longer than they would otherwise.

These meaningful films still exist today but just like before you have to go to watch them and not just go to the cinema to see what's on, you need to actively hunt these films out.",

            "I disagree with your implied view of animated films. They\u2019re fully of charm and by their nature artistic and can definitely leave you thinking if you give them a shot.

            "I think that with marvel, the 10 year lead up to endgame was amazing and endgame was an experience like none other but its a nice place to end. Also we just dont have many directors like Tarantino and Nolan who have these well made films with a lot more to them. Nowadays its just trying to make the most money.",
            "I think the one plot line that could really salvage this genre would be to make a film where the oblivious protagonist learns through a series of small adventures that he has powers he never imagined.  In the next act he would hone those powers and decide (after some internal debate) to use them for good.  In the third act he would be forced to use his powers to their extreme against an evil only he can defeat.  It would end in a 15-20 minute battle scene with a zillion quick cuts and sound designed to deafen the viewer.  Lots of explosions, even when completely uncalled for.  Then some more.  Viewers would go in to the movie knowing the good guy will win, and any sense of urgency or near-catastrophe the film makers wanted to instill in the audience would be futile, because that's how all of these movies are, but in the end the protagonist would narrowly avert disaster.  Then maybe he would say something funny and his friends would all laugh, like at the end of a shitty TV sitcom.\n\nIf Hollywood ever gets ahold of this plan they'll make hundreds of dollars.\n\nI have another idea for a buddy cop movie where the rookie\"go by the book\" cop gets paired up with the wizened old \"my way or the highway\" veteran cop.  The police chief, a mere 6 months from retirement isn't going to let the unlikely pair do anything to jeopardize that.  Finally, when the rookie saves the veteran's life they both learn something about the other and an unbreakable trust would propel them to do amazing cop things in many, many sequels.",

            "Facts",
            "Yeah I'm all burnt out on superhero cinematic universes, after End Game I decided that I was okay with never seeing another Marvel movie. I agree that they are pretty damn overrated in the sense that their plots usually have big holes in them, or they have reused tropes and washed up cliches, and don't get me started on that weird \"girl power\" scene in End Game. \n\nThat being said there are a plethora of real issues that are touched on in just the Marvel universe alone, in Iron Man 3 Tony Stark deals with anxiety and PTSD despite being a literal superhero, in Captain America Civil War you see serious discussion on state watch programs, in Black Panther you see an advanced society that turns their back on the world and the product of neglect in Killmonger (and if you want to see some great acting look at Ta'Challa's talks with his father about how Wakanda has failed the world).\n\nThe reason these films are dominating is because they're easy to digest, they've developed some complexity with the timelines so it gives people something to talk about and speculate between every movie at their cubicles. Think about Game of Thrones, how it went from a nerdy medieval political drama to Keeping Up with the Targaryens as soon as it got mass followings.",
            "Personally i prefer actions and short-lived thrills. Its not really my style to keep thinking about a film for days. To me, films are entertainment, and entertainment doesn\u2019t have to linger in my mind.\n\nCoincidentally superhero films tend to have a lot of action scenes, which i like",
            "Mind If I recommend a movie since we're in the topic; Heneral Luna, a story about a general that got betrayed by his own compatriots.",
            "While I agree with you that superhero movies are overstaying their welcome arent really serious deep films, there will always be a form of a blockbuster genre that will dominate (like cowboy movies did at some point, I guess). Serious and deep films will never dominate the film industry. \n\nPeople who finance films care about making money and making money involves appealing to the lowest common denominator, so making films that teach cultural or historical events and that showcase real emotions, generally dont have the profit margins a superhero film does.\n\nWhile I agree with you that things shouldn't be that way, its the way it is, in the end I think many times the potential for making money corrupts artistic integrity.",
            "Yeah the classical superhero adaptations are getting tiring, even the well-made ones.  However, I don\u2019t mind a good movie about super-powers in an intense action-drama (such as The Boys on Netflix)",
            "You won\u2019t find movies that stick with you for days coming out of a mainstream theater or mainstream Hollywood. Some of the films I\u2019ve seen tend to be indie films and foreign films. I personally loved a Ghost Story. The film has very little dialogue and yet says so much with so little. Most people that watch mainstream films hated it and gave it bad reviews. Superhero movies keep coming out because filmmakers have data that suggest people will pay to see it. People keep paying handsomely, so Hollywood keeps making them.",

            "There is a guy I went to high school, he is probably 33 or 34 now. He is always posting on Facebook, which his entire family can see, pictures and comments about puppy play, i.e., dressing as a dog and banging dudes who are also dressed as a dog. The fact that he likes this is whatever, i don't care, but why does he have to share shit like that to his aunts and uncles and parents and grandparents? They don't wanna see that shit, why do they need to know you like banging dudes dressed as a dog?\n\nThe thing that makes me really mad is that he came out as nonbinary--truly the least shocking thing in the world if you had ever met them for ten minutes. I saw him make a really whiny post about how his family wasn't supportive of his transness (being nonbinary isn't the same as trans as far as I know), and they were hurting his SOUL because they wouldn't use his newly adopted name. I saw his mother say, \"we love you no matter what, we are all going to do our best to use the name, we may slip up from time to time after 25-30 years of using your original name, but we are trying our best to support you.\" This guy was mad that they would even admit that they might slip up.\n\nI was like, well, if youre trans, it really is a problem if people keep using your dead name but it seems reasonable that they might slip up sometimes.\n\nThe thing I didnt see from the post was what the new name was. I later found out from his cousin that he was demanding that his 90something year old grandparents and everyone else in his family call him Snorlax. SNORLAX.\n\nI thought he would want to be called a woman's name, not that of a fucking Pok\u00e9mon. \n\nIt felt insulting to me, like, there are real trans people who just want to live normal lives as normal people of the opposite sex and suffer a lot from some members of society being assholes about it, and you're going to cheapen the whole idea by demanding that people recognize  you as what, a trans-cartoon??? He was so butthurt about his family being uncomfortable but willing to try to support him, he was planning to stop talking to them, all because they might stumble verbally over this stupid ass cartoon identity he created, as if it deserves as much respect as trans people trying to live as the opposite sex. \n\nLook, if you want to live as a fucking pretend Pok\u00e9mon thing, okay, whatever.

Like seriously, I don\u2019t need to know who is into rope play, D/s, whatever the hell pony play is (don\u2019t tell me), etc.\n\nBut there is also a normalizing value to sharing certain things about your sexuality which can protect people with minority interests.  50 years ago, being gay and getting caught could land you in jail and cost you your job, your home, and in many cases, your life.  Gay people did not have the right to get married 10 years ago in the US.  Title IX protections did not apply to gay people literally a year ago.  Awareness that there are lots of decent gay people changed that.\n\nKink communities struggle in similar ways.  DAs will rarely prosecute rapes committed against people who have been identified as kinky.  Kink play often does not have legal protection, meaning if a cop catches you en flagrante doing a consensual kinky act, you can be arrested (kinda like how the old sodomy laws worked).  AFAIK, kinky people can fired for being kinky as well because kink is not a protected status.\n\nAll of that to say, there is a valid reason for the kink positivity movement. \n\nI think it\u2019s fair, though, to say there is a distinction between an awareness movement and showing people pictures of your ass after a caning.  No one wants to see a vanilla\u2019s used condom, why would any of us want to see the aftermath of your kinky endeavors?  And I think you can expand the concept of consent to over sharing.

            "My sister recently came out as pansexual which I support, but at the end of the day I don't care about, which is what I thought the LGBTQ+ movement was about. Not caring about ones sexuality and not asking about it.\n\nA few weeks ago me and my dad were sitting at the counter just talking about stuff, when she came downstairs and randomly said \"have you guys tried to guess my pronouns?\" It had been months since she came out, and she seemed like she was begging for attention. Her actions also pointed to that too; social media posts that edgy teen girls post, eccentric make up and clothing, weird hobbies that she constantly publicizes.\n\nShe always wants attention, and this was one of those moments. I called her out on it, saying that I don't care about her sexuality and pronouns, and that I will keep addressing her as a her/she. I also pointed out to her that she never asked me for my pronouns. \n\nShe later texted me saying \"btw i meant it don't talk to me anymore.\"\nWhich I was happy to oblige, as our relationship wasn't always good to begin with.\n\nI know I come off as a right winger here, but I consider myself an independent socialist, and I'm fine with homosexuals, lesbians, pansexuals, etc., But I still have quarrels with the idea that there are more than 2 genders.

The mere fact that anyone should have to say this shows just how far our society has deviated morally, and it's not good.\n\nAnd yes, their opinion here is largely unpopular among a very large portion of younger (millennial and younger; millennials are more or less on the border here, with some still adhering to the righteous path) people today. And I do believe our society's direction, or rather lack thereof, is the result of an intentional agenda, as seen in politics, by certain people with malicious intent to undermine the moral quality of our society. And yes, the LGBT organization, coupled with other leftist/postmodernists, play a big part in these bad actions.\n\nYesterday, for example, I had a realization about how the LGBT have advanced this notion of \"sexual fluidity,\" when in reality, those who studied it admitted-as is clearly expressed on its Wikipedia entry-that in fact, sexual fluidity occurs in a very small portion of people. That's every bit as disingenuous as claiming violent crime is associated with homosexuality after citing a few people like Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy, yet the LGBT continues to tell *most people in general* that their sexual orientations are fluid. Why do so many give them a pass? Why do these people continue to misrepresent the truth? They're obviously seeking to impose some perverse agenda on the public as a whole, but why, and what is really their end goal? You have to ask these questions.",

Also not a problem, until every single week when he came back from a meeting, he suddenly had \"a huge announcement to make\".\n\nIt was always something different too, like realizing he was trans, to preferring *they/them* pronouns, to deciding he was going to go head on into legit doggie play? (Like dressing like a dog and finding an owner who wanted to adopt him kinda thing), to deciding he was actually bi instead of gay (despite his catchphrase throughout the house being \"eww, vagina/boobs\").\n\nWe were generally supportive, but also of the generation where we don't treat people differently for being different. Not of the crowd where we celebrate all of these sexual differences. After a while unfortunately, it all just became a cry for attention. He started hassling the male roommates about why they weren't interested in \"dipping into his pool\" (he even did this shit to my ex husband). He started getting extremely offended that he wasn't hot enough (wtf?) to turn straight people gay. It turned into a really hostile living situation that myself and the other roomies had to GTFO of.

I always told her, if someone touches you, tell them to stop, if they don't, tell a teacher, and if they still don't, then you have every right to stop them yourself by any means necessary. So she told this boy to stop touching her, and grabbing her things, and he continued, she went to the teacher who did nothing, and finally she punched him in the arm. He stopped, and started bawling, so the teacher sent her to the principal who called me in, I was livid. First, I talked to my child, and then to the principal, I said if they suspend her for this, I'll call a lawyer since they allow sexual harassment of young girls. The boys parents wanted her suspended, but she got in no trouble after the situation was discussed. However the principal caused me nothing but trouble for the next 2 years!! My daughter was an honor student, and a good kid, never in trouble, but I had trouble anytime I had to go there... Waiting to pick her up from class with all the other parents, he would tell me I can't stand here unless I sign in... But no other parents standing here are signed in?? So i would refuse. He was an asshole. I probably should have filed a complaint at the time for the different treatment, but I was trying to keep things smooth for my child who had to attend. Ugh.",
            "Zero tolerance policies only entrench in people's minds that me against the world mentality. If you're going to be punished for defending yourself, there's no incentive to not fight and walk away, take your suspension and go home. You will develop the most extreme anti- authoritarian attitudes as you see the system as actively working against you instead of protecting you. Shit treatment from your peers reinforces that mindset of isolation and distrust. That's priming an individual to be anti-social, uncooperative, isolated and potentially dangerous. Sometimes shitty policies have real world effects that are devastating. In no way am I supporting or condoning the actions of individuals who reach this stage and often lash out with violence. I'm only highlighting the failure of a bad policy. Kids will fight. Kids will bully and be bullied. Treating situations on the merit of people's action is better than a broad brush approach.",

So, my daughter used to go to an after school program and one day when I went to pick her up I was told a 9 year old \"kicked her in the face and gave her a fat lip\"... my daughter was 5. I was livid of course but the next day I guess the 9 year old brought some mermaid toy in, my daughter grabbed it and snuck off with it, pulled the head off and told the teacher \"it's for kicking me in the face!\", and I was told I needed to replace it. I had a good laugh, said I'm not inclined to replace a kids toy who picks on someone half her size. I mean as far as fighting back that's the best she could do with her size and I pretty much told her \"I don't blame you\".

They call my dad and he shows up and sees me in the corner holding the meter stick like a samurai sword.  \n\nThe teacher and principle launch into what I did and my dad tells them to shut up and then he asks me \"what happened\"\n\nI tell them what happened and my dad says, \"Is that right?  Did that kid flick my sons ears all day and you told my son to stop being a baby and you didn't do anything to stop it.\"\n\nThe teacher says, \"Yes but that is no excuse\".  \n\nMy dad then says, \"My son told you about a problem and you did nothing, so he handled it.

And for most kids it\u2019s like a week, I would be locked in my room for months. Come home, chores, room. I had no access to the T.V, any of the shared laptops, a phone, anything technological, and occasionally they would take away my art and painting stuff.

The reason that the neighbor kid sprayed in the first place was because our son was in his house (we have explicitly that he has no business being in someone else's home without OUR permission) and wouldn't leave when asked.\n\nWhile the neighbor kid's reaction was completely over the top, the point is that our son left out key info in order to try and save his own ass.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nSo, yes, I agree that it is completely stupid to punish kids for defending themselves, but they could just as easily withhold information in order to appear as more of a victim.",

            "I was assaulted in a high school where they call the cops for any physical confrontation between students. Me and one of my sort of friends at the time got into a verbal argument and he ended up punching me in the face repeatedly while I stuck out my hand to push him away. I wanted to defend myself, but my entire future of going to college, scholarships, ect went through my mind and I decided that it was worth it to let myself be punched ( I got a black eye and bruises on my face) rather than hit back and risk losing any of that. It was so bad that another kid had to pull him off of me. We both got taken to the office, the cops show up and the first question they ask me is if I hit him back. My face was starting to puff up at this point, and despite the fact that I  was close to being the valedictorian, and had never been in trouble with the school, they treated me as if I was a criminal. Eventually I was asked if I wanted to press charges. I declined, but something still ended up going on his record, so I'm glad that I didn't fight back. Needless to say my reputation suffered with teachers thinking I was a trouble maker, and other students thinking I was weak for not defending myself. The kid who assaulted me was the son of the band director, and the director and I's relationship was never the same afterwards, and I believe it cost me band scholarships. If I could have defended myself, maybe all of this still would have happened, but I'd at least still have my dignity.",

My friend played hockey and was taller and athletic so he just grabbed the kid and threw him to the ground and told him he wasn\u2019t going to fight someone that much smaller, especially since they were fighting for no reason.

Well I go in and I see him struggling to bench 95, and has no clue how to work his legs besides squats. Now I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a strong man but damn I do know how to fight if I need to.  I\u2019ve at most benched 110, and my legs are probably pushing right around 285-320.

What other things have you been lying to all of us about\u201d because he was always boasting about how he could take anybody in the school in a fight. I punch him square in the jaw and I break it.

Then I bit his arm so he stopped. \n\nI got punished and he didn't. I've always been the \"nice guy\" in the good meaning. All my life.

I manage the elementary after-school program for a local school district, with eighty kids enrolled and average attendance of fifty kids per day. \n\nWe have a very visible, and well-known set of rules for program. Hands to yourself is a big one for us. In this community, there is a high crime rate and high arrest rates. We *are not* telling the kids to let someone completely beat the hell out of them, but we\u2019re trying to set the foundation that if you get used to solving things physically, that isn\u2019t not always easy to stop that habit as you get older. (Sometimes, including them breaking property.) We don\u2019t want to see these kids get arrested for assault, get sued, or possibly both. We want to set them up for success. They are by no means worthless to us, and we do our best to instill confidence in them. \n\nWe tell our students to tell a teacher ASAP if someone is antagonizing them (yes, they know this word\u2014we use it often to explain a bully). Then we have the bully call home with us right then and there to explain to their parents how they\u2019re behaving. If they continue, they cannot come to program the next day. Most of the parents *need* this program to work extra hours or attend evening classes. Program is 100% a privilege, and it being revoked is a tremendous hurdle for the parents who need it, so fortunately they tend to step up. Since October we\u2019ve had significantly less physical altercations, which is always great. \n\nWe do have a few students who out out of their way to be verbally cruel to others, and as awful as it is we just recognize as adults that once they\u2019re in high school, they\u2019re probably going to get the s*it kicked out of them. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb We hope they learn after the first time.",

I was later called to the office and my year head said he heard about a fight. I just said \"oh yea, I heard about it too\" and told him how I heard. He asked if I got into a fight so I said \"a fight? You know me, would I do that? it wa...\" I went to tell him it was hardly a fight, I beat him up but he told me I had a good point and sent me on my way before I could. Later that day, the bully told me he was being suspended because of me.\n\nAnother bully used to run to the head crying until someone who finally retalliated got suspended. One day, I saw him tripping people in rounders so I got a couple of people to really lay into him. Someone kicked his legs out and someone else smacked him in the face, flooring him, I rugny tackled him a few times. The teacher turned around each time and was always told he's tripping. He turned to see me on top of him with him in pain one time. Everyone just said he's tripping, I was tripped and fell on top of him. He was suspended. Apparently, the first day, he came in with his mum and went straight to the head who was talking to a year 7 (11-12) who told the head he was the year 11 (15-16) who was bullying her and her friends.

Luckily, he wasn't suspended since it was out of his normal character and he was being picked on (love those cameras). I don't tolerate bullies and neither does my son.

            "I agree. While at the same time, I think in part, the no hitting back rule comes from wanting to develop kids to assess their part in the matter before realizing they need to take physical action. It's hard sometimes to determine the role you play in crappy things happening to you, but it's good to know if you could use some self improvement before acting. Ultimately, if a kid hits someone, a lot of questions should be asked and unfortunately, I don't believe adults ask enough questions to figure out **why** from both parties. And punishment for unprovoked self defense is not a good way to go about it.",

Like, bullying is something more emotional than physical, is worse even. Look I\u2019ve never defended myself from an aggression and I\u2019m proud of it. Probably I was young at that time and all that shit could tell to teachers what was going on. I grown not being a bully who fights back every time I feel threatened. I know what bullying feels like but everybody here forget that bullies were told in their houses that they should use violence every time they feel threatened.\n\n\nThose who create this fight back mentality, are complicit in creating the violence that exists today in schools and even high schools (bullying doesn\u2019t happens just to kids from 8-13 but in teenagers and adults as well...)",
            "Yes and no. If it's fighting back right away then it's a hard no. If they have taken other more appropriate steps that haven't worked then yes.

Every time.  If one of those 2 is a bully then he will be suspended multiple times through the year.  If one of those kids is a victim who is standing up to a bully he will probably only be suspended once through the year.\n\nI know this seems like a grave injustice, but seriously nobody will ever care that you were suspended for fighting once in highschool.  Also I know the real world can get much more complicated than this so I think ever case should be followed up on.

NO! So the next best thing is to teach those who must deal with bullies how to best deal with them. \n\nMy son is six years old and in the first grade. He had a bully in kindergarten. Let me say that again. He had a bully in kindergarten. We dealt with it for six months up until the other kid head butted my son. Head butts are banned from all sanctioned fighting sports because they are so brutal. I told the school in writing that we dodged a bullet bc my son could have been seriously injured. If he is seriously injured by this other kid they can expect to hear from an attorney bc they have been made aware of the seriousness of the situation. \n\nHe also dealt with a bully this year in first grade, but it was in the form of name calling. He was calling my son fat, which he isn't even close to being fat, but again it's about making someone feel worse than you bc you like shit about yourself. My son started asking my wife if he is fat. We didn't realize what was happening and she would say oh yeah, your mommy's chubby baby bc he was a chubby baby. Then one day he refused to go into the school. He said he didn't feel well and that his brain was telling him not to go to school that day. She called me to speak with him. I knew something deeper was going on bc he usually responds well to my reasoning. When she got him home the truth came out. I gave him some coping skills, which were basically to give it back 10 fold and make him regret he selected you as a target. \n\nThey start young obviously. \n\nI'll also acknowledge that bullies look for easy targets and as a family we need to help my son carry himself in a way that doesn't project \"easy target\", but it takes time to build genuine confidence. But we are aware of it and we are putting him situations designed to do just that. \n\nThe day will come when my son takes out a bully and when he does I'm going to make sure he lives like a king during his suspension. \n\nBullies aren't going anywhere so we might as well teach people to handle themselves given the reality of the situation while those in dream land believe they can stop bullying with an anti-bullying campaign.",

I had only recently moved to England from Eastern Europe and didn't understand a whole lot back then, now I'm fluent and treat it as a second language and was ok back then but there were still obvious gaps. \n\nSo I was persistent In denying there was any way I was purposely being hateful to this poor girl who was always nice to me. The teachers didn't listen and just made me feel like shit and just ignoring me. got suspended for one day. I think since then I've felt depressed because I didn't fit and felt there wouldn't be (a space) for me here and I still feel that way. \n\nIt just goes to show how un-open minded such establishments are. Why do you think there are signs like \"parking here is at your own risk\" blah blah blah, it all goes back to not being sued or being the topic of a negative conversation.",
            "yeah, i remember this was this good who would pull my ears until they bled almost every day in this one class i had.  i wasn't afraid of him.  i was afraid of getting in trouble with my parents if i did anything about it and of being seen as a snitch if i told on him.  fuck that shit.  probably screwed me up for life, and i am screwed up.  if i could go back in time, i'd at least try to bash his head and and then tell my parents to eat shit",
            "I agree! I got jumped in school and immediately no tolerance was in my mind (as well as my school record and possibility of getting kicked out of early college program I had just got accepted into) so I just took the hits and luckily didn\u2019t get suspended but feck all happened to the other kid.",
            "Yeah, that\u2019s not a popular opinion from my whereabouts.

How many people need to say this before we believe it?  \n\nMy own son was bullied. He told his teacher and the child was taken aside and told not to do it anymore. The bully continued to bully my son. My son told his teacher again. The bully was spoken to by the principal and all the parents were involved. The bully continued to bully my son. The child was removed from the class and spent their day in the principal\u2019s office for two weeks. After that, there were no more issues with bullying and the bully has not had further disciplinary issues. \n\nSure, my son could have fought back and got his ass kicked, but what would that have solved? Bullies LOVE it if you play their game. You need to show them that bullying won\u2019t work - that you won\u2019t back down. It worked in India, it worked it Selma.

Reddit mods are quick to ban people who stand up to harassers and then when you say something they say \"You should have just used the report button and disengaged.\" But when you do this they don't respond for hours if at all.

            "If zero tolerance policies were actually zero tolerance there wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem because the bully would be punished the first time they acted out, so no one would be pushed to their breaking point.

            "I studied school administration in graduate school. It comes down to issues of student rights, liability, lawsuits and optics.\n\nStudent Rights\n\nUp until the early 90's it was relatively easy for school administrators to deal with bullies by means of suspensions and expulsion for continual behavior. Then the lawyers started getting involved and started suing school districts and principals. They argued, among other things, that even violent students still had a right to an education and that out-of-school suspension/expulsion deprived them of that right. They also argued that because they are public school students the rights to procedural due process applied to them. The courts agreed with these and other arguments. The result was that it became exponentially more difficult to suspend/expel a student. For instance, in most cases it can take up to a year or more to expel a student from an individual campus due to the various procedures and hearings that have to be held in order to comply with the right to procedural due process and if the district loses the case they are on the hook not only for their legal expenses but also the expenses of the student.\n\nLiability & Lawsuits\n\nIf the administration punishes the bully then they are, in effect, saying that they are aware that this student is a problem and poses a risk to the student body. This can lead to lawsuits from victims of the bully against the school district for knowingly keeping a violent student on the campus. If the school doesn't punish the bully then they can play stupid if a victim ever decides to sue.\n\nIf the bully also happens to be of a racial minority, the district also opens themselves up to a whole slew of civil rights lawsuits by punishing the bully. One of the favorite charges in this case is that the district is targeting poor little Akeem just because he's black or Jose because he's hispanic. This leads to optics.\n\nOptics\n\nIf a school decides to punish a bully, especially a racial minority bully, and the mother or some other involved person plasters their face all over the news talking about the racist school, racist principal, racist, racist, racist; the school doesn't have an opportunity to defend itself from the accusations because of student privacy laws. They are forced to deal with the onslaught of protestors, the accusations of racism and so forth.\n\nIf the bully is anyone else and the mother decides to raise a fuss then the school will still have to deal with the fall out without being able to tell the news \"Hey, see this one-inch thick stack of complaints? Yea, this is the discipline record for this kid.\" It creates a public relations nightmare and pulls resources from education to deal with all the bullshit fall-out from people who are only getting one side of the story.\n\nThe whole system of dealing with trouble makers is broken and unfortunately a lot of it is the courts fault for creating legal precedents that schools are requires to abide by. This could easily be remedied with state level legislation but then that will end up being challenged in court by lawyers looking to protect whoever they think they are protecting and that's just more wasted money on dealing with a case that will likely be lost due to the previous court precedents, not to mention state legislatures tend to have more pressing issues to deal with, so something like school discipline reform is a very low priority.",
            "I think that encouraging them to fight back is like telling them that fistfights are the answer. It's not. We have laws in place for a reason. \n\nTell the teachers. If that doesn't work, go to the police. Write a letter to every government branch. Whatever it takes. They shouldn't just take it. They should do everything they can to get help. That's what we should teach them.",

            "I've fought for myself against bullies when I was 5 to 9 years old and it worked, bullies do get intimidated if you fight back and will leave you alone. One of the times tho I was being beaten and having some of my clothes ripped off and scratched on the ground by a group of 3 guys for the entire school day. Next day I got them 1 by one and did to each of them what they did to me. Well tough luck, one of them was a school teacher's son who told him and went directly to the principal to punish me. My parents were called, insulted by the school board and I was blamed for doing to 3 kids what they did to me. I never forgot that instance and it stuck with me to this day. That day I lost hope in the school's system approach to bullying. Later in my teen years I was beat up in the locker rooms by 3 guys again, was able to do nothing but defend myself. I decided to give it a go and report it. Wrote a formal report of the incident  wich a teacher saw and was able to testify in my defence and went to the school board. It was ignored, I followed all the procedures required but it ended in just them pretending nothing happened yet 1 year later a collegue of mine who was the son of 2 teachers at that school was able to report and punish almost HALF of the entire class because they called him a clown anf similar injuries. This all happened in Torres Vedras Portugal in Conquinha and Madeira Torres schools in Portugal. I don't know about how it is in other schools but a place where 3 people gang on you to beat you and destroy your property are considered inocents because you defended yourself, or where you get beat up by 3 guys and the school board looks the other way while at the same time punishing a dozen people because they called someome a clown, where you are only given a proper, humane service and protection if you are in some way connected with someone relevant in the school is no place I would like for my kids, and I would love to see all this people who have even covered rape attempts and molestation without punishment so they do not look bad go to jail and rot there for what they've done. I'll never stop sticking up for myself, and everyone should do that. Kid, teen or grown up, if someone is harming you do somethung about it, do not rely on someone that might not give a shit, and never let anyone tell you that you can't defend yourself.",

I\u2019m under the impression that people don\u2019t even know what genetically modified even means and everyone is falling for propaganda that companies are using to mark up their products. \n\nGenetically modified crops, most of the time, are crops that have been through artificial selection. That means we noticed a couple of plants that we were growing produced bigger fruit with less seeds or they are less likely to die from weather or from pests or etc, so bred them with each other to create the plant that we enjoy today. This is something that happens naturally through evolution and natural selection as well. There\u2019s nothing crazy or unhealthy about it. It doesn\u2019t change the fruit or vegetables nutrition very much and it certainly doesn\u2019t make it less healthy. \n\nAnother way we genetically modify, which is less likely, is that we give the plant DNA that does all the things artificial selection does like pest resistance, longer growing season, bigger fruit, etc. except it takes a way shorter time. it is actually very helpful environmentally because it reduces the use pesticides. There arent any adverse health effects- it\u2019s still just a fruit or vegetable. There are positive environmental effects. \n\nAnother big point is that there are only something like 10 crops that are genetically modified and sold in America. So when something says \u201cnon GMO\u201d it never would\u2019ve had GMOs anyway. It doesn\u2019t make it healthier. I got a chocolate bar that said \u201cnon GMO\u201d and I was like ????

You get the point.\n\nNever understood this notion that because its natural it's better.",
            "I agree with everything you said about the safety and benefits of GM technology for crops except that artificial selection isn\u2019t usually what people mean when they say GM. Every crop or animal you eat has been selected through domestication and breeding, transgenics are a newer and different thing. They are safe though.",
            "You're wrong and right at the same time.\n\nGMO foods are not bad or unhealthy for people.\n\nBut monoculture, the process of using only one type of seed, one type of plant is really REALLY bad.\n\nPeople are right to be upset about GMO, but most people have the wrong reason.",
            "I think a big point that doesn\u2019t often get mentioned are the tangential effects. I can run through two of them quickly. The first is why genetic modification is often used. Sure, it\u2019s often to make crops more weather resistant or larger and more nutritious. On other occasions, and most commonly in the case of soy and corn, it\u2019s to make them resistant to pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are the ones you want to watch out for, as they are certainly harmful, both to people who consume their residues regularly and to the farmers who apply them or live in the vicinity. \n\nThe second point is related. Genetic enhancements and pesticide use have really helped accelerate the consolidation of farms and the eradication of small farming in both the American Midwest and Latin America (folks who know more about other regions can add their expertise). It\u2019s most cost effective to buy and apply seeds and pesticides for large areas, not small ones. Pesticides are best applied through low flyovers, and small farms that sell on domestic or even local markets aren\u2019t geared toward this. Large agricultural distributors and middle men often have particularly convenient deals with seed manufacturers to make buying up surrounding farms and then replanting them with genetically modified seeds particularly efficient for them. There\u2019s loads more on the economic ramifications, but I\u2019ll leave it there for now. In short, genetic enhancements are not at all harmful on their own. It\u2019s mostly the effects that come with them that both social scientists and agronomists are often worried about.",

            "You say \"this isn't really an opinion\", but it's not really facts either.  You're all over the place with your arguement.  \n\nYou say  \"genetically modified\" is the correct label for selectively bred stock.  It is not.  I belive it is correctly used to label foods which have had their genetic sequence manually altered.\n\nYou go on to say that, by extension, there are \"only like 10 crop in the US that are modified\".  Nearly every single crop anybody eats is the product of selective breeding.  \n\nGenetically engineered crops can be patented, and legal consequences can follow for people who save some seeds from their harvest for planting next year's crop (as has been done since the dawn of agriculture).\n\nYou made broad statements about only beneficial results from what you mischaracterize as genetic modification. Unintended consequences when interfering with natural systems can be catastrophic.",
            "The problem that could arise with GMO's is the invention of a very invasive plant eg.  \"Roundup Ready Cotton\" but worse.  The pesticides necessary in the same crop since GM has reduced by about 90%.   This has a twofold effect; the most toxic of those pesticides are now not used and beneficial predators have returned to cropland.\n\nSome certified  \"natural\" or \"organic\" fungicides copper oxychloride and mancozeb are OK in small quantities but repeat usage will acidify soil and nearby rivers or lock other vital nutrients in the soil.\n\nIn short \"certified organic\" is ok but still flawed.  Withholding periods correctly followed keeps conventionally farmed modern produce very safe.\n\nAlso don't trust the \"organic\" guy at the farmers market unless you really know them, some of that stuff would be rejected by the big supermarkets for incorrect chemical use.",
            "May not be any less healthy for the humans who eat them, but genetically enhanced chickens for example can become so large that their legs break and impale their underbellies, leading to a completely sedentary and agonizing (albeit short) life.\n\nSo yes, GMO crops aren't an inherently bad thing; growing more with less resources, as long as its done responsibly (i.e. not contaminating ground water), is good for conservation. \n\nThat doesn't make them inherently good, either.",

            "This post ignores many of the negative areas of GMOs. While some are totally harmless or helpful, other GMOs that are widely used today have detrimental effects on biodiversity, health, and the environment. One such example, round-up ready maize (corn). Monsanto, the company that makes the herbicide known as roundup, produced this strain of maize to handle much higher levels of herbicides. This resistance allows farmers to spray large amounts all over their plants. This has obvious environmental (run off) and health (carcinogenic pesticides). However, there are also hidden dangers. Since insects and weeds have relatively short lifespans and fast reproduction rates, they can quickly breed in traits that help them survive. Farms that don't use tons of pesticides are now faced with resistant pests.",

            "Worked at a big seed gmo company that has winter nursaries in Puerto Rico. The \"organic\" seeds were sprayed way more than the GMO seeds. I was asst. Pest control manager and the only difference between a GMO vs organic is that we used \"organic\" pesticides. For example, Tracer made by Dupont, is a cancerous producing organic pesticide that was approved by OMRI however is was as bad as some other big named chemicals that are out there. The ONLY way to really know what eerie chemicals go into our food is by growing and controling your own crop/food. That is why i laugh at people that waste way more money on organic just because they think its healthier.

            "A lot of the time it isn't the GMO itself that is the problem.  It is everything used in the production of it.  The GMO itself is pesticide resistant so the farmers use more which stays with the plant.  They also use chemicals after harvest to kill the extra stuff and dry food out.\n\nThis is my understanding of most people's problem with GMO.  Of course some people are scared of GMO themselves but usually the cause for concern is not the actual plants but all of the extra additions.",

            "Okay, so this is what irritates me; it isn't that GMOs are inherently bad, it's that you have to ask WHAT they are changing and WHY. \n\nThe GMOs people are usually referring to are Roundup-Ready corn and soybeans (there are others, but I'm going to focus on this GMO category. \n\nThe WHAT is that these plants have been genetically altered to be able to be sprayed multiple times with the weed-killer, Roundup, throughout the growing season. \n\nThe WHY is because the manufacturer of Roundup - Monsanto - holds the patent on these varieties. They have cornered the market and use mafia tactics to intimidate and even sue farmers if they try to keep seed from year to year (old practice, now outlawed due to the patent), or even if their genes show up in another farmer's crops due to pollination. They control the process from seed to fertilizer to weed killer to harvest to the store.\n\nSo, now to the danger: this chemical, which has been linked to a variety of cancers and developmental disorders in children, is being sprayed over produce that is then either feed to livestock (which creates more problems) or is used to make compounds that are found in up to 80% of products in the grocery store, from bread to ketchup and even batteries and diapers. \n\nSo many Americans are getting micro doses of Roundup (and a host of other compounds) in almost every bite of food. And, researchers are only starting to see the effects of these chemicals building up in the soil, washing into streams and rivers with field runoff, and in our own bodies.\n\nSo, are GMOs safe? Sure, but the shit sprayed on them because of their modifications are not.\n\nEnd rant. No potato.",

            "While it is true that selective breeding falls under the umbrella of GMOs most people are really referring to GE (genetically engineered crops) when using the term GMO. I don't think anyone would argue that selectively bred crops are bad or unhealthy. Your insinuation that genetically engineered crops are uncommon or not a large factor in modern agriculture is incorrect. Corn, soybean and wheat are by far the most commonly grown crops in america. Hundreds of millions of acres are used for these crops. Most of the corn and soy is used for animal feed, but to downplay the roll of GE crops in america is foolish. While it is true that genetic engineering can be used for bigger fruit, pest resistance and longer growing season the vast majority of genetic engineering is for creating a tolerance to glyphosate (round up). Monsanto has a monopoly on crop production because they sell the GE seeds cheap and make their money by selling glyphosate.  Glyphosate is less harmful than DEET, but it is not good to ingest either. No one would add glyphosate to a salad  and say it's healthier for it. Short term there hasn't been any widespread health effects but no one knows what the long term health effects could be. Maybe it is safe maybe it isn't. A recent study found that 93% of americans have glyphosate in their urine. Genetically engineered crops may be necessary to feed the worlds population but to say they are environmentally friendly is a stretch. They lead to soil erosion, larger monocrops and less biodiversity which is bad for resistance to disease. Eventually there may be a pathogen that is genetically resistant to gyphosate that could wipe out an entire crop.  I agree that the non GMO and organic labels are largely marketing schemes. Organic food can mean a lot of different things depending on where you are. I never go out of my way to buy organic or non-GMO foods but i do thoroughly wash produce to reduce the amount of pesticides I ingest.",
            "Your 2nd paragraph makes no sense.  Genetic modification is just that: modifying the genome of an organism.  You are conflating the direct modification of genomes with artificial selection.  Artificial selection is the selection of phenotypes not genotypes.  Sometimes phenotypic selection is associated with genotypic selection, but not all the time.\n\n\"There arent any adverse health effects- it\u2019s still just a fruit or vegetable.\"  We do not know that yet.  There have been few good studies on GMOs.  If you would have looked at cigarette smoking during the equivalent time frame, you would have reached a similar conclusion about cigarette smoking.  I mean, it is just a plant like the other plants we consume, right?  So it is no different.\n\nYeah, but the thing is - cigarette smoking is different.  It took 30-40 years for us to realize that it was demonstrably dangerous, and then the companies lied to us for another 20-30 years.\n\nSo are GMOs bad?  We do not yet know.  In 20 years, do you want to learn that you were consuming something that will shorten your lifespan and cause you to die a horrible death?  Many countries in Europe said \"no thank you\", but citizens in the US never were able to vote on this since most would not even know that they are consuming GMOs since there is no legal requirement to label food products with this information.\n\nThat is the bet you are making.  You are betting with your life, and largely you do not know that you are doing it, since companies do NOT have to disclose that they are using GMOs.\n\nHonestly, it looks like GMOs are not harmful.  And they do serve important purposes in food availability and company profitability, but we really do not know if they are safe YET.\n\nFinally, just know that your entire post (with only minor referential modifications) seems very similar to articles written about tobacco or cigarettes 60 years ago.

For example, the GMO corn crops contain or produce a protein that is toxic to insects so instead of them spraying insecticides on crops, they basically created crops that produce an insecticide \"naturally.\"\n\nI prefer to err on the side of caution though and eat organic because of better agricultural practices.

One of the limiting factors in how much X amount of land can produce is the strength of the stems. Too much wheat on the head of the plant and the stems can buckle.

            "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been said or not yet but some girls do it because they have inverted or flat nipples and are self conscious about that",
            "So as a past body piercer can I would just like to add that nipple piercings can have multiple benefits before you just focus on the look. Granted it's not every woman, not even most. But I had several women in my chair that received these piercings to fight against inverted nipples or lack of sensation. Again this is not the majority but it was definitely a fairy large portion of my clients and usually with great success. Some were born that way others due to pregnancy or physical trauma such as scar tissue. Yeah they could have probably also gone with surgery though the price difference is astronomically different and even in regards to inverted nipples, I had a number of clients that were able to get the back to normal to the point that it would remain normal after jewelry removal. I'm not saying you're not allowed your preference, but don't assume that they're ruining their body for a look when really it's the one thing that has helped them feel normal or potentially look better.\n\nFor those that do suffer these issues, I'd truly suggest you look into piercings as a possible benefit and look into a knowledgeable piercer that knows a bit on the subject. Frankly it was one of the reasons I eventually moved into a medical field because it feels good to help people. So again, not trying to shame you, but I hope to at least open your eyes to a different perspective than what you'd probably think of in regards to this type of body modification.",
            "Personal opinion on turnoffs and stuff is fine, and I think a lot of people would be right there with you on this one but just because someone has nipple piercings doesn't mean they sleep around at all. Do you think it's because of this assumption?",

I, for one, find them extremely attractive (as well as belly button piercings) and they\u2019re a quality I look out for quite often. I have yet to have any intimate experiences with a girl that has them, but I\u2019d be absolutely thrilled if that were to happen lol. They\u2019re also something I\u2019m considering for myself as a guy, because I enjoy nipple play and there\u2019s a chance those could greatly increase my sensitivity. I\u2019m not worried about the pain of the piercings themselves, but I do worry about them being ripped out or being overly noticeable through a shirt. Those are the only things deterring me from getting them, so I\u2019m not sure if I ever will\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that in my personal experience, I don\u2019t tend to find that other people find them attractive, so I guess it\u2019s more of an unpopular opinion that I do",

            "Former McDonald's crew trainer here, they schedule more kitchen staff for breakfast than they do any other time of day (so it's not an issue of staffing). Real reason is that the grills are dedicated to too many different functions during breakfast to leave any for cooking beef. \n\nAn entire grill is taken up for scrambled eggs, one for bacon, one for canadian bacon, one for folded eggs, and usually that only leaves one (standard mcdonalds has two grills, one with 3 separate \"cooking zones\" which are longer than they are wide, and one with two cooking zones which are wider than they are long) and that isn't enough to cook full runs of the regular patties, let alone also spend any time doing 1/4 meat as well. Better to leave it open for emergencies. That's why you can still get round eggs all day, because they're cooked on a sort of \"grill cart\" that usually sits next to the toaster. Folded and scrambled eggs disappear after 10:30 because 100% of that space is needed for cranking out burgers.\n\nAnother reason is the assembly table - there are a *lot* of ingredients that go into lunch menu items that don't get used during breakfast (and the assembly table is built to accommodate 100% of them, but no more than that) - and there are a fair few breakfast ingredients that aren't used for lunch. Most Don's locations don't offer the *full* breakfast menu all day, just a few select items - conveniently, the items that only use ingredients served at lunch too, like breakfast sandwiches (which only use bacon and cheese from the assembly table, and the egg/english muffin are stored in the same warmers as chicken products)\n\nTL;DR, Mcdonald's isn't just making excuses unfortunately, there are too many technical obstacles to serving that sweet sweet big mac at the crack of dawn",

There is really no ability anywhere to be properly informed unless you take the time to look at both sides. Which most don\u2019t want to do because having to question yourself is oh so hard. Easier to cover your ears, dig in, and make thing simple on yourself.

Why isn't everybody them? Systemic racism? Skyrocketing healthcare expenditure? Slavery? The answer is \"in between\" or, \"just a little.\"\n\nWe have the trump supporters who really just follow him rather than any coherent ideals. The world is a \"liberal\" or \"marxist\" conspiracy designed to censor them, which they know because it's shouted at them from major outlets with no resistance. Their ideology can be best described as opposition to whatever they're told the liberals want.\n\nAnd we have \"liberals\", that are really in favor of most everything trump does so long as it's performed by somebody with tact and good words, preferably minorities or women. They're socially liberal, but fiscal conservatism supports systemic oppression which is a necessary evil. But they're fine with that because they're either white and male as hell or they had to internalize oppressive establishment values and accept the fate of their respective race and/or gender in order to represent the establishment as public faces.\n\nBut these are just vaguely the categories portrayed by the media.
