Everyone can expect a romantic relationship to come to an end, and even when they do, you will find someone new....\n\nUnlike friendship breakups, you never expect the person you\u2019ve probably have grown up with, known longer than any romantic partner who\u2019s been with you through thick and thin to ever become a stranger.\n\nYou\u2019ll never be able to find someone who understands and vibes with you so well either if they walk out. \n\nThere. That\u2019s my unpopular opinion.\n\nTL;DR: Friendship heart breaks are worse than any romantic heart break. You don\u2019t ever expect it and it can be harder to move on from than a romantic heart break.",

            "When my \"friends\" were mad at me, they invited my toxic ex girlfriend over and made fun of me, and asked embarrassing personal questions about me (my penis size, etc). They even spied on me via our home security cameras. I thought we were like brothers, friends for over ten years. That woke me up to a lot of horrible ways they had treated me and gaslight me over the years. I now feel a mixture of loss, rage, loneliness, and humiliation. At 30 years old, I don't feel like making new friends anymore, I don't feel like I can trust people that way again.",
            "I agree, I swear losing a friend is one of the worst things, because of how much you trust them. Splitting with friends often happens gradually too, which makes it worse.",
            "When they're your best friend and your partner it hurts doubly worse.",
            "100% agreed. I\u2019ve had two relationship breakups and I\u2019ve gotten over them within months, and now I\u2019m dating someone else (who I hope to stay with for a really long time :)). But I still can\u2019t get over my best friend of ten years slowly hating me, and no matter what I did it wouldn\u2019t make up how she felt about me (to be fair I made some mistakes). It\u2019s been about a year since she\u2019s cut contact with me entirely, and honestly even though everyone says that chapter of my life is over and I need to move on, I still wish we could go back to normal at some point. I really miss her.",

We did everything together, she was basically like my sister and it still hurts like a bitch.\n\nPeople always complain about how hard it is to find best friends when you\u2019re an adult too, so I think that also factors on why it\u2019s even worse than losing a partner cause it\u2019s hard to find someone who will vibe with you. \n\nI would definitely say this is an actual unpopular opinion.",
            "Especially if you are the reason that you two are no longer friends, and are just now realizing that all they wanted was an apology.",
            "This is a tough one, and I think it depends on the exact circumstances.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, losing my SO after a multi year relationship, it stings way more but goes away faster. Losing a best friend, it's less of a sting but the pain is way longer lasting.\n\nBut I imagine if I had a wife and kids after a REALLY long relationship, if my wife left me (or worse, cheated), I feel like this would be both a sting and an everlasting pain.\n\nIn short fuck you OP for making this depressing thread... /S",
            "man, I moved to North Carolina from New York in 2015 and a month or so in, my best friend from about 2010-2015 sent me a text basically saying he thought I was a bad person and that he didn't want to be my friend anymore\n\nit kind of stung and wasn't terribly wrong. Thankfully I've been seeing a therapist for the past couple of years to help me improve on myself but his text drilled me. Unlike a girlfriend where maybe she wasn't attracted to me or something, getting that text from a friend is purely a comment on my personality\n\nI've changed a lot since then and maybe it's worth sending a text to him to see how he is but I haven't bothered to do it yet",

            "I haven't had to go through any relationship breakups, but it was pretty painful trying to move on when a friend became extremely toxic after they came out as gay and then I rejected them (because I'm not gay). \n\nI tried everything I could to send a hint, including loudly (and cringily) talking about my crush at the time whenever he tried to flirt with me (which I hated doing because in order to get the message across I had to simp so much (and not the \"being a decent person\" kind of simping; the sucking up to girls kind)). \n\nEventually I had to move to a different lunch group because of how awkward he was making it for me to sit with my friends. Soon after I changed groups he followed me. I began to study alone in the school library during lunches; he followed me again and it was even more awkward since I was alone.\n\nI started getting my friends to tell him on my behalf (I don't like confrontation when it's about awkward subjects), and he didn't believe them, thinking that they wanted to ruin his chances with me. It reached a point where he was literally saying \"I just want him to know that I have a crush on him\". Like, shut up I already know, why the hell would I be getting so hard to send the message that I don't like you if I didn't know.\n\nEventually it pissed me off enough that I sent him an essay text telling him that I didn't like him as more than a friend and that his constant flirting was making it extremely awkward to be around him, and so could he please stop because I just wanted to enjoy spending time with my friends without dealing with that sort of thing.\n\nHe took it very badly. I got no sort of apology in any sense of the word, and instead got a message saying he only though I was gay because everyone else did (now obviously there's nothing wrong with being gay, but this is still pretty nasty because I was already worried about what people (girls in particular) thought of me, and there's nothing that ruins your chances with your crush more than them thinking you're gay). I ended up asking a few people who said that they didn't really think so, but they weren't sure (which is ok). This causes me to block him. At this point if I received a decent apology I'd probably forgive him.\n\nHe then sets about spreading rumours that I'm gay, making sure that they get around to any girls I might have a chance with. A few people ask me and after clarifying, I ask them who was spreading rumours like that. \n\nAt this point I'm in the process of realising that the girl I like only likes me as a friend and I've just about moved on, when one morning I walk in on them talking before school, but they stop as soon as I enter the room. Soon after, my gay friend tells my best friend that my crush said she likes me, which obviously makes its way to me in a matter of minutes. A few days later I shoot my shot, and am rejected which isn't fun. I wouldn't have had to deal with it if this person wasn't lying to my friends in order to try to hurt me by getting me to be rejected like him (he probably thinks it's karma or something).\n\nI then decide that I'm only going to talk to him when necessary, and treat him politely and respectfully like I would a stranger. This is really awkward since my friends still want to be friends with him and I don't. I end up seeing him a lot more frequently than I would like to and he has a huge presence in the group chats I'm in; I used to be able to say anything in those, but I can't because I don't trust him with the knowledge, and as a result I've been driven away from my friends because I don't want to be anywhere near him and they do. \n\nSince I've never been in a relationship, I obviously don't know what a real one is, but this one's still pretty painful 9 months later since I'm constantly reminded of the damage he's done whenever I try to spend time with my friends.",

            "(huge rant, I\u2019m extremely sorry I just wanted to get it out, you don\u2019t have to pity me or anything :P I\u2019m just being edgy and ringing up sad memories)\n\nMy best friend was also the boy I was in love with. He said he loved me too, but I\u2019m not so sure now. \n\nWe had agreed that since we were so young and hadn\u2019t known each other that long, we\u2019d just stay friends. We were practically inseparable. We talked all the time, made all sorts of inside jokes together, and he kept me sane while I was across the country with my parents, dealing with family affairs. \n\nI know it was silly, but I always imagined us together in the future. Every girl does, though, right? I mean, it felt so right. His family was literally perfect, everyone got along like we\u2019d known each other forever, our personalities blended so well. And he was so special- he was kind and caring and opened up to me and he was funny and smart. (Also, our last names matched up beautifully and made one big word, and turned my name into a sentence)\n\nBut one day he didn\u2019t talk to me. And the next. My mom told me not to text him and give him space. \n\nA couple weeks later I had to talk to him, and he said that he realized there was something about me he didn\u2019t like, and wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was because he didn\u2019t want me to change for him. \n\nIt crushed me. I didn\u2019t have anyone else o turn to, except my goth metalhead memelord friend that only messages me at like 2am. Man I love that friend though. \n\nIt hurt way more than an actual breakup of mine- we were way closer than me and my \u201cboyfriend\u201d, but I mean it was my first boyfriend and we lasted a month and it was real stupid, lmao \n\nI still wonder what it is, or if it\u2019s actually something that should be different about me, but oh well. \n\nI still see him sometimes, and we\u2019re almost starting to talk again. Maybe we could be friends again, I hope so. Who knows",
            "I agree. I've lost some friends...\n\nOne two years and a half ago, who I still miss a lot, almost everyday. I can't contact her, she hates me now, because of something I said. I don't even regret what I said, but I regret losing her. I wish I could know how she is doing.\n\nAnother last month. We were best friends for 6 years, but recently we talked about the fact that I couldn't see her, or talk to her, as she isolates herself a lot. We agreed that our friendship hurted us more than it should. So we broke up. It's what's best for us, but I miss her, I never thought I would lose her",

My husband (boyfriend at the time) and I still wanted us all to be friends and hang out together but she dropped everyone once she got with her guy. \n\nI found out through other friends that they all secretly disliked her as she's a very bitchy and selfish person, and they were glad to hear we weren't friends anymore. Deep down I know they're right and I used to look at her through rose-tinted glasses, but it still really hurts.

            "I feel like its because they are much harder to break, especially best friends.\n\nRelationships are fragile, you have to give them a certain amount of attention, you cant date anyone else (unless agreed upon), you have to do a lot of stuff to maintain it.\n\nBut with friends, you have a lot more freedom and it takes a lot of shit to \"break up with them\"\n\nSo it hits harder.",
            "Losing friends was very hard for me, and ultimately the fact that I kept losing and changing crowds from kindergarten to elementary to middle to high school meant it was very hard for me to trust people. And I struggle to this day with that. I get anxious at any sort of love because I fear if I get too attached it\u2019ll vanish like it always had. I never had a best friend growing up and never belonged to a clique and it\u2019s affected me a lot.",

Just stopped, no explanation, nothing that caused her to be upset. She didn\u2019t talk to me for months and when she finally did she just said there was no point in being my friend anymore since she\u2019s moving.

            "Somewhat disagree, so I'll still give you an upvote, lol.\n\nReason I somewhat disagree is because serious long term relationships are very much like friendships on steroids. Your SO becomes your person. Yes, you'll have friends you still confide in for certain things you can't discuss with your SO. However, you can tell your SO so many things most people wouldn't tell your friend. They become your rock. They become the reason you want to be a better person. If they left, I think that would hurt much more, in general. Obviously, a lifetime friend breakup at 45 vs a five year relationship may be quite a bit different.",

He said he \u2018worried about me all the time\u2019 and that he basically didn\u2019t want to anymore. I was an inconvenience; he had shiny-new successful friends now.\n \nIt just validated all that negative shit I think about myself. That I\u2019m a burden, that I shouldn\u2019t be alive... That I am nothing.\n\nHe was my longest friendship and now every time I think of him I get filled with self-loathing.\nI\u2019ve not really been able to trust anyone since. Have to keep everyone at arms length in case they also reject me.\n\n...I\u2019d rather it have just \u2018fizzled out\u2019 the way friendships in adulthood tend to do.

            "I\u2019ve had a good number of friendship breakups and 2 of them were almost exactly the same. I helped get through personal struggles and listened to them when they needed someone. They decided to end a friendship of over two years by ghosting me, not even a text saying they were blocking me. Had to find out from a mutual friend I was on the don\u2019t unblock list. Hurt like hell. One time she got sick at school in the middle of the hall (thankfully she made it to a trash can before throwing up) and I grabbed another friend and together we made a sorta wall around her so people wouldn\u2019t stare. Yeah that girl ghosted me.\n\n2nd time this happened it was with my manager at a fast food place and we really connected and joked around a lot together. Then one day she calls me crying and she just starts venting about how she doesn\u2019t love her husband and goes on about why and I calm her down and manage to get her to stop crying. After a few more rounds of that over the course of a few weeks she tells me she broke up with him (they weren\u2019t officially married, common law or something). Everything\u2019s fine mostly after that. Then I get fired (other unrelated reasons that is not relevant) and then one day she texts me on Snapchat at 2 am while I\u2019m asleep and says we shouldn\u2019t talk anymore with no explanation as to why and then removes me as a friend. First thing I wake up to is someone I considered to be my best friend basically dumping me. I do go up there to get food still and that\u2019s what I do. After a few days I run into her in the parking lot and she tried to avoid me but I call out and ask her what the hell. She gives me some bullshit excuse that she\u2019s moving or something and I flipped her off and moved on with my life.\n\nThe ending to that second story is that she actually tried to get a bunch of my former male coworkers fired. How? She would sexually harass them a whole bunch and try to get them to flirt back so she could fire them. It kinda worked on one dude but he sued and last I heard he\u2019s getting a lot of money from it. What did she get for sexual harassment as a manager? Demotion to team leader.",

But friendship breakups, especially with longtime friends are the ones that sting the most for the longest.\n\nI had a friend who I've known since childhood. We didn't get along for ages (petty kid stuff), but when we got older we started being real friends. Like not super close, but we were friends. Eventually I ended up having a thing for them, but obviously they didn't feel the same. I tried to put things back to normal after we put it all on the table, but it seems they didn't want/weren't able to shake it, since all our convos have felt awkward or forced. We don't talk anymore, and it kind of sucks, because when we talked about it all is when I realised how involved in each other's lives we were.

            "Nobody is going to read this but I'll share anyways. \n\nI used to have a best friend Erik. We lived together several times, played video games together, worked together at several jobs, always had each other to fall back on. We could communicate just by looking at each other, we were comfortable to tell each other we loved the other, i would tag along with him and his girlfriend on dates and it felt normal, never like a 3rd wheel. We would fight occasionally but we always reconciled. We were huge motivators for each other. 100% we were best friends. \n\nWell he was working for me at one point, and we were both single at the time, and I invited him out for drinks with me and the girl I was interested in(she was recently out of a relationship and she and i were very close friends through work, though I hadn't expressed my interest to her yet). Long story short, I had told him my feelings for her and that night while we were all drinking those 2 ended up making out. I was pretty devastated, left quietly and grabbed an uber home. He texted me in the morning blaming me for letting it happen(they stepped outside for a smoke and I stayed at our table). The girl apologized to me the next day and said it was a drunk mistake, would never happen again, but Erik never showed up to work the next couple days and I felt so terribly about myself because of it I ended up quitting that job. \n\nThey continued to see each other after that despite telling me otherwise. I was more hurt that two of my closest friends kept lying to me, and one of them couldn't even stand to face me to apologize. I ended up never talking to them again, but I really really miss the friendships I lost there. It hurts that someone who understood me so well betrayed me and couldn't be bothered to say anything to me, and I lost my best friend because of it.",
            "Completely agree.\n\nI'm still dealing with that kind of loss to this day. It's been more than a year since I've stopped talking to my ex-best friend of 7+ years and I still can't fully move on.\n\nProbably because we never actually talked about it, the situation just kinda turned toxic and I pulled away from her. Not the most mature thing to do, but being honest with her about how much she had changed didn't work, so I felt like I had no other choice.\n\nYet we still have to see each other sometimes cause we're part of the same group of friends (or actually, both our boyfriends are).\n\nSo thanks for this. I've been feeling kind of crazy over this situation, but I'm glad to see it's actually not that uncommon.",
            "Depends on the kind. most of them are gradual drifting aparts but your still on good terms",
            "No offense, but I feel like the people who are saying yes have never actually been in a good relationship. A relationship should be more than just romance. It should be someone that you connect with like what the op said plus romance, sex, intimacy, etc. If you have an easy time getting over a romantic breakup, I\u2019m guessing your feelings weren\u2019t that deep. I feel like half of you should be with the friend you had a break up with.",
            "This is very appropriate for my current situation where my friend blocked me because I 'didn't try harder' to come to her bday dinner after my car was broken down on a busy highway. She messaged me and I stood my ground, not allowing her to guilt trip me. Now we aren't friends.  \n\n\nI still feel so much hurt because it came out if nowhere. If my fianc\u00e9 and I were to split, I'd likely see it coming.  \n\nI wrote a letter to her in r/unsentletters and it was cathartic as fuck.",

            "Yeah, this is beyond true. One of my best friends growing up, like we were neighbors since we could walk, same class (small town) all through school right through graduation.   After highschool he got a labour job in a warehouse and I went to college.  Now we live on different sides of the country, we always figured we'd be each other's best man at our eventual weddings and I wasn't even invited to his wedding, I've not met his wife nor his two children.  Even have since given up on the Facebook thing so don't even get the annual half hearted happy birthday, need to catch up some time message.  \n\nThat shit hurts man, I've gone through several circles of friends in my 30 years, and always wonder how my life would be different if i was still in with certain groups, if I had made more of an effort.  Some friendships ended abruptly and explosive, such as a romantic breakup that split a friend group, others ended so slowly and quietly I couldn't even tell you how it happened, didn't even notice it happening until one day I just wasn't hanging out with them anymore, it just clicked months later and I couldn't put a finger on when/how it happened.",
            "I agree. I recently just came to the conclusion one of my closer friends and I probably won\u2019t really be friends anymore. It looks like we\u2019ve just grown apart, no big blowout event. But still makes me sad to think about.",

I don't believe in airing my dirty laundry on the internet so I don't want to give any details. \nBut i had a best friend for 20years, since grade 4. til a couple of years ago (I'm 33 now) a stupid argument happened and I stopped talking to him (loyalty thing imo) for like 1-3 years (not exactly sure)\n\nI phoned him one day out of the blue to apologize and we blazed and hung out just like old times  and then another stupid thing happened (to both of us, both our own doing) and he stopped talking to me, I know it was for HIS own good. I don't think he knew that I had his back 100% and I'm not very good at telling people that kind of shit.\n\nIt's now been a couple of years (again not exactly sure) and he moved I think to Quebec or something .. miss him everyday, literally thought the world of him (no homo) and his family - in a ton of ways his family was so much better/supportive/awesome than my own. Wish we could connect again but since he's so far away Im not sure if there is a point.\n\nSo much happened between us, I'm not sure if it would ever be the same. I know that he thinks I won't forgive him but honestly, he was my best fucking friend - didn't matter what he did I loved him like my brother, and always thought we would be best friends.\n\nI screwed up a lot, my fears and my own problems hurt our friendship. I wish we could just erase all the shit and go back to being friends (I know I could, but could he?) I feel ashamed of some of my actions, and let down by some of his, some of my own too. I fucked up. \n\nBut I always always always thought we would be friends again someday, and when I heard he moved away I cried a bit, I never cry.\nMakes me sad to know I probably will never see him again\nI miss you J - doesn't matter what happened between us - I still love you brother.

Some drifted away to different places. Some  became religious. Some just out right did things enemies would. Some died. Some were arrested and did serious time. The loses all hurt in one way or another. One of my deepest pains though, comes from my best friend ODing 3 years ago. He was engaged to a girl who had cancer.

            "Thank you so much for saying this.\n\nLate last year I left my fianc\u00e9. It was really hard but I knew it was the right thing to do for myself and that got me through the tough days.\n\nMy best friend was my rock. I texted her when I was feeling weak, when I had a bad day, when I missed him. She helped me go through the apartment I\u2019d shared with him and helped me throw away the pieces of my life with him.\n\nOne day I had to see him and he was particularly cruel to me. I texted her afterwards and she just said \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you\u201d and I just KNEW in my gut something was up. She stopped answering my texts after that.\n\nTwo weeks later she asks me to meet her. I told her if she wanted to meet me to tell me she was now dating my ex-fianc\u00e9, I didn\u2019t need to see her and that she could just text me. She told me she had no idea what I was talking about and called me crazy.\n\nI met up with her and, surprise, she told me that she\u2019s been sleeping with my ex since a week after I moved out.\n\nWhile she gave me the typical \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I never meant to hurt you\u201d spiel I sat there blocking both of them on every conceivable platform - I loved both of them so much and I wanted nothing more than for them to be happy, but I just couldn\u2019t watch them be together.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her since and my heart still breaks, I miss her so much. Every time someone asks me about her I have such a visceral reaction that I throw up. She was my girl, we did everything together, I trusted her with parts of myself I never shared with a romantic partner. \n\nI don\u2019t miss my ex at all. He was a great guy but he wasn\u2019t the right guy for me and now that I\u2019m moving on I have no regrets over the situation and no desire to be with him anymore. But I miss her like crazy. I have dreams where I beg her to break it off with him so we can be friends again. The heartbreak is so real and I feel like no one really gets it.",
            "I agree wholeheartedly. It's been 3 years and honestly, fuck you Zay it still hurts. I deserved better.",
            "I agree with this. One of my best friends from college - we lived together and spent so much time together - ended our friendship about 10 years ago. It was devastating for me at the time. A few years later we were at a mutual friend's baby shower and she completely ignored me. That brought up the pain again. It really was worse than any breakup. I am better now and know she is not the same person I was friends with, but I miss who we used to be sometimes.",
            "It was the weirdest thing. One of my best friends and I simply stopped talking. I really am somebody that she used to know now - she's early 30's, I'm late 30's, we had one brief miscommunication. She put (metaphorical) barriers up, telling me that she needed space and would reach out to me when she was ready. We had no URST, no drama other than that, it really is a mystery for me why it continued past one sharp conversation.  \n  \n\nI left it, then reached out to her a few months later around Christmastime (as her birthday is also around then). Sent her a message (to both her phone and her Messenger), no reply.  \n    \nIt kills me that over a decade of friendship was simply abandoned. Oh well. It sucks, but I can't wallow in it.",
            "Totally agree. I\u2019m going through this right now and I just can\u2019t seem to get over it. All the romantic relationship break ups I\u2019ve been through I get over it very fast. This I can\u2019t seem to move past though.",
            "Agree...I lost my three best friends starting in 2012 (we were 19) after being best friends with them since 2006 (7th grade), two of which were actually kind of my friends throughout elementary school. They got me through middle and high school and I felt really lucky to have them in my life. My mental health took a nosedive in 2011-2012-ish and I was hard to be around and they got fed up eventually. I feel like I got treated worse and worse by them. Every time I would come home from hanging out with them I would feel horrible about myself. I ended up saying things I regret and burned the bridges I had with them to the point where we text every once in a blue moon but I know things will never be the same. I\u2019m married now but other than my husband, I don\u2019t really have any friends. Moving a lot for military reasons certainly doesn\u2019t help the cause. I miss having girl best friends that I can be 100% myself around.",
            "I\u2019ve been in two long distance relationships,  but moving away from my friends after graduation has been so much more painful and difficult. I\u2019ve never loved or missed anyone this much. It\u2019s the best and worst feeling in the world.",
            "Agreed. They suck on both sides. I\u2019ve been dumped by a buddy and have had to move on from a friendship because it wasn\u2019t healthy. All those good laughs and memories suddenly start to sting any time they cross your mind.",
            "I couldn\u2019t agree more tbh. \n\nOne of my best friends and I got into a fight, in retrospect we were both wrong to an extent and I definitely could have handled it better, but the more the fight escalated the more hurtful things she said to me. Basically I had told her I felt like I had just become a back up friend, and the fight escalated from her telling me I was just being jealous to \u201cyou\u2019re secretly in love with me\u201d to  \u201cwhy would I ever want to hang out with you, you\u2019re suffocating to be around\u201d and a lot worse. After all the hurtful things she said I don\u2019t think I could go back to being as close of friends as we were, even if I wanted to. \n\nIt sucks because deep down I still do want to be friends, she was one of the closest friends I ever had, but it\u2019s just not really a possibility at this point.",
            "Bro this hit me hard.\n\nHad a really close friend about a year ago who one day decided that he didn't want anything to do with me. Next day I wept on my couch for a solid hour thinking about it. It's always the small things that pile up and one day it's too much I guess. \n\nI think the worst part was that deep down I still really cared for him and wanted what was best for him, but he absolutely wanted nothing to do with me and made it clear we were never gonna be close again. A year later and to this day sometimes I'll see something or do a behavior I learned from him and memories of how much I trusted and cared for him will come back. \n\nIt's rough and it hurts like hell, but you just gotta keep going. Break ups like that remind you how far you can fall, but it's more important to remember how high you were able to climb with someone. Keep being optimistic, plenty of people are gonna hurt you, but it's not about finding the people who won't hurt you. It's about finding the people who are gonna apologize and keep trying. They are out there. If you stop searching though, you'll never find them.",

Some of us are on friendly terms, but I\u2019ve had to remove one in particular from all of my social media because seeing her posts just makes me too sad. I would rather see an ex-boyfriend everyday on Instagram than have to see her. \n\nWe all met in high school, so there\u2019s a good chance the friendships would\u2019ve ended naturally, but I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019ve yet to find anyone like them or make a friendship even half as close. I\u2019m starting to get anxious because I feel like I\u2019m rapidly approaching the age where super intimate friendships aren\u2019t as easy to come by, though I hope I\u2019m wrong. \n\nI actually had a pretty intense dream/nightmare about one of them last night, and we haven\u2019t seen each other in four years. It is much worse than a romantic breakup, and I\u2019ll have to live the rest of my life knowing that my own shitty behavior caused me to lose some of the best people I\u2019ve ever met. \n\nC, Y, and T, if any of you see this, I love you and I\u2019m sorry.",

I'd been like a therapist to her when she struggled with mild anxiety, even though my anxiety was worse. Once she got a boyfriend she stopped caring about me. We met for the last time and she just told me about this amazing acid trip she'd had. I said I was feeling low but she ignored me, so I cut her out of my life.",

            "My comment will never be seen since I'm late to the game and I wrote a long ass novel. I think it's a case by case basis, but I do agree a friendship breakup can be more painful. Especially, when you are blindsided by the breakup or just struggling with the idea accepting that it is over and not worth your time anymore. :( \n\nI am going through this with someone I've come to consider a BFF and sister to me. These are titles I don't give out to anybody, just because I've been burned so bad by previous friends who were given  these titles.  This deterioration of our friendship is happening over a  period of time. I feel like a frog in a pot of boiling water and just waiting to decide when I need to jump out before the water kills me. Some context she is currently going to grad school and I am an artist and am pregnant. \n\nLate last year 2019 it dawned on me that I was putting in ALL the effort to keep in touch with her. Calling, texting, making plans with her - just to get flaked on with no plans on her part to reschedule with me... I also started to noticed she'd get my messages and have it on read and never get back to me. Or tell me she would get back to me and later on (sometimes days or weeks) tell me \"oh sorry, I totally forgot\". Same applies to phone calls - \"hey, I'll call you back in a bit\" crickets. I've called her and she's never called me back and it's been ages since she's called me first at all. It is a huge deal for me for people to keep their promises or do what they say they're going to do. There's been other little road bumps that I've ignored trying to give her the benefit of doubt. She has only shown up to 1 group art show I've been in the past 3 years... even when the locations are right around the corner for her... I chalked it up to her being tired from work or just wanting to relax. But, then I'd see her stories driving to timbuktu to go to a house party potluck. Staying til god knows when and needing to go to work the next day. \"Dead tired, but had a great time last night\". Same with birthdays for her new set of friends. Go out to a place in timbuktu, spend a ton of money on drinks and stay out til 2 or 3am. It just broke my heart that I would invite her to these shows that were important to me for her to just come checkout my piece irl for a few minutes, but she never had time or never made the time to do it. That compounded with her last minute flaking out of birthday parties I had planned maybe 4 years in a row? I hate doing restuarant style parties, it just feels weird to invite a bunch of people to a restaurant where it's hard to mingle with anyone and there's often times check drama at the end and it gets expensive too. So, I usually arrange something at a home and get kickass food to just eat and hangout and have a good time with my friends. One year I did a potluck style get together since my friend had access to a clubhouse for free and that was a lot of fun and good food too! I digress. I knew one location was too far for her after work and with work the next day, but the others I don't know why she flaked. It was always followed with the excuse of \"I'll make it up to you later\" and I'm still waiting, a *few years* later... her birthday is before mine and every year I would try to get her something that she needed or wanted or take her out if she wasn't doing anything. I've only been met with sweet promises of nothing consecutive years in a row. I know in the grand scheme of things it shouldn't be a record keeping game, but all this forgetfulness made me question my worth to her. She just got a card from me this year that I felt conflicted about sending. \n\nI didn't want to believe that she was taking me for granted or maybe lost interest in our friendship because my financial priorities had changed. I felt eating out and brunches were much too expensive and frivolous and she lived for going out to eat all the time. I admit I used to be very generous with my resources before I changed my careers from a stable soul sucking income to a pursuit of something more emotionally fulfilling. I like to spoil people I cherish and I'm starting to feel as I get older maybe it is something I shouldn't be doing with people anymore. I've seen the pattern where it grows to this entitled attitude in the relationship which devolves into take and take. Doesn't happen everytime, but I have experienced it happening more than once. Not just with friendships, but also with family members.\n\nBefore 2020 I got pregnant which was awesome and then shit hits the fan in my marriage. It literally turned my world upside down. When I felt desperately alone and lost I called her and to my disbelief she actually picked up her phone and listened to everything that was going on. She even came by to pick me up and take me out for some fresh air. She also, highly encouraged me to leave my husband. \"leave him, you can do better than this\" \"you have a whole community of people who will be there for you and your baby\" \"you don't want to raise your child to watching this kind of relationship\". Initially, I tried to break it off with my husband. He agreed to leave the house if that was what I wanted, but he also insisted we try to work things out. He completely respected my wanting space and did pack his bags and left reluctantly. The whole time my husband was gone, so was my friend. Things went back to the way things were with our friendship a day or two of him being gone. I was so confused, hurt and felt so many levels of betrayal. He was gone for about 2 weeks, but he would still check up on me via text and phone calls even though I didn't respond to most of it. He even went as far as dropping off food outside the door because at one point I wasn't eating anymore. He would ask me if I had eaten even if my responses to him were inconsistent at best. In hindsight ignoring his texts was a shitty thing to do because it made him worry about my welfare. Eventually, I chose the work it out page on the adventure book and I'm glad I did. Otherwise, I would have been going  through this entire  pandemic with my cocktail of preexisting conditions, pregnancy, crippled finances and all of it on my own for the past 6 months...  My husband and I have been working things out and he's been really solid with me. I honestly thought I was going to have to figure things out on my own and my mind went to some seriously dark places during those 2 weeks. Even after she dropped me post blow up I still wanted to give her chance this year. I stopped initiating contact and she has yet to reach out and contact me on her own accord to this day. I caved after a month and reacted to a IG story. That is when she asked how I was doing, it wasn't a question she wanted answered since we didn't have a conversation out of it. In her stories she was making all this time for people, posting texts she was exchanging with people (when she was too busy or never had time to even text me back). Going out to brunches, going over to friends places. Her stint to go out to bars and restaurants stopped when the pandemic and shelter in places went up. She never called or texted to check up on me. Nothing. She had been having facetime breakfasts with other people and making pockets of time to socialize virtually with everyone else but me. She was my maid of honor and she was so excited to be a auntie, but she's kept up with her grad program friend's pregnancy more than mine. I don't think it's that hard to ask \"hey, how are you doing? / feeling?\" As a last ditch hopeful effort, I asked her if she wanted my baby registry. She was super excited for it and it's been more crickets for another 2 months. I came to the conclusion she wants to surround herself with people who are more like projects or research. People who need help and fixing possibly. Or people who are living their best lives as twenty somethings. We are no longer in the same job, have different financial responsibilities and perspectives on spending and I'm about to enter motherhood. I know I just have to let this friendship go. I'm just having a hard time pulking the plug to just move on. \ud83d\udc94\n\nTl;dr friendship breakups suck.",
            "Can confirm. I have never cried as much as I have when my BFF and I broke up, and I realized that I was over their toxic shit. I often tell my husband that my worst heartbreak was my best friend, and no man (/romantic partner) has made me hurt as much.",
            "I've always said this! Friend breakups always stab a little deeper than relationship breakups. \n\nMy best friends (who are both sisters) since 3rd grade did some slimy shit to me when I left for college -- which in retrospect was out of jealousy, for sure -- and it took a heavy, emotional toll on me. More than any man ever had or ever will, I believe. All I could think about was all of the new experiences I wouldn't be able to share with them and everything we'd miss out on together. They've crept back into my life now, and we speak here and there, but it won't ever be the same. Also, one of them is pregnant! I probably could've been the godmother, which is kind of sad to think about too. \n\nHalf of me wants an apology, the other half has forgiven them for the sake of my own wellbeing. I still love them so much. They were my best friends!",
            "All I can say is that you must have never been in a real relationship. Friends come and go. People move away. They get married and have kids and fall off the map. Life is fluid. I know, with all the social media and life long phone numbers, now, no one ever loses contact or stops being a part of your life. Not now.\n\nBut, it wasn\u2019t always that way. People used to move away, lose contact as they get involved with their own lives, and phone numbers changed as you moved from place to place. Friends from elementary school go to a different middle school due to zoning or they move away.  You make new friends. The ones that moved away become part of the past. Work friends went the same way. And, we all survived. \n\nAnd, friends have their own lives and their own problems to deal with. They really aren\u2019t a daily part of your life or the person standing beside you to work through the hard times. Sure, real friends help each other out but, you\u2019re not life partners. \n\nYour SO, if it\u2019s a real relationship is the person sharing every day of your life, sharing your highs and lows, standing beside you to work together through hard times. You wake up with them every morning, come home to them after work each day, and go to sleep beside them every night. \n\nRelationships only come and go if they aren\u2019t serious. If it\u2019s a real relationship, a break up is really much worse than a friendship ending. \n\nOf course, if you\u2019re comparing a friendship to a casual relationship with someone you\u2019re just dating ( rather than an actual relationship), then I\u2019ll agree with you. But, I wouldn\u2019t call someone you\u2019re just kind of dating a real relationship.",
            "Out growing friends is a part of life. You come to expect to spend less time together and eventually replace them with more convient friends.\n\nBeing engaged to somebody and expecting to spend the rest of your life together is another story. It hurts a lot more planning and building your life to be with someone only to end up alone. It isn't just the lose of the person. It's the breaking down of you're life's entire structure and future plans. There is a lot more rebuilding that goes into your life after ending a serious relationship.",
            "I agree. Cutting off an ex is easy, but having a friend betray you that you've known for so long kills. I never miss my exes, but I keep wondering why my friends don't talk to me anymore. it's much easier to find someone to date than to find a good friend.",
            "Well not all romantics relationships are equal.\nSo I only partially agree with what you said.",
            "I agree.\n\nAnd at the same time... I don\u2019t think enough people consider that sometimes friendship break ups NEED to happen.\n\nYou get so used to having a person in your life you accept their \u201cquirks\u201d that are really just toxic behaviors nobody needs to deal with.\n\nI also feel like sometimes people get more shit about friendship breakups (especially from parents if they\u2019re childhood friendships) than real breakups which is bullshit.",
            "Depends on the friend and relationship I guess but I'd argue if you haven't experienced true love you'd likely share this opinion. A lot of people here are younger, and have probably never been in a committed relationship for more than a few years. But two individuals in love share so much more than the same \"vibe\" and theres an unbelivable amount of shit you'd trust with your romantic partner than your friends. \n\nSome people haven't had lifelong friends either or have moved well passed that chapter of their life. \n\nSo your statement may be true if you're, like, 18. But I see so much wrong with it given an actual lifetime. \n\nI'd say anyone is lucky to have experienced these kind of connections and it is usually always unfortunate when it ends.",
            "Holy shit! This happened to me 4 months ago and even though she was nothing more than a friend at the time, I feel I got one too many \u201cWas she a GF?\u201d Which made it feel semi-invalidated about the fact she was just a friend but hey, I\u2019m over it and I laugh about it and how pathetic she. Oh, and upvoted.",
            "And even worse when it\u2019s your best friend and SO in the same person.",
            "Disagree, however I get where you\u2019re coming from. For me I have to basically be best friends with someone in order to want to date them, so losing them is far worse than losing someone I was simply just friends with.",
            "The worst is when you get together with your best friend and things don't work out...",
            "This is not unpopular. I was heartbroken when me and my best friend stopped talking and for months i cried all the time. And finally i broke down and called her and we both cried on the phone to each other.",
            "I've broken up with my best friend a bunch, these girls have dangerous amounts of info about me, I wish them well lol",
            "Friends stick while relationships come and go. But losing a friend is the worst thing ever",
            "It entirely depends on the nature of the relationship. Some friendship breakups are worse than some romantic breakups, but some romantic breakups are worse than some friendship breakups. It's silly to try to claim that one type is worse than the other.",
            "I had to explain to someone that this is what the last episode of Bojack Horseman was about.",
            "Disagree, take my upvote. Especially when you realize that you and your former friend have completely different values (those that go against yours), their behavior is unacceptable and you realize you are better off without them. It hurts because you can\u2019t do fun friendship things anymore such as go out for lunches, catch up over coffee and dessert, among other things, but looking at the bigger picture, I guess it is safe to say that you don\u2019t want these kind of people and their drama in your life.",
            "Jesus christ, this is so true. I've had many breakups with former SOs, all who were one of my best friends, and while they hurt, we only dated anywhere from a year to three years. \n\nOn the other hand, my best friend, friends for 13 years, stopped being my friend and it still hurts 4 years later. We literally talked at least once a week and I shared things with him I havent with anyone but my current fiance. \n\nFriendship breakups are the absolute worse.",
            "Despite the fact that my wife cheated on me on several occasions, she was my best friend. I tried to make it work, but i couldn't. Every day i will find something that makes me smile, or laugh. Remind me of her. It is so hard every single day not to send her something. And it hurts every time i stop myself.",
            "I\u2019m still not over the loss of my former best friend and it\u2019s been 8 years. I miss our friendship",
            "im in this situation with  my best friend, he is my Bro,  i mean closer than my own blood related brother. Hell im the god father of his son just left and we have slowly stoped talking trough time and it just sucks so much. I was never a big group of people person always very selective on who to trust. \n\nDamn does it hit hard that we dont speak that often or are in touch like we used to be. But that is life. \n\nAnd not to burst the bubble of all you guys but after 30 it gets harder due to the fact that everyone gets married and start to develop familys. Im in the point were i just find it all very fustrutating in terms of connecting with other people and i tend to be very carasmatic , but Its life guys. try to join activitys and distract yourselves you end up always meeting new people that way.",
            "Even the break ups with toxic friends hurt. You know love them so much but you know that, deep down, they need to be cut out of your life.",
            "Highly agreed. I had an actual breakup a couple of years ago and I hardly even think about her anymore. When I do, it\u2019s just \u201cI wonder how she\u2019s been\u201d and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t miss the relationship at all, I feel like a bird freed from its cage. \n\nBut a year before that, I had an unforeseen friendship breakup and I still think about it to this day. It was a mountain out of a molehill and we\u2019re barely acquaintances. I miss that friendship a lot because I\u2019ve outgrown all of my current friends (we\u2019re just not on the same page on anything anymore) and I basically have no friends at this point. So if I had a choice between getting the relationship or that friendship back, I\u2019d choose the latter in a heartbeat.",
            "It sucks. Especially when they refuse to talk anything out with you, but expect you to do that every time there is a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEspecially when you can no longer talk to a lot of friends, because they are also friends with the ex-friends. And the ex-friends refuse to literally have anything to do with you effectively making you lose all your friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts really nice.",

            "Man I feel this. \n\nI met a guy in 9th grade. He lived in PA I lived in TN. We maintained a friendship for all of high school, through one of the darkest periods of my life. We went on trips together during the summer, we would sit and study together. The summer after graduation we took a two week road trip all up and down the east coast. He was my very best friend. He knew things about very few others knew. \n\nI had a crush on him, and he said he liked me but didn\u2019t want to date since he was off to an Ivy League school and I was staying in TN. More then once he said he wished we could be together. I waited for a while, but I respected that, and moved on to someone else. Which seemed to annoy him but I realized then it was jealousy, but not the kind you would think. \n\nA month into our freshman year he came out to me. He said he has always known and now that he was in college he felt safe admitting it. \n\nI said I was glad he had come out but I was admittedly a little hurt. He had lead me on for two years at that point. He admitted using me as a beard so that his parents would find out he was gay. I said I would have been his beard anyway, he didn\u2019t have to lead me on. I said I needed a day to process this, but I would message him soon. \n\nI did. I messaged him a day later but apparently my reaction was the end of our friendship. Occasionally he likes a Facebook status, I think the last time we talked was five years ago before my wedding.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years and I still miss the friendship. He was, and still is, and incredibly person. The few times he pops up on my social media I feel such a sense of loss.",

            "I'd say losing a best friend is way worse than a breakup, and unfortunately I've dealt with that.\n\nIm 35 now, I had a best friend all through high school and into my 30s. We went everywhere together, trips, concerts, shows, hung out at least 4 days a week.\n\n A few years ago he had a nasty break up with his girlfriend because she wanted to get married and start a family, and he was only interested in having fun and having no responsibility. I tried having a serious talk with him about how we were into our 30s and we needed to grow up. He took it that I was taking her side and he completely cut me out of his life. Blocked on Facebook, no replying to texts or calls. We didn't talk for 3 years, he missed my wedding, it killed me inside. I eventually got used to him not being around anymore.\n\nFast forward to last year he shows up at my house out of the blue one day because he's depressed. He  apologized for what happened and wanted to make an effort to be friends again, but he finds out I started a family and can't be out having fun all night like he wants. Sure enough he cuts me out of his life again, and haven't heard from him since.\n\nI always wondered what would happen if he came back, and he did, only to leave again with no warning. Still hurts sometimes.",
            "My freshman year of college, I quickly became friends with Kate who lived across the hall. We even went to Denmark together for Spring Break. I wasn't blind to the fact we were growing apart, or that our friendship had become a bit more awkward, but one day she just completely ghosted me. I could see she read my messages, liked my instagram posts, but she refused to respond to me at all. It still hurts, and I would give anything to have some form of closure.",

            "On that note friend betrayals are fucking HARD to deal with.\n\nFirst year of university, living in a dorm--became super close with a guy on my floor. Felt as tight as I had with my best friend that I grew up with. We played in a band together, hung out all the time, we were moving in together for the next year and even had planned to work together in the summer.\n\nHe bails on the summer job thing and goes home for the summer instead--okay no big deal, I was a little bummed but the job was garbage anyways. We're back in the fall house with two other roommates we picked out. He starts another band with a different drummer and is always telling me how the other drummer is talking shit about me but how I'm actually way better than him at a lot of stuff, etc. etc.  Me and the other drummer don't get along.\n\nI notice some discrepancies in our joint \"house account\". This house account is something that my \"friend\" insisted we put together to pay for bills and groceries we're all using and stuff. I catch him taking some money out and he apologizes and has an excuse that's believable but I start watching the account like a hawk. Find out later his grandmother was an accountant (he was taking business) that got caught embezzling well over a million dollars from clients. Go figure.\n\nI could keep going on but long story short, I learn after 6 months of living with him that he's been a total scumbag in secret the entire time. He was making up shit for fun between his other drummer and me and turning us against each other by pretending we said things we didn't and telling both of us that the other was full of shit etc. He was trying to cause similar strife within the house turning us against each other inside the house. Found out he was  spreading lies to a bunch of girls from our floor about how I was a creep and all this shady stuff that I never did. I found out he was telling everybody back home that I was getting creepy with him and wanting to spend all our time together working the same job and stuff when HE was the one who suggested that in the first place. The list goes on and on.\n\nIt actually all came out at the same time and turns out he had done this to his friends that he grew up with back home and had come to the same university. I felt so betrayed and hurt that someone I thought highly of and trusted as my good friend was actually just talking shit about me and playing mind games with me and everyone else. \n\nGood did come out of it though. I ended up becoming friends with HIS former friends who all cut his toxic ass out of their lives. I became friends with the drummer I was pitted against and we commiserated together as he had committed to moving in with our \"friend\" before all this came to light. He lasted 4 months I think and ended up breaking the lease. I learned a lot and became more cynical. Whether it's for the best or not, I won't be fooled like that again and I've learned if someone is always telling you about people shitting on you--don't instantly believe it and find out from the horse's mouth. Further to that if someone is always talking shit they're probably talking shit about you too.\n\nWow this ended up as a long rant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr; Got betrayed by someone who I thought was my best friend but was a lying, stealing, backstabbing piece of shit. Shit sucks.**",

Idk how we became best friends, I think that we both assumed that time is equal to friendship, but it\u2019s not the case.\n\nI have also been making other friends, and have one friend I talk to several times a week whom I met only 4 years ago; we can just talk for hours and hours and transition through many topics effortlessly, we just meld better. This is when I realized what I want from a friendship, something that my other friend just can\u2019t/won\u2019t offer. It sucks, but it\u2019s life.

            "I agree. While my latest break up(romantically) did a number on me. It was more of the reasons why I ended getting broken up with that screwed with me than actually getting broken up with. People that I thought were friends decided to make up false stories to the guy I was dating about me being pregnant(I never even had a pregnancy scare while dating him). They told him stuff like me dating him wasn\u2019t okay because we were coworkers or that I was out getting different guys numbers(because a guy gave me his number while I was at work mind you I never texted the guy and just tossed his number away). This guy eventually ended things with me because of the lies of my now former friends. The final nail in the coffin was one of these friends sent me screen shots of the guy saying he never actually liked me, only later admit to making these fake screenshots. It just sucked because it was the betrayal of these friends that really screwed with me and now 6 months later I still don\u2019t have friends and I\u2019m afraid to trust anyone because of this.",
            "Agreed. It wounds your ego in a different way to part ways in a friendship than in a romantic relationship. Like, your first boyfriend or girlfriend from high school or whatever. Yeah, it lasted a year or two but you knew it would end eventually in the corner of your mind, because you're both so young, or you're not yet happy with yourself yet. You cry, but you know you're being slightly over-dramatic. \n\nLosing a friend, you cry, but still even crying it's not enough to express how bad it feels. :/ You're losing someone who was always supposed to stay and be a part of your life.",
            "My best friend one day convince the entire group that I was the bad guy- the bitch. I texted her, asking if we could have lunch and talk about it.

            "I need to get this off my chest : god your post hurts and hits right at the feels. I broke up with my ex a couple of months ago, but there was no real ending, just like \u201cwe\u2019re gonna stay friends and see what happens\u201d. The hopes you get that things will change, the feelings that you don\u2019t wanna let go of, having to see her/him often and being in that position. Still feeling and remembering everything as you should be \u201cfriendly\u201d, shit it hurts.",

            "100% agree with this. My boyfriend and I had broken up, so I wasn\u2019t okay. I texted my bff, telling her what happened and the thing that hurt me the most was that she didn\u2019t call to check up on me. We haven\u2019t been the same since and it still hurts.",

            "A few months ago, I would've agreed with you wholeheartedly. The thought of losing my best friend of over a decade was so awful it wouldn't even fully compute for me... \n\n\n\nThen it happened. And it was nothing like what I thought it would be. I cried a bit. I felt down for a few days. It's been a month-ish, and I do still find myself thinking about it. But it isn't some all-consuming obsession like I'd predicted. I honestly feel a bit detached from it, more rational than emotional. Maybe it'll hit me harder later on, I'm not sure. Or maybe it's just that the distance has helped me realize some things. We spent a lot of time and energy \"managing\" one another. I'd stop her from dealing in absolutes and from taking the worst possible interpretation of a situation. She kept me from feeling lonely, from feeling trapped, and validated me. I thought we were helping one another, but now I know that we were actually keeping one another from actually having to deal with our own crap. And now that I'm not managing her crap, I have more time and energy to deal with my own. And I'm feeling better than I have in a long time. I hope she's experiencing the same thing. \n\n\nIf she called me, I'd still pick up. But I don't need that call, and I don't think she does either.",

I swear he was grooming her. He\u2019s a trust fund brat. They got married when she was 28. He basically brainwashed her into thinking that her childhood friends were all against her. He would name drop celebrity names that he hung out with. Belittled all her friends. Treated her like she was a China Doll, whilst she worshipped the ground he walked on, coz he knew *fashion*. He started a business, which failed, and she didn\u2019t get paid. I eventually had it with her and confronted her. She already dropped her other high school friends and I was one of the last ones she cared for. I cared for her so much, only wanted the best for her. But she broke up with me, basically. Ignored me. Wanted nothing to do with me. \n\nI wonder how she\u2019s doing sometimes. We stopped talking 7 years ago. I know she was cheating on her husband. She admitted it to me before we broke up. It hurt like hell. She made her bed tho.",
            "Definitely disagree.\n\nMy \u2018best\u2019 friends that I grew up with etc constantly excluded me from plans, spread rumours and would message me while they had parties together, telling me to kill myself. \n\nThis was all seen by family and they told me to cut them off. For years I just couldn\u2019t because I had no one else. I got older and realised they benefitted me in no way. Cutting them off is one of the easiest things I\u2019ve ever done. Not seen them for years, and never even think about how they\u2019re doing.

He was my best friend through the rest of high school and even through college, even though we went to different places. He was with me through my first marriage and it\u2019s end. I supported him when he needed it, and he supported me when I did. It was a very deep and fulfilling relationship that lasted until I was 32. \n\nWe had started to drift apart the last handful of years and while it made me sad I knew that relationships changed and I was happy that he was still in my life. We still got together for games and to catch up. \n\nWe definitely had some rough patches through our relationship but we fixed then as we went along. I had called him when I was getting remarried and I wanted him to be in the wedding party. He was hesitant and wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to do that since we weren\u2019t as close as we once were. I explained that while that was true he was still a huge part of my life and I wanted him up there with me. He declined and I could tell there was more by the tone of his voice. I asked if he was even going to come to the wedding and he said no. Then he explained how he felt our relationship wasn\u2019t there anymore and essentially broke up with me. \n\nI still don\u2019t understand why he felt he needed to break it off rather than work on any problems. And it still really hurts.\n\nEdit: fixed two spelling mistakes.",

My girlfriend and my friend who I play with online like once a month.

            "I had a friendship breakup about a month ago. This girl was my best female friend and we had talked every single day for almost 2 years despite my having moved across the country ( from Washington state to Florida ). I finally moved back and we got to actually hang out again, but when I got back I noticed she had changed.\n\nShe was drinking every day, she had spent a lot of time doing psychedelics every day in the town she was in for months on end, and she had started dealing with some really shady guys. She eventually ended up getting groomed by a guy who's 47 years old ( she turned 21 not too long ago ) over the past 3-4 months, and on a whim she decided to go on a road trip with him one on one. \n\nI told her I needed to have a heart to heart over him and how a grown man doesn't have good intentions for you when he's paying for your drug habit and alcohol. She threw away her ged classes, lost all her ambition, and now wants to start an onlyfans and have people provide for her instead of being independent. She did a complete 180 on me, and in the process of trying to have a heart to heart with her she said some unforgivable stuff and sent me some really offensive pictures, so I ended the friendship.\n\nIt's only been a month, but my heart aches more than it did when I broke it off with my ex-fiance.",

For 3 reasons: 1) I can't afford to 2) I have other friends of my own that I'd rather hang out with instead of her friends. 3) I simply don't want to.\nI was devastated tbh and totally caught off guard, since covid I feel like one by one I am losing all the important parts of my life, job, apartment, friend, flights etc. \nBut I've realised \"you've changed\" is a compliment.I'm 32 and she's still living the same life we did at 22.\nI like cooking dinners and yoga and having deeper friendships that don't revolve around the pub.\nSome people as painful as it is are only meant to be a chapter in our book. I love her dearly and wish her well but she no longer belongs in my life.",
            "Agreed. I recently broke up with some friends I have known for close to 10 years all because it had become a toxic abusive relationship. It hurts more because I am still apart of the group text chat, so I still see everything they are talking about.",

            "Ohhhh it's worse when they're still around and wont give you a reason for ghosting you and not calling anymore. Shit sucks.",
            "I think part of this is because there isn't really an accepted social \"ceremony\" for a friendship breakup like there is for a romantic breakup. \n\nIn a romantic breakup you sit down, tell them why it's over, you actually *do* the breakup. There isn't really an accepted/normal way of doing that with a friend, so it's usually harder for the person on the other side to know why it happened.",
            "When I was young I had a friend who lived a few minutes from me. I would see him everyday for years and years. One day his family had to move for work and it crushed me. I was sad from the ages of 14-18 about it. To this day I have never been as happy as when I saw him all the time and I have trouble making new friends as an adult. But I have to say I have been dumped after a several year long relationship and oh my god did it hurt. I would say the difference is that losing a friend is more of a long relentless sadness while breaking up with someone is more like an intense pain that slowly goes away. It was so weird how the breakup actually felt like physical pain.",

In my case you can have a partner you\u2019ve grown up together with for years and years. Friend breakups can have the exact same impact and reason for ending as romantic ones, whether it be growing apart or a hostile fight. They are almost one in the same to me if it\u2019s with the right people.",
            "For sure. Especially when nothing specific happens. I've gone through losing a group of friends 3 times. Once in high school, once in college, and once after college. First group I guess really only talked to me bc I was dating their friend, but I thought we had fun. We would hang out outside of school and game together but whatever. Second group I got pushed out of by someone I invited to the group. She would leave whenever I joined and ignore me if I was there. Eventually I got sick of being treated that way and everyone siding with her (even though I wasnt doing anything wrong? And they had all known me years longer than her who they had known for maybe 1 year). So I left. And my most recent group I still talk to sometimes and none of them have an issue with me I dont think, but whenever I join discord I get talked over and ignored. Idk if its intentional but ever since I started dating one of that group it's like I'm not my own person anymore so they just dont acknowledge me. Instead of being me, I'm just a part of him. If that makes sense idk. Anyways at this point its gotta be something that's wrong with me, I just wish someone would tell me why they stopped talking to me and didnt just ignore me anytime I message them or talk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f oh well.\n\nSorry for the long post.

My best friend \"broke up\" with me and my other friend (we were a group of three) and honestly I don't know why, but it didn't affect me in the sligthess, not after 15 years of friendship. Maybe it was because the reason was so god damned stupid and it just kinda overwrote everything else.\n\nOn the other hand my girlfriend of 8 years broke up with me (before the thing with my friend) and that hit me VERY hard. Though I was mostly ok after only half a year so perhaps I'm just not that much of an emotional person.",
            "With a romantic breakup, there\u2019s still the chance of them wanting to remain your friend, so having to really break up a connection is a lot more painful, since you\u2019re essentially saying you don\u2019t want to be connected anymore.",

            "I\u2019m still traumatized over a friend I\u2019ve lost. I have thought longer and harder about her than I have ever thought about anyone I\u2019ve ever dated in my life .. and I\u2019ve had a few seriously intense long term relationship that have ended.",
            "Agreed. A lot of our friendships see us through multiple romantic relationships. In this day and age we almost go into romantic relationships expecting that they have an expiration date. Friends are the ones you expect to be there before and after relationships and break ups.\n\nEspecially friends that you\u2019ve had for several years. It\u2019s more like losing a family member.",
            "I think they hurt more because they happen so slowly and painfully. At least, with relationship break ups some are more noticable and end quickly (provided the relationship was healthy to from start). The best thing to happen in a friendship break up is having a mutual understanding that you've both committed to a path that makes you both happy and that it could have only happened from the separation. To my best friend, \"J\", I'm happy with where you are at in life and I wish you the best.",

            "Can confirm. Lost a friend recently due to my own mistakes. It hurts worse than a breakup.",
            "This is very true. It's been over three years since my really ugly breakup with my high school best friends. I'm still not totally over it. Today is the birthday of the girl I considered the best friend I ever had. I really miss her.",
            "I agree. But wish I could say that about others I guess people don\u2019t care about friends anymore.",
            "I've gotta agree. I've had heartaches and I've been dump by the one person I've legitimately loved so far, but its my friends, my chosen brothers, that held me together through the tough times. \nI can get on with my life being dumped by someone, but moving on from losing the people that have stuck by me through the worst of time? That sounds like pure agony.",
            "Yeah I went through a real breakup. But I got over it quick enough. My best friend left and I cried a lot more. Completely true statement. It's not only that, it's the way she left. She basically ruined everything we liked about each other and I felt like a stranger to every other friend I had because she swayed most of them against me.",
            "I don\u2019t know if I would call them \u201cbreak ups\u201d, but there\u2019s a very unique kind of sadness that comes with thinking about all the friends that have just come in and out of your life. I\u2019m approaching my 30\u2019s and life is just getting more and more isolated. I\u2019m just fortunate for the friends who have remained by my side, I and work hard to keep them in my life. It really does take effort to maintain relationships when you get older.\n\nI\u2019ve only had a couple real friend break ups, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re out of my life.",
            "My best friend just died so this sucks.",
            "My best friend from high school, we didn\u2019t necessarily have a breakup. More just grew up and drifted apart, I also moved across the country from her which didn\u2019t help. It\u2019s really sad because we had so many good memories and I really miss her. She\u2019s also a big phone talker and I\u2019m more into texting. We\u2019ve also just changed a lot as we got older and don\u2019t have as much in common. It truly sucks \ud83d\ude14",

            "broke up with a girl after dating for 3 years. she was kinda nuts, i was a bad boyfriend. whatever. it was very painful for a short time. then i was alone for a while. then i dated someone new and i didnt even think of her much in the months before i started dating the new one nevermind after.  \n\nmy best friend from grade 4 to 12 strayed from our radar during college. maybe saw him a handful of times during the summers. he made no effort and when i did see him it was always with his new friends not our old friends. one time he agreed to hang at my parents house with the guys and they were all shocked and so happy to see our old friend. in the 10 years since i saw him like 3 times, he called me once out of the blue, i thought maybe he needed his buddy back, venting about a new job, new girl. years passed, we ran into each other once in trade school once as we worked through apprenticeships as a second career. i tried to make plans, never happened. invited him to my housewarming, birthdays, never got a response.  \n\nchoosing to not send him an invite to my wedding was one of the saddest moments of my life. my wife is going to have a baby in 2 weeks and not only she never met him, my son never will either. now im sad. fuck this post",

            "Man this hits deep. I was best friends with one of my mates for nearly 10 years since highschool and we had the stupidest argument over basically nothing. Pride got in the way for both of us and neither of us reached out for months. Then he randomly blocked me off everything including PS and changed his number. Tried reaching out to him on FB messenger late last year as he made a new one but to no avail. I dont regret a lot of things but that one I definitely did and I miss him like crazy. \n\nIt hurts even more cause I thought we'd be friends for a lifetime. He was like a brother to me.",
            "you can say that again",
            "Loved and also was friend with someone. In only 10 months she the first person i wanted to talk to about everything. After that she ghosted without a reason and when confronted she said \"people change\", but she only said that because she ghosted me and needed a good reason :<",
            "I definitely agree. I know it's not always like this but with romantic breakups, I have found that there is a bigger reason for the breakup. But with friendship it can be slow. It's really tough when that person has been your go to for everything for years and then they just aren't. My saddest feelings or the ones that bug me longest have always been friendship breakups.\n\nIt definitely makes me want to never be that close to anyone ever again.",
            "Ah, the feels. So true. You expect your friends to be there when you go through a romantic breakup. What\u2019s the feminine version of bro\u2019s before hoes?",
            "IDK, I'm still feeling the pain of not being with the one I love. Definitely don't feel anything for a couple of long term friendships that ended similar time ago. Not to mention the initial pain was worse leaving the woman I love..",
            "A couple years ago, I had a messy falling out with my best friend of 10 years.  The same guy that was my best man when I married.  In my effort to help him after an argument with his mom, she got super defensive.  She's deranged and manipulative as is, and chose to turn him against me.  I couldn't convince him of what was happening, and any attempts to talk to him were rebuffed.  He claimed that we had nothing to talk about, that if I wanted to talk it would be to his mom.\n\nMy wife and I had just had our second child, and I was on paternity leave.  I decided the time and effort was not worth wasting, and to focus on my family.  Unfortunately, that did not stop depressive symptoms from arising.  I ate poorly, slept barely, lost a lot of time for a couple months.  I mean, it was only in the span of a couple hours I lost my best friend.\n\nAfter those couple months, I figured things had cooled off enough.  I couldn't go to his place, and my wife didn't want him over (rightly so, but our 1st loved him).  I wanted to try and patch things up with him, I thought it was something precious enough to work for.  I paid a few times for us to go to a gaming cafe and hang out, but there was an inescapable tension, a sense of anxiety.  I felt like I had done my share, but we would never be able to get past what happened.  \n\nI had spent months halfway across that bridge, waiting for him to catch up so we could cross together.  In the end, I made it to the end myself, and kept on going, though I do look back every now and again.  There was no goodbye, no closure, just swift detachment.",
            "I broke up with my partner of eight years a few years ago... No regrets. I lost my best friend to drug use the next year, which was way worse for me.",
            "Absolutely. I lost 3 of my best friends friends at the same time. It was a 3 against 1 situation. Not only just friends but my 3 best friends. Pretty much my sisters. Best friends for years and after highschool and I made the mistake and We all went to the same college together. Roomed with one of them who I was the closest with my freshman year and it was hell. Ended up transferring colleges because of it. It was so different then highschool. I still think about them everyday. Haven\u2019t talked to them in over a year this month. It still hurts honestly but it was for the best. The true colors really came out once we lived together. It was really really a sad time for me and it absolutely destroyed my mental health. It broke my heart honestly because we had so many great memories which just got dissolved during our downfall.",
            "I might\u2019ve messed mine up just now.",
            "I thought I was the only one who thought this. I had a friend. I had known him since I was 12 or so. We hung out every chance we could up until I was 25. I considered him my brother. Dude helped me through my depression during my lowest and shared some of the most amazing experiences I still think about to this day. It all changed when I started dating my wife 3 years ago. He just stopped talking to me. Didn\u2019t even blow me off just straight up ghosted me. It still hurts man. I loved him to death. My mom was the only other close person I had like that. I still have no idea what happened.",
            "I agree wholeheartedly. My best friend that I grew up with (and we jokingly called ourselves platonic soulmates) dumped me when she got a boyfriend when we were 22. I just broke up with my bf of two years (that I thought I was gonna marry) last month and tbh I still think about her all the time while I\u2019ve already started to move on from my bf",

            "Had to do this with a friend since kindergarten. Really hurt, but I'm glad we've moved on. I didn't realize how his jealousy held me back from being the best person I can be.",
            "When you meet a new romantic partner, and the relationship is better than your last, you don\u2019t really miss your former partner. However friendships are not monogamous so you don\u2019t really get over an old one when you have a new one",

            "God yes. Heart wrenchingly so. I just recently went through a triple loss; bf and two 20+ year friendships. Two of the three I feel relieved about. It was much healthier for me to let it go. The third though was the result of the ones toxic manipulation and it hurts so bad. It feels like half my soul is gone. I'm lucky enough to have a dressing room and it's like a shrine to her because everything in there came from her or reminds me of her. I hate it. I haven't talked to her since Nov. It makes me sick to think about her believing this other rotten soul's lies. I miss her.",

            "I feel this",
            "In one fell swoops, I had my partner break up with me and 7 friends all choose him, they were all really close friends. Was traumatic to say the least.",
            "Yes, I had a falling out with 2 of my friends in college, still regret it more than any of my love brkups",
            "Yes it's a shame how our society devalues any human connection that isn't a sexual monogamous one. We call people's sex partners \"significant other\" although they rarely last a lifetime. We say that two persons are \"just friends\" when they don't have sex as if \"friends\" was on a lower scale than sex. Why aren't our friends our \"significant others\" and why aren't two people \"just having sex\"?",
            "It\u2019s true. You expect friends to be there long past your boyfriends or girlfriends. The worst is when you lose them both at the same time because your girlfriend left you for your best friend of six years.",
            "i just stopped being friends with one of my really close friends just recently. i knew she had lied before, but i guess the part of me that appreciated the good parts of our friendship didn't want to come to terms with how much she had actually been lying- not just to me but others that cared about her as well. while she's off with her new best friend though, me and my boyfriend and her ex (who she probably lied to/used the most) are becoming pretty close. crazy how things work out.",
            "Its worse when your partner becomes your best friend and you breakup, it leaves you lonely",
            "My best friend from high school, who I lived with through my last 3 years of college and after, up and ditched me cold turkey for a girl. Who he is no longer with. I\u2019m still not over that shit.",
            "Agreed. Drifted away from someone a couple years ago, and remembering all the memories and secrets we shared still hurts every day, way worse than any break up I've ever had. Every day I wish things didn't end up like they did.\n\nHope you're okay, Mango",
            "Ikr. This shit happens throughout life. The closer u get to somebody thinking he/she will be there and uk it, the stronger the repel forces become. And it will always be something on a very very minor incident which otherwise would have been chill. Often this shit builds and a single minor event does it.\nHad been through this many times. Can't really have permanent friends these days due to weird personality disorder of mine. I always feel i am extra and that everybody only converse or look towards me when i with others. Nobody bothers me when i am alone or i will be invited like others. \nRecovering is tough for me, but iu i gtta live through this and so do you my friend!\nHit me up if u wanna talk :)",
            "I mean, I've never dated anyone, so I have no point of comparison, but it truly does feel shitty. I drifted apart from literally all my friends in my first couple years of college when my depression was at its peak. Recently tried to reconnect with my old best friend who I'd known since 2nd grade, but after she blew me off about three times, I knew it wasn't happening. At least when we were drifting apart I was numb to it all, but this time it really hurt.\n\nI'm pretty damn content with where I am now in life, and it's been some years, but I'm honestly not over it. I really miss being someone's best friend. I feel like I just don't know how to connect to people in that way anymore.",
            "I\u2019ve got a friend from college who just ghosted a whole pile of us at some point. We want to blame it on the girl be married, but it seems to all of us that he\u2019s divorced now. He won\u2019t reply to my messages or those from the others in our group. \n\nIt\u2019s a real bummer, and I miss him.",
            "Gosh, I almost lost my best friend around my birthday last year after he canceled my trip to visit him because I was being a downer (I had drunkenly called him a week prior all depressed by my dead-end job and my contemplation of my own mortality when reaching a landmark age). It felt awful and I was heartbroken and lonely and decided to instead spend my birthday replaying my favorite video game because I didn't want to think about how upset I was. It was notably worse than my only breakup, which was a long distance relationship that ended with her calling it off because it was difficult. At least the romantic relationship felt it had run its course, but the friendship breakup was my college years down the drain with a guy whose back I had countless times and was suddenly gone. \n\nIt wound up eventually being alright, since we reconnected the next month and I realized that he was having a rough time and just not telling me about it (his heartfelt apology and complete acceptance of all the blame also helped make it easier), but our almost bro-ckup left me rattled for a few months.",
            "My best friend cut contact with me like 10 years ago. Broke my heart. We had amazing times together man, i think about it often",
            "Over 10yrs and I still think about her",
            "I've never gone through a breakup so I cannot compare, but I did go through several friendships breakups, two being insanely painful. Took me a very long time (over a year) to get over them, and one of those ex-friends, whom I haven't seen or talked to in over five years, still pops into my head or even my dreams regularly. I hate it, but I still miss her and wonder if I'll ever have a friendship like that again. All of these experiences also made me very insecure and it's extremely hard for me to make new friends. Haven't made a new one in 10 years and currently have two who live 200km away. So while I can't compare, I can say that losing friends can really fuck you up at least as much as a breakup. The pain might be less intense but can last for ages.",
            "Especially when you are older, I\u2019m almost 40 on my second marriage and have been in love many times...  I \u201cbroke up\u201d with a friend of 25 years.  It was necessary, but I still think about her and it was one of the saddest  breakups of my life.",
            "Agreed. Since everyone else is sharing, I will too. Best friend of 5 years and I started to drift because she started hanging out with the popular crew (small town/school, cliques are very prominent). Started putting people against me while also staying away, essentially isolating me from everyone. I wasn\u2019t ready to let go yet, she checked out a year before she started changing hardcore. Really screwed me up the moment when I realized I had no friends at all. Had a lot of mental breakdowns and crap, and essentially, mentally, worst 6 months for my health. Advice if you wanna break away from friends; just say it. Don\u2019t drag on, don\u2019t dance around it and drift without telling them. F***s people up.",
            "And friendship breakups don't have to be abrupt. They can be caused by simply drifting apart over the years. That hurts too, remembering what good times were like, then realizing how long ago they happened.",
            " i miss my buddy.",
            "Yes, I am still bitter over being \u201cdumped\u201d by my best friend from college (6 years ago now). The worst part is that she just stopped talking to me, never told me what the problem was. I have tried contacting her many times since and she never responds. I hate not knowing.",
            "Recovering. Learned that my best friend and my other closest friends dont actually care about me, so I guess that's cool. I'm always the first to notice if something's been bothering them and was always there for them. I was considered to be the leader of the group. I didnt put myself up there, they did. \n\nBut things happened that upset me and I left the group. I learned they dont give a shit because they never bothered to check up on me and simply ask \"What's up?\" or \"Whats wrong?\"  \n\nEveryday I want to explain to them why I left the group and explain other things but, this time, I want them to check up on me. I dont want to explain myself anymore. I dont want to be the only person keeping the friendship in check anymore. I dont want a one sided relationship anymore. \n\nEver since my leaving, I've tried meeting new people and create new friends. School clubs, Meetup.com, Hobby clubs, etc. Cant really seem to click with people the way I clicked with my 'friends'. It's probably because I grew up with those guys. \n\nLuckily, my girlfriend has always been loving and supporting. She's got my back even though her hands are full with school, work, and her own personal issues. I love that woman so much.\n\nAlso, shoutout to the one guy in the group that I still keep in touch with as hes the only person that asked me what was going on. Love you Chris.",
            "I felt this one.  It just happened to me recently and hit me like a fucking landslide. I didn't have many friends growing up, but one day I met the kids that lived up the block from me and we really hit it off well. They were brothers, and they saw me playing alone in my backyard and brought their group of friends over to ask if I wanted to be friends (this was like 4th grade). We became fast friends, and stayed that way for a long time. Their family practically helped raise me. We stayed friends through high school even though we went to different schools.  We talked after I went away to college, and started hanging out again when I moved back. As an only child, it's the closest thing I ever had to brothers. \n\n When I was 27 I married my wife,  and like a TV storyline, my friend ended up marrying her sister! It was the perfect setup since family gatherings were like hangouts with my best friend. Fast forward a few years to where it all came crashing down.  Their marriage wasn't picture perfect, and after having two kids together, they ended up going through a pretty nasty divorce. I tried to stay impartial, I refused to take sides (still do), but he refuses to talk to me anymore. He won't take my calls, won't return my texts, dumped me from all social media. More than that, his brother, and his whole family that I grew up with has done the same thing. It's like I lost my two best friends and my second family in a divorce that had nothing to do with me! Even though my wife and I are doing great, part of me hates going to family events now because I feel so alone without my best friend there anymore. I'm really hoping it gets easier with time,  but it's definitely the worst \"breakup\" I've ever been through.",
            "They really do man I had a falling out with a mate I met on my first day of high school and spent nearly every day together since we met.  We smoked weed got drunk together our first times, we even lost our virginity the same night but when I was 20 afew weeks before my 21st we had a argument that led to a fight and my other mates in the group chose him I\u2019m 23 and haven\u2019t seen or spoke to any of them since",
            "Literally just happened to me today! I'm in a bad place rn",
            "Yup just happened to me, I\u2019m just trying to move on and let it go",
            "ahhh, now you made me think about it\n\nah..... great",
            "YES. I grieved over losing a best friend more than I did a partner I dated for 5 years. Luckily that friend came back into my life",
            "I fully agree with you on this. Almost a year ago now is when my best friends since elementary school (we\u2019re 22 now) and I got in a nasty disagreement. We didn\u2019t see eye to eye on something and while I came to the conclusion that we should just agree to disagree, it began this saga of them excluding me from hangouts and talking crap about me behind my back which I would later find out from another mutual. It got to a point where I didn\u2019t want to act fake happy/nice to them and we gradually stopped interacting. I\u2019ve experienced breaking up with a significant other but friendship breakups are some other level. Because I\u2019ve been friends with them for so long, there\u2019s so many things around me that remind me of them and the fun times we had. What\u2019s worse is that although I was best friends with both of them since elementary school, I didn\u2019t introduce them to each other until college (one was a friend from school, another from church).  I\u2019m the reason they became friends and now I feel friendless. And it\u2019s not I have no other friends, but these were my two friends that I used to consider my soulmates. It also doesn\u2019t help that we still run in similar circles so I can\u2019t just escape them entirely unless I just move and start a new life somewhere...",
            "I know this thread is full of people saying the same stuff, but I just wanted to add my story to the list. I lost a friend over the stupidest thing, and have made several attempts to reconcile things with them, but they ended an 11 year friendship over one event. Which was me not going to their birthday party after waiting for them for an hour. They were an hour late to an event they planned and I got irritated so I went home. They haven't spoken to me since and it was over 3 months ago. It still feels surreal that he would end a friendship over that, but he won't talk to me no matter how hard I try. It literally feels like he died, and that I didn't really know him. He was such a good friend that I'm still in disbelief about the whole situation. I started antidepressants ironically about a month before the event happened, but I'm still a wreck."

I got a job as a dishwasher when I was 14 and paid for my first phone and it felt great. Now I take a look around me and take a look at my family and see that a lot of children have their own devices. My younger sister recently got my mom's old phone and my younger brothers use my dad's iPad constantly. I understand times are changing and a new generation is growing but I still don't think kids should be allowed to have their own devices til they can responsibly pay for it or take care of it. The devices they use are constantly needing to be cleaned and in bad condition. Personally when I have kids of my own, they won't be on mobile devices til they are at least 10.\n\nSocial media\n\nSocial media can ruin the idea of growing up in a split second. YouTube, Instagram, Facebook etc can all have a positive impact on young minds teaching them things and all that, but it will mostly be negative if they use it. They will get addicted and want to watch YouTube all day and one wrong search can lead to uncomfortable conversations and things they shouldn't know until they are older. My younger brothers and cousins are watching YouTube constantly and the stuff they watch is extremely weird and in some cases scary. I worry that it's taking away from their child hood and just mind numbing them.\nThanks for reading if you got this far.\n\nEdit: I have seen a lot of people who got a device at a younger age around ages nine through eleven for communication with their parents I do not have an issue with this. However it is when a parent just gives their child a device wether it be a mobile phone or tablet that is fully paid for is when I start to disagree with the parents decision.",

My grandpa could go like \"when I grew up, I didn't watch no TV til it was publicly available\" or I could say I just had a PS2, so all kids growing up today should have that instead of the current generations. Time's changing and will never stop doing so. \n\nBut I definitely agree on social media. But I don't think it's the devices or platforms, that are the problem itself, it's the complete absence of educational concepts to teach kids how to use smartphones in a constructive manner. I mean, they're little computers capable of performing various tasks, yet even adults often don't know to use them for more than messenging or casual gaming. I believe it is super important to acknowledge that kids will use them for a good period of their lives and to teach them responsible handling.

My job today consists of what I learned from that day on. It depends on the kid. \n1. Saying \u201cI\u2019m parenting this way period\u201d means it is not important who THE KID IS but what happens around him even before he is born. I believe good parenting means adapting to your child\u2019s personality. Don\u2019t let them be mediocre if they\u2019re not just because you have an opinion.\n3. Don\u2019t have children if you can\u2019t provide. The day your 14 y/o wants to go out but doesn\u2019t have a cellphone I expect you to let him go out without any contacts since you refused to provide him/her with a cellphone they can\u2019t afford;\n4. Working at 14 is illegal (in my country) and wrong!! If I was a parent I would never wish for my child to do something out of necessity (especially washing dishes or clean up trash) because it means I failed. I believe every job deserves RESPECT, especially hard jobs. But until my child is 18 everything they do out of necessity is just a reflection of me failing to provide. I lived that life out of choice (working temporary jobs to afford the minimum) it\u2019s very depressing. Let\u2019s not have children if we can\u2019t afford it, ok? It\u2019s not mandatory. \n5. If you\u2019re scared that something may affect negatively your child (internet in this case) invest your time in understanding what scares you, why, and if it can be prevented. Boomers didn\u2019t know shit about technology but instead of learning they just blocked their children from having their own experience (and now they\u2019re the ones with the tinfoil hat on their head).",

            "Parents need to teach their kids how to use the devices as well as social media. First thing my parents did when I was allowed to have a Facebook, when I was 9, was give me a long ass informative lecture on what was and wasn't acceptable. Bored the shit out of me and I barely used Facebook because of it, but I got the point. My parents aren't even tech savvy people. They just came to understand that things were changing and it was important that I had an email and could use social media. This was well before I had a phone. The only reason I did eventually get one (Age 11) was because my dad lived ten hours away and it was just inconvenient for me to swipe the family phone for my two hour nonsensical 11 year old rants to my dad every few weeks. He got me one of those minute phones that stopped working (calling) when they ran out. I became hyper aware of how many minutes I had. Two hour rants became ten minute updates because my parents were not gonna buy me more minutes until the beginning of the next month. So, I learned time management, and device responsibility, as if I wanted to talk to my dad in private without my mom chasing me around the house asking when I'd be done, I needed my phone. It also had sudoku on it, and you can bet the majority of my phone usage was spent on that. Guess who loves puzzles. All in all, devices and social media should absolutely not be banned. That would be completely counter productive. However, there needs to be a lesson beforehand, and if you don't trust your kid, then definitely don't let them get a phone or a Facebook until otherwise.",

If it weren't for that research, I would be stuck in the bandwagon that my parents forced on me. I'd be completely anti vax, believe just about every conspiracy, and hate a lot more people. I wouldn't have the social skills I have, and since I tend to prefer to be left alone, I wouldn't understand how to function in conversations with new people. But because of the internet and friends I made online, I know how to be polite and nice to talk to, and not completely awkward. I genuinely believe I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am today, I'd have much less friends, no way to keep in contact with any of them, and no escape from the stressful real world. I would more than likely be incredibly depressed and stressed to the point where I'm not sure I'd be alive, because people online helped me through any tough times. I'd be completely on my own, no friends, brainwashed into believing everything my parents tell me, and possibly dead.

The social media point itself I agree with, too. Youtube is entertainment, and arguments can be made for or against it, and some of the content on there is incredibly worrisome.

Here's what we've learned: Coming at this from a technology angle is arbitrary and fruitless. Keeping your kids safe online is about teaching them how internet safety works, how social media works, explaining how the \"things you cant unsee\" can and will affect them by telling them how it affected you, AND BY FAR MOST IMPORTANTLY treating your children with respect and fostering a relationship where they know they can trust you.",

I had lived in the States from the age 3 - 7, then my family had to relocate back to Iran but we kept visiting back and forth, and I finally settled here in 2016 at the age of 17. The place where I live at is predominantly white and not very diverse, yet the people have *always* been nothing but sweet to me.  Sure, if I tell em where I'm originally from I might get some awkward stares, but I *know* that doesn't give them a reason to treat me any different (btw, I know that not everywhere in America is like that and there's still a lotta xenophobic and intolerant places, but still...).

Its one of the worst drugs for you if you're not careful with it.  Alcohol advertising/usage in magazines and movies are everywhere. I'm currently trying to get out of the business.\n\nEdit: Forgive me, I didn't mean to imply I continued to serve these patrons; that's incredibly irresponsible.

            "It\u2019s more of an issue with how we view alcohol in America as a \u201cright of passage\u201d. The fact we restrict it until you are 21 shows this, and is ultimately the root cause of a lot of these problems. People usually grow up having no exposure to alcohol and they have no idea how to drink responsibly as a result. So when a teen finally gets to college or whenever they\u2019re able to drink freely they go overboard and have no self control because they haven\u2019t been taught anything and have no idea how to drink safely. I mean there\u2019s a reason binge drinking is at an insane level in YAs and as a consequence of that so is alcohol poisoning and the hospital admittance rate. I mean in my freshman year of college, you\u2019d have multiple ambulances taking people to the hospital throughout the night every time there was a party, and it\u2019s definitely not a party school.  \n\n\n\nThis seems to be only an American problem too unless I\u2019ve been lied to.  I\u2019ve heard from just about everyone that other countries that have alcohol heavily incorporated in their culture and introduced at younger ages such as Germany have much less problems with alcohol.   I guarantee things would be better if the drinking age was lowered, and people were taught from a younger age about how to drink responsibly. I mean the only positive thing they can come up with about the age limit is how the number of driving deaths with alcohol involved has dropped since the age limit was set in place, but it\u2019s such a misleading statistic. They fail to mention the fact that driving related fatalities have massively dropped in general, and that it doesn\u2019t differentiate between who was intoxicated to begin with, whether it was the driver, a passenger, or a pedestrian.",

            "I can't AGREE MORE!\n\nI never experienced a true alcoholic in my life until I was about 19-20 years old. My parents never drank besides the occasional after work beer my dad enjoyed from time to time but never would my siblings and I see them drunk what so ever. That was until I met my ex's father.\n\nAfter meeting his parents a couple times I had no idea what was really under the surface, but then I moved in with him after awhile.\nI started noticing how much his dad was drinking. It was day in and day out literally. I don't think I've ever seen him sober honestly. He would stay in his room in his computer chair slamming 7 & 7's one after another. His mom would get stressed out, angry, and depressed because of how he would talk to her. At first I could only hear fragments of conversations because she would usually keep the door shut when she would come in and out of the room. Most times she would be fighting back tears and when I would ask what's wrong she would make something up or just say he was tired. My ex would go outside talk with her in private and come back in.\n\nAs time went on things started getting worse and worse. I remember the first time the curtains were pulled away from this man and he could no longer hide the monster he was. It was about 4 in the morning and I just hear the loudest, deepest, satanic yell I've ever heard. My eyes shot wide open and I couldn't move. I didn't know what I just heard and my heart was pounding. I know it wasn't words that I heard it was just loud yelling or screaming like lucofer was yelling at God himself.\n\nI shook my ex awake telling him something was going on. Then I heard it all. He was screaming gibberish which didn't even sound like English. It sounded like he was casting a spell. Then yelling at his mom telling her how worthless she was, then started threatening her, then throwing shit. That's when my ex jumped out of bed and ran out to their living room. (which became a frequent weekly ritual after this night)\n\nHe would then threaten his son and tell him how worthless he was and keep repeating he wanted to take him outside and show him who the \"real man\" was. This would go on until the neighbors would call the cops usually. Once they would arrive, his mom would lie and say everything's fine and that it was the TV, or that it was a misunderstanding Yada Yada Yada. Then they would leave. Once things settled down it would usually be past 6 or 7am and all of us would be exhausted except his dad.\n\nIt got so bad one time I used my laptop pretending I was doing work on it and recorded everything on my Webcam to show the cops. I was sick of this guy not having any consequences or getting any help for that matter. I told my ex that if they weren't going to call the cops I would I'm sick of this mother fucker. Yet I was begged and pleaded with to just let it go.\n\nWhat made me so angry is that his dad lost job after job from showing up blasted to work from drinking all night and his mom would lie and say the company was downsizing and a lot of people got laid off and his dad was just on the unlucky list. On top of that his dad NEVER drove due to being inebriated 24/7, so he was literally unable to purchase his own liquor. But guess who always caved in and went to the store for him. His mother. I always asked WHY WHY WHY!? She would say she just wants to shut him up, or that he is threatening her. Apparently she would forget about the inevitable soon after that was much worse.\n\nEventually, after one of his mother's Co-workers (who was a nurse) had seen his dad after not seeing him in a couple years she pulled my ex's mom aside. She told her that the whites of his eyes were extremely yellow and that it was a sign of cerosis of the liver. She said he needed to see a doctor immediately. His mom never acted on that though. His father then had to go to the doctor for something else nearly a year later, I forget what it was now. Which all the things I stated above were happening ritualisticly still.\n\nHe told his liver was failing and he would need a transplant. Which of course he would never get due to being an alcoholic. It went rapid fire to him being in hospice waiting to die. My ex's mother was still feeding lies to him saying that he would make it through this and everything was going to be OK. This only furthered the damage to my ex and him never being able to process and except what happened to his father.\n\nShortly later we all gethered around his father, now looking like a withered skeleton (100lbs lighter from his normal weight) and watched him take his last breath. I've never lost anyone remotely close to me in my family let alone had to deal with someone I cared about losing someone important (to them) in their life.\n\nEverything caused so much damage we broke up. I couldn't coddle to his broken soul anymore and his denial of things. His anger and resentment was constantly projected on others. And for me it was so hard to try and act like I felt sorry or any type of mourning for that man. I literally hated him and couldn't care less that he was gone. He was a burden on everyone. I couldn't understand why my ex mourned him so much, I know it's his dad but it still didn't mean he wasn't the person I knew he was.\n\nAlcohol literally deteriorates your brain. This man literally was living the same day over and over stuck in the past reliving the day his own parents had passed. Spewing the same 5 memories he still had day after day. We'd listen and try to pretend it was the 1st time we heard these things trying to not show aggravation to set him off. It was literally the most tragic thing I've seen play out.\n\nI came to the conclusion his mom just kept shoveling those drinks to him in hopes he would die as a result. I know she just wanted to be free of him. I don't blame her. But I wish she was stronger of a person, because I don't think she will be able to get out of tough situation with her own will power.\n\nNow my mother is battling alcoholism or denying it constantly for the most part. Her and my father divorced years back. He remarried and she is still single with my 26 year old brother still living in her house. She's felt loneliness set in and the drinking spiraled. It's now causing her liver problems as well. I'm so terrified of seeing her deny herself into a casket like my ex's father did. She won't listen and gets defensive and angry when we talk to her about it. An alcoholic really cannot figure out how to stop without help. And I don't know how to help without getting angry and mean to show her how real things can get. I don't know what can change it if these health scares don't even make her bat an eye.\n\nI pray things will improve though...\nAll I can say is\nDON'T DRINK TO NUMB ANYTHING or IMPROVE what you think you cannot. It turns into a crutch that becomes a part of you..\n\nSorry for long post",

People love to claim that they will support friends and family members through their mental illness, but as soon as they exhibit a symptom, it\u2019s blaming and abandonment. Here\u2019s an example I\u2019ve seen: your parent claims to be supportive when you get diagnosed with depression, says they are there for you, you fall into a depressive episode and stay in bed all day, suddenly you\u2019re just lazy, ungrateful, and unmotivated. When you tell them your depressed, you get met with eye rolls and sighs. This is extremely common. You go into a relationship and the other person knows you have a panic disorder. One day, you\u2019re having an episode and snap at them while in an agitated state, and it leads to them complaining about how that was uncalled for and you\u2019re just being a moody bitch. No, I\u2019m not saying anyone is obligated to be supportive or be your therapist, but do not pretend to be supportive towards someone with a mental illness when you will jump ship at the first symptomatic occurrence. Don\u2019t claim to support friends/family members with mental illnesses, and then get mad at them when they show symptoms and make them feel even worse.

            "As someone with PTSD and going through therapy currently to learn coping mechanisms and relearn behaviours, I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. \n\nPeople only seem to see the symptoms themselves as the PTSD, they forget that like any other mental health issue it is a daily headfuck to handle. I have stuff written down - mantras, approaches/responses to triggering scenarios, a narrative visualisation of events with relevant counterpoints, and, daily exercises to help me mentally process so that I am able to handle this thing and also not display symptoms. It is something I have to manage on a daily basis, sometimes hourly, and when it is going well and I am handling it then you wouldn't know there was anything wrong. Yay therapy. \n\nPeople do not realise that when I display symptoms it is that my coping mechanisms have failed, or something has triggered me, or it's just fucking PTSD and it's a bitch. Either way, the only way I am physically/emotionally/intellectually able to respond is to display symptoms. I don't mean to do it, I don't enjoy doing it and am painfully aware of the damage I cause to myself and to my relationships.\n\nI don't have insomnia or get angry (or any of the other shitty symptoms) just when PTSD is 'happening', nor do I have those things *just because* I have PTSD. \n\n- No - \n\nEvents happened in my life (tour of Afghanistan, 2011) that have changed things in my head for which I now need to learn and relearn thought patterns and behaviours. Outward symptoms are a clear and physical sign that I am struggling to cope and it is then when I need the support. \n\nI wish people would understand this. However, and unfortunately, I have found that people only respond to the symptoms themselves, taking it as personal offence and have little to no understanding of the context of why it is happening, as I (hopefully) explained above. To be honest, that's when I feel so completely alone and unsupported.\n\nSorry if this has hijacked your post but I feel strongly about this and this is the first time I have had a chance to actually try and respond or talk to someone about what it's like with PTSD; I wonder if it is the same for things like depression.",
            "OP I feel you. I just graduated undergrad, and I was getting so frustrated with the MI awareness campus advocates. There was this woman I knew who ended up getting a ton of awards for their advocacy and activism, ran a MI awareness instagram page, and was nonstop preaching tolerance and acceptance of all people. She lived in an apartment with 3 other women (all uni students in the same sorority), one of which had bpd. She and the two other roommates pretended that they were all okay up until the time came to resign the lease for a second year, and they refused to let the bpd roommate sign because she was \"too difficult to deal with,\" and she was shit out of luck without a place to live less than a before the semester started. She ended up living in my place cause she was dating my roommate at the time.\n\nYeah mental illness is wicked difficult to deal with. But it's disgustingly hypocritical to preach that the biggest issue facing MI people is other people's intolerance, while still acting as intolerant as anyone else.",
            "One of the problems is that mental illness is so inaccurately portrayed in cinema, books, and the media that people don't understand what things like depression, PTSD, or schizophrenia even look like.  Depression isn't walking around just being sad all the time, and showing signs of happiness or laughing doesn't mean you're \"cured\".  Additionally, there's no cure.  There's management of it.  It doesn't go away like the flu or pneumonia.  Antidepressant commercials would have you believe that you just pop a pill and depression magically evaporates.",

It felt as if I was in a field full of land mines and I had to be careful threading through it. It made me anxious and paranoid to the point that my own mental health was affected. I suggested that he talk to a professional because I really did not know how to deal with it. I also told him that if he could not go alone, I would go with him, but I was flat out refused and blocked from his social media. This happened a few years ago and to this date, I do not know what would have been the best course of action. I do not hold it against him because I know that he was not in the best place but it makes me wonder what I could have done better.\n \nI don't disagree with you, OP, some people really are like that, but I also think that there is a limit to what we can do to help, especially if the other person refuses professional help.",

            "I think this is more of a fact than an opinion. Biggest contributor of this, IMO, is that people are terrible predictors of how they'll act in a certain situation. They say \"Oh, if a school shooter comes in I'll barricade the door, I'll jump on him\", etc. Well, you try being in a situation where someone is actually shooting at you and that goes straight out the window. Same exact thing for mental illness. You can say \"I'll stay, I'll be supportive, I'd be patient,\" and everything like that, but when you're getting beat up by your psychotic friend/spouse/family member, or you have to simultaneously work full-time and do the chores/errands and take care of the kids for years by yourself because your SO is non-functional, then things change.\n\nI don't support people leaving their SO or abandoning family/friends due to mental illness, but I have to say that there are many cases where it's hard to hold it against someone. Oftentimes, you can't try to fix other people all the time, and you have to do what's best for yourself and, most of all, your family/kids. Especially if someone makes the active choice to not attend therapy, not take their medication, or get back on drugs.",

I will say that most people who claim they support mental illness are not prepared to handle taking care of someone suffering from mental illness, hence the reaction you see/experience. However, this does not mean they're being hypocritical, but rather they don't know how to react when the situation . arises.

            "Gfd, this is so true. I was always the odd one in my family. First born, two younger brothers, the youngest having ADHD that my parents spoiled and catered to his every whim and excused his behavior for his \"mental condition\".\n\nI finally get diagnosed with bi polar II and I think wow, okay that explains a lot, maybe my parents won't be so hard on me now.\n\nNope.\n\nIt actually got worse, to the point where my mother, whom I specifically told to NOT tell my father about my recent episode and how I felt because I KNEW he would get upset and attack me over it verbally, as was his typical MO, did the EXACT thing I requested her to not do. \n\nThat in turned lead to my \"father\" calling me a lazy piece of shit that didnt care about the family and that he hopes to God that he never meets grandkids from me because he cant even imagine how fucked up they'll  be because of me and my \"made up\" mental health condition. That I had victim mentality and that my \"depression\" doesn't need medicine, that I  just need to grow the fuck up and \"switch it off\". \n\nIt lead to my father AND brother assaulting me during the time I watched my fathers house. (my father is a truck driver and was never home, so the agreement was for me to watch the house while he was away, which was a pretty sweet deal so I could finish my degree. However, my youngest brother lived there as well and he never assisted with the bills or housework. Every attempt to discuss the situation with my father was met with, well you're the older sibling and are supposed to take care of him anyways). While we had one of the many disagreements about my younger brother not helping, he decided me wanting to leave to clear my head was \"disrespectful\"  to him and shoved me back into the house pretty damn hard by my throat. It hurt to swallow for a day afterwards.\n\n34 years.\n\nIt took me 34 years to realize how fucking narcissistic and cruel and downright dysfunctional my family was and how horribly they treated me. Preaching that I should be a strong independent woman, but also chastising me for not wanting to take care of my 25 year old brother, that I had a good enough job that my brother didnt have to pay. I ran away from them once to join the military when I was younger and after leaving and being on my own for a few years thought I was just young and ungrateful and should give them another shot. Worst decision ever.\n\nThe betrayal of trust from my own mother, my father shoving me back into my room  by my throat as I tried to get away from him, my youngest brother breaking my Razer headphones, pulling my hair and slamming me against the wall, all while being told I'm the worthless, ungrateful, lazy one in the family..jfc, I'm tearing up remembering it all.\n\nFuck people like my family. The claim to be \"progressives\" and supportive of people with mental illnesses yet that is how they treated their oldest daughter, which has one. I fucking wish I didn't. I hate it so much. It fucking sucks, it hurts, everyday, every god damn day is a struggle with my emotions. I hate it and feel  broken, less than human even because of it.\n\nI eventually left the state to get away from them before coronavirus became a thing. I honestly hope they think I've died because I will never, ever, ever reach out to them. They are all dead to me and since I've left them I've been doing a lot better, but all the years of abuse has taken its toll. I feel sorry for my therapist..\n\nI'd rather someone tell me oh you're bi polar, you must be fucking crazy, and want nothing to do with me right from the get go rather than someone lie about being supportive of me and my condition.

            "As I\u2019ve told family and friends I will help you and support you but I am not a mental health professional so I may not be at all capable of making you feel better or get you out of an episode, but if you need me I will certainly be there as a friend and confidant and bringer of Ben and Jerrys.",
            "I agree with this to a point. So many people say they support and understand until you\u2019re sitting on the ground sobbing uncontrollably which is followed by three weeks of severe depressive behavior during which you can\u2019t stop crying or get out of bed. They love you at your manic, energetic, positive points where you light up every room you\u2019re in and then they remember why they love you. But while you\u2019re under the covers in your bed unable to even muster the energy to shower for days on end, it\u2019s not \u201cwhat they signed up for.\u201d \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been on both sides of this coin. I\u2019ve been the manic and the depressed. I\u2019ve been the anxious and panicked. But I\u2019ve also been the wife who begged for a husband to get the help he needed. I\u2019ve been the girlfriend who swore to stand by him, no matter what. I\u2019ve been the partner and best friend who backed him up and was held in highest regard during his manic phases as well as verbally abused and degraded by him during his depressive phases. \n\nI have been around the circle in this situation and I can tell you that from the outsiders point of view, when you know someone needs help and they blatantly refuse to get it, you can\u2019t just stand by someone and make excuses for them. If they recognize the issue and are willing to do the work, that\u2019s when you stand by them and hold them up and take their hand and support them. Conversely, when they know there is an issue and refuse to talk about the problem, refuse to acknowledge a problem or are unable to be accountable or responsible for their own behavior or actions, it is not the responsibility of anyone else to maintain their position in that situation. \n\nI understand what OP is saying however, it\u2019s more than a black and white situation. If you want someone to stick to their word and support you, that means supporting you, not holding you up on their own while you refuse to try to stand. \n\nYes, mental illness is hard.  But so is loving someone through it. And sometimes the mentally ill person isn\u2019t ready to be loved through it. In that case, it is nobody\u2019s responsibility but the mentally ill person\u2019s to do anything.  \n\nI suffer from anxiety, depression (which have been there my Whole life) and PTSD since the suicide of my husband who was bi-polar II. I go through manic and depressive phases that are intense and it\u2019s a sh*t show at times. It has been four and a half years since my husband died and I haven\u2019t entertained the idea of another relationship because there are days I can\u2019t handle myself. How can I expect anyone else to handle me if I haven\u2019t even gotten a handle on that?  I can\u2019t fault anyone for deciding it\u2019s too much. Until I can handle myself with ease, I can\u2019t expect anyone else to either. We can\u2019t fix each other. We can only work on fixing ourselves. The rest will hopefully follow. But you HAVE GOT to do the work. Do the work.",
            "I think it\u2019s a lack of understanding. We\u2019re all told how important mental health is and shit and you hear that and without understanding what that truly means, you\u2019re like, \u201cyeah I\u2019m supportive.\u201d \nBut as soon as it\u2019s physically manifested, you don\u2019t make the connection and attribute it to laziness and other similar excuses. \n\nI believe it\u2019s also an issue of *enabling*. It\u2019s hard to find a correct balance, because enabling behavior that exacerbates mental illness is just as dangerous as not being supportive. There isn\u2019t really a standard on the line drawn between being supportive and enabling detrimental behavior. Often, mental illness - especially depression and anxiety, but even sometimes also schizophrenia and bipolar disorder - is an issue that is really only self-cured. Cured through behavioral changes, mindset changes, and dietary changes. The hardest part is the vicious cycle that mental illness exists as - you have no motivation because you\u2019re depressed because you have no motivation because your depressed... because you have no motivation... \n\nIt\u2019s good to be supportive and especially to find the right things to say to those suffering, because *man*, does that make a difference. But not enabling their behaviors that only exacerbate the issue is just an important. I think we\u2019re at a time where there\u2019s just not enough knowledge to go off of to know empirically how to balance it, especially because every case/person is different. \n\nThese kinds of conversations are good though, I\u2019m glad you brought this up.",

So in the past if you were moody or stressed because you lived in a shitty environment, a doctor would diagnose your symptoms as a mental illness and prescribe drugs rather than advise you to change your environment. Case in point, most doctors tend to only want to hear your symptoms, not your home life or work situation, when the latter has very relevant bearing on your mental health.

            "As the spouse of someone with dep2I think that people with mental illness do have to keep somw things in mind.\n\n1) It's easy for you to lose track of how long your episode has lasted.  My husband can be in a withdrawn,  cold, negative state for a month and literally think it has only been a few days.  And from his perspective I seem impatient with him.  But what he cannot see is me going weeks and weeks of carrying the full load of household duties, child care, and being his supposrt without a bit of support myself until I am way passed burnt out.  And for me every day of that time has been a prolonged endurance test.  But for him he has no idea he has been down so long.\n\n2) It's sometimes hard for a depressed person to realize how negative they are being.  And when your verbally negative about everything around you than it can chip away at the soul of the person who is trying to carry the household.  An example.  I get home from work throw a load of laundry in the wash, pick up the house, take care of the pets, make dinner blah blah blah.  Depressed spouse comes home hardly verbal and doesn't speak except to bitch that the house stinks (even though it doesn't), complain about dinner, and get frustrated that they can't find their favorite shirt and I feel attacked because I made dinner and have been keeping track of the laundry and clothes and tried to keep the house up while working.\n\n3) It's really difficult for a depressed person to face the emotional damage they may have done to their partner during and episode and support their partner when they are feeling better.  And this one is tough because it's hard to give of yourself when your battling depression, and so it seems like a lot to have to offer some kind of aftercare for your partner when you've come back up from a dark period.  But it can be hard for your partner to easily shrug off hurt feelings an emotional exhaustion after supporting you through a long period of turmoil.\n\nBottom line, if your depressed your partner has to be willing to be there through the tough times.

            "You wanna know how I knew I found a good one in my best friend?\n\nWe met in 2014 after I'd changed schools for sixth form (age 16-18 in the UK). I told her shortly after meeting about experiences I'd had with people ditching me, turning on me when I thought they liked me numerous times - how it's led to me having serious trust issues. My first birthday after we met she gave me a leather bracelet with an infinity symbol on it, you can probably guess the meaning. Told me \"I know you said you've had issues with people leaving you, it's just to say I'm not going anywhere\". I'd never worn jewellery before then but I wore that thing until it was practically falling apart. I still have it in a lockbox I'm wearing its replacement right now as I'm writing this. This isn't quite the main thing though, this has nothing to do with me showing serious symptoms.\n\nMy depression started getting much, much worse around 2017/2018, after I'd suppressed it for about 4 years. Eventually led to a breakdown in front of said best friend outside a pub around Christmas of 2018. I still have trouble voicing my issues in general so I had to write some stuff down on my phone and hand it to her to read. I spilled all I could about how I was feeling and while she didn't know exactly what to say, she just held me through it all. It was incredibly embarrassing to be crying outside a pub but she sat there with me until I was ready to go back inside. Said nothing of it to anyone, just physically assured me that she loved me and was there for me. \n\nShe was the one who pushed me to finally go to the doctor, get medication and refer myself to therapy. I've been up and down on both of those for numerous reasons but I wouldn't have even started if it wasn't for her.\n\nShe's been totally unwavering in her support and I don't know how she does it. My brain still sends me into horrid anxious thought cycles about her \"leaving like all the others\", but everytime she continues to reassure me of the opposite, even when I unintentionally act out when I convince myself that everyone hates me.\n\nOn the opposite end, my parents were never even remotely supportive of it when I told them about my concerns at 15. For ages I would go through long spells where I'd struggle to get out of bed and make it through the day, gradually losing interest in almost all of my hobbies, but when I told my dad I was worried I might've been depressed he basically scolded me and said I was just \"fed up because I didn't talk to anyone\".

Hell, even on this sub you'll see it every day. \n\nAnd i want to draw attention to that last part, because i see it *way too much* **and these people clearly don't understand how shit works**\n\nDo they think I *chose* to have involuntary panic attacks that make me seize up so hard my ribs feel like they're crushing my lungs and I can't think at all? How about the constant nightmares and insomia? The lingering thoughts of shit I'd cut out my eyes and ears to forget? Do they think I *chose* to be so fundamentally different down to my very core that i could rarely, if ever, relate to people i meet? *I can't even relate to most people's basic fucking instincts, i have no urge to eat/drink, no social drive, no drive to function because I don't feel a need to even exist;* **why the hell would i choose that of all things if given the choice?! Death would've been a preferable alternative to the almost absolute isolation, where I genuinely don't relate to most people and as such can't form meaningful connections with humanity at large, which in turn kills all my motivation and social energy, which leads to a vicous cycle of me never getting along with most people which is further added to by my utter lack of social development. At this time, that experience was most, like 3/4, of my life** But I'm and was apparently just \"choosing not to fix it\" despite the fact I've tried every treatment available with no results. Because my conditions don't have magic cures, it's not some head cold or a bacterial infection, my entire brain is fucked and that can only over maby years, if ever, change. I mean, i got better by a remarkable degree, I'm able to \"relate\" to people more, I no longer think about dying a lot, I'm more capable of distancing myself from my unwanted thoughts and emotions, and I even have more motivation now than i did say, five years ago. \n\nI didn't choose any of it, i got fucking stuck with it and told that i shouldn't kill myself (when i was a teen, i thought it was the more reasonable answer) because I'd hurt people, but then every waking moment I'm even the mildest bit negative I'm suddenly an awful person everyone hates, so am i being selfish by saying logically my existence is only pain, or are they being selfish asking me to stay alive? \n\nShit, i have long passed the suicidal ideation phase and don't entertain that idea anymore, *but they ask me to live then chastise me for having my condition they asked me to live through!*\n\nLuckily enough I'm on my feet enough to scrape by and keep myself in a generally happy place though.

            "And that's on lack of knowledge.\n\nI wish it was mandatory for schools to educate us on mental health issues. There are so many misconceptions and stigmas surrounding the topic, especially, taking into account that our number one source of awareness on it is the media, which obviously is not accurate... \n\nSo, unless we are actively seeking out information we will only have somebody else's preception of these issues imprinted in our brains. Schools should have compulsory classes that provide at least general information on mental health issues. I know for a fact that most schools don't. \n\nSomeone in my class a few years ago (Year 8 or 9) answered the full form of 'OCD' as 'Over Cleaning Disorder'.... Let that sink in.",
            "For little over two years now, I have been struggling with debilitating mental health. Prior to the onset, I had never experienced depression or general anxiety that needed treatment. My parents always gave me high praise for my willingness to be independent and driven. They claim, even still, that \u201cwe never parented ArchyRS because we didn\u2019t have to\u201d... When my ability to self-regulate deteriorated, however, they were quick to emphasize their desire to be by my side on my mental health journey.\n\nThe truth is that my experience of being supported by family members exposed me to medical professionals that exacerbated the situation. My first psychiatrist had a good reputation, but he mostly dealt with acute mental illnesses. Naturally, he pushed an ever-changing regiment of pills to treat a never specified diagnosis. With 20/20 hindsight, we now realize that I spent a year describing various mental health symptoms that were literally side effects of drugs that I was given. The next psychiatrist I selected had a stellar reputation. I personally chose him because he was known to not push pills like the other psychiatrist. The main issue I confronted with this psychiatrist though was his absolute unwillingness to prescribe me my original dosage of a medication I have taken for a decade. Instead, he lowered the dosage and added a different medication to serve the purpose of my previous dosage. \n\nFast forward to this past month where I enrolled in an outpatient program. Within the first two week, my medication regime was reverted to what I took before my mental health crisis. The psychiatrist there listened to me and genuinely got my buy-in with medication. No longer experiencing side effects from the medications he instructed me to stop taking, I had an epic realization. The decline of my mental health was not due to some physical/biochemical imbalance. It was due to my mental decline, a state that was brought about in the first place by unnecessary prescriptions! The program has not only taught me incredibly useful coping skills, but connected me with a genuinely invested team. I am in a much better place.\n\nMy point in sharing my own experience is to show that mental illness can be exacerbated by medical professionals. The very same professionals, who your own support group,  encouraged you to seek out. In a real sense, their support can cause real damage to your mental health if you end up with shitty healthcare workers. \n\nEnd.",
            "IMO, the social climate has never been more duplicitous and hostile toward the mentally ill as it is today. On one hand, you have everyone flying their virtue signalling \"look at me, #icare\" hashtags. On the other hand, the media has absolutely thrown the mentally ill under the bus with their ultra-sensationalist angle of \"anyone who has depression is a ticking timebomb and your next potential school shooter\" which the public seems to lap up with a spoon. You almost have to wonder who the mentally ill really are. Anyone who wonders why people don't ask for help really has major cognitive impairment.",
            "I would go so far as to say most people aren't supportive of people with mental illness, full stop. I think the problem is people aren't educated on how to be a friend to people with mental illness they're just told to distance themselves so they don't get caught up in it.",

            "The thing is, in physical illnesses, people including yourself can clearly see the symptoms. For example, a broken bone is a broken bone, the people around you can see the fracture, you can see it and you know it sucks so you don\u2019t even consider the option of refusing treatment because why would you.\nIn many mental illnesses, the illness makes you believe you aren\u2019t actually ill. As if the bone was never broken, and everyone else is either delusional for believing it is broken or deliberately lying to you. And you might then even try to convince the others that the bone isn\u2019t broken or that it has already healed.\nWith other disorders like depression, you know the bone is broken and how badly it hurts, but the others can\u2019t see the fracture at all and can\u2019t feel your pain. And if they can\u2019t see it, who is to say the bone really is broken? \nThis, of course, doesn\u2019t excuse any behavior towards mentally ill people, but I feel like it contributes to their thought process when they evaluate the situation.",

That is why i think the sponsor system of AA(or a similar system in any other support group) is brilliant.

First, I was dismissed with depression at 16 and have struggled with it over half my life now. In 2013 I started a paranormal investigation team. We became close as family. After about 5 years or so, we didn't have alot going on and my friend mentioned that i didn't seem to be interested in stuff. I confided in her that I was really struggling with my depression for awhile. I had just quit my job which was very traumatic in itself. I apologized and asked that they please just bear with me. She hugged me and assured me. After that they began meeting behind my back and not keeping he in the loop about things. And when confronted, she said that they knew all my excuses. I was floored to say the least. That I confided in her and she threw it all back in my face. It hurt, too. It also made me realized that she's probably not the only person you think that. It sucks.

            "I didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d need to see this post today. I (28F) have struggled with mental illness over half of my life. My bf (27M) of 12 years has been very supportive through all of it. Truthfully, I\u2019m still waiting to find my correct diagnosis. The wording doesn\u2019t matter to me at all, but it would be nice to have a name for it. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with depression/anxiety, later psychotic depression, later BPD II, and now in the category of C-PTSD. I\u2019ve been regularly medicated since I was about 16, but never regularly had therapy. I would always stop going for years at a time, hence a lot of the re-diagnosis\u2019.  \n\nI\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to have someone like my bf in my life. He\u2019s always been very understanding and supportive of my symptoms. He\u2019s always been able to look past the situation and understand there\u2019s more to it (my anger, panic, breakdown, whatever). Not that it excuses my behavior, I don\u2019t think it does, I regret so many of my actions/words/responses from when I was responding from a place of panic. If it weren\u2019t for his responses to mine though, I don\u2019t know that I would have gotten to a place where I realized I wasn\u2019t myself anymore and hadn\u2019t been for years. The last time I remember authentically being myself proudly was like, 6th grade. \n\nMy parents and I never had great relationships. Like everyone, they have their flaws. I believe they both have untreated mental illness. My family dynamic was very stressful to me from a very young age and continued to be through college, until I moved to LA when my bf got a job at a big Youtube Channel. \n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, my parents wanted to be understanding. Started me up in therapy, didn\u2019t want me to feel ashamed of medication, etc. However, it was during HS and college that the \u2018understanding\u2019 felt like it was no longer there, or at least up to the level I needed it to be. I was still expected to be high performing in school, highly regarded in our community, uphold our family perception, etc. Sleeping in was frowned upon, all the usual. \n\nAfter about 3 years of living in Los Angeles, gaining independence, I realize that their reactions to my symptoms, like excessive fatigue, social withdrawing, etc., were because of their own unresolved trauma. \n\nMy mom was diagnosed with GAD when I was a toddler, but does not take medication or partake in therapy, never has. I learned that when I was first diagnosed with my mental illness. My dad has explosive anger/aggression problems, a little Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde situation. I think he has Borderline Personality Disorder, but he will never seek therapy or take medication. To him, he doesn\u2019t have any mental illness. \n\nThey couldn\u2019t appropriately respond to my symptoms, because they couldn\u2019t recognize theirs.  Mental illness goes untreated, undiagnosed, unknown, in American culture because of lack of awareness and stigma. So many people have problems with simple communication. Talking about feelings, or powerful emotions like trauma, is so out of their realm of recognition. If the feelings cannot be easily recognized and expressed, they don\u2019t know how to process it. It gets stored away until you have the emotional knowledge to understand it and make with it what you will. \n\nThis all being a very long winded way to say that, all people are very complex and we can\u2019t always take a surface reaction to a situation at face value. On a conscious level, people who seem to abandon those when symptoms surface, might not realize what they\u2019re doing. They may be too buried by their own distorted reality.  Just like I didn\u2019t excuse my behavior, this isn\u2019t an excuse for them either, I see it as more of an unfortunate shortcoming of American culture and education systems. \n\nAs for friends who seem to abandon, Ive never had a consistent friend for more than a couple years, so I understand the frustration. I\u2019ve \u2018drifted away\u2019 from every friend I\u2019ve ever had. I would socially withdraw and everyone else would just keep on going. Again, I think it\u2019s hard for people to recognize symptoms, because of terrible communication habits, and lack of true awareness of mental illness. But this is solely my opinion and do not mean to invalidate any emotions of abandonment because those are valid. \n\nIt\u2019s a constant miscommunication between those with mental illness and those without, and sometimes those with mental illness if they are not treated properly. I believe the true root of the problem is a lack of emotion awareness and eduction on communication at a young age in schools. Early child development is so important and unless we can make sure parents are emotionally ready to have children, we need to make sure that kids are being taught to recognize emotions, how to process them, how to be empathetic, and understanding. \n\nAgain, all my opinion. Please don\u2019t tear me to shredz.",

I don\u2019t let many people into my life but I\u2019d like to think that I would hide a body with anyone I do let close. My mom was an abusive drunk until I was in high school and there were no siblings, no dad around. It was shit and she was shit, but she stopped drinking and know she is a sweet old lady. People go through shit and it makes them shitty but we all go through shit at some point. I hate to say it but if you can\u2019t handle someone, someone you are close with, at their worst, then you really don\u2019t deserve them at their best. And not as a shield for abusive behavior or anything, not that kind of worst, but like mentally or  maybe when they are busy with life and can\u2019t be the best friends, then you don\u2019t deserve them to be there for you.",
            "I've got to agree with you on this one.  I myself thought I was supportive of friends and acquaintances until they were in an episode and very much acting like a different person.  They were bothering everyone around them and my instinct wasn't to help, it was to pull away.  After experiencing this a few times I feel I have a better understanding of what it means to be supportive.",
            "Yep. And then on top of that, only up to a certain amount of symptoms. Then the person is too crazy and weird.",
            "I, sadly, experienced this first-hand. People virtue signal to make them feel good about themselves but when the time comes when they're actually needed, they're against you, being angry at you for not being \"ok\". My family, friends abandoned me when I was on the brink of ending it all. I faced it all alone.\n\nNow that I'm getting better, everyone is suddenly nice to me again.",
            "Thats basically how it is. You get a few good eggs, but everyone is limited as to their ability to cope. I find I'm too fucked up for most people, and i acknowledge that for the most part and with the majority of people, I'm on my own",
            "AMEN, my family member often has episodes until I educated myself and found he needed professional help not me being mad because he was rude or irresponsible. It has helped with my own stress and depression once I learned it was not my behaviors. It takes a lot of work but when you love someone you\u2019ll put the work in and sleep a lot better.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc75\ud83c\udffb",
            "I would argue that people just don't realize how difficult it is to deal with mental health issues in a good way and don't recognize or cope with the problems when they surface.\n\nPeople need to be more aware of the fact that most of us really can't handle someone with a mental illness. I don't blame someone for not being able to cope with a SO or child or friend that has a mental illness. However, they should fully understand that they can only offer so much and that it will undoubtedly be mentally draining to deal with and work with professionals to understand how to go about things.\n\nI wouldn't put the blame on other people completely, and I wouldn't expect someone to fully understand. They simply don't know what they are getting into most of the time.",
            "There is a nuance here: people with mental illness may not be able to always be supportive of other people with mental illness. My sister and I both have depression and she has an ED. We were very close when we were younger. However, for her to stay mentally healthy now, her first priority has to be keeping her life as calm and predictable as possible. This means that when I\u2019m having a hard time, I cannot rely on her to be there for me. It\u2019s too triggering for her. I\u2019ve learned not to go to her for help anymore because she will say she\u2019s so sorry, but she can\u2019t. And I believe her, even though it hurts a lot to have my need for support be rejected. \n\nShe\u2019s being selfish for her health, not because she\u2019s a flaky hypocrite. \n\nI have another friend who is coping with a lot of trauma and it\u2019s the same with her. I can\u2019t put the fullness of my needs on her, because she needs to be able to get through her day too.",
            "I\u2019ve also experienced this with invisible disabilities. I have autism and sensory processing disorder and while my family is supportive of me in theory I do feel like a burden whenever I can\u2019t hide my symptoms from them. On days where I\u2019m super overwhelmed by sounds and have to put my headphones in they act like I don\u2019t want to talk to them even though I\u2019ve tried explaining that in that state sound feels like physical pain. When I admit that I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening in a situation socially my mom acts like I\u2019m joking or tells me I\u2019m \u201cletting autism limit me\u201d. I just want them to understand that I\u2019ve always been limited by this, I just didn\u2019t have a name for it or a way to identify what I\u2019m feeling. Even though there are days where I function relatively well, they\u2019re definitely not the norm and my bad days will probably always be bad no matter how hard I try to not let it affect me.",
            "I think the main issue is just how much of a Sisyphean task it seems. No matter how much you help them, it\u2019ll go away the moment the next attack or episode comes. They won\u2019t be the person you know they are and no matter how much you help them through it it\u2019ll just come back again. It feels like fighting against a current, and when this current might be saying or doing things that would make you spit on someone without that illness, it really does become incredibly hard to want to be around them without your own mental health coming under fire.",
            "This. When I start showing symptoms my sister immediately asks if I\u2019m taking my meds, she cares if I\u2019m doing well and she genuinely tries to help. With anyone else in my family I\u2019d probably get called crazy. Please care for people with mental illness when you say you will, we\u2019ve had enough heartbreak.",
            "People may start of believing that they want to support the person suffering from mental illness, but quikcly finding themselves overwhelmed. It is not an easy task. \n\nLiving with someone with these kind of issues takes a toll on you. It is, often times, like living with a total asshole and having to convince yourself each day that it is not really their fault. \n\nI might get a lot of fire for this. But hey, I wanted to point out one of the perspectives.",
            "As someone with diagnosed depression and anxiety, I mostly agree with your sentiment OP.\n\nHowever, I do NOT believe that having a mental illness is an excuse or \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card to verbally, emotionally, or physically abuse those who are trying to support you. The quickest way to lose the support of a close loved one is to continuously abuse them and then blame them when they hold you accountable for your actions/behaviors. Mental illness (by and large, with some  rare exceptions) is no excuse to continually mistreat or abuse those who are in your corner. I think this is the flip side to your sentiment.",
            "Yep",
            "I had to break up with person who had a mental illness because he almost forced me to attempt solving all of his issues. It was too tiring for me, and I still feel like shit about it as I promised to never give up on him.",
            "I had a friend with depression and anxiety whose symptoms I endured beside her. I'm talking negative attitude and putting me down and crying and staying silent, all really hard for her and me but since we were bff of 7 years I didn't once think to quit. \nHowever, sometimes people with mental illness rely on you as not support but saviour and don't put enough work and/or time on their own because they don't realise they need to be their own saviour. Also, they tend to put all emotional burden on you at that moment cause they can't handle it themselves so you end up with extra baggage thats humanly impossible to handle with your own stress and issues.\nI'm not trying to paint it black for mental illness people, I just want to show the perspective from the other side of the story.",
            "Dealing with mental illnesses isn\u2019t for everyone. I for one work in a mental hospital. Shit is crazy and not something most people would want to subject themselves to. Showing support for the mentally ill and working with the mentally ill are two completely different things. Most people aren\u2019t built to handle crazy situations with grace.",
            "To be clear I don\u2019t speak for everyone in my experience, but I feel like people that has had history of mental illness, that comes into contact with another individual whom also happens to experience synonymous symptoms tends to have the ethics and first hand experience in handling of their episodes and/or trauma. \n\nAlthough this may not apply to everyone but the way that I\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019m currently suffering from bi-polar 2 and whenever I\u2019ve had depressive episodes for days on ends, the \u201cfriends\u201d that had been advocating for openness and acceptance in my MI has not been bothered to do what they advocated to do which frustrates me because it sends mix signals which leaves me at a dilemma at times: 1) Isolate in confinement and deal with it until my episodes die down, 2) Act in a passive aggressive manner\u2014sometimes impulsive hostile behavior. Oftentimes, a few of my friends that has gone through something, would understand my behaviors and what drives my trigger points off its hinges. But on the other hand when I do try to open to the other half of my friends who do advocate for MI ends up becoming frustrated with me and eventually distance themselves.",
            "Not being able to get help for a mental illness due to uncertainity, discomfort and even social stigma is actually part of your battle with a mental illness. OP's totally right.\n\nSo sad to see so many people in the comments indirectly justifying not giving a shit in paragraph long responses. The same people who'd whine and complain about simpler things done to themselves.\n\nIf your tolerance of somebody's mental illness is based on how quickly that person seeks help then you didn't really care about that person in the first place.",
            "My parents get disappointed in me when I'm honest about my ability to care for a person who would be higher-than-normal maintenance as a result of illness: \nI am not the person who will completely sacrifice themselves to try and help others.  \nMy father has dementia.  If my mother dies before him, he is going into a home.  I cannot look after him, both because I work 6 days a week and am away from home long hours, and also because I am not emtionally and psychologically geared-up to do so.  I probably am suffering empathy burn-out from my work which makes it worse, but if you have mental illness, I'm not the person to turn to for empathic support.  Especially not if your mental state makes you behave like an asshole.  I would rather be honest with people about that, than promise something I cannot keep.",
            "Either that or they say you're faking it until you exhibit symptoms",
            "I\u2019m probably the opposite of that, supporting people with their mental illness to a stupid degree sometimes. I\u2019ve stopped counting how many times this has backfired on me and I still try everything to be there for the people that want me in their live and want help, but I\u2019ve learned to see the point where me helping is just enabling and where it leads me to go downhill with someone instead if helping them get up that hill. So the point of this is basically what others have said, just with a little add on, try to understand what people you want to support are going through and try to rationalize what might happen due to it, but if you\u2019re anything like me, please also try to see at what point you\u2019re hurting yourself and the other more than helping by being supportive and understanding. Sometimes you leaving with a clear message and a door back into your life will be the most important and only sensible thing to do.",
            "Great now I\u2019m sad thx redit",
            "Wow I feel this one.",
            "Ive seen the same people post long tirades on Facebook about how we need to treat people with mental illnesses like anxiety more compassionately and get angry that people don't try to understand the reasons for their illnesses, then, later that day, post long accusatory rants about people doing things that common sense would deem as subconscious, but they treat those people as if they do it on purpose.",
            "I agree with you, but I also believe it's a hard thing to navigate at the best of times. I  think we all could do with more compassion and understanding, because people with mental health issues need that unconditional love sometimes - I know I have. But I've also cut out a few friends in my life because they used their mental health to continually justify the toxic things they did. It's important to support your loved ones, but not to the point of damaging yourself.",
            "Eugenics to the rescue!!",
            "Couldn\u2019t agree more, people agree with so many things in theory. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to cognitive dissonance, but it seems that way. Plus, I don\u2019t see much empathy in most people. Not the attempt, but a true accomplishment to step out of oneself to understand the other person\u2019s experiences, behaviors, etc.",
            "This might be hard to hear, but the reality is that most people shouldn't be supportive about your mental illness, and it's not their responsibility to care. \n\nPlaces like Reddit, and the hand holding circle jerk that revolves through most of the subs, have romanticized the idea of having a mental illness.  They play it off like it makes you deep or more emotionally in touch than others.  They treat it like they're about to write their next big novel on how they've \"struggled so hard\" and are almost there.  The everyone upvotes them, calls them heroic, all their Facebook friends pat them on the back, and they tell them good job and how proud they are.\n\nThe sad reality is that most of these people are just attention seeking and are using their mental illness as some romanticized trope about themselves.  Then when they actual exhibit symptoms they often hurt those around them, have abusive relationships, are manipulative, and destructive.  People have every right to not want to tolerate that or be supportive.  Most mental illness isn't something to be proud of your struggle in,  they're things that signal your need to get it together, take accountability, and do something with your life.  And just like a 35 year old finally getting a job and working on their life, I'm not going to pat you on the back and say good job for finally doing the basic necessities that every other functioning adult does just fine.  \n\nIf you have mental illness you should be taking medicine, seeing a doctor/therapist, actively working to fix it, and taking responsibility when it affects those around you.\n\nThe obvious exclusions to what I said above are those who literally have mental illnesses that handicap them like severe autism.",
            "Nailed it. Something I\u2019ve experienced repeatedly and yet never thought on it too much because y\u2019know, ignorance and selfishness is everywhere and I don\u2019t have the energy to challenge it. They don\u2019t understand AT ALL.",
            "I have SPD/ASPD and wouldn't even dream of telling relatives about it. Sadly this issue is very taboo where I come from and media rarely (if ever) talks bout it, when they do, they just portray the typical hollywood blockbuster and psychological horror shit.",
            "I think it is mostly because people don't know what actual symptoms look like. \nThey think it's \"oh, so you get a little [insert emotion]\"\nI also think this is because some people with mental illness don't know how to communicate what their symptoms may look like (this being with or without fear of judgment from whoever is being told that isn't a therapist/psychologist/doctor/etc.)\nIt isn't something that is discussed a lot, and the irony is this supportive \"mental health awareness\" kick that surfaced for awhile, but didn't actually delve into other mental illnesses besides depression, or common stress. \nI have a suspicion that say, *60-70% of the homeless population that is laughed at, avoided like a plague, or looked at funny have mental illnesses. (**Percentage not actually researched, just a hypothetical)\nMy brother who has schizophrenia is what I call a part-time homeless man. Sometimes homeless, sometimes living in a hotel that'll kick him out within the following weeks because he'll have a schizophrenic episode.",
            "I disagree with your panic disorder example because being aggressive towards someone else is never okay. I don\u2019t think you need to call them a moody bitch or anything but talk it through and make it clear that snapping at someone is not okay.",
            "I actually feel terrible everyday for more or less abandoning a friend with obvious mental health issues. He began old habits of substance abuse and erratic behavior that a lot of his old friends told me would eventually show up. It was great when we would go to concerts or get messed up here or there. Exploring his brain and vice versa over a bottle and a blunt really make up some of my favorite memories. But it became what felt like babysitting. If he got to drunk at a party, or showed up to work unstable, either from self medicating to much or getting off his prescriptions for to long before anyone noticed, everyone would ask me to take care of it even if I wasn't the one who had brought him to either. I feel terrible because I know he feels abandoned by so many people. I guess I eventually saw why so many did. I talk to him here or there, but it's just always awkward now because I know in his \"crazy\" mind he's come up with a million reasons as to why I stopped hanging out with him. He sounds crazy when he tries to explain why his friends stop being his friends. But I eventually saw the truth in his ramblings because he even knows he's broken.",
            "I completely understand this, and I can't even imagine being the person with the mental illness in that situation. That being said, the portrayal of mental illness in the media where everything is dramatic and heroic doesn't help. I don't think the vast majority of people actually know how serious the symptoms of mental illness are. For example, someone may say they want to support you through it but realise they aren't in the right place themselves to help you after you exhibit symptoms",
            "The lack of passionate explanation, or signs of physical debilitation.",
            "I think what is hard for people is undiagnosed mental illness coupled with antisocial behaviour.\n\nHow do you tell the difference between a family member that is just straight up nasty and vindictive and someone suffering mental illness?\n\nI do not think you can unless the person acknowledge they have an issue after confirming it with a specialist.\n\nI would go so far as to say many families wish they could attribute the behaviour to a medical condition rather than accepting they are just horrible people.\n\nYou should not mix up a desire to care with ability to care either.\n\nThe other thing is mental illness is commonly so draining for others around them. You may go off the rails & become violent 3% of the time which means the people that care about you are on edge 100% of the time.\n\nCaring about someone that is unstable or depressed all the time is a horrific experience simply because they are constantly worrying so it's easier to use an excuse & walk away.\n\nLive is short, unfair & by taking responsibility, they are throwing that away for another person (family or not) that may well not show any appreciation for them doing that & may be downright hostile to them.\n\nIt may well crush them to walk away but they know it will destroy them if they continue to care.\n\nI mean flip it on its head, people here reading this who suffer mental illness, how come you are not their all the time for those that have tried to be there for you? I am guessing you consider it an entitlement that family take care of you?\nWhat have you done in your capacity to give back to those people that invest so much in you? Do you believe it's a one way street and you get to not give a shit about anyone else's mental health because you are the one having problems?\n\nDo you just take, take, take? In my experience, family only walk away when they have to protect their own mental health & often it is a heart breaking decision to make that they live with the rest of their lives.",

What's worse, is that I have kids of my own and this so called \"family that sticks together\" don't even invite them to anything e.g birthday parties, family bbqs or any gathering where their cousins and relatives are.

            "I completely agree with this.  I have ADHD/MD/SAD/Borderline and substance abuse problems.  I've figured out they are supportive until u make them mad or get into an argument.  For a lot of people it's as simple as u staying clean and then u are no worse off than them.  For many people they never want to admit u might have it worse than them cuz it ruins their narrative about how easily your problems could be dealt with.  Rather than being grateful that they don't suffer from mental illness, many people want to trash u for not being more successful or less troubled."

            "Thinking back to the Diablo 2 days, I can at least supersize with the notion. If you played hardcore (one death = game over), it didn't actually make things harder. It just made everyone cautiously progress at a snail's pace so they wouldn't die.  \nWith a lot of games, hard difficulties can just slow the game down so much that it becomes boring. I think the specific game matters.",
            "Depends on the game in my opinion, my favourite video games are the dark souls saga and I don't think I would have that much fun if it was on ''easy mode''.\n\nBut then I go on a game like Skyrim and I just enjoy it more when I play on lower difficulty levels, I think it changes depending on what game do you play.",
            "I\u2019ve always been mocked for playing games on low difficulty. Not that it should matter, but this makes me feel a lot better.",
            "Well, it depends mate. I think we are lucky enough now that almost all Triple A games (and even indies) have the options of 'Easy' and 'Very Easy'. I have been playing video games for a while now and my sister used to be a backseat gamer. It means she just used to sit and watch me play, i didn't really give her the controls much because she was young but she was really helpful in pointing out stuff i had passed by or she would present me with ideas as to how to defeat i can defeat a boss. From the games i played, she witnessed me play some of the god of war games and they were some of our favourites. Many years later, i got the new God of war game and immediately after finishing it, i wanted her to experience it. This would be her first ever game she would play thoroughly. As i handed her the controller and she roamed the world and proceeded to hack-and-slash all the baddies, i witnessed how much Santa monica did a good job of making the game accessible through easy mode without making into a very \"novice\" type of experience. and because of that, my sister got to play a game which i (we) grew up loving. But you can't have that for games like Dark souls, which is understandable. the very purpose of those games is satisfaction and rewards through hardship and challenge. If my sister wants to play those games, she just has to get GUD enough that she thinks she is ready enough to step into those worlds, and i think that's fair.",
            "I enjoy doing both. It's fun to play the first time as a fucking God in the game but then after that I play on hard difficulty and sweat it out.",
            "I really think its situational. Some games are way more fun when they are really hard because their difficulty has to be beaten by skill; aka the 'git gud' games like (obviously) Dark Souls, Dead Cells or Enter the Gungeon. Some other games simply inflate the difficulty  on harder gamemodes and in these cases playing in hard is quite Bullshit. With this I mean Games like TES, the Witcher and 50% of al Stealth games",
            "A lot of games do difficulty wrong. Let's take skyrim for example, a fantastic game but the difficulty doesnt make the game harder, you still just run and hack and slash enemies except on harder settings you just have less hp relative to enemies. Instead of hitting an enemy five times you hit the same enemy twenty five times. Puzzles and quests are still identical in difficulty, puzzles especially being uselessly easy.",
            "I don't like the easiest setting because the game gets boring quickly, and I see the hardest setting as something to make additional playthroughs interesting, and I usually play on a middle setting. Usually this ends up being too easy for long stretches with periods of the game being challenging.\n\nThe best games are those with a well made adaptive difficulty, but those tend to be difficult to create and balance.",

He refuses to change difficulty settings (and always makes sure he hosts the game so I won't \"go rogue\" and do it myself).  Eventually I got fed up because it became more about earning stupid achievements or proving to the game you're man enough to beat it on the hard setting.  And guess what?  Every game we played lasted a short time and then we never touched it again, usually after finishing maybe 1/4 of the content. It's the same philosophy as giving Shakespeare to a toddler... You gotta start easy and master the basics before challenging yourself. \n\nNow I play games my way and it's so much more fun.",

When I started getting older the games I was interested in were too difficult for me so I stopped playing. Well now during quarantine I got a PS4 and I have started Horizon Zero Dawn. This game is beautiful and I\u2019m playing on easy mode. I guess some people don\u2019t like that easy mode exists but for me I get to enjoy something I haven\u2019t in years. I find myself playing for hours and I feel so relaxed while playing. For a technical first time gamer, playing on easy has made me feel involved in something I wanted to be a part of before. I am finding new games to enjoy and connecting with old friends. It\u2019s very joyful!",
            "I used to have this mentality.  But, now I only play games on hardest difficulty unless it\u2019s something really out there like Doom Eternal I had to bump down to Ultra Violence.  It\u2019s a great feeling when you overcome challenge.",
            "I play for this reason on medium difficulty\u2014it\u2019s the sweet spot. I think easy doesn\u2019t test your ability and if I wanted to simply watch something while putting forth minimal effort I\u2019d flip on a movie.",

Games should be about what's fun for you. And I don't understand how struggling could be fun for anyone. We already struggle enough in our daily lives...",

            "[deleted]",
            "Hard disagree, but it also depends on how difficulty is implemented in a game. If they're just fluffing up the numbers and making enemies into damage sponges then it's not really fun. Innovative ways to make the game difficult is what makes a game fun. The key is to add a reward for these higher difficulties, though, otherwise it cheapens the experience.\n\nI'll never understand how people don't appreciate a meaningful challenge in their games. Granted, there is a place for games like Stardew where you just dial off and enjoy, but overall games should engage you.",
            "Dunkey has a pretty good video regarding this topic.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4_auMe1HsY\n\nTL;DW: Games need to be designed with difficulty in mind. Games with multiple difficulties usually have an intended mode, but many, especially in the modern day, fail on many fronts to balance the experience to be enjoyable and engaging. Also, some games lend better to difficulty than others.\n\nFor example, a JRPG that is easy is pretty much just a run through the story. It doesn't matter what gear you have, what abilities you press or what strategy you use, making fights seem like more of a slog. But for a hack and slash game like Dynasty Warriors, it might be more satisfying to just mow through enemies on easy mode because it's satisfying to have that sense of being super powerful.",
            "I am not super brave, so being able to play fallout 4 on easy mode makes it more fun for me. Spent two hours taking out the first deathclaw on normal mode, since I was so set on not dying, and it is too long to be entertaining",

            "i totally agree. unless a game is built to be challenging on purpose, it\u2019s nice to be able to sit back and enjoy the story instead of sweating your ass off trying to be good. on my first playthrough of nier: automata, it was way too hard for me on normal mode. i swapped it to easy and just vibed. i ended up playing through it again on normal mode, with a better understanding of mechanics, and finished it with no problems. it\u2019s okay to not be a try hard sweat and still play games, even if people will get salty that you only play easy, lol",
            "I haven't played many games, but I've played two Dark Souls and I'm playing Sekiro and I really like high difficulty on common enemies and mini-bosses, who present a challenge instead of just being there to die like in other games, but sometimes I wish I could lower the difficulty on bosses, some are really a pain.",
            "Borderlands is fantastic for that, you feel so powerful. With the right guns (Stark Krakatoa, Redistributor, whatever else you prefer) the game is a breeze. Then you can do varying levels of Mayhem which change the difficulty, not the speed.",

Sadly we're in an age of \"gamers\" and if you're not destroying every game of COD you play or topping every BR game you play then you're obviously trash and shouldn't play the game (/s). For some reason people love to feel superior when it matter the least and video games is perfect for that. You should always play for yourself, that's why I never go game chat in any game I play anymore. I either play online with no communication (solo private party) or with friends.

            "I know I play all survival horror games on easy because I just hate the stress of always being about to run out of ammo. I also find that shooting a zombie in the head multiple times to be a little cheap. \n\nOn most games though I prefer the normal setting and on a few games I do hard. I do like a challenge at times in a game. I also have beaten all of the souls games though I'm not afraid to face certain bosses with help from friends or randos to beat them. \n\nI don't blame anyone who plays on easy though, and I honestly think that *every* game should have a difficulty slider (yes even dark souls). You pay for a game you should be able to see the entire thing IMO. One game that kind of infuriated me with this was Cuphead (yeah go ahead and downvote me). It had an easy difficulty but it wouldn't count for any progress, which to me was pretty awful. That game was very well made, had amazing graphics, and even on easy had a genuine challenge. On normal it was such a huge step up and felt really cheap at times. So I should also stipulate that I think on easy mode you should be able to play the entire game.",

            "FromSoftware games are designed to be hard and the atmosphere would suffer greatly if they were presented with an easy mode, so I'd say if you're a casual gamer you're not entitled to make the designers change the way their game plays. You can play games with easy mode on easy mode, but demanding an easy mode out of developers who designed their entire company around difficulty is obnoxious. Fromsoft games are 100 percent fair with a... few exceptions. I feel like hard modes on other games are artificial (e.g. nightmare doom), easy modes are trash and boring, and normal modes are hollow and unsatisfying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - I need hard games because I get bored in about two minutes playing a game on easier difficulties",
            "  A youtuber called the Demodcracy has done a fantastic video discussing difficulty modes within games. Personally I prefer games without difficulty modes because then I'm getting what feels like an intended experience by the developers and not an unbalanced experience from a difficulty slider. That being said I do appreciate that increasing difficulty can make games more fun for replay value. Hence the existence of dark souls challenge runs.",

            "Have to disagree. Easiest setting usually doesn't have a learning curve that higher difficulties have.

If i'm not playing for adversity, why am i playing?\n\nSometimes however, game difficulty is scaled, still challenging, and also gives you moments to soak in the story and setting, that shit is awesome.",

That's why I consider the ideal remakes those that have a full range of difficulty settings ranging from easy enough that someone who has never played a video game before can beat it to comically nightmarish levels that make the original look easy. Some remakes with that degree of customizable difficulty are the PSP versions of Ys 1-3, and Mega Man 1 and X, and the PS1 version of Final Fantasy 1 and 2.",

I didn't put it on the lowest, but halfway through I bumped it down so I didn't have to repeat so many areas.",

            "I disagree but sometimes i abide by this rule. The point of playing a game is to have fun, if a game is difficult it can be thrilling and fun, but if its too difficult then its not even enjoyable and just lame.",
            "It depends on the game. \nIn Skyrim and The Witcher where the enemies basically just get double health on every higher rank, it becomes kinda boring and tedious. Lots of difficulty, little challenge. \nIn \u201chorror\u201d games, like Bioshock it felt better playing on a high difficulty because the enemies felt like actual threats. I couldn\u2019t rush in like a superhero and just beat everyone in a couple of shots, thus defeating the \u201chorror\u201d aspect of the game. \nIn \u201cpower fantasy\u201d action games, like God of War and Doom 2016, it shouldnt feel like a chore to beat. But it doesnt feel the same mowing through everything with complete ease. I feel less like a badass warrior and more like an average warrior against incompetent enemies.",
            "As someone who loves the difficult challenge of a frustrating game, I would say you do have a somewhat unpopular opinion, but it is completely acceptable stance. Everyone should play games the way they enjoy them.",
            "Oh boy, here I come, pissing people off again.",
            "Not true for games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt",

            "Oh I enjoy a good I am god smashing things..... But I also love the sense of accomplishment from doing a really hard game. Cod for me alwyas on the hardest setting possible once done I'll go back and smash it again with a easy setting but it just feels better on hard. It's totally down to what you enjoy though and that's key.\n\nIts the same with people who really love ranked online games.... Which is my idea of hell lol I don't want Sbmm or ranked play I want to piss about with friends and have fun. It's why I love gaming there is somthing for every one.",
            "Depends all on the game honestly. Some games I just want mindless relaxing fun, like Skyrim and fallout. I play on the medium difficulty or master, but not until I\u2019m at the point where I can\u2019t really die unless I do something stupid. I like games where you can also set your own pace and be rewarded for it like Borderlands and diablo. Then sometimes I want a game to really challenge me like dark souls or ill play resident evil on the hardest setting first. Sometimes getting frustrated to the point you turn the game off and then come beck when your tempers settled you beat a specific boss or area can be rewarding. But games where it\u2019s hard because the AI sucks isn\u2019t fun. Like division. You\u2019ll get killed by basic enemies, not because they\u2019re humans who can somehow eat 76 NATO rounds all while rushing you down to 2 hit you with a butcher knife while you reload. That shit sucks. I rather have an enemy be stupid fast and unpredictable and one hit me while I need to hit them a couple times than just be able to take your bullets like they\u2019re bread crumbs and just keep going out.",
            "Lol...what a puss!!! I have 45 platinums.",
            "I find the best way to replay a game is on the hardest difficulty. You already know the story now you have to figure out how to not die during the tutorial mission.",
            "If a game is too easy I lose interest and put it down",
            "If something has no challenge it gets boring. I want to feel like I'm overcoming something, toppling an insurmountable foe. Breezing through is fine for some games like DOOM, but there are games I do like being challenged in games like Sekiro or Dark Souls. Playing on easy for me is just there's no sense of accomplishment.",

Like, i used a shit ton of time beating far cry 3 on easy. Well, i rarely play on my console. That is prolly the reason.  Ut i think it is honeslt BS that people gatekeep difficulty. And that even some games mock players for going easy mode.",

            "I agree. I almost always start on easy and only increase the difficulty when I feel it enhances the game in some way (Crysis is a good example) or I just enjoy the experience so much.\n\nOverly difficult bits, such as boss fights, in otherwise not too difficult games can cause me to rage quit. Fuck such games.",

Before being married i liked the hardest setting but with less time on my games if i want to enjoy a story and play casually i dont mind adjusting it. \n\nBottom line is whats your goal and what are you trying to prove yourself and others...",
            "Difficulty has always been about preference, in my eyes. A lot of gamers want to enjoy the story, but depending on skill level some might find it too challenging on normal, some might find it too easy on normal.\n\n\nBut then there are games that are about skill, and the difficulty let's you either breeze through it as a god, or climb a steep mountain as though you were a peasant.\n\n\nIt's all about how the player wants to experience it.",
            "First time through I do normal. If the game is good enough to warrant another play through then I'll crank it up a bit.",

            "Its a balance for sure, I love the payoff of beating something on the highest difficulty.  What comes to mind is playing all the Halo campaigns on legendary.  But also sometimes I get home from work and I just wanna be a God for an hour and kill everything indiscriminately with ease.",
            "That's fine. I like a challenge to overcome when it's hard but fair. Divinity Original Sin 2 is the definition of doing it all the best. You have your cakewalk difficulty where you can do any party composition and still get the story up to ironman brutal but fair where you need an incredibly well synergized team of premades to even survive act 1.\n\nWhat I dislike is how devs seem to think people liking  to take it easy in games  = it's fine for the systems to lack depth/balance. Which a ton of games lack. Tomb Raider is a fun game, but I'm pretty disappointed with how you can blow through in even the highest difficulty. Halo 2 is fun with not too much depth but god damn Legendary was cancer.",

Skyrim really is a game that never stops giving.\n\nHowever, I just started playing Green Hell, the first survival/horror that I've ever played. It's genuinely scary sometimes and I'm still figuring it out, so I want a bit of a challenge but I'm not ready for higher difficulties.",
            "Depends on how the game handles difficulty, if the hard mode is just an increase in enemy stats then it's less fun (to me). however if your given a handicap of some kind or the difficulty is brought by a unique mechanic, it catches my interest and makes the experience more fun.",
            "You're right, but, sometimes I like to suffer so I do the highest straight off the bat. But sometimes I want just braindead easy stuff so I can relax",

            "Some games aren't just about the story, like if superhot had easy mode it would suck",
            "Some games are designed to be more fun on easy mode, some are designed to be more fun on hard. Honestly I think game designers should stop adding modes in the first place and just make the game easy if that\u2019s the best way to do it or make it hard if that is. Dark Souls is a great example of this, built around being difficult and people love it for not having an easy mode. Could just as easily be done the other way around.",
            "I agree with this. I was playing devil may cry recently because I like hack and slash games. But it\u2019s too hard lol. Easy mode is still slightly challenging but makes the game go by quicker. Which is great because it\u2019s designed around minute to minute gameplay",
            "I'm not a hardcore gamer and I never play online. I'm currently playing Horizon ZD on easy. I see it as a really long interactive movie. I dont want to watch the same movie scenes over and over, why would Inwant to play them that way?",

            "Honestly, if the battle system is fun on rpg's I tend to grind and over level my party before progressing the story. At that point it does feel like easy mode, but I can feel happy with the fact that I worked for it. That said though, it's really important that the battle system is fun, otherwise why bother.",
            "I find it depends on the game. Normal mode is often pretty normal. But depending on the developers definition of hard mode, some games on hard mode are so much harder than others that it\u2019s not even worth it. \n\nSuper easy sucks I always play on normal. On super easy it\u2019s more of a movie than a game",
            "For some, perhaps.\n\nI used to be this way, but as I grew older I got more of a thrill from struggling through to get what I want.\n\nTake an RTS, for example. If I set it to easy and play a skirmish, I KNOW what the outcome will be. I'm going to win, so why would I even bother going through the motions.\n\nI like the game to throw unexpected events my way, changing the course of my plan or making me go to an entirely new option. That just doesn't happen for me on easy mode in most games.\n\nIf you play games for the story - yeah. Easy mode is the way to go for that. That isn't so much an opinion as a fact. The game-play is segregated from the story in most experiences, so it is only logical to set it to easy if your concern if the story.",
            "This is true for Resident Evil 4, once you have the infinite rocket launcher.",

            "I play on the difficulty that feels best to me, most often this is the second hardest difficulty. I'll turn it down if the game is too hard or too unfair (bullet sponges and taking ungodly amounts of damage are the bane of my existence).\n\nIf possible, I mod games to give me my preferred difficulty.\n\nBreezing through a game is really boring to me, but I like that you're having fun, and that's great. We shouldn't judge each other on what difficulty we like to play at, every video game is a completely subjective experience.\n\nEg. My playthrough of FEAR on Hard gives me a different experience than your playthrough on Medium; who's to say who has the better experience and more fun.\nEven if we both play on normal, we'll use different weapons and approach encounters in our own way.",
            "I agree, i prefer exploring the game slowly and getting balanced progress every time you play",
            "If hard mode is just hard to be hard htan I agree. Some games have a hard mode that is more challenging so that more experienced players can have fun.",
            "People get different things from different video games. I feel like cuphead would be way shittier if there wasn\u2019t that challenge to overcome and that element of mastery and beating the odds, but I can see where you\u2019re coming from. Cheers!",
            "Won't lie it was awesome getting the Spartan Shield on the new God of War by beating it on the hardest Difficulty",
            "This is a legit unpopular opinion. I very much enjoy succeeding through the struggle and I\u2019m fine spending hours failing if it\u2019s a matter of skill. If it\u2019s arbitrarily hard, or random number generation, then I would agree with you.",
            "For me, if it\u2019s a story-rich title like The Witcher, I\u2019ll run through on the easy setting and maybe try harder difficulty levels later. In the Dishonored series I had a lot of fun playing on the hardest difficulty level.",
            "Perfect example is gears of war. I play on experienced difficulty first time through but if I die on a single gunfight say 5 or 6 times (gears 5 has a couple bullshit parts like this) I'll drop the difficulty to normal to get past it and put it back to the hard difficulty.\n\n\nPlus in general the only thing that usually kills me in the parts that aren't designed to kill you a ton of times are fucking up when killing a Scion or warden, or the average swarm boi with a torque bow"

They spent the whole time changing outfits, taking photos, editing photos, and checking their likes (buried in their phones and laptops).  They were OK looking, but not that attractive. When we finally figured out what they were doing, we asked and they confirmed it.  We looked them up, and it was all heavily edited images of \u201cfun at the beach\u201d.  They barely looked at the water when they were there!  The whole thing was fucking creepy.",

They're selling sex and imagination.  \n\n- Sex = Requires them to be the focus of every photo.\n\n- Imagination = If you hate sports but she's playing sports, she's not your dream girl anymore.  If she does nothing, you can pretend she doesn't play sports.  Staying generic lets your imagination fill in the blanks to your liking.  They also aren't seeking to debate any topics and the best way to do it is avoid is to take no stances.\n\nIt's a crazy world but I think that's why it happens.",

That's the point of the page. \n\nTo me that's like following a page about cats and complaining that they don't post enough pictures of beaches and parades, or following Porsche and wishing they posted more photos of their lunch.\n\nIt's not like you're talking about a personal friend of yours or something.

Their job involves taking photos at the most flattering angles, staying up to date on trends and products, maintaining looks, editing their pictures, interacting with fans, and looking at what other people post on the platform. The lengths to which they go for this job means daily hours put into this, honestly an hour at minimum if not two, and many more on 'heavier' days.\nWe don't know what they do with the remaining time, but we *can* assume that they are spending that much time, energy, and resources on this pursuit.\n\n\nHuman time and energy is limited and every second spent on Instagram is time not spent doing other things, learning about other topics, or developing non-instagram-related skills. At 2 hours a day, that's a minimum of 14 hrs a week that they are devoting to ttaking pictures of themselves and building their brand (14 hours that other people are using differently).\n\n\nThis doesn't make Insta models automatically more vapid than other people. It just means that statistically speaking, they are less likely spend free time on hobbies and projects that other people who don't do Instagram do spend free time on. Perhaps this is more moderate version of what OP is trying to say.",
            "If someone managed to take a thousand unique photos of themselves, I would be impressed as a photographer. However, the reality is a lot of heavily filtered portraits where they're making the same exact face almost every time. It's like seeing Zoolander's 'Blue Steel' infinitely with a thousand different backdrops.",
            "The interesting part about this is we still haven\u2019t seen the long term effects of this. This could be dangerous for some women later in life when they try to mimic selfie/body pics as they were in their early 20\u2019s at age 55 and the angles, filters etc just don\u2019t hold up anymore. It could cause some serious depression or even worse to not have that attention & the compliments from such a perfect body back in their prime. \n\nThink about it, when you\u2019re getting so many likes, so many notifications, dms & compliments it\u2019s like a drug. It\u2019s a drug echo chamber. Imagine losing the potentness of this drug later in life. I pray for IG models in the future."

This young kid like between 8 and 12 came up and ordered some ice cream with some money he got from his grandpa.

The kid nodded and was happy to wait.\n\nMaybe like 15 minutes went by and i was about 2 seconds from making the kids order and here comes grandpa, dragging the poor kid behind him. He proceeds to start ripping me a new one because im taking forever and bla bla bla. I step back and let our manager handle it. She nods and tells him point blank if hes so unhappy we will give him a refund and send him on his way.\n\nWe did and he drags this poor kid out the door while belting out a stream of guttural insults about how we were incompetent and all that shit.\n\nI felt so damn bad for that kid.

If you fuck it up again, I'm gonna go get my gun and we'll see who fucks up then\".\n\n\nNow listen. I'm a picky eater. I hate it when my order is messed up. It's an autism thing.

But those workers are more than capable of being assholes who wan to do the bare minimum as well. I know, I have worked with many of them. Victimhood doesn't make you a saint. That being said, the adults who come in and bitch and moan aren't being helpful, but they don't and can't know if they are actually being screwed or not.

There's an industry wide problem with not giving people what they actually paid for. Therefore, people are going to check their shit for 30 seconds instead. Because if they pull out of line to check and you got it wrong, then they have to either choose to just accept that you didn't give them what they paid for, or go and wait in that line again just to fix the mistake you made.\n\nThis is an example of young people being meek and spineless when it comes to anything that isn't online. Not polite.",
            "I\u2019ve been in customer service jobs since I was 18 (25 now), and it\u2019s very obvious that the teen customers are crazy more polite than the older customers. Like polar opposites. I\u2019ll have granny blocking the aisle, completely aware that I need to get past her and will continue to dumbly stare at the wall and not let me past. Then her granddaughter will get the cart and move it so I can get by. They definitely learned how they didn\u2019t want to be.",

            "I can get behind most of this. The exception is checking the food, special order or not..  I urge everyone to check the contents of their bags every time at the window. More so now then ever. Workers are stressed, don't care, and most importantly aren't perfect. Also, those lines are longer for many reasons, most notably, the dining rooms are closed. So if you move up then check your food, you're fucked. Can't go inside, so you either get in the back of the line or you go home unhappy, again.",
            "I think it's mainly because most teens can't handle any flak themselves. Me and most people I know wouldn't want to bother a waiter or cashier because we're too socially awkward to complain to strangers. I don't really think most teens are super polite because they want too, but they're too scared to complain. I think adults are just more comfortable than teens. They also typically have more responsibilities to attend to.",

One person even said he hoped the restaurant burned down while I was in it. At 16, I just could not wrap my mind around saying such horrible things to complete strangers.",

Fucking nothing. I\u2019m privileged enough to even have 3 square meals a day, and even though I have every right to go back and ask for a double, it doesn\u2019t fucking matter.

Esp if you have an allergy or cant eat something for whatever reason. Nothing wrong with that, its the tantrums that are a problem.",
            "I noticed this when working in fast food. Adults would come in and treat you like second class citizens and trash especially if you messed up on something. Teenagers that came in treated you like any other person. I\u2019m betting they know how it feels to be treated like a piece of garbage by someone older than you.",

They're young and healthy, their bodies are full of energy, they're still learning and feeling new things and gaining new experiences.  A lot easier to sit on your phone for 5 mins waiting for your food when you're a teen.\n\nAlso, it's a skewed perspective.  Teenagers are little shits.  Evil, inconsiderate assholes.

            "Teens are a lot more self-conscious than adults and likely don't want to look bad when dealing with employees at a store. They may know people. As teens mature into adults they begin to care less and less what others think of them which can erode a person's filter entirely. \n\nTeens are also more aware of what its like to be working a part time job while adults forget because they may compare what they see as easy work to their more laborious careers. They also get annoyed when employees make mistakes. One mistake. Oh, well. Just accept it. No need to fuss. But as you age and you endure several mistakes from the same places, your patience wears a little thin.",

If there is more than a ten minute wait on anything they get all stressed and throw a mini tantrum and hassle the staff or leave and don\u2019t bother and miss out. My Dad throws a tantrum and abuses other drivers (not to their face) in slight traffic and hates waiting more than 2 mins.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether you get less patient when you get older or they\u2019re a more entitled generation but god it\u2019s embarrassing and frustrating when you have to deal with it when it\u2019s just simply waiting.\n\n\nIt\u2019s like consoling toddlers trying to tell them to listen to music or take a deep breath or look on Instagram and use their phone and don\u2019t focus on it",

My opinion has actually changed a bit.\n\nI still think you shouldn't take an infant on a plane unless it's absolutely necessary (you're moving/visiting family) because flying is miserable enough already unless you're wealthy enough for first-class. Just drive somewhere until your child is ~~in control of their own emotions~~ old enough to know proper travelling etiquette.\n\nJust straight up don't take them to sit-down restaurants or movies.

He won\u2019t remember his experience, but I\u2019ll be able to remember his reactions to each new experience. We will not be taking him into quiet restaurants and museums until he\u2019s at a point where he\u2019s not crying constantly or easily cries though as I agree it will bring down other peoples experiences.

That trip I have absolutely no memory off because I was only 2 years old.\n\nBut, my mom has very fond memories of this vacation, including some cute pictures. How is this pointless, exactly? I might not remember it, but my mom and my sister do, and they had a great time.

If you are deciding to go on vacation without an infant, who is going to take care of the child while you are gone? Grandparents? If alive. Babysitters?

I can\u2019t say for sure what I would do as a parent, but I\u2019ve always admired parents that bring their newborn on vacations etc. \n\nLike you mentioned. Newborns are far from able to follow directions, nor do they know how to behave in social settings. Hell they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re their own person until they\u2019re a few months old. But despite that, some people continue to do whatever they would have done before the baby knowing it can cause potential disruptions/ annoyance for other people. \n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s a lot of work to bring a baby with you. I admire their ability to even have the energy or will to bring their kids with them. That\u2019s a feat itself. \n\nI also think being in the community and having experiences with traveling has to be good for babies. I know it was good for my dogs when they were puppies. Getting them used to the world and experiencing different things is an amazing way to learn, and to have less fear of the world too. \n\nThe formative years span from 0-7 years. So even though they \u201cwon\u2019t remember\u201d consciously doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t impact them to go on a trip. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019ve never been slightly annoyed by a baby screaming bloody murder on a plane, it\u2019s just I think the benefits of bringing your baby with you outweighs my brief moment of annoyance. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s just something about babies that reminds me that everything in life is fucking cool. I don\u2019t have to walk around unfazed and bored by life. I just have to look at life like it\u2019s new again. I appreciate that too.",

They don't want to hear your screaming child. \n\nTaking your child some place, then refusing to parent them is the most annoying fucking thing an adult can do. \n\nLike, I went to the movies a few weeks back and some lady brought her infant. Who the fuck thinks it's okay to bring an infant to watch Top Gun!? Her kid spent most of the movie screaming because it was too damn loud to have that child in there. She did nothing to calm it down other than give it candy. Candy. To a baby. What the fuck. Then people shushed her several times, and her response was just to call everyone racist. Didn't know expecting people to act like functioning respectful adults was racist. The theater ended up kicking her out, thank god. \n\nDon't bring your kid someplace where the atmosphere is a place to relax and unwind if you have not managed to teach them how to behave. \n\nThe same thing goes for adults that act like children. Just don't go.",
            "Yo! Fuvk yeah I agree. I have two kids and taking them on trips as babies and toddlers was awful \n\nThen again, my wife and I wanted to go places, and it wasn\u2019t so much about the kids. So actually, this opinion sucks and doesn\u2019t look at the whole picture and you\u2019re stupid",
            "I loved traveling with my kids as infants/toddlers - they\u2019ll never remember any of it. I will and I loved every minute of our adventures. \n\nBenefits for children - since my kids were always flying and exploring with me - they have an insatiable appetite for travel and other countries + cultures. We\u2019re American so raising globally aware children was a high priority for me!",
            "All I'm gonna say is I have whispers of memories from a vacation I was taken on when I was 2. My little brother lost his cool little crab sunglasses in a lighthouse, the could flip up so the shade part was perpendicular to the glasses, and there was a large blue passenger ferry to an island where no cars were allowed. I think it was in one of the Carolinas",
            "People should just stop having children, no child support when you get divorced, no screaming matches because they took or did X, it's good for the environment, no depression because you can't afford to save up for their college fund, more money for alcohol and drugs, you can go on more extravagant trips that are more adult oriented, your child may very well be the next Hitler/Putin and you'd be saving millions of lives.\n\nStop having kids folks!\n\n/s",
            "It's just too broad of a brush. Depends on the type of vacation and the parents and the kids.\n\nI took my two-year-old to national parks, and they still remember it 2 years later. The airplane made an impact. The parks made an impact. Side-events made an impact. Trust was built. Memories were made. Life's greatest teacher is experience, and I'm making sure my kids experience valuable things.\n\nHaving said that, I think parents should try to balance the experience for others'. Children and the setting make the situation unique, but child behavior can only be allowed to be so bad before they give up on an experience. Gotta know how to pivot - whatever that may look like.\n\nRegardless of the value judgement, there are other factors as well. Do the parents have a support system? If so, do they feel comfortable leaving children with them for a time? Are the children normally great (kids can just have a bad day or even a bad time of day)? Maybe adults in the family really want to experience something with their kids, and who the hell knows why it may be important to them at that moment? \n\nTo all of the parents who vacation not for relaxation but for good experiences and teachable moments, which ultimately create more work, I salute you.",
            "If you have an infant or small children, stay home. It\u2019s actually harder and more stressful on those kids to make them travel, as it disrupts their routine.",
            "As someone with a six month old, I approve of this. If you can\u2019t find someone you trust to watch your kid while you\u2019re on vacation, you don\u2019t need to go. Infants ruin vacations for literally everyone in their vicinity. It\u2019s selfish and dumb. Besides, don\u2019t you want time away from the screaming monster? How much of a vacation is it when you have to parent full time? Ugh",
            "My daughter remembers vacations from when she was 3 and it ignores that chilmdren leanr by doing so even if they dont remember its specificly they will be formed by it.\n\nAnd anyway the parents can go and enjoy vacations and leaving less then 3 years alone at home doesnt end well usualy.",
            "Its because they cant look after themselves when left alone at home genius",
            "Infants are people and have just as much right to public spaces as anyone. You don't know why someone else is on a plane, maybe it's not vacation maybe they're moving accross the country or visiting with elderly relatives who can't travel and want to meet the baby. As women are generally the one tasked with most childcare you're basically advocating to reduce access to public spaces by women. You are also drastically exaggerating how much the typical infant cries."

            "This is obviously a popular opinion, but I'm still going to try and explain why \"loving your body regardless of size\" is important.\n\nPeople aren't fat because they want to be, but (generally) because they get stuck in a cycle of self-hatred and comfort eating. Fat shaming only emphasizes that self-hatred and it is not at all motivating, it just pushes people down further. So perhaps a better strategy is to show people that they are worthy of love, regardless of size. This is all in an effort to break that cycle of  self-hatred. If someone realises they are worthy of love, they may also realise they are worthy of care, self-care. Which then hopefully encourages them make healthier choices. It's hard to take proper care of yourself when you *hate* yourself, you know. Being morbidly obese is surprisingly similar to alcoholism in that way, the food/alcohol is a coping mechanism, a very harmful one, but still a coping mechanism.\n\nTL;DR: \"Loving your body regardless of size\" is more about diminishing self-hatred than glorifying an unhealthy life, although obv. bad actors still exist.",

Right now, I'm a little less than the heaviest I've ever been but I've also been making healthy choices for close to 6 months and it's the first time in my life I've been this consistent. I got dressed up the other day and I felt beautiful. Despite being larger than I'd like, I love my body. I'm proud of what I've survived. \n\nBeing obese is unhealthy. So is hating yourself.

Of course, some people are more prone to being obese; some have more trouble losing weight than others. No one should be guilting or pressuring you to lose weight but rather *encouraging* a healthier lifestyle. There's no dignity in giving up when you *know* that it's possible to succeed.

            "Probably too late to comment on this one but here I go. This opinion is not unpopular and that's  actually a big problem. There is a misconception in the modern world, mainly western, that being fat = being unhealthy. This in some cases is true, but in many cases far from it. Some people genuinely are just bigger. They exercise, they eat right, they sleep well, they just have more fat on their body and there is nothing wrong with it. All that saying being fat is bad to these people does is make them self conscious about something that doesn't matter. There's actually a thing called set point theory that talks about how this actually works if you care to read more. \n\nIn case you think I'm an overweight person trying to justify my lifestyle I'll tell you why I know what I know. I suffer from bullimia, so for many years thought the same shit. Thought I had to look a certain way to be healthy. I looked \"normal\" as many people would say but to retain that I had to be massive malnourished. Turn the page to today I've whacked on like 25kgs, I look a bit pudgy but I feel fucking great so who gives a fuck. Moral of the story being basically \"fit looking\" ain't healthy and \"fat\" ain't unhealthy. You may say this shit is anecdotal but read most recovery stories from people and they'll report the same shit. \n\nAlso a sidenote many of the problems that are said to be caused by overweightness generally have some other causes too. Think like stress, and being sedentary being the biggest, and also not just prevalent in overweight people.",
            "This sub has become nothing but popular non-PC opinions. Unsubscribed.",
            "No... this opinion lacks awareness of the real issues with hating your body. Loving your body should be about loving your body regardless of your weight, accepting what it is (even if you\u2019re obese) but knowing that you can and should adjust your weight if it\u2019s unhealthy. The self hate and/or body dysmorphia that can arise as a result of not loving your body as it is can be devastating. These types of beliefs lead to eating disorders, self destructive behaviors and even suicide. \n\nYou can accept your fat body while still knowing that you would be better off if you had a lower BMI. Obesity is a chronic disease and the proper treatment is typically diet and exercise adjustment. If you had cancer or diabetes you would ideally accept your condition for what it was, love yourself anyway and of course seek medically recognized effective treatment. \n\nRejecting or hating your body results in focusing on blaming and shaming yourself rather than focusing on the fact that obesity is a treatable chronic disease. In the case of being proud of your obesity, it\u2019s akin to having cancer, boasting about it and being in denial of the damage that it will do to you. You should love your body even if you have a disease, but simultaneously acknowledge that your condition can and should be treated.",

            "I think all of this stems from a misconception. When fat people were bullied, sure they were called fat. But also things like waste of space, disgusting, etc. The concept of \"loving yourself\" in these circumstances came about to combat depression and reiterate that despite your body, you are still a person, and worthy of respect, but that it still isn't good or healthy. \n\nOf course though, people have misunderstood the meaning and have taken it way too far.

            "I do think every person should strive to be healthy. Although, there are times in my life as someone who struggles with major depression, anxiety, and had 6 concussions that I am unable to leave my bed I can easily fluctuate 30 lbs in 6 months. I have to remember that I will bounce back once my mental health becomes manageable and I can be active. So, in those times I have to accept myself (which includes my body) for what it is because any more contributing negative factors will not help me focus on getting healthy or motivate me. \n\nI believe for some people it is necessary to focus on getting a healthy mind first so that they can get a healthy body. So, finding the line of accepting yourself but knowing that improvements can be made once you have the right mindset. \n\nThe same goes for people who struggle with addiction. With alcoholism, many people start to gain weight once they quit drinking because it\u2019s common to substitute it with food. Although over eating is not ideal, if it helps you kick a strong addiction the positives outweigh the negatives in my books. Then, once that person has a strong hold on their sobriety then they can focus on getting a healthy body and regulating their eating habits.",

The concept Isn't entirely at fault If people use It as leverage to posit that It's okay to be unhealthy.\n\nFurther to the point, It's trying to give merit to beauty outside of body shape so that overweight people aren't continually subject to the stigma - bullying and harassment, body-shaming, etcetera.

It's something literally all people struggle with so they aren't special, and the number who have real health issues that prevent them from addressing it are minuscule.\n\nHowever, there is no obvious appearance of fitness and health so you can't just judge someone at first glance.

            "I agree and I only realised how serious caffeine addiction is recently, when I really dedicated myself to quit it. I used to drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day and if I skipped it in the morning or tried to quit it, I would get terrible headaches, which were so bad that I never had headaches that were as bad for other reasons than caffeine withdrawal (obviously there were a lot of other withdrawal symptoms too).\n\n I then switched to green tea that I have been consuming 2-3 cups until recently (about a week ago) when I stopped. I thought green tea is not as bad since it contains significantly less caffeine (those 2-3 cups are probably equivalent to 1 cup of coffee per day), but even from that I suffered pretty bad withdrawal (even though I did a quick taper beforehand!) which is still ongoing right now. Pretty bad headaches, extreme fatigue and sleepiness, depression, no motivation, constant cravings, etc. I had to use multiple supplements and occasionally painkillers just to stay somewhat functionial in the first few days. The severity of the withdrawals alone makes me want to stay off it because it goes to show how powerful of a drug caffeine actually is and I really hope to stay off it, at least for a while. I had been consuming caffeine \"only\" for about 4 years (I'm 20) and I can't even imagine how bad it must be for people who have been drinking it for decades.\n\nAs a comparison, nicotine was much easier to quit and if coffee withdrawals are say 8/10 in severity, nicotine would be 1/10 for me.

This is chemical, and not attributed to \u201cweakness\u201d.\n\nWhen you stop using a substance that you are dependent on, you will experience withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mildly unpleasant to excruciating. This is why users of heavy drugs find it so difficult to stop using a substance. Withdrawing from certain substances can also be lethal if not done correctly.\n\nIn my case, I have had chronic sleep issues since I was a teenager, *before* I began consuming caffeine daily and in notable amounts (as in, more caffeine than there was in a piece of chocolate or fizzy drink). These sleep issues WERE NOT caused by any external factors, such as caffeine intake.\n\nI have seen specialists, who were able to determine the causes of these sleep issues, however they cannot be fixed, only remedied with medication.\n\nI have to take heavy sleeping pills every single night, or else I don\u2019t sleep. I will be awake for days without them. So, in the morning, I rely on caffeine to counteract the effects of these sleeping medications.\n\nRequiring caffeine to counteract the effects of prescription sedatives, that are required to treat a medical condition, does not make me \u201cweak\u201d.",

A chihuahua biting you is a nuisance, a pitbull biting you is a problem. The breed needs to be phased out, despite what all the single moms will say in the replies with comments like \"oh my precious Zeus would never hurt anyone!\".\n\nNot advocating for eliminating current pits but a good start would be to ban breeding them. Fuck those monsters. RIP all the kids who lost their life to these monsters for just walking down the street.

Also if they have uncut nails that's a problem on the part of the owner for not trimming them/taking them to vet or groomer's to be trimmed (assuming it's an issue, I know a few dogs who don't get their nails trimmed because they're very active and walking on the concrete has worn down the nails so to cut them further would make them too short and therefor be cruel).   \n\n\nAlso I don't want any grammar nazis coming for me, I know spelling \"therefore\" like therefor is archaic but it just looks nicer.

And they absolutely loathe company which makes me happy. I never set out to get a chihuahua but once one come into my life it was true love.",
            "I feel the same way about Pomeranians. Lived with a roommate in grad school who had one and the thing was insane. It would literally rush the door any time someone exited or entered so that leaving the house became a fucking chore in and of itself and required distracting the dog or booking for it and hoping you got the door closed in time. Ridiculous. \n\nIt would also routinely fuck a particular blanket and she did nothing about it. It was the worst fucking dog I\u2019ve ever seen and as soon as it died she replaced it with another that\u2019s only marginally better. \n\nVery happy when I moved out of there. \n\nMy parents also have a chihuahua and she\u2019s useless. Shakes, pees and is afraid of everyone and everything. It\u2019s like watching someone have a panic attack 24/7.",
            "I like them",
            "Perhaps some therapy would help. I adopted 2 dogs that were chihuahua/long hair dachshund mix, I wasn't going to get the one that looked like a chihuahua, then I found out they were litter mates and terribly abused. They were so traumatized and bonded I couldn't seperate them. Now I can't imagine being without both. He's a sweet boy. Anyone who has that much anger against a small animal,, having not even being bit by one, is just sad. Sorry for your (probably misplaced) anger.\n\n\nEdit:  I took a poll, they hate you too."

While plain white, red wine, and apple cider can easy be found in your local grocery store (and they each have unique flavor and are best paired with different dishes just like wine is, in fact many vinegars are made from wines) there are many more types not to be found there. If you were so inclined to become an amateur home brewer/winemaker you could easily become an amateur home vinegar maker.\n\nAny fruit juice can be fermented. That fermented juice can easily be converted into a magical vinegar.\n\nKombucha is a similar product that contains the active ingredient of vinegar, acetyl acid. You are likely a fan of kombucha without knowing. I do not enjoy drinking kombucha, but I do like using it in cooking (similar to a cooking wine).\n\nVinegar is also a better solvent for food flavors than water. If your soak vegetables such as onion, garlic, and a spicy pepper in vinegar you make a quick pickled veggie/pepper mix, blend that in a blender then put it on your tacos for a homemade fresh salsa (one sliced red onion, one diced jalapeno or Fresno chile, and 1-2 garlic cloves packed into a jar then filled with a seasoned vinegar (warm vinegar to a simmer then cut heat and add a few peppercorns, a couple cloves, bay leaf, and a tsp each of cumin seed and turmeric powder, then let that steep for 15 minutes and strain) and brine solution. Refrigerate for 24hours.\n\nAfter that, serve those delicious quick pickled veggies over tacos, on top of fish, grilled pork or stuff inside Cornish game hens with croutons/stale baked bread and bake.

            "A lot of boomer parents still don\u2019t understand it\u2019s a different economy. Most of the world stays with their parents until they are prepared to move out. At 18, my dad had a high school diploma and got a job as soon as he applied to Inland Steel in the 70s making $13 an hour. Adjusted for inflation that\u2019s like $60 in today\u2019s money. My brother has an accounting degree and barely makes $18 an hour. My dad\u2019s always rubbing it in his face, \u201cAt your age, I had already moved out blah blah blah\u201d.   ",

Whenever I talk with anyone who speaks about wanting to move out young, I beg them to stay unless their home life is as bad as mine was.\n\nI was very very lucky, I'm in the UK, the benefit system helped me out and kept me alive. But even so, I've couch surfed, gone three months living on leftovers I was able to scavenge from friends and lived without power and heat because I had to choose between bills and food and decided that food was the better option.\n\nPLEASE, if you can stay at home, stay at home!",

            "The whole \"moving out after 18\" culture in US was started in the 50s when the housing, real state, bank lobby started pushing the philosophy among the general public.\n\nMoving out was pushed as being independent, being a man, and someone who lives with the family started being shamed for being a loser. Just think about it, all throughout human history, humans live with their parents and rest of family members. A family is a basic building block of a society and a country. But somehow, it is seen as something to be ahsmed of. A huge majority of population in the world don't move out, but that doesn't make them any less of a man, or does it? In fact, it is seen as a manly move because they are taking care of their parents and helping them out. \n\nThere is also another interesting story on how cigarette companies made women smoke. The tobacco lobby on advice of the nephew of Sigmund Freud basically hired bunch of actresses to stand in busy squares at new York posing as normal pedestrians, and made them smoke cigarettes. This created a debate on how these women were independent and empowered modern women free from patriarchy. Next thing you know, cigarette sales among women sky rocketed, and this is how the tobacco lobby doubled their customer market. ",

It works fine and is enough until they are mature enough to own an actual phone. When I was in first grade my first phone was a flip phone and I had it for a good reason (I needed to have a way to contact parents).

I\u2019d almost like to say they shouldn\u2019t have a phone until high school but middle schoolers often need one to an extent.

But I honestly don\u2019t see a true need for a child to have internet on their phone at such a young age. I think a lot of people would agree that kids these days (and plenty of young adults) are addicted to their phones, so not providing internet access so early on might be one way to prevent that.\n\nEdit: when I say don\u2019t provide internet access, I only mean through a smartphone. Kids will definitely need the internet for school work and some console games, and that\u2019s okay!",

We're at the point where it doesn't really mater bc the graphics are so good. Game developers should try to focus on making their games smaller (storage wise) and getting them to require less powerful equipment. I and most other people don't want to or can't spend 5k+ on a gaming pc to experience their games at 4k 512 fps. I'd like to be able to play nice games on my laptop without it sounding like a plane or turning into a heater. And it's ridiculous that on a 500 Gb device I could have like 3 or 4 modern AAA games.\n\nEdit: to everyone saying this isn't an unpopular opinion, please look at one of the several hundred comments calling me an idiot. To those calling me an idiot, this is my ***opinion*** based on what I, someone not in the industry, has seen and experienced. I'm saying that developers should focus less on graphics and more on optimization and building better stories or making their maps actually playable and not 90% inaccessible, or physics engines that work. There are other more important factors in a game than trying to achieve an unachievable dream of perfect graphics. \n\nAnd to everyone calling me a poor person, just- stop? I'm not and that wasn't the point of this post. You're just making yourself look like a dick biscuit.\n\nOkay because apparently I have to explain this to some people like they're 5, good or bad graphics do not nessasarily mean other aspects are good or bad. But development has limited resources and I feel that if studios were to focus on other more important aspects of the games they make it would lead to a better game and experience. It doesn't matter how good your graphics are if everything else suffers from it. I got tired of playing AC Valhalla because I spent more time in loading screens than the actual game play. And that's with having the entire game loaded on M.2 ssd, which the game took up a massive portion of the storage.",

            "I disagree, and kind of want to say prude, but in reality you're just very vanilla and that's totally valid.\n\nAs someone who calls their partner Daddy all the time, I'll explain my thoughts on the matter.\n\nFor one, it's pretty common at least in the bedroom for partners to have roles. My partner is 8 years older than me, dominant, and I would definitely consider them authoritative in a fun way.\n\nSecond, considering that it's not actually incest, I believe this to be a private matter between two people In a relationship, and that's their right.\n\nThird, BDSM. Role play such as this is very common. Personally things like Daddy Dom / Little Girl or similar also turns me off and I find a bit strange. But merely calling someone daddy, that doesn't have any incest undertones, especially since partners of Daddies don't need to identify as a 'little.'\n\nSo I think it really depends on the context and situation. Otherwise it's just a pet name like anyone else uses on their partner. \n\nJust as I call some friends boss when they're not my boss, or sister when they're just one of my girlfriends.\n\nLastly, I don't think everyone is taken to a place of incest. I am certainly not, it doesn't make me think of my father. It's just hot to be treated as a younger plaything sometimes.\n\nI don't think it's weird I just think most people don't know about it or the details of what it means.\n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfa4",

            "Fathers are seen as someone who is successful and mature. They\u2019ve successfully procreated and have survived long enough to do so. This is a primitive / instinctual look at it. Psychologically speaking, women with good childhood relationships with their father are more likely seek out people similar to their father, so this could have sparked the phrase to be used and then it developed into something more popular over time. Then we have the thought of who calls a person \u201cdaddy\u201d. While you aren\u2019t wrong with the incest answer, it\u2019s more symbolic of a small and weak girl clinging to her father for reasons. In that scenario, the father is seen as a protector, someone who is strong and trusted. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s personal taste. Some people like it, some people don\u2019t.

I read that they inactivated the account after that. Not only in that town, but people all over Texas are calling for his job. I could be mistaken, but I think it said he has another family with one of the other women. I just don\u2019t get it. I also don\u2019t know how people think they can keep that hidden either.",
            "Yeah wish this was popular. Would\u2019ve saved me a couple times in life by now...",
            "I agree and I should note that I have done this and it's never gone over well.    I have also been the one being cheated on and let the other female know she was the other woman (not in marriage in dating) and she could care less, continued to date the guy so I presumed she knew already.     But the one time I did tell the fiancee that her fiance was cheating with me (I was clueless she lived in another city) she berated and blamed me.  They got married and he ended up cheating on her again a few years later and they divorced.  Social media is grand.  I don't regret it though I would do it again.    I think the reason it's not recommend is that often you are blamed and often people are motivated to do it either out of revenge or to try and get their lover to be with them. I would say if your motive is revenge or to hurt someone else or to try to get your lover to stay with you it may not be worth it for your own sanity.  But personally I would want someone to tell me.",
            "Back in the summer some dude I used to be friends with messaged me wanting me to be his side bitch and sent me pictures/videos I definitely didn't want to see. So I screenshot it all and sent it to his girlfriend, who he has a child with.",

            "When I was much younger and a little more stupid, I was unwittingly the other woman. The friend I was messing around with said he didn't want anything serious, and neither did I, so I thought everything was fine. Then I found out that he had developed feelings for his roommate and they started emotionally investing in one another, which is GREAT because it's always nice when people can connect like that, except for the fact that he had been sleeping with me during the entire time they were together. I went to his apartment and told the other woman what all had been happening and dropped off all the random crap he had left at my place since I didn't want to give him any reason to talk to me again.\n\nThat's when I found out that the guy had been lying about me and saying I was being creepy borderline stalking him, and she didn't believe a word of what I said. I lost a large chunk of my social group from the fallout of this. It was ultimately the right thing to do and the people who sided with them were no real loss all things considered, but sometimes truth and justice don't prevail. Sometimes bad people get away with doing bad things, and people who try to do the right thing get screwed. I'm not saying people who find out they're being used to cheat shouldn't tell the person being cheated on, but they should prepare themselves for the shitstorm that's about to be whipped up.",

For many people it takes more than one time of getting caught to give up the person they've invested time and love into.\n\nIf you're the person who found out that your SO is married or in a relationship, their spouse/so will most likely blame you and forgive their cheater. Especially if they have kids.\n\nI've done it. It's not the payoff you think it is.",

            "Agreed i will message the person she cheated on and we can embarrass tf out of her",

But I think people keep quiet because they either feel ashamed and don't want to be judged for something they had no control over (that is if they didn't know a person they're having sex with has a partner), or they don't want to be responsible for breaking up someones marriage, so they rather just back down quietly. \nLet me just add, a woman beign the one doing the cheating or beign someones lover would probably receive more hate than the man in the same position in my opinion.",
            "This can be incredibly subjective. \n\nI have been the \u201cother woman\u201d several times and only once did I try to tell the girl, but she didn\u2019t believe me and accused me of trying to break them up so I can get with her boyfriend (the one who already was \u201cwith\u201d me). Then, the guy got mad that I tried to out him and he said he wished he never touched me. This screwed with my head in so many ways. My integrity was questioned and either way, once word got out, I\u2019d be the \u201chome wrecker\u201d or any other derogatory term for mistress. It became clear at that time that I was never good enough to be the one in a relationship, just the side piece, and I had believed it. Somehow, the blame got placed on the third person, not the one who actively cheated, so I learned to stay quiet. \n\nNow I will say that if I knew someone was in a monogamous relationship and they wanted to initiate stuff with me, I would remind them they are in a relationship. 9/10 times they did not care. If people want to cheat, they\u2019re going to cheat. \n\nI\u2019ve learned and grown from those experiences and I\u2019m in a solid, committed relationship now. I just wanted to point out that while I agree with your opinion, humans are assholes who will make the person outside of the relationship the bad guy just to save face.",

            "if you know about it at all expose it imo lol\n\nbut also a big issue in the first place is people staying/continuing in unhealthy/unsatisfying relationships. communication is important, and if you find youre unhappy with who youre with, its so so important to talk it out, and if you find out its for the better you go, *especially* if theyre not even trying to listen, then thats how it should be.\n\nbut nah, people would rather be liars, cheaters, and cut far deeper by doing so rather than just being mature and understanding about it.",

He has a long-time girlfriend who I was unable to get into contact with (can't reach her on Facebook or by phone). \n\nPart of me wanted to make a post, and spread his photos all over the internet (which probably would have ruined his business he has spent years building, maybe ruined his relationship and possibly broken some of his friendships). But I knew that anger was coming from a wrathful place and (personally) I didn't want to be vengeful, so for MY OWN SAKE I just cut him off and went about my life. \n\nThe guilt ate away at him and he ended up telling his friends what he did, and only one of the friends reached out to me, so that just showed me the whole group of friends weren't people I want in my life anyway, since they didn't care what he did and just shrugged it off. \n\nSometimes \"exposure\" can backfire on you, or make you even more hurt that no one is as out-raged as you are.",

The \u2018other\u2019 has zero responsibilities to the couple. Am I, being the \u2018other\u2019, going to get a medal or some kind of reward for being honest? No. The cheater should care about the relationship, not the \u2018other\u2019. If an individual cheats, there\u2019s deep rooted problems in the relationship that aren\u2019t resolved. Sometimes couples who have problems and individuals cheat, they might eventually resolve those issues and become faithful to each other again, so it\u2019s not for me to start uprooting someone\u2019s relationship by getting involved in the politics of it.\n\nIf you sleep with someone and they\u2019re in a relationship, but you\u2019re ignorant of the fact and never find out they have a partner, it doesn\u2019t change your life. If you do discover that they have a partner and it bothers you, end it with them, but you\u2019re no saint by going to the partner.\n\nGoing to the partner of the cheater is no different than meddling in a relationship and giving people advice as to why their partner does a certain thing, telling your friend they should get their partner to stop or start doing something, putting judgments or insecurities in a friend\u2019s head about their partner and maybe convincing them to dump them, etc. You going to the partner to tell them they\u2019re with a cheater is just shitty of you in most cases. The only individuals that it might be ok, depending on the circumstances, to tell someone they\u2019re being cheated on is if you\u2019re close with them (friend/family) and have seen them cheat, but are not involved as the \u201cother\u201d. Even still, there\u2019s great potential that it can rip your relationship apart with them if you are a friend/family, so you have to scope out the situation, because not all situations are equal. \n\nIf you intentionally sleep with someone you know is looking to cheat and go tell their significant other, you\u2019re a worse person than the cheater. \u201cTraps\u201d are the worst individuals in the equation.\n\nIf my partner and I have a great relationship, which we do, and they decide to \u2018cheat\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t want to know.

Not a guy who has an arrogant ego or enjoys drama or anything like that. He is a really good person.

My ex DID eventually confess.\n\nIt was painful and crappy...drama...all that fun stuff, you know how it can go. I told our friend he shouldn't stop being friends with my ex if he didn't want to after all this...but, I think he has significantly reduced hanging out with him and talking to him much anymore on his own.\n\nI deeply appreciate how my friend came through for me, and how he went about it. He was really great. It feels like we became a bit closer after all that stuff happened, and then calmed down. I prefer that my friends be honest with me about betrayals and bad things like that to me, rather than keeping it to themselves if they found out. I would find it MORE painful if they found out and did nothing. In fact, I would lose any trust in them as friends if they were like that. That's just me, though.",

By your logic, I imagine you\u2019d hold it against the victim because they didn\u2019t take action to prevent it from happening to someone else. It\u2019s just such an overly simplistic high horse to sit on when the right course of action is so nuanced.",
            "My friend is cheating on his girl. Should I tell her? Do this girl I know nothing about a favor? Should I fuck over my friend who I've known for 10 years? A friend that's helped me out hundreds of times. A friend I've starved with. Should I lose my friend so I can go to bed for a few days thinking how much of a good person I am? \n\nLife isn't black and white, and you absolutely don't have to do anything.",
            "Not my business",
            "I disagree. Alot of the times I hear about people cheating I end of empathizing with the cheater. Some of the times the person getting cheated on is somewhat responsible. Does it justify their actions no but I have trouble seeing cheating as this morally evil thing 100% of the time. Also an anecdote one of the women I who cheated with me had an abusive boyfriend it would have been incredibly irresponsible and cruel of me to tell the guy. Situations like that make me also want to tell the other person less bc I might not know everything that's going on at home.",
            "But why? there is nothing to gain and everything to lose. I dont care about people i dont know",
            "Definitely agree. \n\nOne problem I\u2019ve seen is where they know about what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re fine with it. (Even choosing to go out of their way to help the cheater hide with them). \n\nCan\u2019t remember when but there was a post somewhere and a guy was saying he specifically sought out married women because it was his \u201cthing\u201d. \nNot sure how common that feeling is but I feel like it\u2019s more often than not they know about it, and just don\u2019t care/agree to hide it.",
            "Yeah probably the right thing to do. But may as well make the most of the situation and maybe let it go for a little longer before outing the person to the partner. What's a little more if you've already crossed the line?\n\nTo be fair, I'm not sure if I'd tell the other person, but at the very least I wouldn't consider the person as someone to date myself, and commit to, cos if it's happening to this other dude, it'll eventually come around and happen to you.",
            "Nah not a matter of whose business sometimes you gotta move on.  Giving that relationship energy is pointless",
            "I have actually been the other person three times and each time, I told the guy\u2019s girlfriend. Every time, she\u2019d be angry for a minute but then as it pans out, she stays with him. \n\nI\u2019m going to keep ratting out these awful dudes, but when I bemoaned this to my therapist, she told me that infidelity isn\u2019t actually a reason people will break up with their partner. It\u2019s usually things like no longer finding things in common, different goals in life, etc.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t know. Try your best but some people just can\u2019t leave their cheating partners.\n\nEdit: By the way, that quote\u2019s from Mean Girls lol. Tina Fey wrote it.",

            "Eh, it really depends. I understand where youre coming from, but at the same time, I'm not responsible for someone not knowing how to be in a monogamous relationship. This goes for both if I'm involved and if I'm just a witness. If its people I know closely, I will tell the cheater that theyre wrong for doing so, etc, but at the end of the day, it's their job to fess up, not mine, bc thats how you end up as a dead messenger, so to speak. Some people redirect the anger of finding out at the messenger, and honestly, I don't need that headache. \n\nIf youre an adult, take responsibility for your own actions. Anytime I've ever encountered a girl who 'loves to cheat', I forewarn them that theyre a shitty person for doing so and if they arent committed to the person, they should just end it. If they still choose to cheat, whatevs, it truly isnt my problem. I've done what I'm willing to do in such a situation.",
            "It takes two to have an affair.\n\nIf you unknowingly entered this situation, than yes you are a victim of lies. \n\nBut if you knowingly seduced a married person into an affair, than you are just as bad if not worse than the married person having the affair. \n\nOnly snakes mess around with married people. Low lifes and snakes.",
            "People cheat for all kinds of reasons, many of them valid. Maybe their spouse has lost all interest in sex but refuses to open the relationship, or maybe they\u2019re satisfying a kink their partner won\u2019t consider, or maybe their partner is physically unable to engage them sexually.\n\nIf you are the other person and you don\u2019t want to be, end it. That\u2019s all you need to do. The person you\u2019re with may be a cheating piece of shit, or they may be a decent person doing everything they can to hold things together in a terrible situation. Have some fucking compassion for the person you\u2019ve been fucking as well as their partner.",
            "Anytime I see a random man I don\u2019t know requesting to message me with a pick up line, a young girl, and the man has an obvious WIFE or girlfriend in his IG bio with the wife\u2019s \ud83d\udc8d@ I always screenshot, send it to her, and block him.",
            "Maybe in some contexts. I was the other woman and knew it, and I would never, ever tell the spouse because it would blow up her life, their kids\u2019 lives and his. All because we had lust and let it overpower us? \n\nShe\u2019s the one he has remained going home to, caring for in sickness and health, and sharing life with. Not me. That dedication shows where his love really is and the momentary lust we shared pales in comparison. \n\nHe has to live with what he did, and it\u2019s hurt him to the point where he\u2019s a different, serious person. It\u2019s not something he\u2019ll do again. Why the hell would I want to cause them pain? I don\u2019t want to blow up their lives in a way that could be terrible for their poor, innocent kids.",
            "I did tell her. She suspected but no clue it had been going on for a year. She said it was her fault, I told her no, no its not.  She started having sex with him after I told her, they wanted to save the marriage. About 2.5 years later he came sniffing around again.  I didn't tell her this time..keeping track of him after knowing he'd been involved in an emotional and physical relationship with me for year...it falls on her to keep him reined in. Yup, they're still together.",
            "I do not agree with that statement. Because it always depends on the situation. I do not approve of cheating by any stretch of the imagination, BUT, if I find out someone cheated with me, and I know the other person, and maybe is my friend, YES I would tell it to my friend. If I have no clue who this other person is I would definetily keep myself of of that. But because I do not approve of it, I would cut ties with the cheater. Just because I dont approve of cheating, does not mean that I need to involve myself into situations that are none of my concern!",
            "**STOP**. Yes, cheaters are bad, but you don't know what their situation is. They could be attempting to escape abuse, and by 'exposing' them, you can be directly perpetrating domestic abuse by informing an abuser.\n\nYou're one of those who like to go up to depressed looking people and tell them that they are just 'faking it' or 'looking for attention', and then turn surprised when they commit suicide. You think you are bringing some self righteous sense of justice in pointing out people's 'mistakes', when in reality your naivete gave rise to clueless delusions that can ruin an innocent persons lives. This is a classic karen move.\n\nWhat you *should* be doing is going up to the 'cheater', clarifying the situation with them. Understand what is going on first before taking action. If you have the emotional maturity of more than a 5 year old, you would confront the perpetrator instead of tattle-taling around.",

You could be just paying more attention to those that disagree. \n2. for the sake of argument , lets suppose that the majority of redditors disagree with this opinion. People who make use reddit is one cohort, you are not getting broader feedback. I'll give you some extreme examples- if you asked people who shop at whole foods if they prefer organic, there mostly likely to say yes; if you ask seniors if they use tiktok, hey most likely will say no; if you ask people in rehab if they have used drugs before, there gonna say yes;-  in all theses scenarios, it can not be said that everyone everywhere agrees.     \n3.

The whole online multiplayer aspect is sometimes made into the main focus in certain franchises. Which is a shame, as the game loses a lot of the morr important aspects such as the mentioned story etc, all to make budget for online modes.\nCall fo Duty managed to balance all that out, but they almost gave up single player, thinking Games don't need it. What a load of bs... CEOs thinking single player games are dying. Yes they see dying, because you're not producing them. Loot boxes suddenly became the best income multipliers.

You have a lot and I mean a lot of games where the central point isnt the story, like RTS games.\n\n3: Is also purely game type based, almost every game I play multiplayer I can pause. This is definatly the case because I play a lot of strategy, so like I said  its based on the type of game.\n\n4: Also purely game type based\n\n5: your opinion\n\nBut it is still your opinion, dont know if it actually is unpopular but I havent seen it yet so you get my upvote.",

I think you're right on most of the stuff you brought up, but I don't think it's fair to say that offline games are outright better.\n\nThere are many moments I've had in online games that are simply impossible to replicate in offline games. I've had long friendships with people I've never met in person thanks to online games. My progression in a game matters a lot more to me when I have friends to show off to. Similarly, raiding in mmos has given me some of the most fulfilling accomplishments I've had in gaming. There's nothing like overcoming a challenge by coordinating and strategizing as a group, especially when you're all extremely skilled and knowledgeable.\n\nActually, I got a similar feeling from making good calls in mmos as I do now working in the medical technology field. I have to adapt to situations on the fly to make sure everything goes smoothly with the rest of my team, whether it be in surgery or a less intense setting. That's not a feeling of accomplishment I've ever gotten in an offline game.",
            "I personally prefer online games because for me video games are a test of skill. I enjoy trying to best other players, and with modern online matchmaking and ranking systems you can climb up ladders and have tangible feedback on how good you are compared to the world. \n\nI also prefer playing online co-op in certain games like Minecraft and most Paradox Grand strategy games. It's fun to just play and chat with a friend while doing it - even if your goals arent always the same. Trading and helping each other when needed (or betraying each other) also has some charm. \n\nI've become basically incapable of playing Single Player games. I don't find the same satisfaction from playing something alone without anyone else present to talk to. I've been almost forcing myself to progress through the Tomb Raider remakes because I want to enjoy single player games, but it is really hard to get into the game when in the back of my mind I'm thinking about playing something with a friend who just came online instead. \n\nThat being said, I'm not sure your opinion is completely unpopular. I know plenty of people who like single player games more than multiplayer games. (And SP games are a subset of offline for sure). \n\nI am curious though, you started the post with \" I'll make it clear I don't hate every online game\" as if you don't hate Splatoon but you do hate most other online games. Is it that you hate them, or just prefer offline? I've never really met people who hate online gaming but like offline gaming, but I've met people who prefer singleplayer games and are more apathetic toward multiplayer.",

            "YES",
            "You have all the right to not like super hero movies, but I must disagree with \"they all use the same formula\". For me at least, every marvel movie feels different. Some have more jokes, some are more serious. And also, the idea of a shared universe is simply awesome because it makes so much sense! I would love so much a shared Pokemon universe, with different protagonists, or a proper DC universe, the Dark Universe that Universal tried to do, it's awesome exactly because there's always a movie to see. It's always so sad (to me) when I watch a 2 hour movie, absolutely love the concept and the characters, and that's it, no sequels, no prequels, it's done, they're all dead or whatever. And, it also gives more liberty than a simple series, because each move works with a different protagonist, and sometimes the protagonists from other movies can also appear. It's just an amazing concept.",
            "That's like saying Horror is boring. Or westerns are boring. The Comic book movie is now a genre of its own, calling a genre boring isn't an opinion, it's downright stupid. There's tons of variety with the CBM genre itself. \n\nI see that you've said \"there's no originality, no attempt to divert the formula\" but there's tons of shit in the MCU that's exactly like that. Winter soldier couldn't be more different when compared to Guardians of the Galaxy. Ant Man and the Wasp was incredibly minute in it's scope compared to Civil War. Infinity War, Civil War and Ragnarok all had villains win instead of heroes. Dr Strange was a psychedelic visual spectacle, The First Avenger is an 80s period piece, and the Iron Man trilogy is one of the most complete arcs for a solo character with a concrete beginning, middle and end. \n\nUpvoted cause it's definitely unpopular, but superhero movies kick ass. You might not be entertained, but most people do love them, and with good reason. ",

            "I recommend you try watching Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2.\n\nIt's what all marvel movies should have been like, and is a good blend of action, comedy, emotional scenes and stunning visual effects.\n\nThe avengers movies in my opinion are terrible and just a game of how many characters can we fit into a single movie to please the fans. Thanos had the right idea, cull a bunch of redundant characters so hopefully the next movie won't be so suffocating.\n\nA list of movies I *would* recommend:\n\n - Guardians of the galaxy 1 and 2\n\n - Doctor strange\n\n - Ant man (I havn't seen the second yet, so have no opinoin)\n\n - Iron man (Only the first)\n\nI wouldn't call these superhero movies. They involve characters that are clearly flawed and while they are seen doing amazing things and heroic things, they are more complex than both of those labels.",

I don\u2019t hate these films, I\u2019m just really really underwhelmed with most of them. Even Avengers IW which I thoroughly enjoyed and thought was the best of the Marvel films I\u2019ve seen was rather ridiculous at parts. A good film, yes definitely but it being treated as a cinematic masterpiece by many is absurd.\n\n\nI also can\u2019t really stand the Marvel approach to humor, they undercut serious moments with cheesy, shitty jokes way too often. It\u2019s seeping out into other franchises at this point, see Star Wars: TLJ for an example of that done in the worst way possible.\n\nI don\u2019t want Marvel movies to go away, in fact I enjoy them every now and then and actively seek some out. I\u2019m just sick of them dominating the film industry",

            "They are alright. Thats why they are so successful. They are solid popcorn cinema that is not daring.  \n  \nUnfortunately for a movie to be compelling and interesting it needs to have a sufficient amount of ingredients. And the more ingredients it has the bigger can be the payoff for a single viewer but at the same time it can rub other viewers the wrong way.  \n  \nLook at alita. It was a Fresh IP to anyone who was not familiar with the IP which is most people. It was executed very well. Had somewhat of a (one sided) love story world building it threw a lot at the viewer. I had a blast. But many viewers disliked one thing or the other about the movie.  \n  \nSadly being daring is not being rewarded in therms of $$ . Okay action mixed in with some slapstick is.   ",

            "Agreed definitely. I think I just really don't like the idea of the studio having sooo many similar films all lined up and planned out because it's currently profitable. I mean in 2019 there's hellboy, another marvel film, an avengers film, another ant man film, another spider man and another star wars. I mean it's like christ at least have a breather, you know? I understand that they'd rather go with a steady safe income than risk something innovative flopping but it's suffocating. 2020 I'm seeing another 3 marvel films out, it's more frequent than the seasons of a TV show.\n\nAlso there are definitely exceptions but I feel like most of these films take themselves sooo damn seriously, particularly those ones directed by Snyder. When I was younger I loved Tim Burton's batman films, they were so fun and theatrical, but the current Marvel films are a different beast. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/rant.

Maybe not going to be popular forever, but hollywood will keep pumping them out untill they aren't. \n\nGive it time and they will fade, things like this usually do. But calling it a fad is just incorrect at this point. \n\n\nP.S. dont didmiss them all out of hand as boring and samey. Admittedly many are, but there are some that are objectively great movies. Winter soldier is the best James Bond movie we've had in a decade. Spiderverse absolutely deserved that best animated film oscar. Ragnarock was a boring action film but a great comedy.

What bothers me too especifically with the MCU is the cringe jokes. I'd say just about 10% are genuinely funny the rest if like <10 year old humor. They just feel forced and out of place.  The worst part is that DCU has seen this trend and the succes and are now doing the exact same lol. Which i'd be ok if they were copying good films but they arent.

It's the highest grossing franchise in history.\n\nI don't think superhero films are a mere fad.\n\nBut as a fan, I completely get why you're indifferent toward them. A lot of Marvel films are starting to look and feel the same. The cinematography was completely asleep at the wheel behind Captain Marvel, for instance. I might be one of the few MCU fans who was *underwhelmed* by Avengers Infinity War. The stakes just felt...not there.\n\nIt's hard to take death seriously in a franchise with multiple sequels in the work of characters the movie *supposedly* killed off. \n\nBut some films like Logan or The Dark Knight give me hope.\n\nSuperheroes have brand recognition. The Superman symbol is like McDonalds. It's never going away.\n\nA *true* fad was something like Disco. \n\nSuperhero films are way too varied in tone to be lumped in the same category as Disco. \n\nThis upcoming Joker film with Joaquin Phoenix looks like an intense character study. It doesnt 'feel' like a comic book film. The trailer had none of the traditional \"woosh\" action sound effects. It was just a moody display of a man clearly being beaten down by life.\n\nIt may annoy you that superhero films get hyped to death, but consider the *good* that they actually bring.\n\nSuperhero comic books in the 60s were many children's first exposure to diversity. Through modern filmmaking, a movie like Black Panther was able to *get made* in a Hollywood system that would normally have sneered at the idea of 200 million action film starring an all black cast and touching on themes of racism/prejudice. \n\nThe movie is called *Black Panther* for god's sake. \n\nThese superhero films, while many lack subtlety, are touching on a wide variety of issues that touch a large amount of people. If they're not for you then that's cool, but it's dangerous to just see them as mindless entertainment when they actually do have a lot of relevant stuff to say about society.",

            "I agree, provided you are actually describing the person. I think the clear distinction is when you refer to someone's skin colour/ethnicity in circumstances where you wouldn't \"describe\" (point out their skin colour) them if they were white, or you're not actually describing them - e.g. you point out their ethnicity but no other distinguishing features and it's clear you're not actually trying to paint a picture of the person. \n\nBasically, I think the distinction is this: if you wouldn't point out that someone is caucasion, you're probably not actually describing their appearance, so don't point out if they're not.",

Are you endorsing any stereotypes with this story? What are you really saying when you bring up someone's skin color? If it's not important to the story, I'd say drop it.\n\nSecond: do you actually describe every white person you talk about as white? The issue with bringing up skin color is that it's so often used to \"other\" someone. Like \"Well they're obviously not white and I have to bring this up\". This leads back to the first point - it shows bias, unconscious or otherwise.\n\nUsing it to literally just differentiate someone or describe someone \"Hey, remember Josh? The Black guy from stats class?\" is not offensive.

            "So this is very much a problem with the way people are socialized, here in America at least. We are taught from a very early age to ignore our race and anything that it might mean.

Obviously as time moves forward and our general understanding of the situation changes it becomes harder to hide our \"white identity\" from ourselves. This is accentuated by the fact that WE are the only ones blind to the facts of what it means to be white. I'm not here to define that mess though\n\nPretty much of everyone else in the world has to come to terms with the idea of their particular race. Some places it's not a big deal, others, it really is. The point is, if someone is making a fuss about recognizing someone else's race it usually denotes a lack of time or attention of thought to one's own race.

The implication you stated in your last sentence isn\u2019t the only reason/implication for the hesitation either. That\u2019s a developed behavior due to a plethora of possible events. Mostly it happens through personal experience. The person has either seen someone called out/been called out themselves for the thing you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t offensive. That\u2019s the thing about perception. You can\u2019t tell someone else what offends them (unless they\u2019re easily susceptible to peer influence). These things may not offend you but someone else might only know of it being used in a derogatory fashion and thus will be led to perceive it as offensive. Then they\u2019ll start calling people out for these things they only know to find offensive (and justifiably so due to their lack of perspective) and the cycle continues. Both parts feed off each other and will continue to spread until logical conversations are had. I think the point you\u2019re making is extremely important because those discussions need to be had to further educate those that perceive things like this as malicious in nature. I just don\u2019t agree with the whole \u201cif you do this than this is what you\u2019re implying\u201d thing because that\u2019s only your perception yet it\u2019s said as such a definitive statement.",

Which brings to question, why would you feel a need to go out of your way and bring attention to that distinction if someone didn't directly ask about it or if their race has nothing to do with the story?",

And you just have to give credit where credits due. But lately I've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. Sometimes I feel like I should laugh at the cleverness of some. But it happens so often and in so many posts that I find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. Not unless there's just a golden moment. I've even begun to roll my eyes the moment I open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. I NEVER ROLL MY EYES. At anything. \n\nI used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately I've been really turned off by it. Maybe I just need a break.\n\n\nEdit: THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD AND SILVER!  Wow. This blew up... I just wanna add something to this. I'm not saying it's bad to have some fun in the comments. One of you pointed out that it's okay to be serious and to have fun. I agree. I'm saying that when I'm intrigued by a post sometimes I really want to see what the reddit community has to say about it... or to see if there's additional information in the comments. But a lot of the time all I see for miles is the repetitive back and forth joking. Sometimes I really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...\n\nEdit: I never talked about acceptance speeches being annoying. I also never gave one. I said thank you. I'm learning real quick that a lot of people don't actually read your posts before commenting. Lmao",

It honestly feels like cheating. Why would you need to get sexual gratification somewhere else when I am literally right here willing to give you all the material you could ever want? Why do you need to get that from another woman? \n\nI'm currently in a serious relationship and I've talked this through with my partner and he is ok with it and respects my boundaries. I am completely committed to the person I'm dating and I will only go to them for things that I deem exclusive to a romantic relationship, therefore I expect the same from them. When I masturbate I only masturbate to them and I expect the same. When I feel genuine romantic emotions, I only feel them toward them, and I expect the same. The reason being is that I am very, very serious about long term relationships and I'd feel like I was doing something very wrong if I thought of anyone else in this way.\n\nIf you've discussed it with your partner and you're both ok with porn, thats cool, but I've been pressured by multiple people in the past to act like I'm ok with it, but I just never have been. Porn is something I'm highly uncomfortable with, it makes me feel jealous and betrayed and it makes me feel like I'm not good enough. Those should be valid emotions to feel, but people try to make it seem like its irrational to feel that way when I truly believe it isn't. \n\nI know a lot of people feel the same way as me, just know that its ok to set boundaries in your relationship because your feelings are just as valid as your partner's. That goes for anything, really.\n\nEdit: How I sleep knowing that I have a healthy relationship with someone I love and respect. \ud83d\ude34\ud83d\ude34\ud83d\ude34",

            "So are you OK with openly talking about all sexual fantasies with your partner?",
            "Watching people in this thread absolutely bend over backwards to defend the idea of watching pornography is insane to me. How is it controlling to ask your partner to not watch other people fucking? Would your opinion be changed if OP's partner were going to a friend's house to watch two people fuck and masterbate in the corner? (I'm not trying to strawman; this is a genuine question because in my mind they are not very different from each other.) Porn has been proven time and time again to impact sexuality. Wanting your intimate relationship with your partner to progress at a natural pace is not controlling, imo. \n\nPeople are bringing up the idea of \"thought policing\" in regards to OP's partner's masturbatory practices. While I can sort of understand arriving at that conclusion, I highly doubt OP is popping in every time their partner masturbates to be like \"hey, make sure you're thinking about me.\" I'm pretty sure it was a one time conversation where she made her preferences known, and she trusts her partner to make private decisions in regards to that boundary.\n\nI understand that people have sexual needs, and that sometimes they just want to cum. I do not think that all people who use pornography on a regular basis are bad people with ill intentions. However, when you're in a long-term relationship with someone, I don't think its controlling or insecure to ask your partner to not watch porn. Porn is idealistic and largely plays at humanity's base fantasies - aka, big breasts/penises, \"ideal\" looking genitalia, and overall extremely \"attractive\" people. I'd feel pretty insecure if my partner was consitently seeking sexual content from people who look very different from me.\n\nIdk, maybe I'm the weird one here, but I agree with OP. I don't think its controlling as long as it's something that's talked about early and with tact in a relationship. If you wouldn't want to date somebody who wouldn't want you watching porn, that's fine!! But defending porn as a morally neutral thing is just pretty silly, imo. I just think it's weird that people are accusing OP of being controlling and trying to change her opinion. There are plenty of valid reasons to dislike porn, especially in a longterm romantic relationship.",
            "I couldn\u2019t imagine asking someone to not watch it. To each their own though. \n\nAs long as you find someone who\u2019s comfortable with your boundary, you are in the right mind. Happy you\u2019re expressing your feelings. Most people wouldn\u2019t.",

            "I do have to point out a flaw in your opinion.  You feel that your partner watching porn is like cheating since he is getting gratification without you. You even went on to say,\n\n \u201c Why would you need to get sexual gratification somewhere else when I am literally right here willing to give you all the material you could ever want?\u201d\n\nBut at the same time you masturbate.  Even if your masturbating to your partner,  why do that when your partner is literally right here willing to give you the material you could ever want?\n\nIf you say your apart from each other so that\u2019s why you masturbate, can\u2019t he say the same thing about porn when your not together?",

            "I don't share your opinion, but  this is not why I am commenting. Just some general thoughts on the things you wrote:\n\n- Why would you expect not having any romantic and erotic feelings for other people while in a relationship? I think these are perfectly natural emotions to feel also in a monogamous relationship and I don't think you should suppress them\n\n- Also, being jealous or feeling betrayed is something I think you have to work on mostly on your own (reason are often the fear of loosing your partner or not being satisfied with your own life)\n\n- Expecting yourself or your partner to fulfill every need you will ever have is utopic and puts a lot of pressure on both of you. Not talking about sexual action here but other needs that might also make you jealous, like having other close friends of your gender etc.\n\nSo I wouldn't focus too much on whether this is a reasonable opinion or not, but why do you feel this way and if your ideas of a serious relationship are actually beneficial for your happiness, or if your restrictions and your jealousy are actually taking the room for being honest about all your feelings in the future.",

You say it yourself: I think I'm not good enough. That is a problem in YOUR head, not someone elses. It is definitely irrational because it consists purely your subjective view on things. You can't handle your partner watching porn even though it actually has nothing to do with you. You make it about you because you are insecure. Others should not have to deal with your insecurity, you do.\n\nOf course, mutual respect is important in a relationship and a partner needs to accept you have insecurities and  a hard time with things. That is different than obligating them to deal with it. That's very unhealthy for both you and them and it will cause possible problems in the future. \n\nYou should look for the reason why you are feeling this way instead of forcing others to accept it. Your feelings are not always showing you the right answer and you shouldn't act on them too much. \n\nI'm not saying your partner has the absolute right to watch porn and shouldn't give a shit about you. I read he respects you and won't watch it, which is very sweet of him, but it is also him acting on his feelings because he probably doesn't care much about porn and rather not watch than losing you.\n\nYour boyfriend accepting your demands is not proof your wants are justified. Both your feelings are okay and need to be respected, but do NOT expect every partner to be like this, because reasons I wrote above.\n\nNow what should you do and realize?\n\nAccept and see that you have personal problems and need to work on them, even though it doesn't seem necessary in your current relationship. Believe me, it is. It will help you feel better and more secure.\n\nI'm also not saying you should change your view on porn. Even after you could still dislike it and that's your choice. It's your reason behind it what bugs me and I definitely know it's not the right way to go forward.\n\nEdit: upvote because it is an actual unpopular opinion.",

            "I feel the same as you though I've been forced to kind of accept it. I don't see how watching strangers have sex is okay and \"means nothing\" when we know chemically that's not what happens in the brain of people, especially if followed by an orgasm that releases attachment chemicals in the brain. Why is watching strangers have sex irl or fantasizing about people you know/have met is not okay but anyone else who isn't immediately available to you is okay? \n\nClearly, it's because people know deep down you can't trust most people to not end up developing feelings if they have physical access to a person they dream about sexually, the brain is not a no strings attached kind of operation. If you daydream about your coworker, it can easily progress to daydreaming beyond sex and into \"how would it be to live with them\" and eventually you start acclimating to the idea and might one day make a move based on that.\n\nWhereas if you daydream about someone not accessible like a porn star, people think there is no threat, they are lying to themselves though, it doesn't stop the fantasies or emotional cheating that can go on, you can find yourself imagining this person or even a fantasy character during sex instead of your SO and unless this is something you're open about doing, most will not be comfortable with that. \n\nMy long time girlfriend and I had this issue. It wasn't so much porn, it's that during masturbation she would think of characters instead of me and while people are like \"this is FINE\" I'm just like, why? I just have to wonder why she would have chosen a character over me to imagine? There was clearly a reason. I never think of anyone else so this was weird for me, she told me I could but they can't be irl people, so I can fantasize about like Laura Croft, but not Angelina Jolie and not anyone we know. This is incredibly strange for me because I personally can't get off to the thoughts of a fake person. She also told me not to tell her about it, because she would end up jealous.\n\nSo all of this for me is just a wild ass ride of hypocrisy and excuses. OP is entirely valid.",

            "This is actually totally healthy I think. I'm into open relationships, so obviously my line is waaaaaayyy further back than porn. But we're all different! And its important to find partners with similar values to you and can respect your boundaries.",
            "This is frequent but so hypocritical.you say \"Boundries\" yet you take the right to decide what you bf is permitted to think about if he wants to have fantasies, and you assume he won't ever have a fantasy that he would not tell you about to ask for you permission to have it? Who made you emperor of is own mind? \n\n  Not surprising that you say or makes you very uncomfortable. But there's the problem: YOU feel uncomfortable about porn, it makes YOU feel jealous and worthless. That comes from YOUR insecurities. but you make your bf assume the responsability of shielding you from whatever could trigger your insecurities or he will face the consequences of how bad you will feel even if he is not in the least to blame for those feelings.  You see how that makes your claim to value both of your feelings the same so much contraditory? You value his feelings as long as they align exactly with yours, and you put your whole confidence in the relationship, as well as the trustworthyness of your bf on that concept. Don't be surprised if your whole world collapses one day",
            "As papa JT has said \"everyone, is someone else's foot\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere is a match for every kind of person out there, if you 2 both feel the exact same way then great! Fuck what everyone else says, this is your relationship and run it however you want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut understand that for most people this is ridiculous. I hope your boyfriend completely thinks this way as you do, because if he's doing this just to pleas you, soon or later this will become a problem.",
            "It sounds like you're pushing your insecurities on to your partner.\nFrom an objective view; you're only placing restrictions on your partner, this won't make your relationship stronger.\n\nWhilst you're claiming you're both having open and honest discussions about sexuality, I don't doubt that there is a lot being unsaid underneath the surface. He's probably just saying what you want to hear to make you happy.",
            "Jen? Lol",
            "Hey, if you can't share an unpopular opinion on r/unpopularopinions where can you? This way of thinking about porn isn't as common anymore but you're allowed to have your own standards in a relationship and to stick by them. \n\nThe only thing I would say as a counter argument is that masturbation can meet a different need for men (and women I'm sure) than actual sex. Obviously it's a problem if someone is masturbating instead of meeting your sexual needs, but I think both things can have a place in a healthy sexual relationship.",
            "I don't want to be in a porn with someone who wants to be in a relationship.",
            "As a sex worker this makes up a large percentage of my clients. \nThey will contact me saying \u201cmy wife never lets me watch porn, I would like to watch it with you, or thinks shower sex is taboo, role play, or I would like to try (usually something lame like \u201cdoggystyle\u201d gasp!!!!). \nMost of the time they try it and realize it was never a big deal in the first place but continue to see me, men don\u2019t like to feel judged sexually nor do woman. As a sexpert, I would say keep an open mind but always be respectful of boundaries. As long as you aren\u2019t hurting anyone let those freak flags fly!!",
            "If you aren't ok with someone relieving their sexual tension in their own (legal duh) way, you're toxic af.",
            "I\u2019m not gonna say anything. Cause I simply just don\u2019t understand this. But I will say if we dated you would be a really jealous person. But you think whoever you date won\u2019t watch porn? Feels bad for him man",
            "This totally comes off as over-controlling, but hey, as long as you and your SO are happy, it's all good. \n\nI also wouldn't date someone who demands to know where I've been, or regulates what I eat, or insists I send them good morning and good night texts. Obviously some couples enforce that, but I can't see why anyone would willfully enter into a partnership like that.",
            "This feels less like boundaries and more like control. You're basically sending the message that your partner cant have sexuality without you. And that's a red flag cause they had it before you came around and now you get to say what's right and wrong about it. If you go to the beach do you make him cover his eyes? Anyway, thanks for posting, here my upvote for actually having an unpopular opinion.",

Get over yourself",
            "I'm with you. I don't watch porn either.",

            "I thought you were going for somewhere else with that title, seems that you have no idea about how cruel the industry is",
            "Totally on your side with this one actually. Lots of people have the idea that because they watch it on their own that it won\u2019t affect others around them but that\u2019s not typically the case. There\u2019s lots of negative effects of porn when it comes to relationships with others. People can do what they please of course but I totally think you\u2019re valid in asking your partner to not watch it.",
            "I bet they still watch porn",
            "Masturbation has nothing to do with romantic emotions. Your request is honestly insane, but I'm glad your partner was willing to give it up for you.",
            "HAHAHA HE RESPECTS MY BOUNDARIES. So you telling him what he can and can't do with his body by himself is YOUR boundary? This is some INSANE hamster spinning and gaslighting.",
            "Actually good post.\n\nPornography has some negative effects on relationships in general, related to your brain processing pleasure as well as comparisons leading to insecurity and lack of desire for your partner.  \n\nAlso so much of it is unverified and probably underage or with people who never consented to have their naked bodies put up on the internet for some Chad to get off to in 43 seconds on his zoom call.",
            "Sounds like you're just very insecure, highly controlling and it's pretty toxic to any relationship.\nI was kinda the same way when I was younger but I realized how stupid I was being. Porn isn't cheating and it's asinine to think so - everyone is entitled to thier personal space, thoughts, fantasies regardless if they include you or not.\n\nIt'll probably click someday that, that behavior is what makes relationships fail. May need to work on your outlook on these things.",

My siblings would complain that their kids are addicted to phones and tablets, I told them that if they don\u2019t want them to throw a tantrum every time they can\u2019t have a phone, then they shouldn\u2019t give it to them in the first place, or at least limit their time. Of course it\u2019s useless since the easiest way to get them quiet and distracted is to give them a tablet.",

            "I got a phone when I was I think grade 4 or 5 and that was because I had to walk home after school alone or with my younger sister. My mom wasn't a bad mom for not picking us up, she was a working mom.",

            "When I was thirteen I didn\u2019t want a phone for my birthday, I wanted Pok\u00e9mon cards. My parents got me a phone. Did I use it? Barely. This was back when all that was out were flip phones. \n\nWhat these parents don\u2019t get is everything is on our phones. I got apps for my college classes on my phone, my banking app is on my phone, you can file your taxes on your phone. You can file for fasfa on your phone. Not to mention the game options and the internet. \n\nThese parents bitching about phone use are the same ones that spend all day on Facebook, or can\u2019t go 6 seconds without their phones either. I can\u2019t tell you how many times as a kid I\u2019ve sat at a restaurant and both of my parents are engrossed in their phones. It\u2019s almost hypocritical. And if I don\u2019t use it they complain.",
            "Totally agree. Kids are addicted to phones but so are the adults too they just like to point out the kids and not take a look in the mirror. I see more adults on their phone while driving than I do teenagers and that\u2019s frightening to me.",
            "Agreed. My brother's kids (7 & 4 yo) don't even know phones and tablets exist really. He and his wife have done an incredibly good job preventing the kids from even knowing about or wanting these damn devices. And his kids are great! They love to play and run around outside like kids should be doing, not sitting on the couch mesmerized by the screen.\n\nComes down to lazy parenting IMO. It's easy to just throw a tablet in front of a kid to go have a cocktail or something.",
            "I only partially agree with this. I know many peoples reaction to this is that parents are the main problem but I would say it\u2019s only half of the problem. I would honestly say it\u2019s more of a societal problem as most people have mobile devices. I\u2019m sure that pressures some people into having a phone because it\u2019s the norm. While I do think many people do not make good parents I don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely their fault but it does play a big role in development of their children. I think it would be better if parents bought their children phones for only the purpose of calling their parents or guardians for safety concerns. Maybe make your child work to get money to purchase their own phone once they are old enough to and are more mature. (My first phone was a crappy little flip phone but I could call and text my parents which was perfect for me, had no games or social media on it)",
            "Kids just mimic what everybody around them does. Everybody is absorbed in their phone, not just their parents, but their friends, and probably even their teachers too (not blaming you, just saving its a universal problem).\n\nAs you said, it's a societal issue",
            "Yes and no. I'm 17, a part of Gen Z, and I like my phone. I don't need it all the time like during every single class period like some of my peers though.\n\nParents put restrictions = kids wanting them more\nGiving kids free reign = mixed results (this depends on the individual. Some will use them when they want, others will want them all the time)\n\nThere's just no telling. It can be the parents' fault, but it's also just as likely to be the fault of the kid. Parents can't always control their kids' behavior. This situation just has too many factors to pin the majority of something on a single group (i.e. the parents).\n\nIs the kid stubborn? Do they live in an unsafe neighborhood? Are the parents too controlling anyway?\n\nI grew up in an unsafe neighborhood. I NEEDED (nobody needs anything, so I'm gonna say it. You NEED food to live, but you don't HAVE to live, it's a deep conundrum) a phone so my mom could make sure I got home from school safely. I was very stubborn and it didn't matter how my mom tried to parent me. In the end, everything I became was a result of my own choices because I just, at point blank, *did not* care about a word my mom said while growing up. This is not every person. Too many factors.\n\nI kind of went on a tangent, but the point still stands.",

Are there other ways of doing these things, yes but society has changed. You cannot turn back the clock.  But I agree that limits should be set.  But easy declarative statements like just put your phones down is a sound bite, not reality.  The message should be balance your lives people. You prevent you kids from having a cell phone and they will be socially isolated, potentially ostracized. They can't walk over to a pay phone and call you if they are out of the house.

            "Just because this is an unpopular opinion post: while I agree that parents need to take responsibility for the amount of screen time and the repercussions kids deal with, I believe it\u2019s a good thing to integrate these things into kids lives. Tech has become a quintessential part of our society and we need to teach kids to use technology for creative and educational purposes as well as teaching them when to put it away. One of the biggest reasons all these young kids are becoming internet billionaires is because they are utilizing tech in creative new ways that never occurred to older generations. I would not want to take that opportunity away from my kids. Blockchain, programming, and computer skills are arguably more highly sought than a college degree, and I grew up when personal computers and the internet were just coming onto the scene. I can\u2019t imagine how our antiquated ideas and (well founded) fears of technology might impact our kids\u2019 livelihood in 10 or 15 years... people used to think kids who read fiction and played outside too much were damaged & doomed.

Also my family forgot to pick me up from a class one time and I did have to walk like a kilometer to get to a phone I could use (at the corner store) and it was raining but I had a phone, I just didn't bring it with me.

            "Smartphones are a step towards brain implants like Neuralink. They're irritating only because they visibly divert someone's attention away from those who want it. When smartphones are inside your skull you'll be able to listen to someone and maintain eye contact while inwardly texting your friend or w/e. Your attention will still be divided but not in such an overt way.\n\nParents thinking of smartphones as an \"addiction\" are only thinking of them in terms of how they inconvenience parents who want their children's immediate, undivided attention for the asking. Smartphones are not simply a dopamine button. They're a primitive exo-cortex which expands greatly on natural human cognitive capabilities. Taking it away from a child because you want their attention at a moment's notice is like cutting out part of their brain.\n\nKids, not having the conceptual framework or vocabulary to express this, nevertheless feel it very viscerally when that appendage is removed and they lose capabilities they've become accustomed to & rely on. So they pitch the same fit as someone whose eyes or ears are unexpectedly disabled against their will.  \n\n\nBesides the loss of capability, the internet is often a means to find ones tribe and socialize with others beyond the limits of ones local community. For a kid that doesn't fit in where they are (say they're gay or an atheist in the deep south, or an apostate living in Iran, or a closely knit immigrant community in Britain) the ability to find others outside of that bubble who are like minded is a crucial lifeline.   \n\n\nOften one their parents would not allow them to have if they put their kids in that bubble deliberately, to shape them a certain way. Or the parents just think \"My kid isn't becoming who I want them to, or paying attention to me all the time. I have noticed it's related to their phone/computer. If I take that away, surely this trend will reverse\" when it was never the cause, but an outlet",

            "First of all segregation ended not too long ago. It is actually much more recent than the Holocaust. And blacks are not just holding a grudge for past events. Blacks continue being the victims of systematic racism. Conditions have improved but blacks are still more likely to be arrested, more likely to be denied housing, more likely to be denied a job, more likely to make less money, etc. than white people. It is hard to trust and love those who don't trust you and love you back.\n\nYes, it is ingrained culturally. And yes, people take pride on their identity. Your identity is what you are. When you perceive that your social group is threatened you feel threatened. Racism is learned because racial categorizations are after all arbitrary. There are no true biological boundaries to define races. Prejudice toward the outgroup, however, is natural. We prefer our family, our city, our local team. If you are placed in a group at random, you will prefer that group over other groups. The solution to racism is quite simple: Your definition of the in-group should extend to involve members of the out-group. If you want Black people to see you as a friend, you must see them as friends first.\n\nIt is not as easy as to say: Let's be friends, however. For trust and love to flourish between different social groups there must be a place where both groups coincide, see each other regularly, share experiences.\n\nThe problem is that there are very few opportunities to establish intergroup friendships. Cities in the US are still HIGHLY segregated. If you live in the diverse environment of a multicultural metropolis, such as the city of Los Angeles or New York, you may have the opportunity to establish meaningful relationships with members of other racial groups, as either friends, colleagues or simply as fellow city dwellers. However, not everyone lives in a city as diverse as Los Angeles, and even here, the illusion of diversity is lost when one traverses its many neighborhoods. Many neighborhoods remain highly segregated, a consequence of the decades of restrictive covenants enforcing race separation. The Racial Dot Map shows how non-diverse American cities still are: [http://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/](http://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/)\n\nBecause of the lack of opportunities to meet and establish friendly relationships, racial groups depend on stereotypes of the other group to guide their behavior. Whites may expect that Blacks are aggressive, Blacks may expect that whites are cold and ungenerous. Those stereotypes are learned from socializing, you hear from your uncle or from media and it sticks with you. Because of how segregated our cities are, you may have no chance to prove those stereotypes  wrong or worse, if you have a bad encounter, the encounter may only confirm your negative biases, and unfortunately we tend to pay more attention to negative than to positive events.\n\nIn this situation, whites have the upper hand. Whites are still the dominant group. They have the money, the jobs, and the authority. Not all whites are rich, not all whites have jobs and not all of them have the authority. But on average and in comparison not only to blacks but to all minorities, they do.\n\nIf you are interested in establishing bonds of friendship with black people, instead of demanding them to trust you, be a friend first. How many black friends do you have?",

            "You seem woefully uneducated about how black Americans continue to be mistreated. Institutional racism is still rampant. Black Americans are incarcerated and killed by police at much higher rates than white Americans. Southern states blatantly abuse the \"except as a punishment for crime\" part of the 13th Amendment and lock up black people, specifically black men, for the smallest offenses to put them to work. They receive longer sentences for the same crimes and black students are consistently disciplined more harshly than white students for the same transgressions.\n\nCities are segregated by design and generational wealth plays a huge role in your future prospects in America, as opposed to Germany where your parents aren't basically the only safeguard you have. Cities are currently grappling with infrastructure that was specifically designed to make it difficult for black people to move around the city and for the longest time black people were denied the same route to success that white people had: real estate. This still affects how many resources are available to them. Furthermore, because children are assigned to the public school of the district they live in, parents can't choose to send their children to a better school, unlike in Germany where parents choose their children's public schools freely.\n\nThe United States continued to legally discriminate against black people into the 1960s and moved on to covertly racist dog-whistle policies after the explicitly racist ones became illegal.\n\nThen there's the cultural messages they get. For example, AAVE is still widely considered an 'uneducated' way to speak, despite it being just as grammatically complex as Standard English. The English language has evolved since it was introduced on the American continent, which is why it is different from British English. Since black Americans and white Americans were segregated for so long, the English that both groups spoke diverged and took on their own quirks. Yet one is deemed inferior because of its association with its speakers. This is just one of many examples of how black Americans continue to be told they lack sophistication.\n\nNot to mention that in Germany it is socially unacceptable to wear one of the worst things your country has ever done on your sleeve and be proud of it because it's your 'heritage'.\n\nI could go on for a while, but honestly I don't have the time. I suggest you take the time to look into the matter with an open mind.\n\nIn short, after WW2 Germans did a complete 180 and said \"NEVER AGAIN\". It immediately became socially unacceptable to treat Jews poorly. The United States never did this.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold!",

            "i think my only issue with this opinion is that women base their 'men are trash' statements generally not on the men they choose to have in their lives, but the men they inevitably encounter who catcall or harass them, the men they hear about in the news who rape, assult, and murder women for sport, and the men their friends tell them stories about who are abusive, sexist, rapists, etc. Obviously women who have been raped, assulted, or abused by someone close to them factor in those experiences, but saying that women who say 'men are trash' choose trash men is a huge over generalization and misses the point of the statement.",

She had to file a complaint with the store manager because an employee kept following her to her car - which he still does if he can.\n\nMost of the time he's too busy next door at the gym staring at all the girls working out though.\n\nIt's just the tip of the iceberg too.

It\u2019s the misogyny that has being ingrained and for a big part normalized by society, that then those men contribute to, that leads us/women/people to say \u201cmost men are trash\u201d.

I think they are simply sad people who cannot see how wonderful other people can be. They don't know how to seek out and enhance the good in others. They certainly do not choose to associate with liars and aggressive bullies. They just have never learned how to recognize people who have better qualities. Either that or they have never learned how to appreciate others and constantly find people insufficient. \n\nNo one chooses to waste their time. These people need to learn how to evaluate compatibility and/or how to help others express their best selves. These people need our compassion and assistance, not our judgement. \n\nAre they toxic? Yeah, probably a bit. But telling them that their pain is their own fault won't help anything. Educate your friends. The sentiment \"all [demographic] are trash\" is one of despair.

If a woman is attracted to bad men and chooses to be with said bad men, that's on her. As a man, if I make a crap decision I am expected to own up to my responsibility and not blame others. For whatever reason, women are rarely held to this standard.\n\nA woman I was with years ago had previously been with a dark triad man (there may have been more than one in her past). Despite the fact their relationship had ended, she could not stop talking about the guy. Eventually I woke up and realised that I was just the \"rebound guy\" and that she still had strong feelings for her ex who treated her like shit. That I treated this woman well obviously made no impact on her feelings for me and her feelings for him. I broke up with her soon after this.\n\nWhat is the moral of this story? That women do indeed like men who treat them poorly. These same women then complain that there are no good men left in the world. Sadly, these two facts are directly correlated.",

I\u2019ve taken the equivalent of a minor in gender and feminist theory courses. The underlying concept is based in theory and the \u201ctrash\u201d thing is a very crude way of referring to that. The concept is that all men benefit to a degree from their social position in their day-to-day and most don\u2019t acknowledge that they\u2019re higher on the hierarchy, which undermines equality movements.\n\nThey sometimes say things simplified to the point of being overtly offensive to many like the \u201ctrash\u201d thing and are aware of it and I\u2019m not a fan of that, but women are human, and 99% of humans prefer kind people.

Where I'm from 98-93% of women have reported some form of sexual assault whether it's verbal or physical. I've had invasive store clerks and pharmacists ask invasive questions and where I live. I've been catcalled in the streets maybe minimum 5 times every time I go out. I've had professors not care too much about helping female students get into research or projects because they consider their field to be for men. I've had internships where the company states blatantly they do not hire women in their workshops so they don't invest in recruiting them. I've had every single man in a workshop I was training at berate me about the field I've ended up studying and what on earth mad me end up there, men I've literally just met interfering and correcting me about my life choices. I've had bus drivers tell me how to sit on the bus cuz they don't like how I do it.\n\nI actually advocate for proper communication and outreach to help men and women understand these societal problems and to help men grow to call out their fellow men. But I've been through the \"men are trash\" phase and I would still use the term in a setting where I know the friends around me understand this statement is from the absolute frustration in my daily life and in the lives of every woman I know.\n\nI understand where you're coming from but maybe men, specifically, can be trash and disrespectful and demeaning in more ways than cheating around and being cold.",

If you look at it as a service that you use, it's no different than Hulu or Netflix. It's similar to cable. Why SHOULDN'T they? Every single other service costs money or makes you watch ads, but YouTube is somehow different? Why should you be entitled to get this service for free, or without ads? \n\nI pay for YouTube premium. I more than get my money's worth. No ads, ever. YouTube music is just as good as Spotify, so now I'm not paying for that service. I can close the screen on the app and keep listening (great for podcasts and stand up comedy!). I get access to music and content that's \"not available in my country\" on free. It costs less than ad-free Hulu, and I get six accounts this way, so my wife and 4 of my friends all enjoy this service (which costs us $2.50 each a month). Content is far more varied and interesting (to me) and there is THOUSANDS of times more content to watch, no matter what you enjoy, and this is only increasing, while other streaming services offer an endless list of shit I scroll past and never click on. \n\nI don't like to shill for Google/YouTube, because they're bastards and have enough god damn money... But daily posts about how annoying YouTube ads can be are getting old. It's a service, it costs money, stop expecting it for free. Either cheat the system and get ad blocker, or pay for YouTube Premium.\n\nEdit: I think a lot of people disregard YouTube Premium as being a bad value or not worth the money because YouTube does a fucking terrible job of advertising its benefits and features. There's a ton of stuff I enjoy about the service that I didn't realize until AFTER I paid for it (like 6 accounts for one price).",

You only have to support yourself - one person. YouTube would have to support EVERY YOUTUBE USER - ~half of a planet. And since nobody knows, how long this pandemic will last - maybe a week, maybe a year, they can't do it, because they won't be able to sustain it if the pandemic lasts longer. If the pandemic lasts long, Google would need to make Premium even more expensive after the pandemic (something along the lines of a Gibson Les Paul kind of expensive) to balance out the losses. That will scare even more people away. So both the current strategy, and the strategy you proposed, are ineffective.",

In high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance I\u2019ve ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. \n\nThere is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don\u2019t seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. \n\nI really don\u2019t have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower IQ and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren\u2019t drinking and to clarify I don\u2019t mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a SLIGHT buzz regularly. \n\nTLDR: alcohol will basically negativity effect every aspect of your life if you drink regularly.",

            "I am a recovering narcotic addict. Been using hard drugs for 14 years, been clean for two months. I had a friend who is an alcoholic. We aren't friends anymore because he is persistent in saying my addiction is worse than his. He still drinks. I am 100% clean. He has no job. I do. I pay my bills, and am attempting to pay off my old debts as well. He somehow has conned his girlfriend into supporting his entire lifestyle. He thinks that because every other hour he can switch to beer instead of vodka he has his addiction under control so therefore it's not an addiction. I won't put myself in a friendship with someone that far in denial.\n\nAddiction is addiction. In my mind there is no such difference as one being worse than the other. Whether it's shopping, drugs, gambling, eating, or anything else, addictions need treatment. There are a lot of people who are in denial that one addiction is better or worse than others. All need some form of treatment in order to control. ",

            "See the thing is that alcohol and weed are both ok in small amounts in moderation. But that's the key. No, moderation is not binge drinking once a month, it's having one glass of wine with dinner to relax. Any binge drinking or sustained regular use is dangerous and harmful.\n\n Other drugs even in moderation can alter you enough to fuck you up pretty good. Cocaine users for example, are at a significantly increased risk for heart attacks due to vasospasm caused by the cocaine, even in small doses, even in first time users.",

There was sober Rich* and drunk Rich and I hated drunk Rich with every cell in my body. Sober Rich was an asshole a lot of the time. But drunk Rich was mean, cruel, obnoxious, and toward the end, physically violent.   I can't believe that anyone could compare alcohol to any other drug and not see that it is worse than most drugs out there. It can make nice people mean, and it can make smart people stupid. It doesn't have any significant benefits to your health or life, and in the majority of cases it makes your life worse. I wish there was no such thing as alcohol. All it does is destroy lives and families. And even if you do decide to stop drinking, its hard to stay sober because it is everywhere you go, stores, movie theaters, arenas, chuck e cheese, you can't get away from it. So if you don't have a will of steel, it's going to be very hard to stop drinking. \n\n*name changed to protect an idiots privacy",

The key difference is alcohol can be done in moderation with minimal effects; compare that with other 'hard drugs' - who ever heard of a meth high with minimal effects? who casually does meth or heroine? Alcohol *pales* in comparison to real hard drugs in terms of addiction as well. I can go out and get absolutely plastered tonight and not feel compelled to do it again. That's not how hard drugs work. \n\non top of that, you're talking about it when it's done in high quantities when, frankly, doing most things in high quantities is bad. \n\nBottom line, the problem with what you're saying is you're only looking at alcohol when it's used in excess, ignoring that it can be done casually, and completely ignoring the actual characteristics of hard drugs in order to make an easy comparison.

Most sitcoms become dated within 10 years.  When you have 22 minutes to make people laugh every 11 seconds you're relying a lot on the mood and feel and trends of the times.\n\nI think some people can and will always identify with the show because it's truly about that time when your friends are your family.  You've left mom and dad and siblings, and you havent started your own family yet.\n\nThat's what the show reminds me of.  \n\nAs for being a good show or being 'funny'?  I see it this way.  20 years from now people will be saying \"The Office sucks!\", \"Big Bang Theory sucks!\", \"Modern Family sucks!\" not because they are terribly written or acted, but because they are sitcoms and they wont age well.  So it's not really saying anything.",

            "Not an unpopular opinion at all... BUT,\n\nYou have to remember Friends came out at a time when there wasnt a sitcom about 20 something year olds living in the city trying to make it in the world or get through the good and bad of life. Sitcoms at the time were all family affiars or older actors (Frazier; Roseanne; Tim the Tool Man Taylor; The Nanny; Sienfield)\n\nThere was no sitcom that covered the day life struggles and funny moments you have in your mid-20's with your group of Friends. When you first move to the big city, when you get your first job in your field, when you think you've fallen in love for the last time; when you have inside jokes; when you cry on your best friends shoulder; when your 30th birthday is around the corner; when your first friend in your group is having a baby; When you do stupid stuff with your mates in your 20's that you all laugh when your older and no one else gets it. Think about how many young-adults move to the 'big-city' with their mates or make new friends and try to just live their lives till they're 30's trying to get by. It the the age old trope; but Friends the TV show was the first ever instance for it to be put into a relateable sitcom. Its why SOOOO many young adult can relate to being Monica with her OCD and youngest sibling, Ross with his constant heartbreak; Chandler falling in love with his best friends little sister and being the clown; Pheobe being alternative and quirky and not 'fitting into a specific mold'; Joey struggling to make it in the big world in his career. ALL highly relatable things we or our friends experience or have felt. And when things go wrong in your life or start to crumble your friends are your family; your go-to people. Its a show that came out at a time where millennials and gen-x could easily relate to it for once with the things they were experiencing as opposed to 'A group of old ladies' or 'A family of 6' or 'A group of business people in an office'. \n\nAgree the jokes and humour in each episode may not have aged well. BUT the over-arching concept; a group of FRIENDS in their 20's trying to make it in the big city together will always be a relatable topic to each generation. Hell! im 30 now and my 22 year old niece's (so born in 2000) love Friends also. It was watched by billions of people around the world in literally every language. It was and still is HIGHLY relatable to soooo many people.",
            "I don\u2019t care if you like the show or not, I don\u2019t care if you like laugh tracks or not, but a laugh track is not the reason people think the show is funny.

It\u2019s only the stupid people who automatically think a show is bad just because it has a laugh track. I don\u2019t laugh because the laugh track does, I laugh because Friends was a legitimately well written comedy show with talented actors who had amazing chemistry together. \n\nI bet you think The Office is the greatest TV show of all time and quote it to death any chance you get. Well I\u2019ll just say that you people are insufferable with that show anymore. It is so vastly overrated and just so you know, when you laugh at Jim\u2019s stupid face staring into the camera it\u2019s pretty much no different from laughing due to a laugh track.

            "It gets praised as one of the best shows ever, and now (especially on Reddit) people call it out mercilessly for how blah it really was. It was an alright show. Forgettable mostly. But it was full of amazing looking people being silly, and that was the key to its success.   \n\nOf course men loved the 3 female leads, but so did women. Women wanted to BE Aniston, that hairstyle took the 90s by storm. Cox is just timeless beauty and Phoebe was ultra cute and super silly, which made a ton of younger girls want to be that same kind of quirky.   \n\nI can\u2019t speak as much to the men since that\u2019s not really my taste, but I\u2019m aware enough to say that Joey was a stud, and chandler and Ross were also each handsome dudes in their own individual ways. The fact that on the show the men all had phenomenal jobs didn\u2019t hurt how they were viewed by women either I\u2019m sure.   \n\nBut look at what was on at the time - married with Children, Frazier, Seinfeld, maybe cheers for a bit still I don\u2019t know, and stuff that came later like Malcolm in the middle and big bang and all the others. Most of those are easily better shows than Friends, but Friends was so front heavy on beautiful people that it filled a niche that wasn\u2019t being filled. You either had funny shows that looked like Roseanne, or you had shows with beautiful people that were too ham fisted on drama like Melrose Place and 90210.   \n\nFriends just struck a balance between beautiful people and silly jokes that could appeal to a massive audience. But if those people were normal looking sitcom characters, it wouldn\u2019t be nearly as heralded as it is.   \n\nAll in all it doesn\u2019t deserve the praise nor the hate it gets.",

            "This is not unpopular!",

            "The show is pretty bad, you can find edits online where they remove the laugh track and the dialog is almost unwatchable due to the amount of time they pause in between talking. Without the laugh track its not that you forget to laugh it's that you actual hear the joke and see their acting and it's pretty horrendous. Literally just saw the \"office sandwich\" scene without the laugh track and Ross sounds like a real sociopath.",
            "Sitcoms don't age that well. I love friends because I grew up with it so would happily rewatch the entire show at any time. I totally understand why people who didn't grow up on it don't find it that funny.\n\nI didn't watch Seinfeld much at all growing up and watched it recently. I did fairly enjoy it but the comedy isn't very funny. I'm sure when it came out it was hilarious and people who grew up on it love it like I love friends.",
            "In the beginning, the show was an accurate portrayal of twenty somethings living in the big city. Everyone is broke. The cool kids in high school bottomed out. The academics did well. Then the show became horrible fan fiction. Yeah the show sucked in no time. In the start? Nope. Not bad at all. Watch the first five or six shows.",

            "Watching Friends now is very different than watching Friends in the 90s.  It was a different time back then.  I would watch it while doing my homework.  There are plenty of shows that are way funnier, but you can't say it was a bad show just because you don't like it.  It went on for 10 seasons.",
            "Tbh I never watched for the jokes more and more for the slice of life feeling.",
            "I feel the same way about Seinfeld. People act like it's a crime to hate the show, but I cannot stand it.",
            "Imagine thinking a show is funny only because of a laugh track. If that were the case, they could just slap a laugh track on anything and make a show as successful as Friends everytime.

            "Objectively its a good show. Im not a huge fan personally but the actors are great, the sets are well designed, the timing and pacing of the show are well controlled. \n\nThe writing is on a higher level than say the King of Queens, or Everybody Loves Raymond, which i like better than Friends; but not on the level of Seinfeld or Frasier, though few sitcoms are. \n\nI dont think it can be denied that its a good show a lot of people love. \n\nWhereas the Big Bang Theory is objectively bad despite many people liking it.",

But it's far from funny, amusing at best, on a good day, and what i'd sat through of it only made me wonder wth people saw in it",

You don't get a discount for pumping your own gas either or ordering through an app. \n\nYou're not \"saving jobs\" either. No one particularly likes being a cashier and if anything stores have added better paying jobs lately by adding a pickup option. \n\nThough I'm sure they'd be happy to raise prices another few cents just to add a \"discount\" to the self checkout and make it appear like you're getting a deal.",

            "The problem is that it\u2019s an option. Not a requirement. If you feel like you aren\u2019t being fairly compensated by using self checkout you can wait in the lines with a cashier. If that\u2019s unacceptable, you can do it yourself and get paid in convenience.",

Phone companies used to pay an operator to patch your call through.  Why aren't they giving you a discount?\n\nYou withdraw your own cash at an ATM.  Banks used to pay a teller at the bank to withdraw and count the cash for you.  Why aren't they giving you a discount?\n\nThere are a hundred things companies used to pay people to do that we now do ourselves.  Why are people so hung up on self checkouts?

            "This is dumb (and unoriginal). I used to be a cashier and if anyone needed help at the self checkout it's because they're too stupid to read/hear the audio prompts on screen. When I'd pull up to help them they'd go, \"ya know I'm scanning my own groceries, maybe should start paying me\" or if they help bag they ask for a discount because they put in the effort to get their groceries to their home. \n\nWhen you fuck up the machine, when it's out of paper, or when it doesn't give you your change back who fixes it? The employees. If you want a discount for doing the cashier's job then get a job at the store and get an employee discount. \n\n\"I walked to the bus stop, it's on the house right?\" \n\nYou ever been to a grocery store? You've never seen the \"15 items it less\" sign on the self check out? \n\nHAVE YOU EVER HAD A CART FULLLLLL OF GROCERIES AND GONE TO THE SELF CHECKOUT? \n\nWhat kind of discount are you expecting? I used to get paid 12 dollars and hour to do everything in the store. 12 dollars I got 10% off as an employee discount. From cashiering to pushing carts to stocking to working the meat department and I just turned 16, I got 10%. You're scanning and bagging on a self checkout machine which is so much easier then what we have to do at the register, 2 years later I still remember codes on the fruits, your getting YOUR groceries and scanning them for at most 5 minutes. \n\nIt's your choice to go through the self checkout and IS faster. It saves you time that's why if you just came in for some bananas (4011) you can get your fucking bananas and leave before your engine cools down.\n\nIt all boils down to the entitlement you feel, I have to scan and my bag my OWN groceries?

            "You have the option to pay for something in coins at these places. If someone paid for something with pennies and made a cashier count them I'd almost feel THEY would have a right to make it cost more. \n\nYou can dump 1000 pennies in a self service checkout and that alone makes it even out in some cases. I mean coinstar charges a fee after all.\n\nAnd before you say \"no one is going to want to inconvenience the people who have to wait for me dump 1000 coins in the self service checkout\" \n\nI've paid with coins at these places before *at night like an hour before closing* when there is no one waiting behind you. You can plan for that sort of thing when you intend to pay in a ton of change.",

I think I have 2-3 customers complaining every hour about it, I've heard that they are paying for my services so I should be doing it, they should be getting a discount for having to scan themselves, and I've even had people full on leave their whole trolley because they refuse to do self service (one guy shouted at my friend yesterday saying that if our shop wants a sale , he will scan every item for him or he will complain to our management). The few times I give in and scan it to stop them shouting, my manager will tell me I can't do that as we need to get people use to self service. It's not gonna happen.\n\nThe worst part is none but one till accepts cash (normal till system but we have to keep it free for ONLY cash / gift cards etc) but it's gotten to the point people will lie that they are paying cash just to then pull out their card because they know it's the only way they will get someone to scan their 3 items. \n\nIt's tiring having to hear these complaints so many times a shift, it's not hard to scan your own shit.

            "Just a thought here from someone who works in a place that utilizes self checkouts: \n\nSelf check outs generally increase speed and efficiencies based on the fact that more people can go through at a much faster rate than a standard one to one interaction. \n\nThe costs really don\u2019t decrease from a labor standpoint as those hours are generally dispersed into higher paying more skill intensive areas they don\u2019t just disappear. So really unneeded labor costs are decreased while labor needed in areas that make the store function are increased.\n\nAlso as a person who gets paid to interact with people I personally am sort of done with social interactions when I am not paid so being able to get in and get out without the hassle of being nagged for whatever those cashiers are supposed to be selling is a boon.\n\nYou should learn to stop worrying and love the self checkout",

Grab a little hand held machine (also has a spot inside of carts to place it in) ans then you can scan items as you shop and instantly put em in your bag. Then at the end you just out in the machine and pay.\n\nBoth options are extremely convenient imo.

Employies scanned 2x40 groceries,  identical shopping carts, and the self checkout person had it all bagged and ready to leave when the other was maybe 2/3 as far along. \nAlso,  usually the que time is nonexistent because there are much more self checkouts then regular registers. \n\nAlso (now my store is new and fancy)  we have theese self checkout scanners, you can scan and pack while you are shopping.  Saving even more time because when you are done,  you pay.  Then grab the bags and leave. \n\n\nMaybe stop crying for a discount for having to do a tiny bit for yourself.",

I hate wearing my contacts at this point due to allergies, and I really didn\u2019t give a shit if I looked \u201csilly\u201d or \u201cold\u201d with the transition lenses (I am a male and was 26 at the time). My doctor told me it might be a better route to just get prescription sunglasses. \n\nI thought he was just trying to up-sell me, but he said I would get the second frames half off and lenses for free; I would just have to pay the fee to have them installed. It would end up being slightly more expensive than transition lenses, but he said they would work much better for driving purposes (I drive 30,000-40,000 miles a year for work). I guess a car\u2019s windshield has some layer of UV protection that may cause the lenses to not fully transition or something.\n\nBut now I refuse to believe any of this, and that my doctor was actually just telling me I\u2019m too sexy for transition lenses.

My oldest is nearly 18 and my younger ones are just getting old enough to stay home by themselves for a few hours.  Other than that any kind of adult activities have had to be scheduled well in advance, with babysitting being arranged, and staying available by phone is a requirement.\n\nIf someone is at the point in their life that they don't want to have those restrictions, then they are absolutely right in that they shouldn't date someone that is already a parent.  This isn't saying the parent is less desirable, or has \"baggage\" or anything like that, but their priorities and responsibilities, rightfully so, are drastically different than it is for a single person with no kids.  A person dating a parent is at best accepting that those responsibilities and priorities will interfere with the spontaneity usually enjoyed by single people dating.  As the relationship progresses into something serious, it is accepting some of that responsibility as their own.  It's absolutely OK to say no to that.  Are they missing out on dating someone that may be otherwise perfect for them?  Yes, that's a risk for them to choose to take.",

            "I agree. I would rather a man not date me because I'm a single mother. The faster a man eliminates himself, the faster I can move on and so can he. If a man rejects me because I'm a single mother, then I know immediately that he isn't good relationship material, and isn't good father material. Men eliminating themselves ahead of time is always a good thing. Dating is hard, so anything that makes it easier up front may be a bit painful in the moment, but is better for everyone in the long run.",
            "The opinion is of course valid, and doubtfully unpopular. The supporting reasons for the opinion, however, are absolutely idiotic. There is no competition between a potential romantic partner and one's children, or at least there shouldn't be. If you date someone, your aim is likely to determine whether or not you are compatible as a couple. Sure, it's important they treat your kids well, if you have kids, but your goal isn't to replace your kids with the person you're dating. The relationship between romantic partners is entirely different than the relationship between a parent and their children. Someone coming into a relationship with children from a previous relationship is just as capable of being an incredible partner to someone as a person coming into a relationship without children. Sure, a person with kids might have less time to engage in activities usually associated with kidless people, but who gives a shit? You aren't going to party and gallivant your entire life together anyway.

Are you going to leave her as soon as the baby is birthed because you\u2019re no longer #1? \n\nWanting to be child-free and not wanting to date people who already have children is valid. However, your reasoning behind not wanting to date women with children is awful, misogynistic & entitled. Boyfriends and husbands often become abusive (or become much more abusive) after their female partner births their child. \nExample: He doesn't feel like #1 anymore, so he becomes more demanding & manipulative. He refuses to take on more responsibility of housework and childcare. He demands sex even when she is tired and looking after the baby. She no longer has the time or energy to fuss over him and baby him like before, so he verbally and physically punishes her for prioritising the babies needs over his own \"needs\". He does nothing to help and abuse escalates because he feels jealous, betrayed and entitled. This is the \"reason\" behind why a lot of men abuse or murder their partners after having a child. Sometimes he abuses or murders the child instead/as well. There are several of these types of posts on Reddit as well (written by the woman).",

Incredible value, but I refuse to support Amazon for the same reason as EA.\n\nIn many ways, it's beneficial to use subscriptions, but like Netflix, it's only a matter of time before those subscription prices creep into ranges that aren't as valuable anymore.

My girlfriend's hometown has similar bicycles-as-a-service, but the *charges* make much more sense: you pay the city office 200 yuan for a charge card, but you *never* have to charge the card. As long as you park the cycle you check out at another station within an hour, your ride is free, and there are stations *all* over town.\n\n\\*\\* This is what scares me most. There's no way to turn this back without a violent uprising. Basically, the housing industry realized its mistake in having ever allowed the concept of personal home ownership to take root. Now that every prospective home owner without a seven-figure income has to take out a loan to buy a home, the banks have cemented their ultimate ownership of all the homes and all the land. Sooner or later, an owner will default on payment of their mortgage, and that home will be repossessed and become a rental--to every home on the market. In fact, why even have houses when you can demolish them and rent apartments instead? Urbanization is another *irreversible* trend. I'm sure this system will eventually provide some kind of \"relief\" for the homelessness it generates, but not without that too exploiting the disadvantaged for a profit: there will be extremely minimal \"affordable\" housing, but those who live in it will have no disposable income or savings.",

But we used to pay 50-150$ a month for cable and satellite depending on the packaged and amounts of channels in them or offered. I know people out there still paying for cable AND subscriptions. Yes, we all do have a good amount of bills but I for one feel that it\u2019s a little cheaper for me personally, to have subs for Netflix, Hbomax, SHO, Paramount+ & AppleTV that\u2019s about less that 40-50$ a month on media subs compared to cable or a deluxe media package of thousands of channels and offers a more focused way for me to choose content. The problem is there are other apps where I love to watch content like Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. I have those shared by family and friends so I don\u2019t pay for those and to save THEM money I share my passwords and cloud logins for my paid apps to them. However, I do have a few other friends that pay me for log ins for a few apps because they don\u2019t have subscriptions to offer login too so they pay me a percentage of the subscription fees for each month to help cover costs. \n\nThe fact that I, and probably others, have a network of sharing passwords and paying portions of monthly subscriptions \u2026 kinda gives me pyramid scheme vibes. The way they would profit FURTHER is to ensure we each pay for a single person/ single household password (Netflix is testing this feature) so that we CANNOT have those micro financial transactions and password bartering in place\u2026 it\u2019s the closest way they can force us to watch ONLY the services we want to consume content on specifically, the most.\n\nPs.

            "I'm a massive fan of superhero movies and I actually agree with this, mostly. I vehemently disagree that every superhero movie is the same, but if that's your opinion I'll respect it (that is the point of the sub, after all).\n\nHowever, as much as I love superhero movies, it kinda sucks when an entire year goes by and it feels like the only movies that do well are all superhero or horror movies, and everything else is swept under the rug. I would agree that superhero movies are sci-fi and fantasy though so they're kinda filling those gaps already. Sucks for people who don't like them.\n\nHonestly it feels like movie studios are shooting themselves in the foot because when they do make something a little riskier they either don't put as much effort/money into it and end up making a bad movie or they put it on a streaming service and end up not making a big profit which, in their minds, means they shouldn't make any more.\n\nBut I get it, superhero movies and horror movies are safe. The former because people (like me, admittedly) love them or will go see them regardless of quality, and the latter because they can usually be made with a relatively low budget and make massive profits.\n\nThe last non-superhero sci-fi movie I even saw in theaters was Blade Runner 2049. Great movie, didn't do well at the box office, probably won't see anything like it for a long time. Out of more recent ones most of them were pretty bad imo (Ready Player One, Terminator: Dark Fate). Alita: Battle Angel was good but that's basically a superhero movie lol, and also did poorly. I love Edge of Tomorrow but that came out, what, 6 years ago? And it did terribly too. Of the last decade the only non-superhero sci-fi movie I recall being really good *and* doing well financially was Arrival.\n\nAs for fantasy, I don't even know what's going on. Outside of the Hobbit (bad) and the Fantastic Beasts movies (bad), I haven't noticed any real successful attempt to do what Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter did back in the early 2000s. You would think that would get capitalized on. I mean, Lord of the Rings won like *every* Oscar. I can't even think of any big budget fantasy films that weren't sequels or reboots that made a good profit. Twilight, I guess? Onward was great but that was more of a Pixar movie with fantasy creatures/elements thrown in than a full on fantasy movie.\n\nSuperhero movies are today's Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/Star Wars. Hell, Star Wars is still around and it can barely even compete with them. Like 50% of the population hates the new Stat Wars movies lol. I bet a decade or two from now we'll be on some other new trend, reading threads on r/unpopularopinions about how the new trend sucks and we want superhero movies back.",
            "I love both and you\u2019ll find most comic book fans also love both, the lord of the rings and the marvel demographic do overlap. I think obviously the MCU is popular and DC is also releasing a lot to compete with them but that\u2019s pretty much it, for fantasy we just had GOT not too long ago and soon another one will pop up, superhero movies don\u2019t really prevent other sub genres",

            "Sci-fi does far better on TV typically.  Sci-fi novels tend to have a super-rich background and that's hard to convey in a movie setting with limited time.\n\nThe more movies that come out, the more generic they become because of the \"Simpson's did it!\" phenomenon, no one wants to see the same stories told again and again. Shortcuts in special effects(eg model ships) made them able to be made a lot sooner...\n\nFantasy movies have been a thing for a long time, and a lot of them are similarly generic or otherwise below-B stinkers.  The technological bar here is the lowest of all three, more on costumes than special effects, and as such, seemingly historical(looking if not in fact) costuming is relatively easy.  \n\nBoth of these genre's has well outlasted Westerns as they started getting made right after interest for westerns waned in the 70s-80s.  Legend, Labrynth, Princess bride, etc, not to mention LotR series(one of the few source materials big enough to enable a lot of investment in the films)\n\nSuperhero's have been around as well, but technology has only really recently advanced to the point where they're really vibrantly told in a way they couldn't do well in the 70s-80s and even 90s, and with that, we've only got a couple franchises and a handful of indy movies worth a damn.\n\nIt's that MCU really pumped out the movies in volume and marketed the fuck out of them.  DCU took a darker approach with a lot less material.  \n\n/three cents",
            "Your comment \u201call the good superhero movies are over looked\u201d seems to imply that you think the current superhero movies don\u2019t produce anything good. Which is... I mean. It\u2019s not entirely true, even putting personal preferences aside.\n\nYou can like Blade and still like Marvel movies. Marvel and DC have produced some good stuff. Netflix has The Umbrella Academy, which is superhero show that doesn\u2019t follow conventional cookie cutters. There is stuff out there but it really feels like you\u2019re just sleeping on it because of nostalgia and being stuck in the past.\n\nI also just don\u2019t agree with the \u201ccookie cutter\u201d sentiment. In reality, no one would reject a perfectly delicious cookie on the grounds that it\u2019s exactly the same as another cookie. No one is forcing you to only eat this type of cookie.\n\nYou can have cookie *preferences*. But you can\u2019t say that Snicker Doodles are Not Good just because you don\u2019t like them. You just personally don\u2019t like them. And it has nothing to do with how cookie cutter, or popular, or ordinary it is.",

Point is, in order for stuff to change we need to expose people to stuff that\u2019s better than what they\u2019re currently watching.

Over a decade since that point and I couldn't be more proud of the happy little family my partner and I have created.\n\nEdit: The trip was self funded.

One of my friends just wanted his parents to 1) stop hitting his younger sibling and 2) apologize and admit that they were wrong for hitting him and his siblings. They couldn't even do that.",

We're all super fucked up but yes it had nothing to do with years of severe physical and mental abuse. I'm talking if you called him at work for pads, he would come home rip you out of the shower and literally kick you down a hallway. Not that he couldn't be called at work.

When I was a little kid he used to beat the shit out of me for everything, it was bad, like if my report card had anything below a C I would get beat. Belts, feet and  fists, nothing was off limits for him. When he got remarried when I was a 12-13 he stopped the beatings, but then he just stopped trying to be in our lives and just let us do whatever  like we would disappear for weeks at a time without even saying anything to him and when we showed back up nothing was said.

            "The parent child relationship needs to be approached with extreme responsibility.\n\nParents ultimately have a huge amount of power over their children. Nowhere else in normal life does an adult have this power over other adults.\n\nExceptions include prison guards, dictators, etc. All of which I don't consider normal life\n\nIf you dominate your child too much they will resent you.

For the most part no there wasn't really any depth in that relationship other than authoritarian parenting, mental anguish and beatings.\n\nI realize now that it sad that people have kids without being prepared, It's tragic at times, Not saying I wish I was never born but my upbringing was not stable.",
            "I was stuck with my parents until I was 23. \n\nI went no contact with mother a few years ago and finally went low contact with my father about six months ago.\n\nI finally feel more free and like there's this big nagging anxiety that is lifting.\n\nI moved a few months back and they don't know about it. I don't want them to know my address because my mother will send me unmarked letters in weird handwriting to trick me into opening it.\n\nMy mother stole $5k from me while I was in uni, forcing me to take a semester off and go with her (on my dime) to a series of cult-like get rich quick courses. I was forced into debt because of it.\n\nMy father later let me stay \"rent free\" in the family home, not charging me $500+1/3 of utilities for ten months to \"payback\" the money they owed me. And then I had to pay for the next months until I moved out.\n\nMy mother has been a gaslighting narcissist my whole life. She has been emotionally, mentally and, very slightly, physically abusive. She isolated me from both sides of my family and made it nearly impossible to make friends.\n\nMy father has confessed he only speaks to me to try to get me back into that abusive relationship with my mother. He would rather have no relationship with his only child, versus have one with just me and without involving my mother.\n\nMy mother raised me referring to me as her RRSP. She also refused to think I lived with my then-boyfriend up to four months after I moved in with him. She believed he commuted home to his parents house 30mins every night.\n\nParents hate hearing it, but there is a limit to how much you can fuck up. Children are their own people. Be proud and loving of your children, be strong and be their guides. Know you cannot protect them from everything and must instead prepare them for life as best as you can.\n\nAnd don't have kids if you're not 110% certain you want them. They're people, humans to grow and care for, not a milestone. Having them is optional and you can measure your success in other, more important and less cruel ways.\n\nI wish I knew what having normal, well-adjusted parents was like. I think my life would have been radically different for the better. I probably would have had many friends, I'd have had stronger ties with family, and I wouldn't be in such debt today if my mother hadn't forced me to give her money.",

Like\u2026 that is NOT normal behaviour. \n\nSomething has obviously went horribly wrong for a child to sever such a significant, strong bond the SECOND they are suddenly deemed a \u2018real person\u2019 and get an ounce of freedom and then get as far away as physically possible. \n\nThey get a taste of being allowed to actually have boundaries and consent. They get treated like a real life human being and then they leave. Now armed with the knowledge that how they were treated was not okay and was never okay. They leave for their own sanity and safety. Someone really, truly has to fuck up for their child to think potential homelessness is better than whatever the fuck their parents subjected them to. \n\nPeople seriously need to think about this before spewing: \u201cbut he\u2019s/she\u2019s you\u2019re dad/mom?? \ud83e\udd7a Your poor dad/mom, he/she tried their best tho??

If anything the victim is doing this to protect themself.\n\nPeople enabling them then reinforces this believe in society that children aren\u2019t \u2018real people\u2019, parents are absolute authority and \u2018always know what\u2019s best and have good hearts\u2019 and that treating children like this perfectly okay and that they don\u2019t even need to apologise because they were \u2018only disciplining you\u2019.",

He asked if I had any questions. I asked, \u201cHow gone, when I was 12, did you put the barn kittens in a burlap bag and shoot them to death in front of me. He nodded and thought. Then said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember that happening, BUT I BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU SAY IT HAPPENED.     \n\nThat last sentence made me able to forgive him. He didn\u2019t deny my reality.

            "100000% absolutely spot on. The actual day I graduated high school, I moved out of my mom's house and moved 300 miles away that very night.  Moved in with my bf (future husband). Why? Because the year before I finally broke the news to my mom and family that her husband (my stepfather and dad to my half siblings) had been molesting me from about the ages of seven to fourteen or so.  What did she do? Well,  you'd think she'd be angry and call the police and apologize to me, right? No,  she didn't believe me and they said I was making up the story for God knows what reason! Something I made up with my bf is what they accused me of.  My family basically gave me sort of the silent treatment until I moved out.  I know  she would tell everyone that she couldn't do anything about it because who would support the household (mom never worked in her life). It wasn't until my younger half sister defended me years later and admitted her father had molested her as well.  I didn't see my mom for at least 5 years after graduation and only until I turned about 30 that I could honestly forgive her.\n\nEdit: I don't know if anyone is even reading this lol but a major reason I was able to forgive her is because she ended up telling me her own story.  She was also molested as a girl by her own stepfather but never told anyone about it until she told me.  She said she got flooded by memories she'd repressed long ago.  I felt badly for her. It took a lot of work but a relationship is able to be saved.",

Both of them are now remarried to other people and are much more happy and more forward with their emotions.

The reason it took years longer is because she was not an overtly bad mother (at least, not to me). She had to actively cross a major line for me to realize that, hey, she wasn't good for me *either*.\n\nI wasn't perfect in that relationship, mind. But the **entire reason** I cut her out of my life was her blatant disregard for me as a person. It was the way she only came around when she needed something from me, didn't invite me back home but did invite other siblings, made it clear that helping me was an inconvenience, protected my groomer older brother from the consequences of what he tried to do to me as a teen, etc, etc. It was all things **she did** that led to my decision.\n\nThere is no magic age where what your parents did to you, and the kind of relationship you have with them as a result, is not completely their fault. You own what you may have done to them **too**, mind you, but that is *your* actions to own and not theirs.\n\nThere's also no magical age where estrangement is blamed on the abused person rather than the abuser parents.

            "Probably because this is Reddit and most people in here are American. And America has 300 million people too I suppose!\nBut.\nI notice throughout a multitude of threads....a theme of American parents being VERY CONTROLLING. They hammer into their kids their religion, their beliefs very hard and issues do appear to arise once kids are teens, because the parents just can't \"let go\". \n\nThey love to punish. There seems to be endless \"grounding\" and taking away electronics, even taking car etc etc etc\n\nAnd as they get to end of school. Instead of trying to let go? They dig in harder! They threaten with not paying for college if the teen doesn't do what they want. \n\nAnd so many of these kids are still wholely dependent on their parents, so have to take it.\n\nWhy are so many American parents like that?\n\nNow I know there are other cultures that are worse, but the USA is supposed to be an advanced culture? So what's going on?\n\nYou read about in-laws interfering in their kids lives when they are married with children!! Going on holidays with them! And continually being at their house and telling them what to do?!! What's with that?\n\nTo me! It's no wonder so many Americans have such terrible relationship with their parents.

Mybe I'm a cynic, but to me it's clearly shallow and feels like a condescending pat on the back.\n\nFor example, I make a lot of chilled-out Lofi music - and It's a pretty wholesome environment, as you can imagine. A lot of the people who make it are super nice, and if there's one thing you need to know to understand my argument it's that I DON'T HATE KIND PEOPLE. The issue is when ridiculously wholesome comments are given for no reason, with no context, in the middle of conversations.\n\nPicture the scene: I'm chilling in a discord server talking to a friend about chords or something, when some guy I've never met randomly pipes up with 'Hey, I don't know who needs to hear this, but whoever you are, wherever you are, you mean a lot to a lot of people. Suicide is never the answer, stay positive and do what you love \ud83d\ude4f' or something along those lines.\n\nI agree with his message, but it means absolutely nothing if there's no context or reasoning behind it. I also understand that this message could have a profoundly positive impact on someone going through tough times. And that's amazing, I'm glad there are people in this world who dedicate time to helping to motivate and help out people in need. But there's a seperate text channel in that specific discord server for mental-health-related topics, this guy just chucked it into general in the middle of a conversation and left. It's things like that that makes me think they don't mean it - that makes these comments feel shallow. \n\nBut yeah feel free to flame me in the comments for being a hateful cynic or something",

Everyone has their Goldie Locks zone. \n\nWhat is extreme, not enough or just right is subjective. \n\nSo I kind of agree, but with the reservation that this is a personal thing and different for everyone.",
            "The people constantly posting positive and wholesome stuff are doing it because they need to convince themselves the world is positive and wholesome. \n\nIn my experience it's often a response to them feeling overwhelmed by negativity, and it's their (somewhat high effort yet innefective) way of fighting back.",
            "I know what you mean, it's annoying as hell and shallow. I don't think anybody with serious enough problems to be contemplating suicide is actually gonna be turned around just because some stranger on the internet who they might not even like in person tells them they are loved. It seems like virtue signaling like hey look at me I am a beacon of hope, saving people. That does sound cynical but I mean if they really cared they'd be looking for depressed people to talk to not just advertising in the general tab of a discord server. And talking can only help someone so much, they're probably either very young and think they're helping or someone desperately depressed just trying to spread love. But either way it doesn't really help but always warrants the obligatory \"omg are you okay? Im here if you need to talk!\"",

Just because if you were happy, it'd be fake someone else being happy automatically means fake?  That comes from your own thoughts, not theirs.  \n\nIf positivity and wholesomeness make you react in that way you may want to look within for answers, not blaming others.",

What you are pointing out is people using gestures or words without any genuine/realistic intention behind them, purely for attention.\n\nYou are annoyed by your perception of disingenuous action hiding under something that should be \"good\" but fails to be that when it is fake.",
            "I have mixed feelings about this. People who are overly positive can be annoying. On the flip side of that, the world is a shit place, and I do find it endearing that some people try to make it a little more brighter. You never know what someone has gone through or what they've overcome. What might come across as fake to some might be that person's way of showing the world they won't let the negativity beat them.

            "Yeah I completely understand what you mean especially on the comments from Lofi music videos, but for me it\u2019s really easy to ignore and I\u2019m pretty sure most of them are like 13. What really annoys me is people who are really positive in person. I work with this girl who is just so positive to the point that it\u2019s like she\u2019s just messing with me but I know she\u2019s actually 100% serious. It was cute at first but it\u2019s honestly so annoying I can\u2019t even talk to her anymore for more than like 10 mins.",
            "I'm of the opinion that constantly happy-happy-joy-joy people are absolute psychopaths at their cores. No bullshit. I mean, there's gotta be some points in your life where you just have to express some kind of negative emotions, and thus wouldn't have an outpour of optimism to share with people. Idk, maybe I'm just a little pessimistic if I'm being honest with myself, but that's my opinion.",
            "I\u2019m an eternal optimist, I\u2019m pretty much always cheerful... but I know what you\u2019re saying and couldn\u2019t agree more. To me, what you\u2019re referring to as \u201cwholesome\u201d is what I called \u201cforced positivity,\u201d it feels phony and contrived, and it\u2019s massively off-putting. Even with my natural inclination toward the positive, I don\u2019t expect others to be like me, which I suspect is the difference. I also don\u2019t paint a smile on my face all day just to come across a certain way.",
            "Ah yes, the daily post",
            "So I can tell you - as someone who went from being depressed to extremely happy and satisfied about life - that viewpoint changes. When you make a true connection with someone that's what it's like. When you let go of your stress for the moment and give an individual all your attention and live in that moment, that's how it feels and looks. That's what true connection with another person feels like and it's truly satisfying.\n\nThe reason people view it as creepy or fake is because they are closed off to that. It is so unbelievable that someone could be so genuine and nice that it seems fake or unnatural. The \"they want something feeling\" is directly an imposed view that is a reflection of themselves bc that's how that individual would act if they wanted something from someone else. The annoyance is because of a deep seeded reminder that your unhappy and this other person is not (in this moment) which could trigger feelings of jealousy. Ultimately is all is shown as cold and closed off where we tell ourselves \"I'm better off this way\" so we don't have to face our true feelings and struggles. It's one of the most common defense mechanisms people use.\n\nSo yeah, your right, it's definitely not encouraging. It's as if a competition weight lifter came over and handed you a 400 lb bar and cheered you on to bench it. That's not uplifting, (no pun intended) it's annoying because it just seems as if the other person is throwing it in your face and bragging when on reality that weight lifter believes that you can do it - With enough work.\n\nI urge everyone to try and find that place in their lives and stop labeling it as corny. It's real and it exists and it's awesome.",

It\u2019s awful when there are no kids in the building but there\u2019s still some lady screaming like a cartoon character.

My family is so negative all the time, they take everything for granted, there has to be an issue with everything they eat, do, etc. They have to tell you about all the bad news in the world. Id argue thats way more annoying.

            "As a mental health pro, I can say with certainty that the people who go onto suicide forums and spread that \"stay positive\" bullshit are doing more harm than good, and need to look at themselves first before trying to help others.  \n\nWhere can I find some of your music I've been into chilled out lofi lately",

            "I\u2019ve been dealt a really shitty hand in life but I know I can come off as happy go lucky and positive. For most of my teen years I was mad, depressed, and just a little shit to everyone around me. That got old after a while. After a particularly bad day someone had some kind words for an art project I did for school. I had a realization then \u201cWhy share my misery with other people?\u201d. I saw that all it did was make people around me miserable in return. I realized that helping people made me feel better about myself. It made me feel more positive about my self image and feel like, regardless of my circumstances, things DO get better if the right person is in the right place and they say the right things. So when I feel down, I make it a point to complement people about something that I like about them. Idk if it comes off as shallow or fake or that I\u2019m trying to win imaginary points, but it is something I sincerely mean to say. \n\nI still deal with my shitty circumstances but I don\u2019t want to make other people feel like shit too.",

            "I think it depends. It can be annoying, especially if you're very upset already. Sometimes what people need is for someone else to give them the energy and excitement they can't generate themselves. Other times, people need to be met where they are so they can work through that place.\n\nI used to suffer from pretty severe depression, and felt the same way. Now, I still sometimes don't need that. For example my dog thinks every time I'm mad about anything it's about her, so if I express frustration she either leaves or incessantly tries to cheer me up. Sometimes it's even more frustrating and I have to tell her to sit down. Other times it's really grounding to be reminded that I don't have to be as upset as I am.\n\nIt can be annoying, but reminding yourself that people like that are just trying their best to help the people around them helps make it less annoying over time, and helpful eventually.",

First thing you need to know, people *love* what I\u2019d call \u201cinspiration porn\u201d. Literally just disabled people doing usually normal people things with some message attached like \u201cIf they can do it, so can you!\u201d or something.

Unfortunately people will react super negatively if you point out their \u201cPositivity! Just be happy!\u201d stuff can be condescending, paternalistic, or even just mostly unhelpful. So many people tell me, \u201cJust think happy thoughts, just pray, just do yoga, just try essential oils,\u201d etc., and I know they mean well, but it\u2019s all wishful thinking. Sure, keeping a positive attitude can help, but no one can be happy 24/7. Similarly I\u2019m not going to positive think my way out of disability.

Spread the word and end suicide now! \n\nIf you actually want to help someone with depression, at the very least you're going to have to have a conversation. No single platitude, copy pasted all over the internet will suffice. Like....talk to people, be a friend if someone needs one, ask questions and listen. Actually getting to know someone is an act of kindness, not regurgitating an inspirational poster you saw at the school counselor's office. That takes no effort or consideration for another person's hardships whatsoever. \n\nIt's demeaning and I'd honestly go as far as to say selfish and cruel. Propping up the image that you're a ray of fucking sunshine, who farts glitter and shits rainbows, is kindaaaa a slap in the fact to someone who is in so much agony they want to end their existence. \n\nI get that that's not the intention but I don't know if that makes it much better.

            "Be very careful what you wish for.\n\nHere in Singapore, creating and spreading fake news was just outlawed under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which came into effect last October. According to the government, at least, the aim was to \u201cprotect society from deliberate falsehoods created by malicious actors by targeting falsehoods, not opinions and criticisms, nor satire or parody.\u201d [Here\u2019s the full Bill](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Bills-Supp/10-2019/Published/20190401?DocDate=20190401), [and here\u2019s a reasonably unbiased explainer of it](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/singapore-fake-news-protection-online-falsehoods-manipulation/).\n\nHowever, the enforcement of the bill *is up to Members of Parliament*, and so is the definition of \u201cfalsehood\u201d. Non-compliance with a POFMA takedown request will result in a fine of up to US$38,000 and/or a jail term not exceeding 5 years, if you\u2019re acting as an individual. Individuals acting on behalf of a corporation will be fined up to US$370,500. If bots are used, the max fine and jail term is doubled.\n\nWhat this means is that Members of Parliament have the full authority to take down anything they deem to be a \u201cfalsehood\u201d, and any disputes have to be settled with the MP first, before going to the courts. You can certainly imagine that there\u2019s huge potential for abuse here - that it might be used to quash dissenting opinions under the guise of \u201cfalsehoods\u201d.\n\nThe government has also set up a blog, [Factually.sg](https://www.gov.sg/factually), as well as [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/factually.sg/) and [Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/factually.sg) accounts, that display the articles/posts that have been served a POFMA takedown request, with a huge \u201cFalse\u201d stamp superimposed on them, as well as the government\u2019s own talking points rebutting the articles. Hmm.\n\nAs of late last December, it\u2019s now been used 5 times - 4 times against individuals, and once against Facebook. What\u2019s worth noting is that the 4 individuals were all considered to have viewpoints opposing the government, and all were opinion pieces.

A national news media must appeal to broad audiences for profit, making detailed stories difficult to justify, and can be bought and sold by private interests. A smaller local media based off of public funding can afford to focus on local stories (such as local companies dumping into local waterways, thus holding corporations to account in specific ways and using common investment of the local populace to cross the usual partisan lines that divide topics like conservationism on a grand scale).  \n\n\nThis isn't a perfect proposal, but it's leagues ahead of what we're currently dealing with in America, and more resistant to a lot of the problems we're currently facing. Instituting a means by which government officials can punish media outlets, while something I have often wondered about myself, is very likely to backfire. One need only look at the current U.S. administration to see examples of politicians that would willingly abuse this power to silence their critics. In modern democracies, it is the role of the media to hold the government to account by informing the public, but giving the government the ability to regulate their own regulators based off of personal beliefs of what is and is not true (again, a concept that is in theory universal, but in practice is horribly subject to interpretation and itself a corruptible process) is not likely to be the solution you're looking for.  \n\n\ntl;dr Imagine a Trump administration with the ability to legally punish the press.

If all this is established, even the most flamboyant surprise scoreboard balloons fireworks proposal puts no pressure on a \u201cyes\u201d because both partners are already on the same page that this is acceptable. I\u2019m of the opinion that even ring browsing should be a couple activity, or at least a passing conversation about what kind of style they like best so that the person planning a proposal has a general idea of what their partner would like - or if they would like a ring at all. \n\nTLDR Good communication saves a lot of headache and viral proposal disaster videos.",

No words were said, I only asked \"you sure?\", he tells me he is and I put the ring on. \n\nI thought it was a lovely intimate proposal because we don't need specific words to communicate our intentions. Most of my ex co-workers disagreed and mocked my husband outwardly for such a \"non proposal\" and further mocked me for buying my own, cheap ring (sterling silver and cubic zirconia).

We\u2019re so used to taking pictures and posting and sharing our lives with everyone - this was a moment that was truly just about us. \n\nNot saying that it\u2019s for everyone but looking back I\u2019m happy that we have this memory that no one else got the luxury to be a part of. There are no pictures for anyone to scrutinize or share or whatever because who cares. It was a private moment and absolutely perfect.",

            "My fianc\u00e9 proposed to me in front of the reflecting pool in Washington DC. Was it a surprise? Yes.  Did I know he wanted to propose? Yes.\n\nWe even went jewelry shopping together so I could get my finger sized and I could show him what I liked.  Now, I didn\u2019t know he was going to buy me the ring that I had loved or anything like that, but by that point we had talked so much about it it was obvious.\n\nTo be honest, when he proposed to me everything kind of went quiet around me.  I heard people cheering but it was almost like they were in a far off distance.  My focus was on him, the love of my life, getting on one knee and asking me to marry him.\n\nI don\u2019t care that we were both crying in public (I would NEVER otherwise).  I don\u2019t care that he did it with other people around, because they didn\u2019t matter.  It was just me and him and it was perfect because I could not imagine him doing anything differently.",

            "Sometimes a place that has a particularly important meaning to two people is a public place. In my experience very few proposals are a true surprise. Most couples know that it's a possibility if not exactly the timing or place because adults tend to discuss something as serious as marriage.\n\nIf you are prepared to accept a proposal just to avoid embarrassment you are an idiot. Equally, you are an idiot if you aim to leverage social pressure to secure a proposal. Any sane adult would hand the ring back in private if they were to embarrassed to do it publicly.",

            "That's not unpopular. But, truthfully you already need to know what your partner is going to say. If you are unsure re-evaluate your relationship. The worst thing you can do going into a marriage is being unsure of your partner. But doing a big public proposal is pretty douchey. My sister and brother in law did a pretty neat one. They went to a park to take pictures (my family loves taking pictures, no idea why) and during their picture taking, he proposed. Super sweet and it was just the two of them. I proposed to my wife in the parking lot of a cracker barrel. She's loves that place and it reminds her of her dad who passed away a few months before we got engaged. Meant a lot to us, but sounds odd to other people.",

            "There's nothing wrong with proposing in public, but do not propose if you haven't ever discussed getting engaged.\n\nMy fianc\u00e8 and I knew one month into our relationship that we wanted to get married someday. 11 months later, he proposed to me at the airport when he was picking me up, and brought my best friend to record it.\n\nIt can be an amazing experience, if you know 100% that both of you want to get engaged.",

            "Totally 100% agree. And like many of these comments mention, the time of the proposal should be the only surprise. My now fianc\u00e9 took me to the park where we hiked on our first date. On the exact trail that we both love and have visited many MANY times. It was just us and it was perfect.",
            "I did this aaaaaallll wrong.  My now wife then girlfriend wanted to go with me to look at rings, I found one I really liked with a matching wedding band that she also loved.  Luck would have it that it was in her size and just seemed ment to be.  So out of fear of it not being there when I would come back later to buy it we both decided to buy it right there for her.  This was both good and bad.\n\nFirst she knew she loved her ring, but now she knew that there was a ring.  There was no way I was going to be able to surprise with popping the question.  The people behind the counter handed me the box with the ring in it.  Looked down at it, looked at mg wife who was looking at it and then did the dumbest thing i could have done in that situation.\n\n\nI held the box out to her and said \"here\".\n\nWe still joke about it today but sometimes she gets sad about how she never got a real proposal.\n\n\n\nThat being said you are right, kinda.  You should not have your first conversation of marriage when you are proposing, especially in public.  Poping the question when in public when you both have had this conversation a minimum of one, but preferably multiple times and the most recent ones the answer wasn't \"maybe in the future\" but a \"yea that would be nice\".\n\nIf you have had this conversation and pop the question in public and the person feels pressured into saying yes but doesn't want to that means you have lying problems in the relationship and need to ether break it off or fix it.\n\nSo public proposals are great if you know the answe will be a yes.",
            "I 100% agree. I proposed to my wife in a quiet corner of an empty park without a photographer and it couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. Just her and I. My parent were so disappointed but I don\u2019t care. This was my thing, I wasn\u2019t going to be influenced by anyone else.",

Over the next couple of years, I reported them several times because of my goddaughter having bruises, going hungry, telling me about drug use, etc. Eventually they refused to let me see her. When she was 13, I got a call she'd overdosed. She thankfully survived. But she spent the next few years in and out of rehab centers and mental hospitals. She's 18 now and out of the system, but the damage is there. Her dad is currently in the hospital recouping from a stab wound (drug deal gone bad) and his parents act like martyrs because they \"took in\" my troubled goddaughter. No. You fucked up your own kid to the point he became a junkie then helped your grandkid head down the same path.

            "I'm going to restrain comment on the information provided in OP's post, but I wanted to comment because there is disinformation being presented.\n\nTLDR: If you want to make a difference in society and help out children that desperately need help, become a foster parent and change the world for the better.  \n\nChildren are not automatically placed with grandparents.  That is not how things work, at least in foster care.  When a child is removed from a parent and placed under guardianship of the state, the first thing that MUST take place is a search for viable kinship placements.  This is law in the US for all states that I'm aware of.  This kinship placement can come from almost anywhere, even if they live outside the state.  Kinship can be fairly loose, as well.  Yes, grandparents are usually the first people that the state looks to because they are usually financially stable and usually still in the lives of the parents who lost their children.  \n\nAnybody that seeks placement for the children as kinship placements must meet certain criteria.  First, they must not have any history with DSS for any reason.  In my experiences, that excludes some, but not all.  They must also be financially stable, have a residence, have room to host the child, the physical and mental ability to care for the child, and be able to show that they are willing to accept the child through their 18th birthday.  Of course, some states are VERY lax on those points, but in most situations, they have to prove to the court that they fit these requirements with a 'reasonable amount of time'.  I've heard from other states that these checks don't happen for 6-9 months after the child was placed in kinship placements, so you can make your assumptions on how closely those requirements are followed.  \n\nAlso, parents don't automatically 'lose custody' when children are placed into foster care.  In fact, removing parental rights is a very VERY ... VERY long and complex legal process that can take years to complete.  A parent has one full year to follow whatever court orders are in place to their children reunited.  If the parent cannot complete those steps, the child is placed in guardianship the kinship/foster placement, or parental rights are terminated, and child is up for adoption.  \n\nNow... I'm not saying that kinship placements are the best.  Like OP said, there's a reason why parents are bad parents, and it sometimes comes down to family history.  Our social worker stated it this way:\n\n\"parents who have their children removed are F- grade parents.  Kinship placements only need to be D grade parents in the eyes of the courts.  Everybody wants A+ parents to step up, but they rarely do.\"",
            "There is also another concern when it comes to kids living with grandparents. Even if the grandparents are brilliant, you can't get away from the fact that they're usually old. I was partially raised by my paternal grandma from the ages of 5 to 11. She didn't have legal custody but she basically raised me. She would cook my food, do the laundry, keep the house clean, etc. She was the person that stood in between me and neglect (my mum wasn't around and my dad didn't put much effort it). Then when I was 11 she died very suddenly of a stroke. Not only did that devastate me but it also meant there was no one to care for me properly. Things got better but it was rough for a year.\n\nMy grandma was an amazing woman. I know that if she'd had a choice she would have stayed to make sure I was looked after, but she didn't have a choice.

She is one year older than our granddaughter. We talked with all our \u201ckids\u201d and made sure they were okay with having a baby sister and they were thrilled. Lol even with her being an Aunt/sister more like it to our granddaughter. \n\nThen came the system. Lmao. So...the grandmother who had done drugs with the mother (smh) all the sudden realized drugs are bad and told the judge this. She was not going to do drugs anymore. \n\u2014let me understand: you, the grandmother, did drugs with your 16 year old daughter with your granddaughter present, but now you all the sudden know drugs=bad and are not going to do them.  Umm oh okay. \n\nGuess what? Do you think we were allowed to adopt the baby? Of course not. Why? Because we had no say in the care of this child. Oh, did I forget to tell you this baby had been in 7 homes. Seven. Less than a year old and seven homes. She was with us for over a year. \n\nBut to grandmother she went.

My BGM tried to make her out to be a terrible daughter and that she'd do much better with me. Well, showing up to the court room not even wearing shoes didnt help her case. Also my foster mother brought up how much I hated going on visits with my BGM (i would do anything to not go, beg my foster siblings to hide me, run away, etc)  and long story short, the court made the right decision and kept me in foster care (with ability to be adopted by my foster parents, which they did, was completed when I was 8).

There are a lot of factors at play and essentially all of the child's well-being needs have to be considered, such as keeping them in the same school, and the nature of the relationship they have with relatives. When that can change is some states do have \"grandparents rights\" whereas others don't. And yes,  whether the grandparents played a role in how the parents turned out matters.

Even though the foster parents had raised her her whole life. 6 months later the child died in the care of her biological parents. \n\nThose parents were obviously not fit to care for her, she even died because of their negligence and abuse. But the system deemed it better that she be with the people who abandoned her in the hospital, simply because of biology. \n\nIt is a problem with child rights. The fact that abusive parents (and grandparents) get to have custody even though they are abusive, shows that their rights matter more than the child\u2019s.

I have a younger sister and i couldnt just abandon her like that. So i decided to keep quiet and go along with it.

The grandparents already had the familial relationship which is good for kids and they were generally stricter, in a good way. Both of my friends have gone on the graduate from college and get good jobs. If you ask them they will attribute their success to the stable household and close community they were placed in and they say they would have never gone to school if they stayed with their parents.

But they're not these selfless, perfect heroes who live only to serve the greater good.\n\nThey're individuals with individual personalities. Some are friendly and loving, some are more stand-offish and don't like people or other dogs very much, and some, like some people, are fucking assholes.\n\nSome dogs will rescue kids from rubble, some will help stop seizures, and some will bite your feet in the middle of the night because you dared to roll over and rustle the covers.\n\nSome dogs want to play with everyone and every dog they meet. Some will attach themselves to the pants legs of your nice neighbor who was just trying to bring in the groceries, then bark their stupid little heads off at every single person, car, dog, squirrel, or leaf that goes past the window, so you move all the furniture away from the window so she can't see out anymore but it doesn't matter because she can still *hear* the cars and the little fucker just Won't. Stop. Barking.\n\nSometimes they're lovable friends who want to play all the time. Sometimes they try to bite you every time you sit on the fucking couch. It's been 12 years, I'm allowed on the couch. Get it through your stupid, grapefruit-sized dog head already!\n\nAnyway, yes, we deserve dogs. Dogs are just people. Some are cool, some suck.",

If people were as horrible as they though, they'd not have such great values as to love dogs. They're just frustrated at their own as well as other peoples weakness and imperfection. Their *inability* to do good, not their *unwillingness*.\n\nTo address your point, people refuse to see the bad things in dogs like parents refuse to see the bad aspects in their children.

Some dogs are TRAINED to be therapy dogs but we don't go around saying, \"We dont deserve doctors or therapists!\" I mean the sheer amount of work you have to do to get recognition as a person is made apparent when a dog is cute.\n\nCuteness goes a long way. I have a a toddler and I cannot believe how much I love him, but I had to accept that some of that unbelieveable cuteness goes away and eventually when your teenager is throwing a tantrum because the internet isn't working or something.

He hit her enough that she would cower if you raised your arms near her. Yet she loved all of the family including him. I don't think anyone DESERVES that kind of love.

Today he has a free run of the farm, he's confident, well fed and sleeps in a warm, safe place every night. \n\nIs he perfect? No. Sometimes he can be a little C$%T. Not my word. My son gave him that nickname after he sat on top of a chicken and pulled out a few feathers. For some reason, our pup thinks it's funny.",

The second dog grew up in an abusive home (rescue), but she\u2019s really kind towards humans, sticks to my mom at all times, but can get pissy when other dogs try to get attention from my mom. The third, a new puppy, spent 2 months from birth in a barn with no people, so she had no clue about human home behaviors, but we have managed to teach her that no, biting isn\u2019t very playful, and that no, peeing inside is not cool. By teaching your dogs, you won\u2019t have a rabid dog who bites anyone at all times.",
            "My eldest daughter regularly complains about the dogs on our corner keeping her from sleeping.  They aggressively bark at anyone, beast or human, who walks by, and their neighbor has told us when she goes outside the dogs attack the fence and fight each other when there\u2019s no one to bark at.  Bad owners who never walk them either.  Those dogs aren\u2019t any sort of blessing to our neighborhood but I will say this: we definitely don\u2019t deserve them, because no one deserves those heels created by the people who let them get that way.\n\nThere\u2019s also a preponderance of people obsessed with dogs because no one else can stand them.  Dogs should be additional to friends and family, not a replacement."

All the while a bunch of industries are struggling to find actual qualified vocational workers.\n\nPlus the overreliance on delivery trucks is terrible for the environment and the air quality, and holds back the development of more efficient and green distribution solutions.\n\nEdit: I can see this hit a raw nerve for some, i mostly meant smaller delivery trucks and vans that do most of the local distribution, not the international/interstate rigs. Only a few years ago a person would drive to the nearby shopping center to buy whatever they needed, while now each item arrives on a separate day as a separate drive, needing more and more people who just drive shit around in vans.\n\nI know in the US there is an overmystification of trucker life and i'm not trying to shit on that, enjoy while it gets automated. I spent several overnights on european borders back when that was a thing and as far as European international trucking is concerned the bar is pretty low there, not to mention most stuff could be really expected to be handled by rail if it wouldnt be so fucking overunionized and segmented accross the EU. \n\nAlso congrats for some for coming in last on the \"maintaining one's cool while arguing on the internet\" contest.",

I\u2019m not saying this in a homophobic way.

            "Allow me to respond with my experience:\n\nI did this to my bullies in elementary and middle school.\n\nI was picked on for being so much larger than the other kids (taller, husky but not obese - about 3-4 grade levels ahead in size). I was a nerd. Socially awkward. \"Gifted\" but with very little sense of social norms. Awkward, to put it mildly, but I meant well, I just never got the memos the other kids seemed to about how to behave to fit in better.\n\nSo some kids would pick on me. I never lost a fight, but about once a year, maybe twice, it would get to a full-on brawl. But kids are stupid, right? They don't know to pick targets.\n\nThe fights were fucking sad. One kid wouldn't stop talking about my mother, so I came up behind him, grabbed his head, and smashed it into a wall while screaming at him to never talk about my mom again (I love my mom!). This was fourth grade. Another time, a kid jumped on my back. I pushed back into a wall, crushing him until he let go. Fifth grade, I grabbed a kid who punched me, threw him down, put my knees on his shoulders, and laughed while I slapped the shit out of him. Finally, a teacher saw it.\n\n6th grade I laughed while I picked up a guy and dropped him, twice, then kicked him. 7th grade, a guy picked a fight with me in the locker room. I got ahold of his arm and whipped him into the shower stall walls until the coach intervened.\n\nI took some hits. I had no \"training.\" I was just much, much bigger and much stronger.\n\n*I could have really hurt those kids.*\n\nThey never really \"hurt\" me - the pain was minor, and what the principals told me was true - I could have really hurt those kids. I shouldn't fight back like that.\n\nThey were totally correct, and I (and those kids) are very lucky there was no permanent harm.\n\nSo what did it get me? Did they learn a lesson? Did they stop picking on me?\n\nFuck no, they're kids. Get real.\n\nDid I get a reputation as a psycho who was a danger to be around? Yep. That rep followed me into high school, as it turned out, even though I hadn't been in a real fight since 8th grade. I found out that some people avoided me. Some people were worried about being alone with me. Girls who were my friends got asked, \"How can you hang around him? Aren't you worried he might hurt you?\"\n\nThat broke my heart. I thought I was defending myself. Only hurting people who hurt me, who \"deserved\" it.\n\n*It* *accomplished absolutely nothing.*\n\nI can't overemphasize that. *NOTHING* changed. They didn't learn their lessons - they're fucking children. No bully ever got physical with me more than once, sure, but it didn't end the torment. I ended up with a reputation as a fucking monster, and guess what? Assholes and bullies still pick on monsters, but nice people - people I might have liked to know, people who might have been friends - those people avoid the monsters.\n\nDefend yourself if you must, sure, but don't believe for a moment that \"turning the tables\" on them will do anything good.",

This kid was slender and tall, and he was fast, but I was more determined than energy and I chased him out into the track and field, he lost stamina and I was making a slow gain on him but now I was seriously doubting if I could catch him and also have the breath to fight, and at that moment I saw a broken piece of a two by four on the ground about 2.5 feet long, about 1/3 of the width, so about a 2 by 1.33 On the ground, he gains about 10 feet in the time it takes me to pick up the wood, making him about 20 feet away, I call his name and he turns to look at me and I threw that stick just like I\u2019ve thrown axes in scouts and I land it directly in the middle of his head just past his hair line, blood immediately starts streaming down his face and in an instant I realized I fuck up bad.....\n\nI immediately go to him and tell him I\u2019m sorry and I\u2019ll help him, using my scout training I apply firm pressure to his wound and stop the bleeding, but now a crowd of kids gather round and pull me off because they think I\u2019m still trying to hurt him. He goes to the hospital for stitches and my parents come in to school mom from home and dad from work, we go to the principles office, police are there, parents, the principle asks my story, already had many others, he asks my parents their thoughts on what happened and they\u2019d said the kid is a bully and our son asked for permission to fight back and we gave him our blessing..... the principle, me and my parents were silent for what felt like and eternity. Then the principle said to my parents: \u201c I can\u2019t really expel or even give you suspension, because you were attacked first, but for prudence and to let this blow over why don\u2019t you pull him out of school for three days and we will record it as excused and we can let everyone assume you were suspended.....\u201d My mom says to me \u201cwanna go to the beach tomorrow?\u201d... and that\u2019s how I got a three day vacation from school for cracking a kids head head open (a small 1cm chip to his skull, mostly all tissue damage) with a broken chunk of a two by four.....\n\nNow of course my parents head some mature conversations with me about anger management and consequences.\n\nAround decade later we crossed paths, and he actually apologized to me... he said when he came back to school everyone was telling him he deserved it and had it coming, he said it was a real eye opener..... so we both became better people from the experience.",
            "Consequences are important.  For both sides.  Consequences are how children learn.\n\nI'm an old man.  We didn't have the same bullying issues when I was in school, or if we did, we certainly didn't get so bothered by it.\n\nSome kid says something that bothers me.  I bust him him the mouth.  Teacher takes me to the office and I get in trouble.\n\nHe learns a valuable lesson to watch his mouth.  I learn a valuable lesson to control my temper.  Everybody comes away a better person for the experience.\n\nWhen you add \"without repercussion\", that becomes the problem.  That's just more entitled punk kids who think that they can do whatever they want, as long as the other person \"deserves it\".  Nope.\n\nIf you want them to have consequences for their actions, you have to accept those for yourself as well.  I'm not even saying not to do it.  I pasted more than a few kids throughout my youth, and I got the odd shiner myself when I said something I shouldn't have.  But if you think that their words are so terrible that you should have the right to beat them up over it, then surely you can recognize that your fists hurt worse than their words ever did.\n\nDo what you think is best.  Accept your punishment like a man.  Don't make excuses.  Make it worth it.",

They were lashing out for being treated as the \"it\" by their peers. (often due to anger issues keeping them from playing well with others, likely brought on by insecurities stemming from the same ostracizing behaviour.). Often it was two ostracized kids lashing out at each other, each seeing themselves as the victim and putting each other down in a vain attempt to win approval from the other children.  Most physically violent kids could be brought to a better path if you could find them another kid to become their best friend. Mostly lonelyness problem.

            "Yeah, I think the first thing some people think of when they hear the word \"nuclear\" are the bombs then they assume that every nuclear power plant will have a meltdown like Chernobyl.",
            "Nuclear energy gets some bad press, but most of this is unfounded. Nuclear energy has unfortunately suffered some pretty large PR disasters in the past (Chernobyl, Fukushima etc) and this has understandably shaken public trust in its safety. Despite its bad rep, nuclear energy has consistently been shown to be orders of magnitude safer than most other methods of electricity generation.\n \n[Studies ](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh) have shown that nuclear energy causes just 0.07 deaths for every tera-watt hour of electricity generated. This is in comparison with 2.82 for gas, 18.43 for oil and 32.72 for coal. Nuclear power plants do not release any carbon dioxide during the course of energy generation and even accounting for CO2 emissions during construction, the emissions associated with nuclear energy are still 50 times lower than those associated with coal power and 30 times lower than those associated with natural gas [(source).](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/reconsidering-risks-nuclear-power/) \n\nOne often overlooked aspect of the pollution released by coal power is that ash released from burning coal often contains highly concentrated levels of thorium and urainium. [Studies ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/) have shown that exposure to the elevated levels of radioactive material present in coal ash has the result that people living in the vicinity of coal power stations experience radiation doses up to 200% greater than those living close by to nuclear power plants. Bizarrely enough, the radioactive waste produced by burning coal is actually more radioactive than the waste from nuclear power and yet there are no restrictions on coal ash simply being released into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy is a low carbon, low risk method of energy generation and has an essential part to play in the battle against climate change.",
            "I honestly think people just don't want to live near it because of Chernobyl",
            ">Nuclear is the best, cleanest, and most sustainable option that we have at the moment to power the world.\n\nI am a former Navy Nuclear Power Program Electronics Technician Instructor. \n\nI will take exception to this because we haven't bothered researching anything that isn't a breeder reactor.\n\nA breeder reactor is one that fits into the only model we use, and a couple of the theoretical models. The current version of the reactor that we use was first developed by The Manhattan Project, to the point that SCRAMing the core is an industry standard term referring to the fact that the original reactor had a single control rod, that was pulled by hand and rope, out of the core. The SCRAM was quite literally the Safety Control Reactor Axe Man. SCRAMing the core today means that you just hit an angry red button that immediately unlocks the magnetic seals of the lifting screws, and (hopefully) all the control rods just dropped to the bottom of the core, stopping nuclear fission completely. The (hopefully) is there because in less than 1% of the time, the rods didn't bend, expand, contract, or any other physical variation, but the pressure won't allow these 1ton rods to fall. It happens so rarely that I have actually SCRAMed my core twice, and know about 25 people who have SCRAMed thier core a total of 95 times, and none of us had to use the \"manual protocol\".\n\nIf we would just finish the designs of Thorium Molten Salt Reactors, with way less than 1 Trillion in development, probably only a couple billion to be honest, then we would have a reactor that a) it is physically impossible to melt down, b) can use 90%+ of current nuclear waste as fuel, and c) cannot be used to make bombs.\n\nObviously point C is why we won't invest in this technology, since we could literally give this version of nuclear tech to our enemies and it would only help them to create stability and world peace, which isn't profitable for the MIC\n\nEdit: oh and that isn't even discussing that the only reactor we will build is the cheapest, most dangerous, and least profitable design we have ever come up with.",
            "Nobody in this thread has mentioned the huge costs of mining and refining uranium before its ready to be used. It takes a lot of CO2 to do all of that, and mines can be small scale environmental disasters. \n\nStill better than mining & burning coal though. Just something to factor in",
            "I've never heard a good answer for all the radioactive waste. Putting it in the ground isn't a good enough answer. I could definitely be convinced that it's a great option, but it doesn't look good right now.",
            "That's not the only reason. There's also the fact that nobody really knows what to do about the high-level radioactive waste material which is produced. That's problematic.",
            "what do we do with the waste??",
            "I agree with the sentiment, not necessarily the phrasing. Nuclear is the best option we have available at the moment, until we can figure out renewables, which could take multiple decades. We should definitely be going with nuclear energy for the sake of the environment, but it isn't \"sustainable\", it's a stopgap solution.",
            "I personally am afraid of what the future holds. Yes, what you said is true for this moment in time, but what happens if the earth becomes less stable in the future. More frequent/intense earthquakes, sink holes. What happens if where it was thought safe to build a plant then becomes very unsafe. Also human error is always a possibility of failure.",
            "The original reactors were the same as small nuclear submarine  reactors, but scaled up. These were difficult to stabilize, regulate, and had loads of waste issues. Terribly inefficient designs, though they have been improved on in time.\n\nI'm a huge huge huge fan of the thorium reactors currently in experimental phases. Reactions require less pressure to start and are easy to stop. The waste is much less than uranium and has a shorter half-life. There's also the idea of reseeding spent fuel in the reaction chamber so you can recycle spent fuel rods. The reactors require less space and support, can be scaled up or down to meet demands. And operate at about 75% the cost of uranium per gigawatt of energy created. \n\nUnfortunately people hear \"nuclear\" think chernobyl, 3 mile island, or Fukushima, and default to \"No\" before exploring further.",
            "Well maintained and engineered nuclear power is great. It's just pretty awful when it's not.",
            "I'm not anti nuclear but I'd say Chernobyl disaster and Fukashima disaster highlight the very real devastation that can be wrought when nuclear radiation becomes uncontained. Both were very different circumstances and both still haven't seen the full effects of each disaster.",
            "God this sort of thing gets posted to Reddit so much, who\u2019s selling?",
            "Speaking as a physicist, I have to disagree. Nuclear meltdowns are a concern but a bigger issue is that it produces a tremendous amount of radioactive waste that we do not have a good solution for. Concerns about ground water contamination, soil contamination, etc are increasing as facilities are aging and the waste is piling up.  It's a serious problem. \n\nYears ago, when I worked as a satellite engineer, we were tasked to do a study to discover if sending our nuclear waste into the sun was a feasible solution. The risks of a launch failure ended up saying 'no' so we generally just keep sticking it in holes in the ground (often not properly shielded) but I can assure you, this is a significant and growing concern for the governments around the world.\n\nNuclear is anything but \"clean\".  We need a real solution that doesn't just create more shit for future generations to have to clean up.",
            "Its not the name. There are just issues with it. Wikipedia has an overview of it here:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate\n\nI read some analysis of it done by a nuclear engineer a while ago(couldnt find it again), but I can summarize some of the talking points from it. \n\n1) they need a lot of water or a lot of extra infrastructure to be able to reuse water. \n\n2) there are a lot of nuclear related incidents, when it provides barely any of our power. If we make a ton of reactors, we are hugely increasing the safety risks involved, both in terms of accidents and terrorist targets. \n\n3) the fuel supply that we can use isnt that large. It would at most be a transition to another energy source, but now youve got all these reactors that are made to last for decades that have to be decomissioned, which itself can take a decade. Most energy sources are much easier to get rid of when they are unneeded. \n\n4) they are large energy sources that are only suited for places with a high demand for energy. Most energy sources can be scaled up or down more easily, but with nuclear there is a large base amount of infrastructure necessary, so you need a high production to make it profitable. \n\nThey are also just highly regulated in the US, with regulations changing frequently. It makes it difficult to invest in, because the reactors need to be updated so often. They are definetely good energy sources in some circumstances, but they are not a perfect solution. \n\nIMO, the worst issues to deal with are terrorist attacks and amount of fuel. I see absolutely no way of being able to guarantee that terrorist attacks wont be successful, and the potential damage from it is huge. Even in the perfect scenario where it goes well in first world countries, it wont in others. The fuel issue means that if we switched to nuclear, we are adding a ton of issues that we need to solve and infrastructure that needs to be built, when the solution is only viable for a few decades. At that point, you might as well just put those resources into a different energy source.",

            "Given the expense, entire countries can't run on nuclear, either.",
            "Cost and time. One nuclear power plant will probably take ten years to build, and take huge initial investment, not to mention running costs once it starts working. Solar power is pound for pound cheaper and faster, and of course there's the whole \"won't make the whole area uninhabitable if it goes wrong\" thing. Not getting enough energy stored on cloudy days? Just make more of them.",
            "All spent nuclear fuel is currently in temporary storage. 100% of it. As in all spent nuclear fuel that has ever been produced, all the fuel from every country and every experiment and every reactor, all of that is in **temporary storage**. \n\nAgain, we have been \"*temporarily*\" storing spent nuclear fuel for up to 80 years now. \n\nIn the 80 years since nuclear reactors became reality, we have had 15 nuclear meltdowns, 2 of which caused radioactive material to be released into the environment, causing large areas of land to become effectively unusable, and another meltdown that almost went into the environment but was stopped by pure chance. \n\nThat's an average of a meltdown every 5 years. Not a great track record. We have only started trying to build permanent storage in the last 5 years, and it will take decades for that to store all the waste we currently have produced. The answer isn't to produce more.",

Overall nuclear is never going to catch up with the viability of other systems because it's been left at the way side regulation aren't going to change allowing nuclear to be more dangerous while its so strict you are allowed less radiation from working in nuclear power plant then you get from being outside.\n\nIf we had taken the course long ago nuclear could be king but its slow turn around plus high upfront costs has reduced it to second rate compared to our present options.",

So far we are storing them at the nuclear plant, but what happens next? No one has a definite answer which makes it difficult to calculate profits from the power plant (it has to account for wastes disposal costs) which makes finding investments even more difficult. \n\n* nuclear energy requires nuclear enrichment which is restricted by nonproliferation agreements.

Like here in Ukraine we produce 50% of our electricity on nuclear plants but we depend on Russia for the nuclear fuel. \n\n* Another issue with long payback time: imagine I\u2019m building a nuclear plant and planning that it will bring profit in 2040s. With the current progress rate with renewable technologies my power plant may become less efficient than wind or solar by then.  Those kind of power plants require only few years to install which is another risk for investors. \n\nI\u2019m not against nuclear power, it\u2019s a really godsend solution comparing to gas and especially coal but its not at all as perfect as Reddit paints it.",

I live in a generation of people who want instant gratification and are instantly discouraged from trying new things when they aren't immediately good at them.  Nobody is.  That's an important lesson to learn while growing up.\n\nChildren need to learn to admire others instead of unjustly having their egos inflated by those around them who tell them they are geniuses, kings, queens, princesses, future Kobe Bryants.  If they admire people better than they are, they will have role models.  They will learn respect, diligence, patience and to be humble in their pursuits of improvement.

            "my philosophy; beat them, but show them *how* and give them tips on how to counter or do it themselves. for example, i play a lot of fighting games (think things like Street Fighter) with my little sister; i'll beat her, show her what combo i did and/or how to avoid/counter it, and then the next we play, she'll try and use them. so far, it's worked with flying colors; there are some games where she'll obliterate me even when i try my hardest lmao",

Some things are more important",
            ">Children need to be humbled in the presence of *real ultimate power*\n\nYeah, this is what happens when kids grow up starved for positive feedback. They turn 25, beat children at video games, and lavish the praise denied to them in their youth upon themselves.\n\nKids do not need to be brought low by those they love and respect. Life humbles them plenty enough already. They don't get to eat what they want, or go to bed when they want. They don't get to decide what to do with their days. Give them a W in super smash bros, you bully.",

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re taking it to that extreme, but the fact people are hyperbolically agreeing with you makes me think it isn\u2019t that much of a stretch of the imagination. I think allowing children to FEEL like they\u2019re persevering against a seemingly unbeatable foe is the key. I let my cousins get close to beating me in games, because shutting them down doesn\u2019t encourage them to play against me again, unless they want to train, but training is work and so on and so forth",

            "The games should be adjusted so the child has a reasonable CHANCE of winning.  \n\nFor example if it is a race across the yard the adult could be on their hands and knees or if the child is a little older, the adult runs backwards. A little older the distance they each runs is proportional to height.",

            "I agree with this up to a certain point. Kids do need to learn what skills or talents other people have and what the ceiling might look like at certain activities in terms of skill level. Just letting the kid win all the time so you don't hurt their feelings is going to give them a warped view of their own skill level that's going to turn around and bite them in the ass when they go out into the real world. Also they need to learn how to deal with losing at something. Also, if you just let them win all the time, that might give them a strange impression that either all the adults around them are incompetent or that they themselves are blessed with godlike talent - neither of which you want a kid thinking if it's not true. With that being said you can't just dominate them 100% of the time every time. If you do that they'll probably just get demoralized and give up. Or they will just not engage in that activity with you anymore because it's not fun to just lose to you every time. I think you as the adult have to play this balancing act where you demonstrate to them how good one can be and how much the kid still needs to learn, but still give them opportunities to have success and develop their skills from time to time.",
            "I was teaching my 3 young cousins to play magic one day.

            "It greatly depends.\n\nI wont let them win AT FIRST.\n\nBut if I see that they're busting their ass practicing so that they can be good, then I'll let them win occasionally.\n\nMy older sister would often go way too far in trying to prove her dominance. Looking back, it felt less about teaching me about respect and more about protecting her own ego. It was kinda pathetic of her.\n\nSo yeah, my philosophy is to never let kids win AT FIRST. \n\nLet them sweat for a while. They can handle it.\n\nBut if I see them genuinely sweating blood and tears in order to get good and I STILL see that they are losing, I'll show mercy and let them win.\n\nFuck. They're still kids at the end of the day.\n\nThat's my take on this.\n\nAlso, if you see that they are genuinely getting upset and that they NEED to feel good: that isn't the time to try to demolish them. \n\nWe're the adults.

Then you lose a bit more people start questioning whether you are eating enough, or they make comments calling you skinny etc.\n\nMy wife felt like everything was about her weight, family, friends, Co workers all had their opinion on it. She became obsessive over a self imposed calorie cap. She won't eat anything that someone else makes for her, even me, because she needs to know the exact calorie content.

            "Ah, finally somebody says something about this topic. I agree",
            "The reason to give two weeks is because you want the company to give you a good reference. I wouldn\u2019t want to hire someone who left their last company high and dry. Why would I have any reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t do the same thing to me?",
            "You aren't obligated? I don't know where you get that idea but you don't have to give advance notice to the employer. It is a general practice for people when they want to leave on good terms. \n\nIf your employer is shit and you don't care about a burnt bridge do whatever you want when you quit. But people leave jobs for many reasons and don't always want it to end on bad terms. So they give their boss a heads up and help with the transition in those last few weeks while saying goodbye to coworkers.",
            "There\u2019s definitely a difference between losing your job over a company issue and getting fired for not showing up/being a blatantly bad worker. I don\u2019t think the latter should require notice. I work at a restaurant and it\u2019s constantly irritating when people get away with not coming to work again and again before finally getting fired. \n As far as giving notice before you quit\u2014even if your employer is a crappy person, you often have coworkers who are relying on you so you kind of screw everyone over for not letting anyone know.",
            "I agree, a lot of things are like this where the employee is supposed to be more respectful to the company than the company is to him or her.",
            "You shouldn\u2019t be quitting until you\u2019ve secured your new job. Once you do that, quit however you want.",
            "That's current law everywhere that allows no cause termination.\n\nAs others mentioned, it's a cultural norm. Given how major employers behave, it probably should go away.",
            "I'd only quit a job without notice if I hated my boss, my coworkers, and everyone that would be impacted by me quitting. And I would not attempt to use that job as a reference.",
            "\"At will\" employment sounds more haphazard than it actually is in practice. Sudden termination has to be for-cause with documentation or else the employer is on the line to pay the ex-employee to, if they choose, ride the couch for the maximum term of unemployment benefits. If I fire you, I have to be ready to fight you on unemployment too (which is absolutely not slanted in the employer's favor by default) because I'll still be paying you anyway if your claim is approved. \n\nWith that being said, the two-weeks notice is generally just a motion of respect to your coworkers and managers, no matter how bad you perceive them to be. Networking is important in any career. Therefore, forcing your coworkers to suddenly stop their lives to cover your sudden no-show and/or management to drop everything to replace you and/or reassign your duties won't bode well if you continue down that path. You never know who may be influential in your future career and that's why it's key to always maintain a, at worst, neutral relationship with all stakeholders in your workplace sphere of influence. There are obviously circumstances that could subjectively warrant petty revenge, but those are very rare.",
            "An employer *can* fire you without notice, just like you *can* leave without notice.\n\nMost employers don't do that, though. Many have performance improvement plans so you know months ahead that they might cut you. Even if you think it's unfair and your manager is setting you up to fail, it's in effect a long term notice so you can start looking for another job. Many companies offer severance pay during layoffs, which is the usual reason people get let go. And finally, you can pull unemployment if they didn't fire you for some cause (criminal stuff, essentially). \n\nSo unless you hear your employer fires people without notice or cause, if they are reasonable to you, you should be reasonable back. If they're toxic, they probably weren't going to give a good reference anyways, and leaving without notice is decent revenge imho. Just make sure you aren't hurting someone innocent, e.g. if you had a great manager but were dissatisfied with the higher ups not giving you raises/promotions. Burning bridges can hurt both sides.",

I had to sign one when I was 14 referring soccer, through working at a sub shop, to delivering newspapers, up until where I am now. In those contracts, it either defines you as an \u201cat will\u201d or \u201cfor term\u201d employee. \n\nIf you\u2019re an at will employee, your employee can fire you at will, but they still need to be acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d in the \u201cbest interest of the business\u201d with a \u201clegitimate business purpose,\u201d which is typically covered by the \u201cbusiness judgement rule,\u201d unless it can be proven the employee was fired with \u201cbad faith\u201d or \u201cbad intent.\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019re a \u201cfor term\u201d employee your employer cannot fire you until the \u201cterm\u201d is complete (whether that\u2019s a specific date or the completion of a project/season, etc.), but then there is usually another provision saying something to the extent of \u201cunless employee does x, y, or z\u201d (ex: violating other provisions of the contract). If these provisions are not listed then the MBCA, the sections states have adopted, or state/federal law (depending on other provisions/considerations such as choice of forum, choice of law, or jurisdiction) are default rules and act as \u201cgap fillers.\u201d \n\nIn regards to the \u201ctwo weeks\u201d rule, that\u2019s also usually included somewhere in the contract, so in essence it is technically required. If your employee/employer contract doesn\u2019t consist of such a provision, it\u2019s for the sake of your own reputation. Your new, potential employer does not want to hear from a reference that you just decided to quit one day and leave the rest of the staff short. It\u2019s plainly put, just disrespectful. No employer wants that characteristic. You also don\u2019t want to burn your bridges, you may find yourself needing to be rehired by the same company you left originally, or in need of a reference. \n\nTL;DR - Usually your employee contract mandates certain requirements for terminations to protect both employees and employers, such as provisions pertaining to a two weeks notice and the inability to fire an \u201cat will\u201d employee without good faith.",

            "Edit: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn\u2019t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn\u2019t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn\u2019t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun\u2019 a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn\u2019t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I\u2019ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.",
            "Youre right in that its not fair- but its because typically the employer has more power.\n\nIf they fire me for no reason, not much I can do about it.

It inevitably makes it much harder for me to find a job. \n\nBecause a company is comprised of a ton of people, it's hard for one person to destroy them, but it's easy for them to ruin your future.",

            "I'm not going to lie, I frequent r/AmItheAsshole a lot. However, I have several criticisms with the users. First of all, the validation-seeking posts, God. It's so annoying to see people who IN NO WAY can be in the wrong ask from help for others. AITA is supposed to be a morally ambiguous place that discusses the morality, consequences, and benefits of a situation's possible outcomes, not a place to post about things that you could take up with someone else or with another subreddit. If you know that the situation you're in is wrong, you need to call a therapist, the police, a friend, someone! I understand that victims often seek validation from others, but it gets to a certain point where it becomes terribly concerning and annoying to repeat the same sentences over and over again to someone who knows something to be true, but denies it. While reddit can be a great place to get another, objective, third-party opinion about a situation, you need to someone else about your issues.\n\nSecondly, the posts that are *obviously* in the wrong. Posts like \"AITA for slapping my children\" or \"AITA for kicking out a homeless man from my home because he was gay\" are going to contain OPs that are totally wrong! It's more likely that the OP is either a troll trying to get people to collectively hate him for some reason, or they're the wronged person of the situation trying to, once again, get validation from others that the other person is a horrible person for doing something from them. It's more often than not a shitpost, because what horrible person would be self-reflective enough to use a platform like reddit to get other opinions?\n\nThird, the cluelessness of the users. This is going to sound pedantic, but please, please read the automated comments if you're a new user to reddit. Use the correct acronyms, ask for information if necessary, don't be afraid to call out an SHP if you see one. People tend to jump on the bandwagon too fast, and, like this OP pointed out, it can be frankly toxic, especially when the majority is wrong. Blatantly obvious SHPs are toxic for everyone, especially if they just incite fear, racism, hatred in fake, racist stories.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point. Like this OP pointed out, the fake stories need to stop. Most people are going to be assholes in the situation they talk about, but they will sprinkle in a random factor to make them look better. It's so obvious sometimes it's infuriating. Don't upvote those.",

It's insulting to actual rape victims.\n\nYou chose to have sex, it was good, so it was consensual.

            "To all those who are saying \u201cyes, this is asshole behaviour but it\u2019s not rape\u201d:\n\nI used to be an escort part time, through a website. There was a section of your profile where you could pick which sex acts you\u2019d be willing to do, and generally set how much each one would cost, or you\u2019d figure out a different way of pricing or whatever. Oral, PinV and Anal (i.e. penetrative sex acts, not including hand stuff) also had separate \u2018without condom\u2019 options. Meaning there was Oral, Oral without, PinV, PinV without, etc., and you could (and were encouraged to) set different prices for them. It makes sense that way because either you\u2019re opting to say \u201cI\u2019d like to do this with a condom please\u201d and accepting a slightly lower price in exchange, or saying \u201cI don\u2019t mind condomless\u201d and can charge more for it. \nMy point is, with and without condom are two separate acts, with two different arrangements of consent. If we\u2019re talking about the hypothetical sex we started with (girl consents to sex with condom, man gets rid of condom and initiates sex without it), he never confirmed consent to start sex condomless, so why wouldn\u2019t it follow logically that if they\u2019re engaging in a sexual act that she didn\u2019t consent to (whether or not she\u2019s aware, it doesn\u2019t actually matter), that would mean she\u2019s being raped, no?",

One of which is frequently the use of contraception, to protect all parties from the spread of disease in the case of condoms and other means can be used for avoiding unwanted pregnancy. \n\nIf any party has given consent to sexual intercourse with the condition that a given contraceptive is in use the removal or nonexistence of that contraceptive would breach the express conditions of consent given by the injured party. That IS rape.\n\nIt is not fraud or any other crime. It may be both those things but it is rape.\n\nSimple.",

            "I think something some people don't entirely understand is, not everyone is great at talking about really personal stuff. It might be easy for you to outright say what's on your mind, but there are people who get very anxious when thinking about bringing up personal problems. Dropping hints is a subtle way to get the person your talking to to *reach out* and help kickstart things when someone would otherwise leave things unsaid. It's not a fun thing to deal with and it's a habit people need to break, because being honest and talking to others is just more healthy, but there's more to it than people trying to turn conversations \"into a game.\"\n\n\nI used to drop hints a lot when I was stressed out, hoping friends I cared about would show they care without me having to go out of my way to ask for it. I felt lonely and felt that if I were to bring up what was going on in my life to them, I'd be a bother. But if they reached out to me themselves without me having to ask, it'd show they cared enough about me to act without being told to if concerned. It was probably pretty annoying when I did that, I'll admit, but I think I've gotten better at avoiding that sorta thing since.\n\n\nDo what you can and be there for your friends when they need you though. It might not always be fun, but if someone is dropping hints that something is going on, do your best to talk to them and get a better understanding of what's going on. Maybe help them be more honest, chances are, they're not doing it because \"it's fun\" or because they want to build suspense.",

            "I disagree a bit. Ok, you can't guess everything, you are not a wizzard but it gets boring if the other person can't read basic things. A conversation needs interaction, I don't want to ramble information about myself or hear anyone ramble information about themselves, I want to interact, ask me questions, answer questions, be interested, know when it's your turn to talk, etc. When you are asked to guess is a way to participate in a conversation where the other person talks about themselves. We need to have some \"game\" in our interactions cause it makes our minds think, not only listen and wait to talk about you (or even worse interrupt)\n\nAlso hints is a great way to avoid people without having to be rude.",
            "The expectation of mind reading is baffling to me.  Some people honestly believe that they shouldn't have to verbalize their needs if they aren't being met.  I get it that in life and relationships, there are certain things that just happen harmoniously and we can meet some of each others' needs without a written contract signed in blood, etc.  But as soon as one party in the relationship can identify that a need is not being met, they need to be able to communicate this to the other party in a productive way.  In most relationships, I don't think there is any refusal to meet a particular need, but the struggle is with understanding how to communicate our needs.",

            "Sigh. Alright, you asked for it: People drop hints for three main reasons.\n\n\nFirst, you're in mixed company and they want to tell *you* something but not everyone else. Usually this is to protect *your* privacy or dignity but sometimes it's an attempt to communicate social discomfort and a desire to leave or change topics. Regardless the intent is to get your cooperation or attention on something without involving others, who may have less endearing personality traits like being an attention whore, gossiping, insensitivity, flat out inept, or painfully extroverted.\n\n\nSecond, to see if you're actually interested and paying attention or just a typical mouth breather being \"polite\" and really just waiting for their turn to talk. Women in particular (hi) aren't coy to be cute or flirty as much as to guard against narcissistic pieces of sh*t. Testing someone with hints is a way to identify and avoid them. Narcissists and emotionally abusive people are most usually also socially underdeveloped and lack empathy. Consequently subtlety and \"layers\" are not their thing. \n\n\nHinting is a way of testing for this because if they are paying attention, empathy usually dials a normal person into the subtext. Sociopaths lack empathy but they mask that with cognitive ability - they know what people's reactions are to typical situations. The inability to sniff out subtext is a good indicator you're dealing with someone on that spectrum. Most women know this intuitively, or at least subconsciously do it as a defense mechanism because toxic men are goddamn everywhere.\n\n\nThe last reason is related to the previous. As a man, you are of course completely clueless at how hard it is to show interest without being vulnerable to the aforementioned shitty people. Women are expected to be unfailingly polite, warm, and social. Fun fact: We don't want to with most people. People, in fact, suck. Rather a lot. Too many guys think we're just machines where if they insert kindness tokens they'll get sex. \n\n\nAnd other women are obnoxious in other ways. Abuse and trauma is so pervasive it's a foregone conclusion we're dysfunctional in one way or another. If you've ever seen two women take an immediate, strong, and seemingly irrational dislike to each other that's usually why. Incompatible neurosis. Conversely our close friends usually are broken in ways similar to us (or at least compatible). It's a running joke that love is just mutually compatible neurosis. \n\n\nThe reason nobody told you any of this is because your tone and manner of speaking is aggressive, abrasive, and entitled. They lumped you in with those twat waffles. Now i know there's a million keyboard warriors who will want to scream about how wrong i am and blah blah fukity, oblivious to how well their angry down votes and replies prove all of this. Or worse, they're white knights. Ugh. Just stop - it's okay to admit all this, it's not sexist, it's authentic. Scary, i know, but not threatening unless you are so scared of everything vanilla is the flavor for you. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother explaining this, especially on some anonymous internet site. But we're all stuck in our rooms alone with our thoughts, reflecting far too much on our own personal failings and ruminating.\n\n\nSo I took pity on you... And to be honest, I had no social skills starting out as an adult. None. And most people didn't take the time to get to know me to find out why I was - and i was in no particular hurry to inform them. So i limped on for a long time learning everything the hard way and being bitter. Maybe i see a little of that in you, under all the aggression. Maybe i remember how hard it was having nobody to give it to me straight why nobody gives it to me straight, and how much of a goddamn treadmill that was until i realized that I wasn't alone - lots of people deal with it too. The only difference was someone loved them enough to take the time to help. So hi. \n\n\nNow you know. You can stop being angry now. We're not playing a game with you. We're just trying to protect ourselves in a screwed up world the best we can. Sorry it took this long to hear this.",

However if this is meant as, people suck at dropping hints, and I wish they would use more useful hints because the \u201chint\u201d where they punch my arm isn\u2019t much fun, then I get it.",

            "OMG I thought I was the only one.....  This is something I hate the MOST about people...!!. I once lied to my teacher about not running off from school, I'm aware it was a dumb idea, and from the moment she found out, for about an year, I could sense that she didn't like seeing me in the same room as her. \n\nIt made my blood boil because it felt like she was in some acting classes, acting super nice with me in front of everyone, but having bad hints in disguise. I'll explain: \n\nfor example she says: \"being honest with your teacher can be very hard sometimes\", and give me a smiling glance. Or once she said, \" I understand the school isn't the best place where everyone would want to be \" and she would gaze over to me. \n\nThis went for about an year, and it made me want to not come to school. \n\nI soooooo much wish she got her shit together and had the balls to look me in the eyes and say, I hated you for doing this and that! \n\nThe world would be so much better if everyone was honest with eachother as much as possible. \n\nThen I wouldn't sit at home and think about some fucking conversation, and if they had bad or good intentions.\n\nAnd the liking part. What do I say about that... I would say if you wanna fuck with someone, just say they have good eyes, or they dress beautifully.... \n\nSay that, don't walk up to them, and tease them about having some stain or not having their hair done and laughing at them. That's not flirting, that's fucking annoying. \n\nThe best world I can imagine is where everyone is telling eachother the truth, being honest, and that people learn to handle the truth, very important.\n\nIt's easier to walk up to a girl and say you are beautiful or cute, rather that having to turn you attention away from her, so she becomes more attracted to you (not my words, read it somewhere)... \n....\nUgh.....!",
            "Sometimes people enjoy the subtleties of picking up on cues and knowing what the other wants without needing them to come right out and say it.

But, in terms of dating, it can elevate the romance.",

            "Idk man, I can't upvote you because I think what you're describing is absolutely toxic and I don't think it's an unpopular opinion. I hate unclear communication.\n\nI've communicated clearly in relationships and asked for the same back and they've literally looked at me like I've had two heads, then still proceed to bullshit me (that I find out later of course).\n\nI've even had someone over agree with what I was saying (which I did find a little weird at the time) then find out she wanted close to the opposite a couple weeks/months later. It's weird. It's toxic. I don't see how you can achieve lasting happiness that way and it's best to take all the hurt and leave them now. They may have their good moments and you may share some beautiful memories, but it's doomed to go down in flames from my experience and hurt you both more down the road. Let them play their games with someone who will roll dice with them while playing their own games, while you find someone on the same wavelength as you.",
            "Actually, dropping hints instead of saying things outright can serve a number of purposes:\n\n-It can help you determine things about the person you're talking to and whether they're the right recipient for whatever message you have. Sometimes, you're itching to share something, but are afraid of the other person cares about the same thing, or maybe the information in question is somehow a delicate matter and you want to be sure the other person won't mishandle it. Dropping a hint can gauge interest without committing to the topic, and if the person isn't picking up what you're putting down, chances are they aren't the right confidante for you.\n\n-It builds relationships. Fundamentally, it turns one person trying to tell the other something into a two-way conversation. If the other person catches on fast, it's indicative that the two of you think alike, and people like being around people who think similarly. If the other person doesn't catch on, you may still spin it into a positive easily - \"sorry, I'm used to people here talking in riddles, but I see you're above such things, so I'll just cut through the bullshit.\"\n\n-It puts emphasis on the fact that you have the information without actually divulging the information. Hey, manipulation is communication, too!\n\nRemember, transfer of information is only one use of human communication, and not actually one we devote most energy to.",
            "Depends on the circumstances and situation to hat the hint is bring made. If the receiver of the hint is likely to be offended or lose face publicly, then out of politeness, a hint may suffice. Sure there are strengths/levels to hints. And vice versa. \nI mean being straightforward is the preferred outcome, but again you need to read the situation. As an extreme example, even if a girl liked you and you are say making out (American petting) then you are blunt and say \u201cfo you want to fuck now?\u201d . Again depends on the girl, but a lot will suddenly find that a turn off. But dropping good hints while petting will get you further than lets fuck. I know i am over generalising, snd Over simplifying a very nuanced situation.",

            "The way i see it. Men ignore hints because they don't want false hope that girls are into them, when those hints could be totally platonic.

            ">Life's not a movie where you need to build a little suspense, nor is it a Romcom, if you're giving hints that you like someone.\n\nWhat do you think movies and drama in general is *based off of?* I don't understand how you can possibly think humans don't/shouldn't play social games. Complex social behaviors like talking about a thing in a subtle or indirect way serve an important function by allowing us to demonstrate and measure eachother's social intelligence. You can't just say, \"No, that's dumb, just say exactly what you mean all the time, it will save us all time.\" That's fucking stupid. If you don't have the perception to pic up on subtle social ques or, conversely, the tact to leave adequately obvious social ques (this isn't one sided of course), then you just lose. Maybe it would have been better if they had been more direct, but they're not at fault for playing social games *at all.* They just failed, that's all.",

Or at the very least it should be more achknowledged and not just glossed over by her fan base and a large sum of people. \n\nI don\u2019t really give a shit about her in terms of getting arrested or put in jail.

Snoop Dogg killed a rival gang member and beat the case because he was rich and nobody even talks about it anymore. Rappers like Gucci Mane, Notorious B.I.G., and Killer Mike, etc., rap about poisoning their communities with drugs and nobody bats an eye. The main similarity between all of these people and Cardi B is that they put their past behind them and dedicated their lives to making music which is an inarguably positive change. I get that Cardi B isnt a very good rapper and isnt really setting a good example for the youth, but neither are a lot of other rappers who are guilty of similar crimes and are not lambasted by everyone on the internet.

Then yes lock her ass up, but just because someone said they did something and there is no evidence (in the eyes of the law) unless someone else said they did it then its protected under free speech.

I personally find it embarrassing and nowhere does it say that this is a task you should have to perform.

            "Honestly, i kinda love it. Firstly, because if you do it well enough youre gonna get a sick tip. I used to work in a themed resturaunt that did like 13 different birthday songs depending on whether it was a child or adult\"male or female, or whatever. The goal was to embarrass the birthday person as much as possible. Its not for them. Not a single person ive ever encountered in my 15 years of serving has ever gone somewhere on their birthday and not dreaded the birthday song. The amount of times ive had a guest pull me aside privately before the meal ended and begged me to not sing to them is incalculable. And if theyre paying, i won't. But 9/10 the person who is paying isnt rhe birthday person, its their mom, gramma, or asshole friend who wants to laugh at their misfortune. And so i make the poor victim stand on their chair wearing a funny hat and loudly proclaim them the birthday person and make the ENTIRE resturaunt sing to them. It brings me no small amount of satisfaction to embarrass karens like this. Their margarita chugging friend is going to slide me an extra 20 for it. \n\nBut the anxious child? The cowering adult who is too scared to even look at me when i bring them drinks for fear of what comes next? They get a friendly but firm reminder told to their party that my job is to make their stay a pleasant one. Ill take a hitto my pay if it means making sure a little girl doesnt cry on her birthday.",

It can make you smile too! Life can be very tough. Full of bad days, struggles, and annoyances.

The drug wars have been an abysmal failure, and no laws should exist that punish a nonviolent person for drug usage. But that doesn't mean we should encourage all drug usage as if it's by default a good thing. Becoming addicted to the right drugs (ones that are explicitly likely to cause dependency) can completely destroy someone's life. So, we should be careful to balance advocating against laws that harm nonviolent people with advocating against their destructive behaviors.\n\nI find prostitution, which in effect reduces sex to a business transaction, to be morally disgusting. So, it's simply not something that I can celebrate, just like how I can't celebrate someone who's addicted to heroin wrecking their body or losing their job.

            "This is not an unpopular opinion on Reddit.\n\nWhile decriminalizing sex work may be beneficial, normalizing it is not best for society. Most people don\u2019t want to live this lifestyle, they are driven to it by abuse, lack of opportunity and economic necessity.\n\nIt seems like normalizing sex work is giving people freedom to choose how to earn a living or use their bodies, but that\u2019s just how it seems to uninformed people.\n\nThe sad truth is sex trafficking, human trafficking, sexual and physical abuse are inextricably linked to sex work. Without the demand of Johns, these crimes would be far less frequent. \n\nIf you actually know any sex workers, instead of just talking about them on reddit, you will know they are at a high risk for violence and rape because they are part of this profession. Legalization may help reduce these issues, but just pretending that sex work is a regular career/industry is reductive and counterproductive.\n\nThe reason many people cringe when considering selling their bodies and engaging in a sex industry rife with rape and abuse is because it\u2019s fundamentally flawed, and many of the consumers have sexual dysfunction that is often commingled with violence, rape fantasies, and problematic control dynamics. Pretending that sex workers are mostly woke sex therapists or strong independent entrepreneurs is problematic...sex workers are often also minors, the poor, abuse victims, immigrants and many other vulnerable people groups who are doing what they think/do have to do to survive.",

            "Ethically speaking, any expenses incurred in the process of \"making it safe\" should be handled by the individuals or establishment participating.

I find it hard to believe that any person would choose to do sex work or that those who do choose it find it fulfilling and rewarding. You can look at career satisfaction rates among pornstars to see that most sex workers are depressed or suffering from other mental problems as a result of their profession. The people who actually do it will be the ones so down in their luck they\u2019ll be forced to.\n\n3. I disagree on a moral basis. It is my personal belief that paying for sex is wrong.",
            "Hate to be \"that\" person, but there's quiet a reason why it can't be that easily allowed.\n\nIf you make all sex work legal per se, human trafficking will skyrocket. Especially in places like Europe where you can cross the boarder without getting really checked, smuggling kidnapped people becomes incredible easy and would become even easier if you would just allow it.\n\nIn general, prostitution is very closley related to crime as pole dancing is to stripping.  \nNearly every prostiute -even the better ones- have experiences with violence and dangerous situations. Lots of young workers can dive into the drug scene & other scenes because it's so very close.\n\nOther voices also regularly talk about the lines that are blurred through easy access. I'm not wanting to dive in the whole topic, but one of the reasons why prostitues -especially minority prostitutes like f.ex. prostitutes that are trans - suffer so much violence is because the lines are often blurred.  \nA lot of people that pay for a prostitue often see them objects they bought. And while it's not exactly clear if the idea of \"(mostly)men being allowed to buy prostiutes makes them treat these & other sexual partner generally worse\" holds extremly much water, I know from personal experience that a person can definitley become delusional from such experiences.\n\nTo make it short:\n\nProstitution -as well as every other job in the sex& porn industry - is a double edged sword.\n\nOn one side, it has a lot of benefits. Many of which you named.  \nOn the other side it also a lot of downsites, including the ones I mentioned.\n\nThe best way to treat this issue is to neither demonise, nor to glorify prostiution as this \"curse from hell\" or \"happy, great empowerment of women &co.\"  \nI think we would need to flip the whole system upside down and build it up from the ground anew to make it work.

You can do it but you need certain permits, you\u2019re subject to scrutiny over it, you have a ton of restrictions depending on time and place and area etc etc.\n\nAn example of a decriminalized act is.... idfk wearing sunscreen I guess. You can just do it. \n\nThis may sound like I\u2019m pulling a \u201clmao guy made a word mistake point and laugh\u201d bit in the case of sex work the distinction  is not just merely importer tan enough to point out but a central point of conversation about the whole thing.\n\nMost sex workers favour decriminalization, because legalization comes with the fact that you are as an individual probably not going to be able to afford to be able to go through the beurocracy to get the necessary paperwork to do this, and while some people do sexwork because hey why not it\u2019s mostly a bid to avoid either poverty or the soul crushing jobs that keep you just above it, or (in the case of disabled but mentally cognisent folks) a way to make more than the pittance benefits would get them in a line of work that ends up being pretty disability friendly if you can find the right clients.\n\nSo legalization means having to find someone who can afford to get the proper permits and working for them, an asshole who has leverage over them, putting most sex workers right back where they started.\n\nSo yeah from the text you wrote it seems you are in favour of *decriminalization* not *legalization*.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more I highly recommend the video  [Sex Work | Philosophy Tube](https://youtu.be/1DZfUzxZ2VU) although be... idk warned?

            "**I support your point because of the following 10 reasons:**\n\n1. Is sex work is criminalized then these sex workers are pushed into the shady underworld and are exposed to extreme human rights abuse with no legal remedies.\n2. If sex work is legalized then the government can make laws for the safety of sex workers, open pension funds for them and can provide with subsidised regular testing and other medical assistance for them.\n3. I am no one to judge a sex worker or why he/she is doing. As far as an individual is okay with it and feels comfortable and is not doing any harm to me, I should let that individual enjoy their freedom.\n4. If I go by the victim doctrine, even then people are forced into being a sex worker due to economic failure. We are not in stone age. In today's world of written constitution, everyone should be supported by welfare means to have basic necessities of human life like food, shelter, medical facilities, internet (in today's world), right to work etc. If government fail to provide welfare protection to vulnerable people then the government has no right to control whatever ways these people are resorting to sustain, as long as these ways are not detrimental to national security or harming anyone.\n5. Sex transactions between consulting adults is not the area for the government to peep into and make laws. Its a private domain. \n6. Sex work is the age-old profession, need not go by medieval or victorian ethics. In interconnected world where global movement is so lucid, declaring something illegal pushes people to look for places with grey areas.\n7. Sex itself is a human natural act, the government can at the best facilitate it by making it safer in the commercial domain, but has no right to curtail it. It's a natural right, not a political right.\n8. On the contrary, when sex work is criminalised it enters into a grey area of drugs, smuggling and other immoral activities ranging from paedophilia to other pervert acts. By legalising it and bringing the NGO sector will make this profession safe.\n9. Many times even customers of this trade are cheated or have to go through abuse. If sex work is legalised then there will be ID cards or other parameters set for everyone and safety will be ensured. It will keep the corrupt moral police away from harassing people and abusing and misusing sex workers.\n10. Sex workers are as humans as anyone else. Right to do business which is **NOT** anti-national, adverse to national security, immoral (like zoophilia or paedophilia), harming the society (like mass killing or selling drugs) should be the right of every citizen. The only regulation on this profession should be regarding regular medical check-ups, maintaining customer records only for the purpose of contact tracing in case of contagious disease and not permitting advertisement of such services within a certain radius of schools, creches and other places of small kids and toddlers.",

So like I said I was with you ar one point and you get my upvote for an unpopular opinion. \n\nI just know that it's easy enough for those with power to make the illusion of choice, and then advertise that \"these people\" just choose to live this way. \n\nBut hey porn is legal, that's just prostitution with a camera and our society hasn't collapsed yet so maybe I'm making this bigger than it really is.",

People never do sex-work for fun (and no, the few exceptions  do not invalidate this fact). Prostitution should not be encouraged.",

            "I agree that in theory, the legalization of sex-work would help the industry become more transparent, and in *theory* improve the safety of sex-workers. But you also have to consider, that making sex-work legal means that any contracts formed between a sex-worker and a client are 100% enforceable.\n\nThink about this scenario: Jenny is a sex-worker at a brothel working her shift. A client comes in and pays to have sex with Jenny. Jenny agrees, but later when they get to her room, she changes her mind. The problem is, Jenny *can't* change her mind, because this man has already paid to have sex with her, and she has an professional obligation to have sex with him, even if she doesn't actually want to.\n\nSo my question is, if you legalize sex-work, how do you ensure consent? Sex without consent is rape, but if you are a legal employee being paid to do your job (sex), can it really be classified as rape?\n\nFor this reason -- and many others -- I think there's still a long way to go before we reach effective solution to sex-work. Legalization will completely blur the lines between sex-workers rights to withdraw consent, and it would likely also become a breeding ground for corruption and possibly human-trafficking.",

            "I would say expand this a step further.  It's hard to carry on a conversation with someone who has a one dimensional personality.  If your personality is built around one thing,  it's hard to relate to that person. It doesn't matter if it's your sexuality, only having one hobby, work, school, bad childhood, political views, religion, etc.  If that is ALL a person talks about, and they wedge it into every conversation, it's tedious to deal with.   Unless someone else shares your interest/enthusiasm in that one topic, it gets old talking to a one dimensional personality.\n\n\nPersonally, I struggle with this myself.  Most of my life revolves around running a small business.  My wife works with me/for me, and I spend the majority of my time there.  I have to keep reminding myself NOT to constantly bring it up in conversation.  Not everyone wants to talk business.\n\nFortunately I have a few other hobbies to fall back on during conversation - motorcycles, woodworking and computers/video games.",
            "Of course anyone that makes one single thing their entire identity is pretty annoying after a while. It's nice to talk about more than just one thing, and usually when your whole identity is built around one thing you get way too into it to the point of it being cringey, no matter what it is.\n\nHowever, there's a hell of a gap between keeping something entirely to yourself unless explicitly asked and having that one thing be your entire personality. It's perfectly fine to want to talk about dating or relationship stuff sometimes, and that's pretty much inevitably going to give away your sexuality. Hell, even just any normal show of affection with your partner in public would obviously give it away, too. \n\nSo yeah, people who talk about it all the time are annoying, but there's plenty of room for it to come up in conversation pretty innocuously without it being overbearing. Your post makes it sound like you think people should actively hide it and that's not cool.",

You constantly hear about straight sexuality. No one bats an eye when the newest action movie has the male lead kisses the female love interest at the end. Switch it to an homosexual relationship however and suddenly it's \"pointless pandering that brings nothing to the story\" and \"I don't care if they're gay but why focus on it, it's like being gay is their whole character!\"\n\nAs for the whole single personality trait (sexuality or otherwise), that's just something obvious and if it's your main point, doesn't belong in this sub as I doubt anyone would disagree that someone with a one dimensional personality is uninteresting.",
            "my main problem with this is I think OP is presenting two different opinions here. \n\nFor one of them, I agree. Your sexuality shouldn't be your entire personality. Nothing should be your entire personality. Your favorite TV show, your national pride, your sexuality, a genre of music, the baseball team you love, no ONE thing should be your personality. DO I think that in reality, most people who wear a main personality interest as a badge of honor have other interests and if someone took the time to interact with this person, they'd find them? Yes. \n\nExample: I've come to know plenty of very openly LGBTQ+ people while living in the West Hollywood area. While, at their surface, many of them just seem to be all about PRIDE. Rainbow clothing, pride instagram posts, etc. But once you take the time to meet one of these people and actually talk to them, you learn they aren't just pride, they are complex individuals just like the rest of us. They write sketch comedy, play in adult dodgeball leagues, play DnD, love spanish soap operas, love hiking/traveling/exploring.  These people are no different than the metal head in your life who wears different black band t-shirts every day. They are complex individuals who happen to have one aspect of their life (a much more important one than just what music they like if you ask me) that they like to make very apparent, because it IS important to them. \n\n\nWhich brings me to the second point OP is making. Sexuality should be kept to yourself. \n\nThe reason so many people do wear PRIDE as a personality trait is because like it or not, we still live in a world (and this applies to every country on Earth) where heterosexuality is the default and if you aren't the default, there are people who hate you. The entire point of PRIDE is to be proud of who you are in the face of a society that has members who can openly hate you and want you dead. \n\n\nSo OP I have a challenge for you. The next time you meet a LGBTQ+ person, who wears that pride outgoingly, make a point to ask them their interests. I'd bet a large sum of money the first interest they list isn't \"being gay\".",

            "My issue with this is i often see this as a justification to direct gay and lesbian people to not express affection in public, or as a justification to say \"why does this fictional character have to be gay?\" There are also examples where lgbt people make jokes where being one of those letters is a central premise of the joke. IE a joke I dropped recently is \"traps might be gay, but since I'm bi it's just the best of both worlds.\"\n\nSo long as you explicitly mean don't just drop the statement \"HEY I'M GAY\" with no supporting infrastructure or other utility, then I'm on board. BUT if you're using that as a justification to go against any of what i just gave examples of, that's kinda cringe chief.",

For some people though, these choices are a fundamental part of their identity and self image, especially if they\u2019ve had to fight to become the person they are now.

I got other things I'm thinking about \" Ain't nobody got time for dat.\" Too each their own, \"live long and prosper.\"",
            "I see posts like this so often on here, especially in this sub and I really wanna address some things for once.\n\n1. Your sexuality is not just your sexual orientation. Your sexual orientation is an aspect of your greater sexuality but it's the not the only aspect. If you are super in to sex or just not interested. If you feel sexy in this or that, or if you never feel sexy. These are all aspects of your sexuality and it extends past just who you like/ your sexual orientation. Please stop using the 2 interchangeably.\n\n2. This is not a queer issue. This is not queer specific and I don't even believe this is primarily occuring by queer people. I personally believe this comes down to exposure. \n\nIt is normalised so much in the world about hyper sexuality in heterosexuality. \"Sex sells\" is just a basic example of just how it's accepted that highly sexualised things are meant to be more engaging. The number of guys in my high school who would always, always talk about woman in frankly gross and highly sexual ways all the time. Even my parents can't go watching a show without pointing out either how someone is attractive, or making comments to me about how I find xyz person attractive.\n\nSex and sexuality as a personality trait is not just perpetuated by queer people, but you are so used to it in heterosexual spaces that you don't notice it as much compared to in the few queer spaces/moments.\n\n3. The fact that people always raise this comment in relation to queer identities is low level homophobia. Yes people mention that it happens with straight people too but you make a point about it in queer people. If it really was just about the point of personality itself being 1D, or about over sex based personalities, then why did YOU even have to mention queer people. You yourself could have left sexual orientation out of it but you didn't. You made a point of calling out queer people who sound like they are just out and proud of themselves. By making it about queer people so significantly, you show a level of discomfort with queer people being proud of themselves, regardless of your intention. \n\nStop calling queer people out for a universal problem. It's inherently homophobic and perpetuates the ongoing stereotypes of queer people revolving around hyper sexualisation!",
            "Straight people unprompted: \"were trying for a baby\"\n\nStraight people to 4 year old: \"wow, look at you looking at sally, is she your girlfriend?\"\n\nStraight people: \"Hey let's add a pointless romance to this movie.\"\n\nGay dude: \"I think i might like dudes.\"\n\nStraight people: \"OH MY GOD STOP TALKING ABOUT YOUR SEXUALITY OMG KEEP IT PRIVATE.\"",
            "I think you\u2019re confusing a personality tied to a culture with one tied to a sexuality. This is thinly veiled, almost blatant, homophobia. If you didn\u2019t care about people\u2019s sexuality you wouldn\u2019t have posted this.",
            "For me, it feels like I\u2019m drowning in a world in which I don\u2019t fit in. I\u2019ve had a long history of internalized homophobia to the point where I was calling myself gay slurs. I still have issues with it and am grappling to understand how homosexuality biologically works. I constantly feel like the world isn\u2019t meant for me. It\u2019s a very isolating experience. So, in a way, it\u2019s actually really comforting to openly reaffirm my sexuality, especially when I\u2019m forced into a box of heterosexuality. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t feel the urge to reference my gayness (though it isn\u2019t my entire personality) if people didn\u2019t perpetually assume my identity for me and make me feel like a misfit for not matching their judgments. There\u2019s also the issue of society being okay with gay people as long as they\u2019re just like straight people but with private personal relationships that happen to be homosexual. It actually changes a lot of gender and life dynamics when you are gay. When you aren\u2019t designed to reproduce or find solace in opposite-sex, gender-based relationships, your gender identity and expression face different challenges. Yes, annoying people are annoying and 1 dimensional people of any kind are toxic. No, I\u2019m not going to stop referencing my sexuality in a casual manner to reaffirm myself and build up my own confidence in my unavoidable identity that is constantly being erased by the ignorant.",

This movie brought me back to that, and what made me love theatre. I don't speak Spanish, but I've been doing Italian on duolingo for about two years, and honestly, it wasn't that bad. Whole scenes weren't really done in Spanish, it was usually just single sentences or short exchanges to my memory, and usually followed up with Anita chastising everyone to speak in English so they can practice. Context made it clear what was going on, even if I only vaguely understood what was actually being said. Even on Broadway in recent revivals, MUCH more of the show was left as untranslated Spanish.

It was used to represent their camaraderie as a Puerto Rican community, their relationships with each other, even their unwillingness/reluctance to assimilate into their new surroundings. \n\nWe can very easily pick up what they're saying by the tone of voice, the expressions of the actors, or the music being played. \n\nIf what they were saying drove the plot, yeah it would be irriating. But that's not what is happening here. I personally feel it added a lot to the movie and never felt like I was misunderstanding a scene.\n\nEtA: there really isn't an abundance of Spanish speaking.

As one of the few people who actually saw this on the opening day, I can tell you that all of the un-subtitled dialogue is explained seconds or minutes later by other English-speaking characters. While Spielbergs reasoning sounds a little like he\u2019s scared of being cancelled, I still think he only did it because he liked the sounds of Spanish dialogue and wanted people to listen instead of read, but as I said this isn\u2019t at all a problem for an audience member in what I think is one of the better films this past year."

You shouldn\u2019t be craving ~~a mind altering drug~~ weed(that you are not prescribed) right as you wake up. You shouldn\u2019t be that averse to sobriety. \n\nYou have a problem. Address it.\n\nEdit: I should have clarified that waking up on your day off or whatever is different and am focusing more so on the people who wake and bake before say... going to work, for example\u2014 the people who seemingly need weed just to live their basic everyday lives. \n\nEdit 2: I also don\u2019t hold the opinion that it\u2019s *ALWAYS* bad, but habitually doing it more than say, once, maybe twice a week, or staying high all day often, is most likely indicative of a deeper rooted problem.\n\nEdit 3: I smoke weed, about once a week, after I get off work. I still hold this opinion. Even daily smoking is likely indicative of a problem.\n\nEdit 4: To you guys comparing THC to caffeine, I really think that\u2019s an unfair comparison. I can\u2019t respond to all of you, so I\u2019m going to say it, here. CAFFEINE IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN THC. It is NOT a good comparison. Weed is notoriously used as an ESCAPE. Wake and Baking is often just escaping, thus why sobriety is mentioned. I understand the need to escape, but first thing in the morning? That is an issue.",

Cannabis treats my symptoms extremely effectively. I\u2019ve had issues with depression anxiety and apathy. Cannabis quite literally reduces those feelings to borderline zero. I\u2019ve been on traditional prescription medication for each one of those things I\u2019ve just mentioned and all of them have negative side effects that cannabis does not. \n\nEvery time I\u2019ve had to quit for a job, or because society made me feel bad for using cannabis to medicate, I am a miserable fuck. \n\nNow in my mid 30s, medicate responsibility under the guidance of med dispensary and I\u2019ll never go back. \n\nIt ain\u2019t for everybody\n\nEDITED: it does not CURE anything.

With that being said, I actually realized in my later 20's that quitting smoking weed was the best decision I ever made, while it helped me focus in school, I was failing to address the antisocial/ bad anxiety, & almost depressive\" feelings it was giving me. If you have a medical condition I'm 100% for you reaching for your weed first thing in the morning, even if it's just your day off from work, who cares if it doesn't affect you? I would warn everyone else to be careful with forming the \"wake and bake\" habit though, try spending your morning clear headed, I should have realized I didn't even need it in school!",

I was experiencing mental health issues big time, and being high masked it, never solved it. I haven\u2019t smoked in 45ish days, and I feel amazing. The major difference is REM sleep, and remembering my dreams which are insanely vivid and \u201centertaining\u201d. You shouldn\u2019t drink alcohol in the morning, and you shouldn\u2019t blaze before you\u2019ve accomplished something for the day.

I told myself it helped with my constant back pain (it did) but I recently stopped smoking for an up-coming drug test. The first couple days were mental hell, as everything I was subconsciously hiding from came rushing back. Turns out I was smoking to hide from the pain of my childhood. Not saying this is the case for everyone, but if you are constantly high (even if you get sober for work like I did) taking a break for a week could really open your eyes to things.",

            "I generally regret a lot of the years I smoked too much weed because it delayed certain things that I should have been doing.\n\nThe long and short of it is weed doesn't so much make you lazy as it makes you complacent - okay with how things are. Which is a form of long-term self sabotage for most.",
            "Dr K has a lot of great videos about addiction on youtube(hes a twitch streamer). I think it is clear weed can be addictive, like anything else. The distinction is things like tobacco, alcohol and other narcotics are all both physically and mentally addictive but weed can be just as mentally addictive if not worse than the others. The false belief you can't get addicted to weed can make it harder to acknowledge the addiction.",

OP chastised commenters for providing their personal anecdotal evidence, and yet OP's entire basis for this post boils down to a sweeping generalized presumption supported by nothing: \"Like, come on, guys... I'm pretty sure this is bad for everyone, just because, probably.\"\n\nIn reality, of course, many wake and bake strictly because it enhances productivity. I used to be anti-weed before I got to (an incredibly high-ranked and competitive) college. There, I discovered that nearly all of the highest, most productive performers (people who had more intelligent, nuanced perspectives and were recognized for their achievements) smoked copious amounts of weed. The narrative about it instilling laziness was just on its face, demonstrably a false notion.\n\nThanks, OP, for reminding me of my former, ignorant self; it's a helpful reminder about humility.",

I definitely plan on getting a medical license once I can. \nOf course if I smoke too much in the morning I end up completely off my ass and unable to work, and if I smoke every day I get sluggish.

I didn't get high when I smoked because my tolerance was so high, but it was literally the only thing that helped my PTSD, and anxiety. It was never about getting fucked up, it was about having a little relief. \n\nI haven't smoked in years, I quit because my boyfriend does not like it, and it was a stressor for us and honestly I chose my relationship over pot. I would be lying if I said I didn't miss it occasionally, mostly miss the relief it gave me from grief and trauma.",

Now it's very very moderate (a few times a week, at night after work/responsibilities etc). People who do this regularly, like I used to, just to be high all the time. That's not a healthy mindset no matter what anyone says.\n\nLike you said, the caffein comparison doesn't work. I can drink too much coffee and drive to work, be very productive, watch my kid, communicate with lots of different kinds of people, make quick decisions. Not the case with weed.",

While it may not be chemically addictive in the way things like alcohol, nicotine, or opiates are, people become dependent on it. They are self medicating for something. Usually anxiety or depression.\n\nEdit - I'm saying long term, habitual, chronic, unprescribed, unchecked over-use of marijuana is unhealthy. The stupid trash that has begun to reply here is proof of this. Can marijuana be helpful in some medical conditions? Yes. Should it be legalized? Yes. Do some people use it irresponsibly? Yes.",

It\u2019s not like being a drug addict that *needs* to have a hit of heroin to stave off sickness, I would describe it more as a habit. For some people it\u2019s like having a cup of coffee, that little heart starter to begin the day with.  If you can\u2019t function properly without that first toke of the day then it\u2019s an issue but I think if you can function and aren\u2019t doing something like driving or anything that requires fine motor skills then you\u2019re not harming anyone at all.",

            "MASSIVE RDR1/2 Spoilers\n\n>!I think it's honestly good that Arthur died how he did if you get the high honor ending. It is very sad but he did try to atone for his sins if you do the questline with the nun and monk then he actually feels inner peace about dying and is 100% resolute about sacrificing himself for John's future. Another reason relates to a famous quote: \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" Arthur chose to die because he did bad things and he knows he will do more bad things, and he wanted to go out on a high note. However, John Marston doesn't deserve to die, he did things right and was set on the path to being a righteous man and Edgar betraying him was unnecessary but would be pretty fitting for his character backstory, he would want revenge on the full gang that killed his mentor. All in all, Arthur died on his terms, John died on another man's terms which is actually pretty fitting considering both of their stories. John Marston has a lot of themes of the power and control government has over everything, made especially clear by Mr. Macfarlanes lines when you first meet him. Arthur's story is about living free, made clear in the terms of someone saying something about surviving versus living, and while that line mighta come form somewhere else, it's pretty fitting considering some of Micah's lines in the final battle being \"I'm a survivor, black lung\" so him dying on his own terms is pretty fitting for him and his story.!<",

For beginners, I recommend the Cash App for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Once you buy Bitcoin, withdraw it to a non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your Bitcoin. Don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. \n\nNot your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it.\n \nI recommend using [Mycelium Bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) for Android.\n\nMake sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. \n\nNever sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work.\n\n[Purse.io](https://Purse.io) - Buy anything from Amazon using Bitcoin and name your own discount from 5-30%.\n\n[List of stores that accept Bitcoin](https://www.acceptedhere.io/)\n\nWhen spending or transferring your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (The fee goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). \n\nCheck https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your transaction fee. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. Some wallets don't offer this option. Don't use those wallets. \n\n[Bitcoin deep dive](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html)\n\n[Read Inventing Bitcoin](https://1lib.us/dl/5328494/9e51d1)\n\nPlus there's a second layer called the [Bitcoin Lightning Network.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network#:~:text=The%20Lightning%20Network%20is%20a,to%20the%20bitcoin%20scalability%20problem)\nNearly free and instant transfers based on Bitcoin.\n\n[Phoenix wallet is the best Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.phoenix.mainnet)\n\nAnd finally, a warning from Jameson Lopp. \"Every bitcoin that is held by an institution is a bitcoin that has had its security weakened by being subjected to bureaucratic and political decision-making. \u201cNot your keys, not your bitcoin\u201d rings true because when you have to ask someone for permission to transact, you are no longer in a position to resist censorship. Bitcoin owners must not trust third parties to act in their best interest!\"\n\nHold your own Bitcoin. Don't let anyone trick you into giving them your Bitcoin. All of those schemes are Ponzi schemes. Nobody is going to give you interest on your Bitcoin, and if they do, they're paying you in a worthless, flawed token. Or they are doing accounting shenanigans that Bitcoin already solved. They will all collapse, and people with think they lost their Bitcoin, when in reality the Bitcoin was lost as soon as you deposited it into the Ponzi scheme. \n\nNot your keys, not your coins.",

Since people are getting an increasing amount of extremely biased information that reinforces their beliefs fewer and fewer of us can have a conversation involving shared facts. To make matters worse, as people bring up unfamiliar facts people are likely to misinterpret them because they are experiencing cognitive dissonance.",

School is supposed to help kids learn and grow into functioning humans, not into high-stress, high-anxiety testing robots who don\u2019t know how to critically think and solve problems. Students, as much as schools want to claim, are not valued as people. They are only valued if they perform well on assessments. It\u2019s such a shame. These students then graduate and join society, having no idea about what the world is really like, no idea how to solve problems when things get hard, and get blamed for being useless, lazy, and stupid. It makes me sad, and I can only hope that this country will someday go back to remembering what\u2019s truly important in an educational system.",

For a long time a lot of that was based upon religion. It gave them organization and direction and a certain unity. Sometimes for good and some for bad but fundamentally it was a unifying thing. \n\nWe've gone away from that as a society and I get the sense that people are floundering. Religion has been replaced in some cases by other groups and even social media and the internet in general but it's not as unifying. I'm not religious and a wedding was probably the last time I was in a church but I can see how people might need the direction.",

If you asked a lot of people if they would rather maturally excel in sciences or philosophy than they usually think of what will give them better material success in the future. Dont get me wrong it's not too bad of a mindset to try and seek success through natural sciences rather than social sciences and philosophy but they it seems the system teaches them to undervalue a subject like philosophy cause it doesnt lead directly to those fat green stacks. They also overestimate how developed or how much they know about social political issues and its regarded as more \"just common sense\".

It is all testing, very VERY few real life skills, there is tons of filler that is really not relevant in today society, and some subjects are taught and re-taught 3 or 4 times. Yes, even college is trash. The first year and a half of college was ALL just crap I had learned in high school. History, English, Government, wasting my time. Many of the classes after that are taught from systems such as Pearson, McGraw Hill, etc. and they are all computerized. So far I have done great in college grade wise, but as far as what I have actually learned, I have learned more outside of college than I have inside.\n\nWe are all living in a society in which there are so many things out of our control. So many things that feel arbitrary, based on rules that are not logical, and make things harder than they should be. This might be part of what causes the protests and riots.",

            "to add an unpopular opinion to your unpopular opinion, you left churches off of your \"propaganda of groups\" list.\n\nI can't recall what 101 class in college it was (I want to say philosophy, or public speaking. probably both!) but we learned about rhetoric and critical thought. it was a class in the core curriculum. think the problem is (like alot of freshmen requirement classes) is that you take the class, usually in a giant lecture hall, absorb just enough to pass the class, then move on to what you came to major in.\n\nbut regardless, you're mostly right. educated or not, left wing or right, there is a paucity of critical thought, and a surplus of confirmation bias. the social media age has only ramped this up. it takes alot more effort to ask yourself \"why/how do I believe what I believe?\" than it is to turn on your favorite commentators and parrot what they say.",
            "I think your reasoning is actually the result and not the cause.\n\nThe cause is the continued drumb beat that we are all oppressed and victims of one group or another.  This creates outrage and anger.  Anger pushes all other logical capacities to the side unless the person is taught how to deal with anger.\n\nWhy else would an entire country be in an uproar about the death of a man where everyone agrees that the Cops were wrong, and the cops have been arrested?  Literally every person in power that has anything to do with the George Floyd murder agrees.\n\nThese cops need to be held accountable.\n\nYet we have the protests where people are screaming it's not enough.\n\nAnger is logical.  It is the most powerful emotion available to us and the most difficult to overcome with reasoned discourse.  Critical thinking takes discipline and self sacrifice.  Our society doesn't do either very well.",

This makes it seem like most people don\u2019t critically think. There\u2019s a lot of people in America who know the news can\u2019t be taken at face value. \n\nIn high school, my government teacher tasked us to pull an article of a current event from multiple sources (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, NPR, etc) and compare the differences. That really opened my eyes to how different stories were being told about the same event and you cannot take anything at face value. If I read the articles without context, i could easily believe I was reading about different things. \n\nI took a few philosophy courses in college as my electives which got me thinking about the world and purpose of life differently. I learned critical thinking from other courses as well. \n\nHowever the only direct lesson in relation to the media was taught to me in high school. \n\nWhen I hear some people speak about what\u2019s going on I can usually tell which news station they watch. Many are unwilling to hear a differing opinion, it\u2019s insane. I don\u2019t even bother discussing current events with people because it\u2019s what this one news outlet said or it\u2019s false.

No wonder we're having this conversation again in an election year. \n\nDid you know in 2019 more unarmed black men were killed by black and hispanic cops than white cops? Did you know that unarmed white men were killed at twice the rate as unarmed black men in 2019? Do you know that black men commit 53% of all homicide in the united states despite being 13% of the population? \n\nTHIS IS A STRAW MAN AND A RED HERRING TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING, and you people keep falling for it time and time and time again. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. How many times have you been fooled now? And you keep eating it up because you 1. either have something to gain, 2. have guilt (for what reason, that's something only you can know), or 3. are scared to speak out because of cancel culture and how radical people are. Fuck that. \n\nI know what's in my heart, I know who I am, I know the actions I've carried out and how I've treated PEOPLE my entire life, and I won't be guilted, shamed, or bullied into buying some bullshit narrative. Statistics are racist now. Facts are racist. Pointing out problems in the black community are racist. \n\nIt's a deeper dialogue that required far more context, nuance, and understanding than \"cops bad, they hunt black people int he streets\". Get the fuck outta here with that. The biggest con of the last 20 years and the biggest lie that is being used a political agenda to get your votes, fuel division, pit people against one another, and ultimately keep eyeballs on the screen for $$$$. And you guys eat it up. VOTES - REPUBLICANS BAD. COPS BAD. THEY HATE BLACK PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO KEEP YOU OPPRESSED. The BIGGEST LIE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. \n\n\nThe topic that needs to be discussed is WHY IS THERE SO MUCH CRIME IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND HOW CAN WE ADDRESS IT? What measures can be taken to help stop that: education, money into black businesses, a culture change, the black community ceasing glorification of criminals. I don't have the answer. \n\nYou know what the saddest part of all this is, too? Lebron James with however many tens of millions of followers on his social media is putting out \"Black people are being hutned like dogs in the streets, why do yall keep doing this to us\", and there are millions of little kids out there who - given no other reason - are terrified now. They now have an idea filled in their minds that no matter how hard they work, how hard they perservere, how determined they are... they won't be able to succeed because of systemic racism and the country turned against them. And so they don't. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Barack Obama, the president of the United States, perpetuated this narrative....the most powerful and beloved man in the coutnry, in the world. Shame on you, Lebron. Shame on you. It's SAD, MAN. \n\nI work with black business owners. Wealthy, articulate, hard working, educated, successful men and women. They are all republicans. They didn't buy into the narrative the world was against them, they worked hard, they fought through their tough upbringings, and they EXCELLED. Millionaires. They despise the narrative because it's they believe it's so detrimental to the black community. They refused to accept that narrative, and so it never stopped them, and neither did the system or the white man. \n\nI pulled up the FBI's bureau of crime statstics for some of my white friends, and showed them the numbers. Wow! How they spun basic facts. \"Those aren't indicative of what's going on because black people representing 50% of crime in america is because little susie wouldn't get pulled over and arrested for the same weed foffense as jerome\" (by the way, i absolutely despise the war on drugs. It's despicable. Greedy fucking politicans waiting to get their pay off, or lobbyism from big pharma still putting money into their pocket. Republican politicians in this instance - fuck 'em) Great, let's scrap the crime and use strictly homicide. \"Well there's more violence in black communities because they're over policed\". So ya'll think that there is more murder in black communities because police officers are there, or police officers are there because there's more murders int he black communities? People don't want to appear racist, so they ignore facts. This WON'T STOP WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE ACTUAL PROBLEM THAT PERSISTS. Until we address the real issue, nothing will change. I asked my friend then, ok - I completely agree that police need to have better de-escalation procedures and that every police officer should have a body cam recording during every interaction, and there should be a 3rd party panel that investigates any violent interaction and decides if that officer acted accordingly, no doubt. But what happens in 2025 when the rates drop for police related deaths of black citizens, but the homicide rate has remained extraordinarily high or more than likely will increase? Do black lives still matter then? Or do only blacklivesmatter when there's a political agenda to push, and you all just keep eating it up. \n\nI am sad for the black community that this is the best this country can do to try and address the real issues.",

            "At risk of sounding like an edgelord: why would the government teach critical thought in school? If they did that--if people learned to think for themselves--people wouldn't blindly trust in the state, and most reasonable men and women would condemn it on some level. When it comes to ethics and philosophy, the goal of K-12 is to indoctrinate children and teens into \"good\" servants of the state, not to create responsible, ethical adults.

            "When I was in eighth grade I was selected for a program that taught us how to think critically. At the time I had no idea what that meant and thought the work was pointless and ridiculous, mostly visual exercises that could be difficult but were mostly very simple. The teacher (who I hated, had no idea why she was chosen to teach that course) encouraged people to question and look at things from a different perspective. The problem was what she was saying didn't make sense with the written exercises and I felt like it was a waste of time.\n\nMany years later I looked back on that course and I understood what they were trying to do but they went about it all wrong. I know it was the first step in integrating critical thought into schools and I hope they used what they learned from our class to improve, but other than a couple high school teachers, most classes just teach you to stay in place and do as you're told.\n\nI should also add that since the teacher wanted everyone to question things, the class pushed her on that. We probably cut up more than we should have and I remember I got in trouble because I wanted to do my work sitting on the floor (cringe now that I think about it but it was my thirteen yo way to question authority). It was also only offered to the top students, which is also probably why she let a lot of things slide.\n\nI finished at a high school that was fantastic academically but employed a lot of teachers with weird backgrounds. A few of them were first gen hippies, one guy hitchhiked across the country- that sort of shit, and they encouraged us to question a lot but I know most schools are not like that. My first high school wanted to churn out non questioning middle managers and it drove me fucking crazy.",

People crap on philosophy majors but I learned to write clearly and concisely as well as have sharp rational and tactful discourse. \n\n9 years later (now), I'm back in school getting a graduate degree in education. I was worried that being out of school so long I'd be struggling academically. However, the vast majority of my colleagues don't even try to analyze what we read, they just accept everything as 100% fact, and class discussions are literally groupthink where no one is learning because they're either not thinking critically about the topic or they're too scared to speak out I fear they'll be judged. Getting them to speak up for themselves is like pulling teeth. For group projects I have to proofread their work, make sure their research is accurate as well as citations, etc. This is in an EDUCATION program.\n\nHigher education is in a really bad place right now, not just K-12. They're too concerned about graduation rates and making sure not to offend anyone. I also work on campus leading workshops and my supervisor told me I shouldn't cold call students as it makes them feel uncomfortable. So f***** what?! They need to feel uncomfortable! This is how people overcome obstacles and develop. But education now isn't about that in most schools. Challenge a student in a way they don't like, they can complain and get you fired ultimately.

            "I hear what you're saying but it's a little unfair to completely ban public smoking. In the case of queues I absolutely agree with you. You have no choice but to stand in close proximity. Irresponsible smokers are the problem, tossing butts where they please and not respecting others personal space. I have smoked for many years, it is no longer a habit I enjoy but I shouldn't be denied the freedom to smoke in public so long as it is responsibly.",

        "selftext": "Like i think the whole getting drunk culture is dumb anyway, so i don\u2019t get drunk when i go out. It\u2019s a little sloppy and I\u2019m not like looking to \u201cparty\u201d like that. I stop at maybe 2-3 drinks and I\u2019m good. I don\u2019t like putting alcohol in my body cuz of guilt too. However, socially EVERY outing involves drinking. Pool? Drink. Rooftop? Drink. Picnic? Champagne. Bar? Of course drink. \n\nLike I get slightly hungry after 11pm too, men should hit on women by sending them over something off the appetizer menu or a dessert plate instead. We\u2019re out all night, liquid alcohol isn\u2019t going to keep me standing. We need carbs. Thanks. I\u2019m also wanting to hilariously point out that for those messaging me as a gold digger for wanting an alternative to alcohol, honey.. you have NO gold. (Imagine me making a post about a serious purchase like.. um a car or house). \n\nEdit: A lot of men here have probably never been in a social situation where they wanted to befriend an attractive girl at a bar and bought her a drink or two (generously offered) before. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have your panties in a bunch over * *gasp* *such expensive appetizers :/ I feel bad for the ladies in your city who have to be subjected to such ridiculous behavior. If you have a problem with treating someone, say it. (Like, really way to announce you\u2019re a man that has nothing to spare cuz women are SO expensive right?! What about being able to provide for a family? Lmao). Don\u2019t ridicule the social norm. Lol\n\nBut all in all, thanks for some enthusiastic comments about treating a girl to some bar food if she doesn\u2019t like drinking. It\u2019s definitely a good starter and you can spend a bit more time with her. It\u2019s also a tad harder to run away with a plate of wings.\n\nEdit 2: Also to go deeper because ya\u2019ll reallyyyy wanna go there. Even as far as to go and call women prostitutes for asking for appetizers instead. LOL. Some have pointed out that alcohol is preferred and that \u201cbeggars shouldn\u2019t be choosers and just be grateful a drink was bought for you\u201d because a guy has the advantage when a girl is drunk. So if you care if she\u2019s a bit hungry or not, it doesn\u2019t benefit the men trying to get laid that night. Because buying a complimentary drink is to not be nice. In fact food slows down how fast a girl can get drunk. So that\u2019s why ya\u2019ll are mad when women want the food alternative to alcohol. Alcohol is to inebriate women, wings don\u2019t. It all makes sense now. Thanks",

Calling on students who only raise their hand provides minimal feedback on how well your lesson was understood.\n\nAs to your critisizim, the statement \"Teachers who cold call students who are shy with the intent to socialize them are truly the worst\" is a refinement I can get behind. I have plenty of shy students, they know I will call on them. I often give them a non-verbal heads up, let them know I intend on calling on them that day, or talk to them quietly in person if they look off that day. Checking for understanding is crucial, but not at the cost of comfort in the classroom.\n\nI have had students who have a difficult time talking even if they do want to participate. I give them time to formulate their thoughts and help them to craft and refine them. No student should be immune from a Cold Call, but all of them should know it's not a punishment or that I am trying to change them. I need them to know that I need to understand how well I taught my lesson.\n\nAnd just because I think it's relevant. I am a maths teacher. So it's not just an liberal arts thing.",

Whenever I get evaluated by admin, one of them crawls down my ass about \"not engaging disinterested students.\" All because I call on kids who raise their hand (or more often have an open discussion without me dictating who talks). I get told to surprise kids with their hands down to \"engage\" them. And in my head, I'm always like, \"fuck that. If the student wanted to answer they'd offer an answer.\" I refuse to put y'all on the spot like that, because I know it's not welcome and not helpful.\n\nNow that said, there's a big difference between a kid who just doesn't know/doesn't want to answer something and a kid who is truly checked out of the class. I can tell the difference. I won't force either kid to speak out, that's not something I do, but I may ask someone who I know is engaged but quiet if they have something to say. Maybe the student is just shy and is waiting for a safe space to talk. If they decline, I respect it. I usually do this in smaller group settings so they won't have to talk in front of the whole class, cause that's often part of the issue.\n\nYour opinion may not be as unpopular as you think, mate. A lot of teachers think past the often outdated pedagogies we're taught for the sake of the students. Either way, I agree with you fully.",

She\u2019s great at science, history, and math concepts but she had two language arts teachers who insisted on calling on her to spell words aloud or to write sentences on the board in front of the class so the teachers could correct her and make her feel stupid in front of 17 other children. Multiple conferences and involving the principal finally addressed this problem yet I devoted two years to this issue. These teachers clearly delighted in embarrassing my daughter despite knowing of her dyslexia. They weren\u2019t there to support her; they used her as an example of a student who just didn\u2019t try hard enough despite the fact she tried her very best and saw specialists three days a week outside of school.

I have to give and grade a ton of paperwork to get that information if students aren\u2019t willing to show through class discussion or participation that they are getting it.  I also can\u2019t just take your word for it.  I have to have evidence that shows understanding.  We don\u2019t force kids to participate in order to have them socialize, although that is an added benefit.  We do it as a form of formative assessment.",

Sometimes people let their minds wander \u2014 it happens to the best of us \u2014 and, even when the student is paying attention, they might not have a good answer or be ready to answer.\n\nIf you want all your students to participate, it\u2019s much better to ask them to speak on a certain topic in advance of the class. If you let them know that they\u2019ll be expected to talk a bit about X, they\u2019ll come prepared with a better answer anyway. For instance, in my smaller classes, I would ask each student to talk a bit about the reading before we started the class.

I've also always been highly introverted. If I appear to have my mind elsewhere and look bored, I truly can't help it. I'm not trying to be rude and it's NOT that I don't want to participate. Participation when there's too much stimulation going on is often too overwhelming and I shut down. My 5th grade teacher tried this on me all the time and gave up on me by teling me that I was stupid to my face and by saying things like \"I just can't figure out what's wrong with you,\" and \"get out of my classroom, I don't want you in here.\" I ended up getting in trouble for wandering around outside each time I got kicked out. I'm soon to be 29 and I'm still paranoid about displeasing those in authority and I suffer from a toxic level of perfectionism. I feel like nothing I do will ever earn me any recognition.

We should use tactics and methods so that every student has to talk during one lesson. That didn't sit right with me. I said it doesn't make sense to force an answer out of a person who doesn't feel comfortable to speak in front of the whole class. The course laughed at me.\n\nIn my opinion, if you have to call on kids randomly because no student has their hand raised, your questions and you as a teacher SUCK.\nIt means your students are either intimidated by your presence, or your questions are too hard, your teaching isn't motivating enough, your students are bored, the list goes on.

I was terrified.\n\nI talked to my parents and they talked to my teacher, but he said that the activity was important and my parents didn't insist. He knew is was difficult to me so he allowed me to sing with a classmate and my friend choose the worst possible song ever ([La Chona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULxcmMgsxf4)).\n\nI can not explain how embarrassed I was.

            "I am a teacher and let me weigh in on this.\n\nThe typical view among teachers is they use this as a form of formative assessment to check for students\u2019 understanding. There are many reasons why a student keeps quiet. Likewise, there are also many ways to check for a student\u2019s understanding. Also, some teachers are of the view that the quiet student may have mentally drifted elsewhere. Also, when teachers are observed during lesson observations they may get feedback from observer if they do not \u2018check the understanding\u2019 of the quiet students. Worse till, allowing the vocal students to answer is frowned upon as it is seen as letting them dominate airtime and causing the less vocal ones to be afraid of speaking up.\n\nHowever, i am of an entirely different view. I am the atypical student turned teacher. I hated being picked to answer. I answer when I want to. It\u2019s extremely embarrassing and nerve wrecking when you sit in a class of 40 having 80 eye balls on you waiting for your answer.\n\nTo compound the problem, some asian classrooms arent that safe for a student to answer questions. The hostility you meet with when you give a \u2018stupid\u2019 answer can be from the teacher or peers. It\u2019s an extremely stressful experience being called upon. One wishes to melt into the chair and not be seen.\n\nAlso, as a student i really do daydream because i am simply not an auditory learner. All i need is good notes and i\u2019ll go home and study them. I also need time to process information so don\u2019t expect me to listen to Pythagoras\u2019 Theorem and be able to find you the hypotenuse like 1 minute after you introduce it. \n\nLikewise, I don\u2019t expect the same of my students. But sadly the general fraternity seems to think this is the only way to check for understanding. Personally i prefer to go to students of concern individually to look at their work. Takes more effort than pointing at them to answer questions. But i feel it is less intimidating.",

That made my anxiety go through the damn roof. Every kid in that class was staring at me and making comments at me and I never felt so embarrassed. The teacher even started to grade homework and go on the computer while she waited for me to give the answer. The girl next to me tried to help me and tell me what the answer was and the teacher yelled at her and told her not to help me. I felt my face get so damn red and my ears were ringing.

The gist of it was that by cold-calling kids, the teachers let the kids know they are expected to be active participants in their own learning and it is to their benefit.

Also, once she said I never raised my hand to ask questions and that I should do so. Well, if I had questions, I would not dare to ask them because then she would get annoyed because \"I already explained it\" but most of all: I did not ask questions because I did not have any questions.

            "Don't know how it works elsewhere, but in the UK teachers are taught a technique called 'Assessment for Learning', AfL for short. \nPart of this technique is getting students to answer questions during the class. It isn't to pick on them, or make them socialise, it is to provide the teacher with a quick assessment of understanding in the room. We also use things like whiteboards to have the entire class display work at once, so the teacher can check for the correct answers quickly. \n\nMy school takes this further- 'hands up' are banned unless it is to get our attention. If I ask a question, students expect that it is either rhetorical, or that I'm about to pick someone. \n\nIts perfectly okay if the person I choose doesn't know, that just tells me I need to support that person to continue learning.",

They would still try to get me in trouble for that.\n\nI guess I just never...did the whole hand raising thing. I understood it, as I do now, a method to teach kids that everyone gets a chance to speak and you can't just be the loudest. \n\nThe problem is that lesson is lost on shit teachers. They use the whole hand raising policy as a way to throw their weight around. Only the people they deemed worthy would get to speak, or only the people that didn't want to would be forced to."

        "selftext": "Using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't I? If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.\n\n1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)\n2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)\n3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.\n\n* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \\- 26 deaths\n* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \\- 29 deaths\n* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \\- 33 deaths\n* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \\- 41 deaths\n* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled \"*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*\" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))\n\n>That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed\u00a0by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly\u00a01 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child\u00a0being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. There is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",

            "Also doctors kill 200,000 patients a year due to malpractice. I think this number is to high and we should really discusse and evaluate the reasons for these people dying and if there is a feasible way to prevent it. ",

            "Thank you so much for actually posting an unpopular opinion. \n\nSo much better than \"I think child molesters should be put in prison\" \n\nOr \"people who drive drunk shouldn't be allowed to drive anymore\" \n\nJust paraphrasing on those two, but you get the point. \n\nI like what you're doing here, and you're totally right. \n\nEdit: \n\nWhen a school/mass shooting happens the media goes fucking apeshit, politicians push for reforms, the pictures of victims plastered everywhere, we all know how it goes. A bunch of white children murdered in a school or a bunch of concert goers. They are normal people who are distanced from true violence, therefore it is so surprising that they would be killed going about their lives. I get it! I draw the line when the fear mongering starts, about how white men are dangerous and such. People end up protesting in the streets over this stuff, and I get that too...\n\nBut at that same time, over a period of just a couple of days, there are even more black people killed by other black people in Chicago and other dangerous urban areas. What gets me riled is that I see no one in the streets of Chicago neighborhoods protesting the gang violence that is claiming the lives of countless young black males and innocent bystanders. No one is standing up and saying \"fuck this, we don't need to live this way, we need to change, how do we do it?\" \n\nBut that all changes when a police officer shoots a black person. They go up in fucking arms over it, talking about all this persecution they face and all that, which is totally true in alot of cases and I am sympathetic to those who have faced racism at the hands of police. However, in alot of these cases, the officers even had a perfectly good reason to shoot. Ive seen countless bodycam videos of police shootings, where the suspect clearly had a gun, and even shot at the officer and received the response you would expect from an officer fearing for his life. Before long, people storm out of their houses into the streets, crowding around the scene saying he \"didn't do nothing.\" Even if their is clearly a gun laying next to his body. So where am I going with this? \n\nWhen someone in these neighborhoods shoots someone else, no one crowds around the scene demanding justice, saying he didn't have to shoot. No one burns cars and vandalizes businesses over this. I hate rioters, but if there was ever a good reason for a riot, it would be black on black violence in impoverished neighborhoods. \n\nThe politicians and media turn a blind eye to the ongoing wars in our inner cities, fueled by trivial social media beef and drug dealing territory. \n\nIn my opinion, politicians and media do nothing to change this, they hardly even mention it. the media won't make much money off of the coverage of a shooting in Chicago because it happens all the time, it's not surprising;just black people doing black people things right? They only want low hanging fruit, the stuff that makes their virtue signaling worthwhile. The politicians, (especially the left) don't like to address it because it's such a slap in the face for gun control, it's proof in many cases that gun control legislation does not stop gun violence with the current standards in place. \n\nThey all just want to scratch the surface, they virtue signal by being outraged about Jussie Smollett, because it's easy, It's all laid out, a perfect way to stoke the flame and further their agendas, (forget the hoax part, just an example). What they don't want, is to confront the issue that is tearing the black community apart, it would take too much responsibility and admitting they were wrong. \n\n(By they, I am talking about the media and politicians, as well as many who have platforms that reach many people.) \n\nSome of this maybe came off as sounding almost racist, I'm just being blunt about the issue. Truthfully, I only wrote this novel because this issue breaks my fucking heart, it is such a tragedy. So many people who claim liberal are really just well off white people who want to feel righteous and care about civil rights, so tweet about how outraged they are over gun control or police shootings, or the wall, but they could care less about the black people and other minorities who are caught in a loop of constant warfare, because it would require hard WORK to help them. \n\nMy final statement/tldr: am a white man, I care about people dying no matter who they are. I think politicans and media dont care about the true problems that the black community faces, as well as many members of the black community. Gang violence is claiming the lives of young black men and women every single day in America, no one is in the streets protesting that or calling for help in Washington. But when a white kid who had a future dies at school, all hell breaks loose. I think that the media and political system IS racist, they are just quiet about it, and it makes me pretty sad. I wanna do something...sorry for the tangent, I don't remember my original mental outline for this, I just got carried away! Lol. \n\n\nEdit2: thanks for the gold and silver, I never thought anyone would value one of my poorly outlined tangents. It means alot (: ",

            "I'm going to play devil's advocate and say, this issue hits closer to home for many people. Proportionally, it may not kill as many people per year as other instances, but the situation is a far more emotional one for those affected. I mean, you have kids being murdered in school; a place where they assume they're safe. It's not just a numbers thing, being mowed down in a place of learning is a horrible tragedy. And one that seems easily preventable but is obviously wildly complicated.\n\nI don't think it shouldn't matter to any of us just because the number of deaths may be low. I do agree that the media sensationalizes everything, they want good news and blow it out of proportion. Car crashes are one of the leading causes of death in the modern day, but somehow I don't feel as bad hearing someone died in a car accident than a child shot up in a school. ",

It can have lasting impacts on how a nation grows and changes from generation to generation.\n\nDiabetes, Cancer, car accidents, falls, these things happen and cant be avoided.

Yet no one talks about guns when it comes to suicide either. \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started with the big metal boxes of death destruction (I.e. cars). There are more car related deaths than almost any other death besides health related deaths.

Look at liberal calls to ban \"assault weapons.\" A minuscule fraction of gun violence comes from assault weapons. Handguns are the most common. You know why? 66% of gun deaths are suicide. Then after that, the next largest portion is gang violence. Gangbangers generally aren't pulling drive by's with an AR15. Even in mass shootings, it's not like it's only \"assault weapons\" that are used. For a long time (before Orland and Las Vegas), the Virginia Tech shooting was the deadliest in American history.

From a quick google search: From 2009 to 2018 there was roughly 288 shootings. In 2018 there were at least 307. That shows an escalating problem, and by an exponential amount.\n\n[How many mass shootings in America this year 2018](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-mass-shootings-in-america-this-year-2018-2)\n\n[The number of school shootings vs other major nations since 2009](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-number-of-school-shootings-in-the-us-vs-other-major-nations-since-2009-is-staggering-9164763)\n\nAs for the human element keep in mind we are not talking about young adults, but elementary to high school. Of which a large portion of this age group would not be able to effectively defend themselves or be properly and mentally equipped to survive such an attack. So measures of safety would need to increased, which is supported by the apparent rise in rate of attacks.\n\nGiven all of that I am not sure what your opinion is beyond that we shouldn't care. Is it that the number is insignificant? Also I would point out that since the targets are being picked, especially elementary schools, for the shock and pain as well as densely populated areas with no means to resist...that effectively means children are being targeted by terrorists, that feels like it should be addressed no matter the frequency.",
            "I totally understand that from an objective point of view your opinion makes sense. However I would have to say that personally I disagree. Probably because when it comes to children we are all a little bit bias.\n\nI think the reason I care so much about school shootings is because someone accidentally killing themselves in the bath isn't a reflection of the shit that so many people (especially children) have to put up with in their lives. I believe a big part of why so many people are affected by this is that it's robbing a child of their innocence which I think is the best part of so many people's lives.",

Far more people died in 2001 from car crashes, medical malpractice, etc. Yet, 9/11 shook the foundation of the world, radically changing our domestic and foreign policy.\n\nThe importance of certain events can't be measured by lives lost",
            "Also, caring about shootings gets it plastered all over the media, giving a spotlight to the shooter, which may be contributing to their decision to do it ",
            "I can't agree more on this. There are things that kill waaaaay more people than school shootings, or really just shootings in general. What about obesity, drunk driving, depression, medical malpractice... the list goes on. Those things kills many times more people than guns every year, but none of them receive anywhere near the amount of news coverage as gun violence. Also, if the media treated this like the almost non-issue that it is (compared to other things that kill people), it wouldn't receive weeks of coverage and inspire others to do the same terrible things. \n\nAnd I just have to get this off my chest, making more gun laws will not do anything to reduce gun violence. We can't even effectively enforce the laws and policies we have now (ex. Parkland shooting) so adding to them will only restrict law abiding citizens. From my personal experience, people who are against guns either have little  experience with them, or have only had a bad experience involving them. I think we can all agree that gun violence is bad, but being a victim of gun violence doesn't make you a gun expert or gun policy expert. I don't claim to be either of those things, but I'd say I know enough to know that 99% of new gun legislation will not solve the problem. ",

            "School shootings are \"useful\" to people that want to push a gun control narrative. They helpfully ignore the fact that gun control = more gun laws, which were already broken when the shooter walked into a \"gun free zone.\"\n\nBeyond that though, my biggest problem is how the media makes shooters famous. Don't show their face. Don't talk about where they're from or why they did it. Don't say their name. Don't make them a martyr. Tell the real story, which is that a fucking coward took a weapon to a place where he knew everyone else would be unarmed and committed an act of terror. ",
            "It\u2019s almost as if the liberal media is pushing some kind of gun-control agenda using children to tug at your heartstrings and elect officials to remove those pesky rights. You wouldn\u2019t want to be complicit in child death would you?",
            "I agree. The media love stories like this because it drives audiences. People don't care about feel good story and only the bad. And gun control will not help either. These shooting mostly happen in gun-free zones anyways.",
            "It\u2019s a good point, and I agree with you. But they still happen and when they do, they are tragic. I think we should still take appropriate measures to stop or prevent school shooting, at least the \u201cmass shootings\u201d, because there is no reason not to. And I don\u2019t mean by banning or restricting any particular firearm. Columbine, the fist major media covered school shooting in y lifetime, occurred during the last assault weapon ban. Virginia Tech, the biggest school shooting in terms of people killed, was carried out with pistols. The fact that the majority of recent school shootings are carried out with the most popular rifle in America is irrelevant. Ban or restrict them and they will simply use another firearm. \n\nArmed resource officers at every school (many schools have them already), allowing teachers who WANT to carry concealed to carry, locking classroom doors, teaching firearm safety/responsibility in school, and a robust mental health counseling program in every school would go a long way to reducing school shootings.  ",
            "I've been saying it for too long.  Gun control isn't about saving lives, because there are plenty of things easier to regulate that would save more lives.  It's just about hating guns.  California has been openly hostile toward gun rights for decades now and guess what, they still have public shootings.  We keep making laws that affect 150,000,000 gun owners because some concerned activists and politicians have a hunch that regulating them *might* prevent shootings (pro-tip: it doesn't)",

            "Statistically you\u2019re correct, we should care a lot more about other things than school shootings and school shootings have very little consequence to most of our lives at the moment. \n\nBut here\u2019s why I disagree. \n1) Just because you\u2019re not killed in a school shooting surviving one or knowing someone who survived one still impacts you massively. Going through trauma like this has a ripple effect to everyone who\u2019s kid was at a school where a shooting happens. It makes people involved feel unsafe in society which does impact society as a whole. \n\n2) Like terrorist attacks, society is disproportionately impacted by school shootings. Large events like these really do scare people regardless of the likelihood of it happening to them. This kind of mirrors point one. Because these events are nationally reported on, it makes people feel unsafe at school or that their kids are in school. No one should feel that way and even though the stats say it won\u2019t happen to me or someone I know, that means very little to the individual who it does happen to. Society runs better when people feel secure and safe and reducing school shootings would help that cause, even if they affect very few people. \n\n3) People don\u2019t and will never understand statistics + cognitive dissonance exists. Some people aren\u2019t smart enough; most people don\u2019t care to Saying, \u201cWell people should just know the facts before speaking for feeling a certain way,\u201d doesn\u2019t work. We are not rational beings and in fact, we are extremely emotion driven. What you feel is a lot more compelling than facts staring you in the face a lot of times. That\u2019s why it\u2019s easy to go with your gut rather than do the research about topics. We are and forever will be emotionally driven as a species. If reducing or working to reduce school shootings makes people feel better that\u2019s a noble pursuit as long as the benefit of everyone feeling a bit safer is not outweighed by the costs of reducing shootings.  \n\nTL:DR - OP is logically sound but traumatic experience have an affect on a number of us even if we aren\u2019t directly impacted and that can wear on society. Humans are emotional and even though events like these aren\u2019t worth worrying about, we inevitably will. ",

            "I went to High School in Los Angeles, in the 80s at the height of gang conflicts ( it was crips and bloods back then, but others too ). Moved around a quite a bit + had some issues, got into fights etc. so I actually attended 4 different High Schools between moving and transfers. I started at El Sereno, then Van Nuys, then Sylmar, then Monroe. The 1st 2 schools were actually pretty bad at that time, like really fucking bad. Sylmar was kinda in middle, still had plenty of bad shit though but people there were more laid back and not as violent or reactive, and Monroe was a decent one where I graduated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring my time of high school attendance, I have experienced 2 school shootings, 1 very close to me, where when I think about it now, there was actual real danger of a bullet ricocheting and hitting me. Luckily that didn't happen. And as far as ducking or getting out of the way goes, it was pretty much over by the time I even realized I should have ducked or gotten out of the way. In each case the shooters shot a couple times and immediately took off. Also in each case, they missed their targets and no one was injured or killed. The schools of course closed for the day cops and cop cars everywhere, everyone evacuated, etc. etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut even despite my own experiences, I am kinda with OP on this. It didn't break me, didn't cause me to cry in histeria or anything like that. Frankly speaking, all it ended up being for me back then was a few welcome days off from school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings are of course extremely different in a shooting such as the ones I experienced where a fucked up kid runs up to the fence with a handgun, tries to shoot another fucked up kid but misses and takes off, vs. something like a mass shooting with Assault Rifles or machine guns. Those are horrible withe a lot of people unnecessarily being hurt or killed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing which I understand now, but obviously did not when I was a teenager, is that parents trust schools to a large extent to take care of their kids. And for me, kids are kinda sacred and off limits when it comes to adult bullshit. Double this if there is violence. So now I know there are a ton of parents who feel this way and I understand why they feel this way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a school shooting makes so much news not just because of the act itself, not just just because of any actual casualties, but because of the violation of that trust. A violation of that \"sacred\" status and of course loss of a child which is a horrible thing to happen to any parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to sum it all up, I think that definetly there are incidents which are just too over sensationalized by the media and blown out of proportion, but there are also ones that do deserve such attention, and there are many that fall somewhere inbetween those. \n\n&#x200B;",
            "What I care for on the matter is Irrelevant. \n\nYou are not understanding that using emotion to pass legislation is unreliable, unpredictable and useless.\n \nYou\u2019re example is comparing two completely different ideas yet combining them as the same idea... \n\nNo matter how hard you \u201cwish, want or feel\u201d that emotions should be relevant to legislation, it will never be so. \n\nEmotions are fickle and using them as a foundation to make legislation is useless. \n\n",
            "It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter how likely your kid is to get shot. The problem is that there is a chance at all. We accept that we might die in a car crash. We know that a carbon monoxide leak can kill us. Firefighters and cops get killed all the time, and it doesn\u2019t surprise anyone. \n\nLife is uncertain, and there are obviously things we can\u2019t control. But being shot at school should not be accepted. The fact that it\u2019s unlikely is irrelevant. It\u2019s a heinous act that should be addressed anytime it happens.\n\nIf you said \u201cI\u2019m not *afraid* of school shootings, since they are so rare\u201d that would be ok. It\u2019s silly to fear something that is so unlikely. But we all should care about them. We should care about being able to send our kids to school, and having absolute **zero** fear that they will be shot. ",
            "[deleted]",
            "Probably no one will read this, but firstly, damn this is well-supported and thought out for an unpopular opinion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are saying that **we should not care about school shootings based on the fact that it is unlikely for an individual child to be shot in a school**. That's a solid argument, but I personally think that it misses the point somewhat. I hate to say it, but in this instance, making an argument purely with numbers does not work. It really is about more than just stats here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) The numbers as you present them are slightly misleading. For example, **school shooting deaths are increasing**, and **the number of adolescents vs adults committing them is also increasing**. So more kids are shooting up more schools. Does that seem significant, or like a trend worth checking out to you? For that reason, going all the way back to '65 and dividing the deaths evenly per year does not represent the problem fairly as it does not show that it is a worsening problem. \n\n[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180419131025.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180419131025.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Try making this statistical argument to a young school kid who is afraid to go into school. The very fact that this is not an outrageous scenario illustrates that the significance of these events extends beyond just the numbers. They are news because they have broad psychological and indirect effects on us as a society. **School shootings traumatize us as a society**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) What do these deaths suggest about us as a society? If you view these deaths as a symptom of some larger problem, it would seem that that underlying cause is also likely worsening. They are significant because unlike deaths from falling, **they reveal that our society is sick** in some way that should be considered seriously and treated. No other country has this frankly bizarre problem to this extreme extent, and for that reason, **the shootings signal something very ugly underlying US culture as a whole**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) As trite as it is to say, even a single child shot in a school would be 1 too many. Although statistically unlikely, **it is absurd that we have to calculate the probability for an individual student to get shot because they went into school** *at all*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) Lastly, the other statistics that you give for **other kinds of deaths are not really relevant to school shootings**. Maybe they are more severe problems, maybe they aren't, but they do not say much of anything about the relative importance of school shootings. Does it make sense to gauge the severity of school shootings in relation to the death toll of heart-disease? Not really because they are two separate and surely almost completely unrelated issues.

The only league with some parity is the EPL. \n\nI enjoy the strategic approach to the game (lol at the guy who said it\u2019s not a game of intelligence - it\u2019s a game of armor). If you\u2019re a RB who can\u2019t read the defense/understand blocking schemes/playcalling good luck trying to brute force your way through an NFL defense - it doesn\u2019t matter how much \u201carmor\u201d you have a 300 lb linebacker with safety help is gonna bring you down. \n\nThere is so much complexity in football with schemes, strategies, and playcalling that vary from team to team on both offense and defense that studying and film room analysis is just as important as your athleticism. You have to be prepared for each team individually, what their strengths are, how they will try to stop you, etc. \n\nThe way the Titans in this last playoffs were able to beat the ravens by exploiting lamar\u2019s weaknesses throwing to the outside was brilliant.

Each play has a goal, and the game continuously shifts depending on whether that goal is met or not.\n\nThe clock ticks down, which adds even more suspense. When the clock has 5 seconds left, it has 5 seconds left. The refs don\u2019t get to add more time based on a rough estimate they conjure up.

            "Football is a strategy sport that just happens to have an intense physical component.  The constant shifting and adjusting based on what the opponent is doing, pattern reading by the QB, insane reaction necessary from DBs, brute strength and technique displayed by the line, and generally having massive dudes that can move fast are all icing on the strategy cake.  \n\nThe bulk of the game is play calling and adjustment. The quick bursts of violence are the strategy in motion. \n\nThat said, the game can be streamlined a ton for better flow and momentum.  That's a huge part of what the XFL seeks to do and why I'm all for a brand competing with the NFL in a meaningful capacity.  \n\nAlso, NFL defensive backs are the greatest athletes on earth and I dont think it's even a question. Insane speed, strength, split second change of direction in reaction to what opponents are doing, insane power, and the ability to redirect force by dealing and absorbing impact.",

I love football, and I played a lot of it and I know how much skill it takes to make even a 4 yard run. The planning and preparation, offensive and defensive schemes. It\u2019s just so fun to watch. However, when I\u2019m watching a team I don\u2019t care about or it\u2019s not a playoff game, I don\u2019t usually watch the full game, just the 4th quarter. Thats also why I like highschool football, because I know the people and that amplifies the amount of fun I have watching. I feel that\u2019s like most sports. I don\u2019t watch baseball because I never played it, and I don\u2019t care about any of the teams. So it just really depends. However, I will agree that NFL has way to many commercials and is a slow burn for the first 3 quarters and unless i\u2019m watching \u201cmy\u201d team, it can get boring easily. Any live high school or college game you realize the speed and intensity it takes to play, and that itself is fun af to watch.",

Those kids **were** being abused, and are living with a different person (can\u2019t give away any more info than that. All that matters is that they\u2019re gone and safe).\n\nThe parents were arrested as well, since they were using hard drugs and giving them to their kids. Their lease has been dropped, and the landlord let my wife and I move into their old unit since it\u2019s on the top floor. Now that we\u2019ve actually caught up on our sleep, we aren\u2019t snapping at each other constantly and can enjoy the view from our new unit. \n\nThis was a very interesting post, and the replies went everywhere from \u201cThis isn\u2019t unpopular\u201d to \u201cthis is the 20th time I\u2019ve seen this concept in a week\u201d to \u201cyou are a terrible person who wants all babies to die\u201d to \u201cI made terrible choices and now they\u2019ve come back to haunt me and it\u2019s your fault for discriminating against people with children\u201d. I didn\u2019t knock you up, I didn\u2019t force you to keep it, go find some mommy club to complain to or whatever the hell it is you do- just don\u2019t do it around me. \n\nTo those of you with children, teach them to use their inside voices, and understand that the world won\u2019t stop turning because little Timmy\u2019s having a tantrum. You and you alone are responsible for your offspring, try to raise them into decent people. Also, don\u2019t bring your kid to adults only places. Or post them on the internet. There are dangerous creepers online, and putting photos and videos of them up is dangerous. The entire world doesn\u2019t need to see little \u201cK8lynn\u201d singing into a hairbrush. Nobody except for you and your family is interested in seeing that. \n\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nMSTOP TELLING ME ABOUT SENIOR RETIREMENT VILLAGES. I AM 34, NOT 50. I CANNOT MOVE INTO ONE FOR ANOTHER 16 YEARS. WE CANNOT AFFORD A HOUSE. WE\u2019RE SAVING FOR ONE. WE HAVE REPORTED THE FAMILY TO THE LANDLORD AND CPS. \n\nMy wife and I got some new upstairs neighbors recently. They were a bit loud moving in, but we figured that they were just trying to unpack as quickly as possible to get settled in. We brought them a basket of baked goods- and were promptly told by the lady of the house \u201cI hope you guys are good with noise. We have 6 kids under the age of 8.\u201d \n\nThey\u2019ve been here for a month. We have not slept for a month. They scream at one another all hours of the day and night, run and jump super loudly, and are just generally annoying. Evidently, they like the sound of our doorbell and will press it repeatedly to the point where we decided to take the batteries out. \n\nWe\u2019ve filed several noise complaints, only to be told \u201cThey\u2019re kids. What do you expect?\u201d Considering that we\u2019re paying nearly $2000 in rent per month, we were expecting at least some peace and quiet. \n\nIf there were an adults only apartment building with no children allowed, that would be amazing.\n\nEdit to add: No one under the age of 18 would be allowed to move in. Should any resident get pregnant and decide to have the child, they will be moved to a child friendly complex owned by the same company. (Original wording was vague) It\u2019s literally one building for people without kids, and one for people with them. They would have 3 months to vacate their current apartment and move into the child friendly block. \n\nThis is a hypothetical situation. \n\nAnd yes, I know retirement communities exist. My wife and I are in our 30\u2019s. We don\u2019t qualify yet. We actually like kids- it\u2019s the fact that kids are very poorly behaved now and we want to have at least *some* peace and quiet. For those of you with children, good for you- just raise them to be aware of the noise they make and try to shape them into respectful and kind little humans. \n\nLast edit: I can\u2019t believe this tiny germ of an unpopular opinion managed to make it on the front page. Whether or not you agree, the point is moot. My wife and I have decided to spend the weekend at my parents house to get some space from our neighbors. The stress that we\u2019ve been going through with these neighbors is intense. \n\nWe\u2019re planning to move out once our lease is up and will be looking into getting a top-floor unit. We live in America, so this child free building couldn\u2019t exist here. I know that and I wanted to see if people were interested in something like that. We called CPS because we think the kids are being abused, not because of the noise. They show a lot of signs of neglect, despite the fact that the parents are home nearly all the time. \nThank you all for the advice awards and debates! \nMay all of you be safe and have a Memorial Day.",

            "The problem with this thought is that it's not an unpopular opinion among landlords.  Kids make for *terrible* tenants.  \n\nThey generate noise complaints constantly.  They flush things they're not supposed to.  They break fixtures and appliances, and generally increase wear on units.\n\nIf landlords were allowed to discriminate around family status, many absolutely would.  That's great for child free renters, not so great for people with kids who have nowhere to go.\n\nIn my mind, a more pragmatic solution would be requiring certain standards of sound dampening for multi-unit rentals, or at least regulating the language around how landlords can advertise.  I've lived in units where I can *just barely* hear my neighbors screaming at eachother, and I've lived in units where my upstairs neighbors tiptoing to the bathroom might as well be bowling.  You don't know which you're getting until after you've signed a year long lease, and both units can be advertised as \"quiet.\"  That's the real bullshit of the thing.",
            "I understand completely.\n\nHad a downstairs neighbor who worked nights as a stripper. Her job wasn't a problem for me. But her dog would bark until she got home then she always brought a \"friend\" home. So I would hear them having \"sexy time\" then the TV would go on full blast. She seemed to be Bi so when she got a girl friend that started living there, they fought day and night! Middle of the day while I was working from home, they got in a fight because the stripper girl used all the tampons and the girlfriend was going to kill her for not leaving any. I don't care that I was TA but I called the cops because of the threat and I was tired of talking to them about how I could hear their fights. Plus they were so loud, when I was on a work call they could be heard fighting.",

            "Check your locale. Most locations have \u201cnoise ordinances\u201d meaning it\u2019s illegal to make over a certain amount of noise after a certain time (usually 10pm.) Constantly record instances of the noise and create a file. Time stamp the recordings so they can see what times the noise are.\n\n\n\nIn addition, I would begin to chat with your management agency about either getting them to respect quiet hours, or breaking the lease. Or giving you the courtesy to move into another unit. Yes kids make noise, but there is a limit to that if sleep is affected constantly for a period of time. Do not be afraid to call the cops non-emergency line for noise complaints, if they are truly making it for a long time and the officers show up they will be told to quiet down. \n\nContinue building up your case and any documents from the police. This will continue to add pressure to the management agency and after a few weeks of constant issues might cross the threshold of legal territory.",

            "I agree and I\u2019m actually a parent to a toddler + one on the way. To my credit, we follow noise ordinance laws, if for some reason my child is up early we have quiet time before 8am. If for some reason my child is up late, it\u2019s quiet time after 10pm.

It\u2019s obnoxious and I\u2019ve been in your position before I had my own kid and even when my son was an infant. Unnecessarily loud neighbors are awful. I believe in having *some* leniency, I\u2019ve been forgiving and passive when a neighbors baby has a rough week with teething at late hours, or if you hear an occasional bang and then cry (kids are suicidal little drunk people), an occasional shriek at 11pm, but a whole month of constant noise at all hours is ridiculous.",

It was barely bigger than a queen size mattress and didn't have a light, but that's where we chose to sleep since it was the only place in our suite that wasn't underneath their living area.\n\nWe made a few polite complaints, but that just resulted in us being evicted.\n\nThe housing market in North America is changing quickly and honestly I don't see it going back. It's not because our economy is going to shit. It's because the standard of living here has been unsustainably good for way too long.  Look at pretty much 90% of the rest of the world. Do they own single-family houses and drive new cars? No, they don't. The way our parents and grandparents lived was simply unsustainable, and that reality is starting to correct itself.

Not sure what the punishment is if they don't, they'd probably have to pay damages or something.\n\nObvioisly, this is a bit hash and most people feel bad about reporting noise unless it's really persistent and really bad. But at some point, noise pollution is just too much and you deserve some peace and quiet in your own home.\n\nI'm not comfortable with the concept of X-only buildings, whatever X is, because it's straight up discrimination. For instance, poor people who may have more kids, take in extended relatives with kids who'd fallen on hard times, etc. may be entirely driven out of certain neighborhoods designated for childless adults only, creating further gentrification of cities. Especially since these rentals would be in-demand from young families who don't plan kids yet, so the prohibiting expense may have a further gentrifying effect.\n\nEventually, if all buildings became either noise-friendly or noise-unfriendly, one of the groups may struggle to find housing because their preference is more in demand and thus prices are higher, making one of the choices more expensive.\n\nIdk, it just doesn't sit well with me. Though I agree living in an apartment with kids, especially with lots of them, is suboptimal. A house allows you more space for all of you, a yard for the kids to play in while being easily supervised, a buffer between you and the neighbors limiting the noise, etc. But many can't afford this and it may not even be sustainable to aim for everyone having this, financially or ecologically. Cities have just gotten too dense.",
            "There is nothing to be done. Federal law protects families from any penalty for noise caused by normal children\u2019s activity, including running, playing with toys, etc. Even during designated quiet hours, those activities cannot be restricted. Even asking them to move apartments is illegal. \n\nRepeatedly ringing your doorbell is the only actionable issue here. You should be able to legally insist they stop doing that, but the rest is protected by the Fair Housing Act.\n\nYour best bet is to ask your landlord if they have a top floor unit for you to move into and are willing to transfer your lease.\n\nYour proposal of a child-free rental complex is also illegal, even \u201cin America\u201d as you put in your edit. In the eyes of the law it\u2019s the same as setting up a complex that discriminates against any other protected class. Calling CPS was a major dick move and it won\u2019t work.",
            "I get what you mean but that sounds illegal as fuck to kick someone out of their home just for the simple fact they are pregnant lol",
            "Holy shit you pay 2k a month for a 1 bedroom? That's fucked.",
            "I wish this wasn't an unpopular opinion, childfree apartments should be way more normal than they are. Not everyone loves to live next to living sirens.",
            "I lived in a complex that seemed full of introverts. I\u2019d see people walk into their apartments and would never hear a thing.",

            "Fuck (them) kids",
            "Make more noise than them. Bang on the ceiling under their bedroom during the night when their kids are keeping you up. \n\nAlso, depending on where you are and what your lease says about noise, you might have some legal rights you can flex in response to the non resolving responses to your complaints.",
            "You should definitely start playing those high pitch only kids can hear tones on your stereo at full blast until you find a new apartment or they leave.",
            "Lol those would be so illegal. Oh you got pregnant here's your eviction notice, oh you have kids can't rent here nope not discrimination at all...",
            "I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve lived in apartments where the neighbors didn\u2019t have kids but they fucked like howler monkeys 2-3 times per day. The guy was actually super chill. I\u2019ve lived in houses where people across the street would keep me up fighting. If life\u2019s in super dense apartment 150sqft apartment buildings where the neighbors never made a sound but the building management started an 8 month renovation that was well over 100db 6 days a week. Now I live on 5 acres in the woods, surrounded by national forest and honesty kinda miss the city. \n\nIf you found an HOA or building management that was strict about noise, then you\u2019d have to deal with management that\u2019s probably strict about other things too.",
            "What if it were a 13+ apartment? Would that bother you? If so, what\u2019s the minimal age you\u2019d be ok with?",
            ">No kids, just adults and pets.\n\nI'm sure there's plenty of people who've had at least as much problems with neighboring pets as you've had with the kids. I say, keep them all out. Much as I appreciate a pet-friendly community in principle, I do not appreciate many of the pets that are living there in reality.\n\n>We\u2019ve filed several noise complaints, only to be told \u201cThey\u2019re kids. What do you expect?\u201d Considering that we\u2019re paying nearly $2000 in rent per month, we were expecting at least some peace and quiet. \n\nAnd you're probably legally entitled to it. Most apartment complexes have in their leases (and some locales have in law) a clause stating that you deserve peaceful enjoyment of your home and management is to take certain measures to preserve that.\n\nThere should also be a clause that says you (and therefore your neighbors, who should be under a similar contract) are not allowed to cause disturbances that will interfere with the peace of the community.\n\nRead your lease. If it has these provisions, point them out to management and ask that they enforce them.\n\nAlso check up on local noise laws. Call the cops (actual cops - not apartment security or courtesy officer) on the non-emergency line every time your neighbors are making too much noise, or making noise when they're not supposed to be.\n\nAlso, take recordings when you can. That way you have persistent evidence if the cops don't show up quick enough.\n\nIt might take awhile still. But persistent calls, accumulated documentation and evidence of incidents, and involvement of authorities should eventually pressure either the management or the parents to do something.",
            "I agree with you. Kids are noisy and many parents just expect everyone just to adjust to their little brats noisy ways without considering anyone else. They should not be able to terrorize you and your wife without repercussions...you pay good money each month to live in that building and should be able to relax in your own home.",
            "This is hilarious. Dude wants people to move out if they don\u2019t like his rules but doesn\u2019t want to live with the rules of not being a home owner. You\u2019re 34. Grow up! You should have been saving before now. Stop complaining. Move out or shut up.",
            "That's the con of living in an apartment and just something you have to accept, it's likely that when you were a kid, you bothered at least one of your neighbours (unless you live extremely isolated)",
            "They're destructive little bastards too. An apartment with children is almost guaranteed to have broken bifold doors, blinds, window screens, and cupboard hinges. Not to mention stains on carpet (if there is any), and marks on walls.\n\nNot that I really care. I'm not a landlord. It just strikes me as a bit odd when pets are prohibited for the same reason. And let's be honest, they're much less destructive & loud provided the owner isn't a complete buffoon. Don't get me wrong, I understand the rationale behind the double standard, and wouldn't want to open up the can of worms involved in addressing it, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. :P",

            "who the fuck has 5 kids within 8 years and decides \"hmm, yes, one more\"?",
            "This is what my city used to be lite. It was a nightmare to find new housing when I was pregnant. We'd just renewed our lease and had to end it early with a penalty. We paid more money for a smaller, less-nice unit, further from the city centre with worse amenities (and worse access to transit). Having to coordinate a move while I was pregnant sucked.\n\nAnd, like, for what? When our daughter was born she wasn't even a big crier. We had louder adult neighbours than our kid ended up being - people who played loud music and held big parties in their apartment. Even when she got older, she was asleep during the night when noise ordanances were in effect. My kid wasn't awake at 3:30 in the morning listening to trap music - she was sawing logs, passed out in a puddle of stuffed animals.\n\nOur city recently introduced legislation to make these practices illegal because it's made finding affordable family housing so difficult - and I really support that. It's discriminatory - and the people it affects the most are, frankly, low-income children.",
            "I agree, I also think that there should be a fee for children in an apartment more so than a pet fee. My dog is much less likely to fuck shit up than someone with 6 kids in an apartment.",

            "I've posted my situation on several subs. I'm going through something similar. So much noise from these kids. It boggles my mind that the parents of these kids have no consideration for anyone else. Everyone in the whole complex has to deal with the noise, toys everywhere, ruining the landscaping, ringing doorbells, peeking in windows and whatever other mischief they get into. Most of the tenants are older and many have had to work from home. It's ridiculous and management does nothing. \nOk, I've vented. I'm moving this month because of all this. Hopefully it won't happen at my new place but I've never had such luck.",
            "Completely agree, kids are playing outside my apartment right now and have scratched the side of my truck with their bikes.",

            "So, personally, I agree. I love the rain, there's something so tranquil about the pitter patter of the droplets. Storm are gorgeous sometimes.\n\nBut scientifically, theres actually good reason why we associate it with being sad, depression, and pain. The barometric pressure and atmospheric changes associated with weather fluctuations can cause both psychological and physiological effects. \n\nPsychologically (for some) the environmental changes such as the lack of sunlight and humidity can bring about more irritatibility therefore leading to a more negative mood and perception throughout the day. There have been studies that show some people who have bipolar disorder, depression, and related disorders can have more negative reactuons to the weather changes generally lowering their mood more. (This doesnt apply to everyone, whether you have a diagnosis or not - much of the population doesn't have a psychological reaction to the \"poor\" weather at all)\n\nPhysiologically (also, for some) the change in barometric pressure can effect muscles, tendons, joints and other parts of your body. The changes in pressure can cause contraction amd expansion of the muscles, scar tissue, and even bone that can cause pain. The lower temperatures can also effect joint fluids and other fluids in your body making them harder to regulate. This is why people with arthritis and other related pain conditions can sometimes tell when a storm is coming because of their pain level.\n\nSo, although most of the association is personal and depends on where you live and your own experiences, there is some science to it. \n\n(Have Bipolar II disorder and EDS so weather tends to hit me like a ton of bricks)",

Compare with cultures that were formed in dry climate - Sahara desert, native american cultures of people from desert areas, like your Arizona.

There's a lot of nights I remember from when I was 6-8 where I sat watching the rain or on a drive around the state while it rained.\n\nEven now, I'll shower with the lights off in the middle of the night just to be happy or to calm myself down. If it's raining and I'm asleep I'll stay asleep until it slows, to the point where you can't wake me up.\n\nIt rains a fair bit here, but it's always special, even the weeks where it never stops raining.\n\nI've never really been a happy person though, life has always been hard to trudge through, I don't remember or know if anything even caused me to be this way but I've never enjoyed life. My grand father was always confused as to why I was the only child who stayed alone, never smiled, never laughed, never said a word unless they came to me, never played. I feel like that's what everyone saw when I was young, that seemingly depressed child. \n\nThat child who wasn't loud even after birth (my mom always brings that up when she talks about young me \"You're the only child I know who didn't cry when you were born\"), the kid who didn't want friends or even to be talked to, that school mate who looked like they hated everyone though never said a word, that student who was so capable but just skated by with perfect 60s, thar adult ed student who never had any strikes and passed all the work given with 90s or 100s, that person you see walking every where, the one that pulls your attention but doesn't want anyone to look them, the applicant who looks capable though doesn't take care of themself and would put off customers.\n\n*shrug* You'd think my life started off tragic, though I don't remember anything that ever caused it and I don't have any mental illness that would effect it. To be perfectly honestly, I just think it's something from before I was born... I know how stupid that sounds, though it's the only explanation I have. I don't understand how people could be just blatantly happy, and I don't understand how someone could be happy without pain. I have always hated myself, and I've grown to live with that pain, but... You may grow jaded or scarred or get over it, but it never goes away. And it makes every happy moment even better... The rain is one of those for me...",

            "I know you're not trying to say anyone happy being single is really lying and secretly hurt, but it still makes me want to share a story that happened... 2 weeks ago?\n\nI am asexual and aromantic. Sex and romance are NOT for me, and due to past experiences, I get really pissed off when people try to tell me that I need to be in a relationship or I can't be happy. After YEARS of people trying to force me into relationships I didn't want to be in, I get very unreasonably angry when people try to tell me that I should be in a relationship. They mean well, but they need to mind their own business.\n\nI was in the breakroom with two coworkers. One of them is like me and has never had an interest in love or sex. The other used to have a fiance.\n\nIn fact, he was telling us how his engagement fell apart because she was religious and he wasn't. He couldn't stand religion and even though they tried to make it work, it was too big an incompatibility (I found out later that he kept shaming her for her belief in God and she left him). I was uncomfortable and I'm prone to bad jokes when I'm nervous, anxious or uncomfortable, so I said \"I'm glad that's not something I'll ever have to worry about!\" And as soon as I said it, I realized my mistake. He told me \"Oh, don't worry! You'll find someone!\" With absolute pity. \n\nI gave a very obviously fake smile and laugh and said \"Thanks, but I'm happy being single.\" He didn't get it, and kept going on about how he was confident I wouldn't be alone forever. The other guy was visibly getting uncomfortable, too, so I decided to be direct.\n\nI told him that he was pissing me off and needed to stop. I told him that I was tired of people telling me how to live my life in order to be happy when they don't know shit about me, and that the conversation was over.\n\nHe got VERY condescending and said \"Well, I believe there's someone for everyone! Including you!\" I'm kind of ashamed of how I handled this, but I managed to shut him up.\n\nI said \"You should mind your own failed relationship instead of getting in my business! Your engagement flopped, not because of religious incompatibility, but because you can't stand anyone living life differently than you! Fucking stop!\" I didn't know about him shaming his fiance at the time, but his behavior towards me pissed me off and I just said what I hoped would make him leave me alone. Then I turned to the other man and started loudly discussing how I've recently picked up studying Christianity and the things in the Bible that confused me. The guy with the ex left quickly afterwards, and I made sure to apologize to the man who feels like I do about those things.\n\nI should have had enough common sense to know he wouldn't have taken my joke well, and I should have had enough patience to not tell him his relationship failed because of him. But it wasn't because I'm secretly unhappy with how I'm living, it's because people around me are so entitled that they think their way of living is the ONLY way. I have never told anyone that they'd be happier single than in a relationship, I've never tried to shame anyone for being in a relationship, and I have only tried to break up one couple because they were bad for each other, abusive, and one almost died in the hospital. If people could just offer me the same courtesy in return, everything would be fantastic.",

I was emotionally spent. Yeah I had my friends still and hung out, but ironically, the day my wife met me and started crushing on me, was the party I decided to attend and stop giving a fuck and just being content by myself before I fell for another woman and had a terrible ending again.\n\nEven now while married, I am extremely comfortable being alone, either purely or at home with the wife. I barely talk to anyone from high school or family, made no friends in college and burn all my extroversion at work, so I come home and hide with our cats.

That\u2019s just how it is but you wouldn\u2019t stop being someone\u2019s friend over it, so why do we stop being our own friends over it. No one has to be perfect, just be a good friend to yourself. And then, even when you are alone you are still hanging out with a friend.\n\nAnd what\u2019s really cool is once you realize that and learn to be alone the rest of your relationships improve because they in turn are under less pressure.\n\n(I\u2019m no professional or anything, that just what I do cause it\u2019s the only way I\u2019m not impossibly hard on myself and that, being impossible, just sets me up for inevitable failure which continues the cycle.

Obviously I don\u2019t know how your relationship works so maybe you and your partner have a bond over talking about who you find attractive. However, if you are in a closed relationship with someone I don\u2019t see what the point of telling them that you find someone else attractive is, just keep it to yourself. For example, if you see someone on the street and think they look cute why would you tell your partner about how cute they look? Or if you have a celebrity crush on an attractive celebrity, why won\u2019t you just have that fantasy in your head, what will telling your partner who probably doesn\u2019t compare to that celebrity do? \n\nThere\u2019s nothing they can really do with that information, to me it just seems like a way to try and get a reaction out of someone or to see if they\u2019d get jealous or not. If you don\u2019t get jealous by that stuff that\u2019s great and shows that you are confident in yourself, however, if you do get jealous by this stuff there\u2019s nothing wrong with you for doing so, they should keep their fantasies to themself. \n\nTL;DR - it\u2019s 100% natural to find other people attractive in a relationship but feeling the need to continuously tell your partner who you find attractive is an asshole move.\n\nEdit- I thought this was unpopular due to the amount of people saying \u201cthey won\u2019t meet the celebrity anyways so it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d In [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/htwlkc/its_lowkey_rude_af_to_be_so_blatantly_in_love/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nEdit 2- I find it funny how many people are angry at how \u201cthis isn\u2019t unpopular at all\u201d but I\u2019m getting a very large amount of comments about how childish and somehow controlling this viewpoint is.

        "comments": [
            "I 100% agree with this. I feel like it is normal to find other people attractive, and my partner and I actually have a healthy outlet for it where we will not sexualize the other person or make each other feel like shit about it, we just pay a compliment that the other person can agree on in passing like \"She looks so cute in that dress!\" or \"Man that guy is in wicked shape, he must hustle at the gym, good on him!\" Nothing derogatory or rude, and especially nothing that makes the other feel small or unattractive. I would never say something to purposefully make my partner feel insecure, and I have seen people do that kind of thing. It's a shitty thing to do to someone. I heard a man say to his wife before: \"Remember when you used to look like that? My God.\" I mean, what the fuck do you do with that? Or I have heard a similar comment from someone's wife before: \"You used to have a body like that before you got a beer gut\". I mean Jesus. Do you love this person or are they your whipping mule? Those are horrible things to say to people.\n\nAcknowledging beauty does not intimidate me or make me feel insecure because I know my partner and I genuinely don't worry. We have complete confidence in our relationship and it doesn't take away from either of us to admit we find someone attractive, but there is a respectful way of doing that so you don't hurt them or others. Some people are so rude and belittling to their partners, they will use someone else's appearance to make their partner feel like shit. And that's abhorrent. \n\nBeyond that, I think appreciating a celebrity or having a favorite isn't that much of a big deal, but I have seen behaviours that really compromise and disrespect the relationship. Guys who plaster their computer with photos of their favorite scantily clad actress? Not cool. Women who plaster photos of their favorite boyband dude on their wall while living with their male partner? So cringe. I mean, I have seen people legit tell their partners they are beneath their favorite celebrities, or that they will \"have to get used to\" the fact that they will never be \"insert celebrity\". You don't know these celebrities and you are delusional. You are ruining a relationship with a person who genuinely wants to love and care for you for someone who has no idea you exist and probably never will. I have heard a guy refer to his girlfriend as \"his placeholder for Salma Hayek\". That's fucked up. I know of a woman who has a Park Jimin shrine IN HER BEDROOM that her and her husband share. Also, fucked up. \n\nThe bottom line is, if you truly are in love with your partner and you respect them, nobody comes above them. It's OK to like a celebrity or find someone else attractive, but never, ever let that come between you and the person who supports you and has your back. Make sure they know that, completely. I always make sure to give my partner compliments, tell him he is sexy, tease and be playful with him, flirt with him -- all of those behaviours which show love, affection, and give them security in your love for them. It is so paramount to me that he trusts me, feels valued, and feels confident. If you don't make a point of putting that energy into your partner, don't be surprised when they leave. \n\nMy TLDR here is, If you are spending all your time praising other people's looks and don't put that kind of time and energy into praising your partner, you are probably not with the right person. Looks are great and all, but we all become withered in the end if we make it that far. Beauty is fleeting, flowers die, and what remains after all that superficial bullshit is out of the way is what counts. If your relationship is built on shallowness and vanity, don't expect it to still be there when you grow old. You need to build your life with someone on a stronger and more realistic foundation than that, and you've got to build a solid foundation of respect, trust and honesty if it is ever going to last.",
            "Thank you so much for saying this. Had an ex who would make some sort of \u201cooh\u201d and \u201caah\u201d noises every time an attractive woman went on screen. He then gaslit me by saying he doesn\u2019t even find them that attractive and it\u2019s a natural reaction. It honestly destroyed my self esteem.\n\nEdit: The amount of vitriol for this comment is unnecessary. There is obviously more to this comment and a history behind it that I don't want to divulge on the internet. I wrote a nice thank you to a post that touched me from my own experience. There's no need to read that thank you and then assume I'm still struggling with any of this or that I'm a weak minded person. This was in the past. It was also a small piece of why this relationship ended and there were other facets involved. So maybe just keep the unnecessary comments regarding my \"mental fortitude\" to yourself.\n\nEdit: Some of y'all need to go to the r/relationships sub with this kinda energy.",
            "I had this once with an ex, so I started to behave the exact same way. My lock screen was of shirtless David Beckham (this was like 10 yrs ago), I would check out other guys in public when I was with him, smile and look away when I made eye contact with the good looking strangers, all the stuff he did to me I did to him. And you know what? It broke him. Made him feel insecure, threatened and jealous. What\u2019s worse is the righteous high i would get from behaving that way faded quickly, and in the end I was very ashamed of my behaviour. In summary: don\u2019t be with someone who makes you feel shitty about yourself for any reason. Some people don\u2019t mind having a partner with wondering eyes, but if you do, communicate it or get out.",
            "I would be more concerned if your physical attraction part of your brain suddenly stopped working during a relationship.

Naturally I immediately heard alarms bells, this question is a trap. If I say no, you accuse me of lying, if I say yes I'm a mind-cheater and a dick. I chose honesty:\n\n \"Well yeah, sometimes I might notice if someone is good looking\"\n\n\"How can you do that? That's horrible! I never notice anyone else ever!

A good example is 'The rock',  which they will both be drooling over in every movie he is in.  Knowing she is sexually attracted to big, muscular men does provide motivation for me to be in the best possible shape.  She doesn't have any issue with me pointing out attractive women ( and even points them out to me).   It also gives her a boost to be be in the best shape she can be.

I was an asshole on several occasions. Constantly spreading that information that either partners can\u2019t do anything with is shitty. I have been making sure that I am more positive in things I love/have attraction about my partner and not the attraction of the others. Not doing that again. Now I\u2019m not saying one can\u2019t see a movie or a show and comment on the beauty of someone, but to subject your partner to the lust or over infatuation (through over commenting or noises) of another person is detrimental to either partner. Since they can\u2019t really change their physical attributes. If you can do that with your partner cool, but how do you really feel about it? I believe a lot people are not true with their feelings on this subject. They try to act as if they super open and okay with it. I don\u2019t believe they are though. That\u2019s just my take.\n\nEdit: You can be confident as fuck. Still feel shitty about that just saying.",

We do the same thing about people we encounter in the real world, but it's been a while since covid started.\n\nThere's no asshole move involved here.  The only reason why someone would have a problem with their partner telling them they find someone else attractive is insecurity or a lack or trust.   If you can't trust someone, then there's no reason to be in a relationship with them.  There's also no reason to be in a relationship with someone if they're insecure.

            "I think if your partner has told you they don't want to hear it then you are an asshole!! But I'd be more than happy to point out attractive people with my partner if that's something they was ok with! \n\nI think celebrity crushes are viewed slightly different due to them being 'fake'. They don't look like they do in the movies irl, you don't know their personality and will never meet them or have a chance, so it's the same as saying you find a cartoon character attractive, kinda means nothing... But again if your partner has told you they don't want to hear it, youre an asshole",
            "A few months ago in the waiting room at the doctor\u2019s office there was a couple looking at a magazine and the guy turned to the woman and said loudly while pointing at the magazine and said she would be my hall pass! And made a few more comments but I just tuned him out at that point. The woman told him to shut up and looked embarrassed.",
            ">Recently people have been saying how fucked up it is if you have a celebrity crush\n\nI haven't heard anyone say this, but humans can be, and usually are, attracted to more than one person. It's human nature. That has nothing to do with cheating in a committed relationship, which is an act of breaking the trust of your partner and is always bad.\n\n>While I agree that finding other people attractive is just a part of being human it becomes concerning if you feel the need to continuesly tell your partner this. Obviously I don\u2019t know how your relationship works so maybe you and your partner have a bond over talking about who you find attractive. However, if you are in a closed relationship with someone I don\u2019t see what the point of telling them that you find someone else attractive is, just keep it to yourself. For example, if you see someone on the street and think they look cute why would you tell your partner about how cute they look? Or if you have a celebrity crush on an attractive celebrity, why won\u2019t you just have that fantasy in your head, what will telling your partner who probably doesn\u2019t compare to that celebrity do?\n\nYou acknowledge that you aren't presuming to know how everyone's relationship works, which is an important and reasonable starting point. I'm in a committed, long term relationship with a partner who I live with. We're about 85% monogamous, 15% non-monogamous. Non-monogamy doesn't really factor into our relationship most of the time, except we have linked OkCupid accounts and occasionally we have fun looking for a third or another couple to play around with. We're a little non-traditional (we also occasionally go to kink events), which isn't specifically what you're referring to, since you said \"closed relationship,\" but our relationship is still mostly closed.\n\nI enjoy being relatively open with my partner about who I'm attracted to, whether it's in a tv show we're watching or someone else who catches my eye. I don't talk about it all the time, because I don't naturally do that anyways, whether I'm with her or with friends. But if you want to understand the benefit of it, think of it this way. If I'm watching a movie with her and there's some actress on screen who I'm crazy attracted to, sharing that fact with her is an act of open honesty, it's an act of me expressing my real feelings and thoughts, and it's an act of vulnerable sharing, and the same goes for her telling me about a guy she's attracted to. We don't do it all the time, but when one of us has the urge to we just do it openly as opposed  to silencing ourselves.\n\n>There\u2019s nothing they can really do with that information, to me it just seems like a way to try and get a reaction out of someone or to see if they\u2019d get jealous or not. If you don\u2019t get jealous by that stuff that\u2019s great and shows that you are confident in yourself, however, if you do get jealous by this stuff there\u2019s nothing wrong with you for doing so, they should keep their fantasies to themself.\n\nYou make another pretty reasonable comment here. The point is, if sharing attraction to other people doesn't work in your relationship and both you and your partner are very happy and content keeping that information to yourselves, that's great! Your relationship can be exactly what you and your partner want it to be. You should maximize whatever makes your relationship as awesome as possible. If for you two that means not sharing outside attractions, awesome, don't share them. For me and my relationship, maximizing the awesomeness means sharing those attractions, and that's great for us! There's no one right answer as long as everyone's communicating their needs honestly and directly.",
            "In my opinion, if you are a 100% confidant in yourself, you won\u2019t give a dam about who your partner finds attractive cause you won\u2019t feel the need to compare. That being said, there is a big difference between a partner mentioning that a particular person is good looking and them saying that that person is hotter or better than you and you should follow step. It also depends on how the partner says it too, there\u2019s a huge different between saying I find that person beautiful or good looking and saying he/she is hot as fuck or whatever vulgar term is used. \n\nEx: \nRyan Reynolds is a beautiful man = ok and being respectful of others\nRyan Reynolds is hot piece of ass, you should work out like he does or dress like he does = no very disrespectful and distasteful",

My parents both likes my dad's frist name so they decided to name me it since my dad never used it (he was raised with his middle name.).\n\nThen I tried to buy my frist apartment.  The sale nearly fell through because of a old loan of my father's.\n\nWhen I was 14 my dad took out a loan to buy some new equipment for his business, apparently the loan was some how attached to my name in addition to/instead of his.  When my dad paid off the loan it the loan was only cleared from his name.\n\nSo 13 years later, offer accepted, i get a call telling me that I can't get a mortgage until I clear this old loan.  Massive wtf.  So after several phone calls I ask them.  \"Can you see my birthday in your system?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"How old was I when the loan was created?\"\n\n\"14\"\n\n\"Who cosigned it?\"\n\n\"No one\"\n\n\"So you're telling me someone gave a loan to minor with out an adult sign off on it?\"\n\n*Silience*\n\n\"I can't remove the loan until you prove you paid it.\"\n\n\nSo anyway, they finally tell me which bank the loan was with, same I was with at the time.  So I go down there and get them to write a letter listing all the accounts I have with them and state that I have no other credit cards, loans, or any kind other accounts bey9nd the listed ones.  I sent that to the company blocking the mortgage and it's still not enough.\n\nI go back to the bank and get the letter amended to state that that specific loan is not, nor ever was given to me, that I was not responsible for it, or was in anyway related to me. Also that said loan was paid off over a decade ago with in the terms of said loan.\n\nSend off that new letter and finally able to clear the subjects less then I week before the dead line.\n\nNone of my childern will ever bare the name of a living relative of the same last name.",

            "\"Less likely to be dry\"\n\nOK that's not opinion that's just bullshit. Let me explain. You see fat is what makes meat juicy and gives it a nice mouth feel. In chicken most of the fat is just under the skin so when you remove the skin you remove some of the fat. Another thing that makes meat tastier and juicer is collegan and connective tissue. Now boneless 'wings' are just strips of breast meat with a coating.

            "A long time ago, I went to a relatively well known pizza place here in Canada. I wanted chicken wings, I had had them there before and wanted to get some. I saw that they had boneless wings, but stupid me forgot that boneless wings = breaded chicken, so when I got them and saw what they were, disappointment ensued. Finished them, ordered some actual bone-in wings, enjoyed those more. All I remember about the boneless ones were that they tasted like dry, over-processed chicken giblets coated in chewy, soggy batter.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love chicken nuggets. But when I want a good flavorful piece of chicken where the meat at least has some substance to it, I'm not ordering boneless. They're just chicken tenders. Good for when I've got nothing else in the house to eat, not so good when I want to eat *actual fucking chicken*.",

            "Boneless wings aren't wings. They're trash.\n\n1. White meat is less flavorful than dark meat.\n2. Breaded boneless wings don't have skin, the part that gets crispy that the breading is trying to recreate/compensate for the lack thereof.\n3. Always has breading (added carbs) that tastes like a pre-spiced blend of generic freezer section Tyson nonsense\n4. Comes frozen in the box. Sure, the wings come frozen too, but the freezing of that breading makes it taste like garbage.\n\nSure, not all places get their boneless wings from GFS or Sysco, but enough do to make it pointless for you to be buying them from a restaurant.\n\nWings are expected to be messy. It's one of traditional wings socially understood idiosyncrasies. That's why there are wetnaps at restaurants that serve them. It's part of the experience and indicative of someone who knows how to eat wings if they can do it without making a mess. You having a problem making a mess simply means you're a child.\n\nAlso, if you're breaking teeth on chicken bones, you're trying to eat the wrong part.  \nWhite breast meat is also MORE likely to be dry and stringy. White meat is known for being the part of the chicken that is more likely to be dry whereas dark meat is always associated with juiciness and more flavor.",

A show about high school wouldn't be a routine every day slog of studying like it is in real life, instead the more interesting aspects like friendship and parties are turned up to eleven so that they could be interesting and a sort of escapism that appeals to the viewer.

And if it\u2019s not, and even as an adult you think longingly of being a teenager, than you peaked in high school.  Like Al Bundy.\n\nYour 20\u2019s will be awesome because you will be discovering your independence.  Stretching your wings as they say.

I graduated 11 years ago, and luckily, the only social media then was Myspace, which didn't become a thing until I was already in my sophomore year. Today's youth has ALL the pressure from snapchat, YouTube, Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram, twitter, Netflix, etc etc. You're always being bombarded at every angle with how society is \"supposed\" to be like and how you're \"supposed\" to live your life.

You can make great memories and friendships, but it doesn't take away the fact that you're still a kid navigating puberty and the beginning of adulthood.\n\nEdited to add the below:\n\nI am nearly 35 and I feel my late 20s to now have been the best years for me. I had pretty bad social anxiety in high school so, although I had several friends in choir, I wasn't the stereotypical high school child. In college I studied a hard major and worked part time so I didn't have time for the stereotypical college life either. And I lost my virginity at 24. But now I feel much better. I've lived in several states. Made a lot of friends.  Visited a lot of cool places. And I have a solid career.  My point is, everyone has a different pace and path in life. Just because movies and TV shows swear high school or college has to go a certain way, that isn't true. Live the life the makes you happy and, I hate to sound like a corny parent,  but also make good choices and those choices will pay off.",

            "> youtube videos  \\[...\\] social media\n\nThere lies your problem. You're using the wrong sources for informations and those false narratives generate frustration when you realize real life (your real life) doens't work like fake shit on social media, TV series etc.\n\nDo you think real-life doctors have enough time for all the drama and the escapades you see on Scrubs, Gray's Anatomy, House MD etc?\n\nDo you think cops have a thrilling chase and a difficult, yet successful, investigation about serial killers every week like in most procedural dramas? I bet most deal with much more inane paperwork, boring instances of disorderly conduct and domestic violence than TV let you imagine. And don't get me started on SVUs...\n\nRomanticized and exaggerated accounts of EVERYTHING are a problem, but they hit harder when they're about things kids and teens are \"supposed\" to experience.\n\nThat's peer-pressure on a whole different level.\n\nJust don't consume as much garbage content about what your life \"should\" be, or don't do so acritcally. Be aware that all forms of entertainment conveniently sweep under the rug the mundane parts of the stories to focus on the highlights.\n\nThere IS a reason if videos are 5 minutes long and TV series covering years of life last only a couple of hourse per season.\n\nMaybe your strict parents forgot to give you the memo. Fiction is called like that because, guess what, it's not real.",
            "Casual sex and excessive drinking, especially at such a young age, is extremely detrimental to mental and emotional health, and physical health as well in terms of the latter.\n\nYou're better off avoiding any of that stuff. A lot of students in my senior class didn't graduate, almost all of them the ones with reputations for being drug users or 'partygoers', not to mention all the ones that had kids because they were out screwing each other left right and center without any concern for safety.\n\nI know high school is not an easy time. You probably feel like it's your chance to figure out what kind of person you want to be, to test your social limits by going out and partying all weekend, every weekend. You feel a new sense of independence as your growing older and getting ready to head for college in the next few years.\n\nBut I promise you, those parties will do nothing for you even in the short term. It will be a few hours of immediate gratification and that will be it. You're better off avoiding that sort of stuff altogether. In reality you're unlikely to see most people from your high school class again barring your closest friends. The only thing that matters is putting in the best effort you can to prepare yourself for college.\n\nAnd, for reference, college isn't what it's portrayed to be either, not if you want to actually get through it in one piece. It's not all even more alcohol and weed and more dangerous casual sex, unless you want an excuse to waste money and fail a semester. It's much more work than high school, and you're going to deal with a lot of advanced classes that require good study habits if you're going to make it through.\n\nI'm still in college myself so I'm hardly 'well-versed' in the intricacies of adult life, but you got your entire life left ahead of you. Don't squander it by thinking you need to spend your high school and college years partying. Don't think that losing your virginity is something you absolutely *have* to do by any means especially. That is perhaps the most dangerous concept that's crept into the image of modern high school and college depictions. Be careful and don't make rash, stupid decisions because you feel pressured to fulfill some nonexistent standard or because you think that your time is running out, cuz otherwise your looking at your own 18+ year commitment that you'll not be ready for.\n\nYou've only begun to live. Hell, I'm 22 and I still don't know much of anything. They say life is short, but it's not *that* short. Take your time, think things through. You'll be better off applying yourself in school than focusing on parties that do nothing for you in the long term.",

            "There is somewhat of a generational gap in terms of movies/tv shows made about high school nowadays. A lot of movies portray high school as sexed up, drugged up, party craziness. \n\n[But that was the 90s and 00s, kids in the 2010s are way, way more tame than previous generations.](https://i.imgur.com/sMOCg0V.png) Especially in regards to stuff like parties, which used to be the mainstay of teenage socializing in previous generations, yet have rapidly fallen out of popularity among current teens. I always see the trope on reddit that \"high school parties like in the movies dont happen in real life\" and it always confused me because growing up we had quite a lot of parties like that. \n\nSo we might say \"high school movies are unrealistic\" now, but to the people making these movies, it wasn't entirely unrealistic to how they grew up. They just haven't updated to the times, where kids do less drugs, have less sex, drink less, and go out less.",
            "Yeah, I didn\u2019t do any of that in high school. I went to a smaller rural school and graduated per 15 years ago, but movies back then romanticized high school as well.  Most of your peers are also thinking the exact same way as you, and you will find that the best years are to come. \n\nFor instance, in high school, I thought hanging out with my group of friends was the greatest thing ever, and didn\u2019t want that to change. Then, college came, and I found out high school sucked and college was way better. I had more options to go, got to really find my interests, and met people I just would\u2019ve never had the opportunity to if I didn\u2019t go. Now, I\u2019ve found that both of those didn\u2019t give me as much fulfillment as being a husband, a dad, and having a successful career make me feel.\n\nLife is all about phases, and you\u2019ll find yourself.

It was very frustrating but looking back on it now, I\u2019m so happy I didn\u2019t have any relationships and sexual experiences because it is a big thing and I definitely wouldn\u2019t have been ready for it, even though I thought I was.

            ">Everyone\u2019s lives bloom at different points\n\nI'm glad you've realized this as a teenager. See, the time of my life that was fraught with \"unrealistic expectations\" was college. Everyone goes on and on about how college is the best time of your life and you can never get it back, so enjoy it while it lasts. I spent most of my time at college struggling from undiagnosed ADHD and an almost complete inability to make friends. My college experience was not the \"movie experience\" and I hated almost every minute of it.\n\nI'm currently one month away from my 25th birthday and even though 2020 has been one hell of a year, I can't remember the last time I was so happy. In the last six months, I've moved out of my parents house, got into graduate school for something I'm really passionate about, got a dog, and got engaged.\n\nMy life has certainly only just started to bloom, and its truly incredible. I guess my advice for everyone would be to try to know when you're in the good times and don't take them for granted, but also try to remember to find happiness and peace in your life in those times you're not quite in \"full bloom\" yet. <3",
            "Almost 99% of \"high school\" portrayed in media, is specifically regarding the culture of Rich Suburban Los Angeles California High School.  The show's creators and writers can only write what they know, and usually the actors are a decade past puberty anyway.  It started basically with Archie Comics and went from there.  Most high schools can barely run a proper prom let alone the kinds of clubs and teams shown in Glee.\n\nActual high school in Anytown USA is not like One Tree Hill or 90210.\n\nThe only major exception I can really say is part of the 1% of realistic high school shows, is Degrassi, because they go out of their way to make their show like a Canadian school with young actors.  The drama comes from seeing very young teens like real grade 9s and 10s dealing with major real life shit.",
            "I agree that the high school shenanigans you see in movies exist in a wild, heightened reality that can sometimes diminish the joy of actually being in high school.\n\nThat vision of the high school experience comes from somewhere, though.  I think it's a chance for the adults who make and to an extent watch those movies to vicariously relive high school.\n\nBecause the reality is that high school is essentially the last time in your life where adult responsibilities just don't exist.  Barely anything counts, and all the people you're around every day will largely disappear from your life after you graduate.  The tragedy of being a teenager is that barely any of them have enough perspective to realize that 95% of the shit that seems important or difficult when you're 15 is meaningless nonsense.\n\nSo while it might not be an especially fun time for you, hopefully you might get why people who work 40 hours a week and get 15 vacation days a year total might romanticize a time when they routinely got summers off.",

Volunteer, get a job - anything that might stand out to a recruiter on a college application (they like seeing unique programs or leadership exp.)\n\nI read about someone who knew exactly what she wanted to do in college so she graduated HS early. I do not recommend this.\n\nHigh school sucked for me. The problem w/ social media is that everyone wants to \"stay in touch\"/see how you're doing in life, etc. after HS. Keep your friends and block everyone else.\n\nI saw a post about how some girl did whatever she wanted and got a minimal GPA/high school diploma. You could do that instead of dropping out... but those are incredibly low standards.",
            "I don\u2019t think that is unpopular but I agree as a high school student. They really do it just for the movies bc tbh an average high schoolers life is quite boring and uneventful most of the time",
            "My counterargument: High school is not and should not be a 24/7 party. Not everyone is like a teenager in a  movie setting unrealistic expectations, and you need to study and get good grades to get into college to get a good career. Doing it the Zuckerberg way based on your 'street smarts' is not a viable option for any real person. I don't even necessarily think you should stop studying and go wild in college, but even that's not as vital if you're not planning on going to grad school or graduating cum laude. \n\nHigh school is important to set discipline and regiment on your own that you'll follow the rest of your life, since you won't have your parents doing things for you like in middle school where the grades essentially don't matter. Just my two cents.",

            "Mean Girls, too.  I graduated in 2010, and the only time girls were dresses and heals is when they had some sort of after school function and had to dress nice.  The guys had to wear dress pants and shirts and nice shoes.  Also, the popular kids weren\u2019t all mean and bullies.  Yeah, there were a few here and there, but a few girls who had been mean to me never singled me out, but maybe made a few comments.  I was super quiet in high school and not that popular.  I\u2019m not sure how high school parties were for the popular kids, but I know they would get drunk every now and then.  But I don\u2019t believe for a second that high school parties are a messy shit show like they show in movies and tv shows.  And I never once been told I couldn\u2019t go to a party.  If the popular kids were setting up a party, they talked amongst themselves and you would overhear their conversations, but they don\u2019t sit there and write a list of whose invited and who isn\u2019t.  I never went to a party because I\u2019m too damn shy and quiet lol and most parties were after a dance, a big football/basketball game, when kids in school extracurricular groups would set up a \u201cget together\u201d (I went to one of those), and graduation parties.\n\nI know it\u2019s easier said than done, but please don\u2019t get too upset about it.  When I was in school, I would get depressed, anxious and FOMO when a party went on and I wasn\u2019t there, but I promise you, you\u2019re not missing anything.  And 9/10, if someone is going on and on about how \u201camazing that party was\u201d, they\u2019re just talking it up and nothing happened, except Becky got plastered and fucked Kyle, who is currently dating Becky\u2019s best friend Taylor and now they have completely fallen out.  You WILL hear about any major drama that happened, because kids spread that shit like wildfire.  Also, a fight probably happened between Kyle and Chad, because Becky is also dating Chad.  And it\u2019s no surprise that Becky cheated on Chad with Kyle, because everyone knows Becky is a huge slut.\n\nLol sorry for the long post.  I just want to assure you that high school parties aren\u2019t that great.  Go to dances, go to football and basketball games (dances and games are where the real fun is), and just do what you think is fun, especially with your friends.

People you meet after high school that you knew are very quickly entirely different people.   \n\nIn life, you\u2019ll be a ton happier if you learn to stop worrying about comparing yourself to anybody else.

How do I know?   \nBecause I am doing it right now and even as an kind of experienced programmer and system admin with quite solid experience in in networking and hardware I still have difficulties since it goes indepth faster than you think.  \nSome things I have never heard of.   \nAnd its a shitload of math. \n\nComputer science is not about gaming, its not about fixing bluescreens and it not about making some shitty HTML pages.   \nIf you go into it with that experience, you will be out faster than you think.   \nI already was amazed by how many people went into a trainee ship for a job like that with such experience and expectations, but going into computer science with such experience and expectations will result in you being kicked out really fucking fast.\n\nAnd yes building your PC is easy, the hard part is choosing the parts, which can be also done with some research or help subreddits like r/buildapc help you a lot. They don't judge you there and answer pretty much all questions as well as help you choose parts that fit into your needs and price range. Just don't expect them to make a miracle, they are bound to the same laws as anyone else.   \nBuilding it self has some difficult steps but even for that there are solid tutorials out there.   \nI personally recommend Gamers Nexus, since they explain most stuff very well and have some good tutorials out there. The age doesn't matter.   \nPCs may look a bit more fancy nowadays with RGB and everything, but the connections, layouts, sizes, formats and what not stayed the same for the most part.  \nAs a beginner it will probably take you 1 to 2 hours if you have no prior knowledge or experience. Depending on how complex your build is that may vary a bit but thats my experience so far with all the people I helped with building their own PC.\n\nDon't worry if it's not all perfect from the get go, most of us still make mistakes too, even if we have build a good amount of PCs.",

            "It\u2019s not that hard, I tell people that and it might make people think I\u2019m smart, but really I just watched a few YouTube videos and used pc part picker for mine. Still had to take it to a pc place only to find out my windows was faulty..which was pretty lame",

In first year, my prof talked about it for maybe 5 mins on the first day.\n\nAnd yes, I've built my own PC. Its basically lego",
            "As someone currently studying computer science I can safely say that building a computer and studying computer science are two (funny enough) completely unrelated skills. Computer science is about math, logic and programming. Assembling a computer is like LEGOs. But you already knew that.",

            "As a teenager who built my own computer when I was 10 and have been programming since I was 11 (I wanted to make Minecraft mods), and hope to get a computer science degree (or some other very computer related degree), I fully agree. I think that it may be slightly easier for me to get a computer science degree than the average person, however I think that's more because I already know multiple programming languages, I expect it to be hard work and require a lot of time and effort to get a Computer Science Degree.\n\nBuilding computers is like complex Legos, playing with Legos doesn't make you an architect or builder.",
            "I built a computer when I was 14. My parents praised me as a computer genius and bragged to our immediate family about it. I thought I was the second coming of Bill Gates. \n\nI am about the least scientifically inclined person you\u2019ll ever meet. I nearly flunked out of my one computer science class freshman year of college. I\u2019m a lawyer in training. Not a tech wiz. \n\nI took the parts out of the box, screwed them in place per the directions in the pamphlet, connected some wires, and hit the power button. It took me two hours. If a 14 year old could do it, anyone can. There\u2019s nothing impressive about it.",
            "Dude I cannot agree with you any more!  I\u2019ve built multiple PCs for profit and I don\u2019t know jack-shit about coding. I\u2019m just a teen with the ability to  use the internet and a need for money, not some Wargames teenage hacking prodigy.",
            "Jesus Christ, I knew this dude in high school that had such a big ego because he built his own computer. I always wanted to call him out on it but never had the confidence to do so. Needless to say I got a kick out of this lmao",

            "Okay.....\n\nThat guy\u2019s got problems.\n\nBut for the majority of PC builders, it is fairly impressive. It takes some time, knowledge of how a pc works, and most importantly FUCKING GOOD CABLE MANAGEMENT to build a pc. It\u2019s not something anybody can just go \u201chey I want to learn this in an hour\u201d\n\nBut yeah you aren\u2019t a computer scientist that\u2019s different.

You mean to tell me that you only call out *some* of the people who built their PC? Why not all? Why any if that's the case? You're being hypocritical by allowing some people to get away with the grand betrayal of yours.",
            "To be fair I have a Bachelor of Computer Science with Specialization in Applied Computing and when I built my PC I broke one fan and other fans on the wrong side of the water cooler on my first attempt. Different people have different natural abilites.",

            "As someone who's built in excess of 20 computers, I'll agree... but it's a little more involved than assembling Ikea furniture.",
            "Companies have brainwashed people into believing building a computer requires computer science degrees and 200 IQ.",
            "THIS. Have no clue why people think it's hard to build a computer. Doing work experience even I was 14 on the first day I was literally told to take it apart, label each part and put it back together. It was easy.",
            "While I agree, that your friend is a douche, what you've said is nonsense.\n\n> There's nothing impressive about 'building' your own car! You're just assembling parts and it doesn't make you a mechanic any more than assembling an ikea desk makes me a carpenter.\n\nThe sentence is transposed to many different things, and it starts to outline how fucked up it is.\n\nDoes building a computer make you some super cool IT guy? No. Is it fun? Cool? And does it involve specific know-how? Yes.\n\nBuilding your own computer is impressive. The vast majority of the global population couldn't do it even with some help.\n\nSo stop bashing people for feeling excited or happy that they can do something many other people can't.\n\nThat's not very bodacious of you.",
            "As a person studying for their MTA (Microsoft Technical Associate) certification, I agree.",

            "I've heard it put this way and its how I will describe it for the rest of my life, building a computer is the adult version of Legos.  Its literally plug this in, snap that into place and aside from the thermal paste, which is also easy as hell, its literally just legos. Although snapping the Motherboard into place is one of the most adrenaline filled moments of my life, that thing just fuckin bends half the time, feels like I'm gonna break it every damn time.",

            "This reminds me of an interview of a nets player I saw the other day. The reporter said he was a genius because he built his own computer and he said it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s like assembling legos and she still acted like it was a big deal. I had to just roll my eyes.",
            "In my opinion the only impressive thing about it is the fact that if you build a computer it usually is pretty good, but the fact that you built it doesn't compare to the fact the computer is like the ones they use at NASA",

We\u2018re talking maths and more maths and algorithms and programming.  Then there is Computer Engineering which might have this in the first weeks.\n\nYour friend will be booted out because he\u2018s playing too many games and not studying enough.",
            "As someone who has built a computer, this aggravates me. While yes, it does take some skill and it's not a trivial task, it doesn't make you a computer scientist. It really annoys me when I meet people who built one computer and suddenly think they're an expert in the field. Though, I will admit, having built your own computer does make it easier to troubleshoot it in my opinion and it is a good way to learn the basics about how modern computers work.\n\nHowever, most of the people I know who have built a computer think it's relatively easy.",

            "100% agree. It's basically expensive Legos. I have friends who are CS majors, and it is not \"easy\" because you can assemble a PC.",
            "I built my own at 14 and I think of it as something normal that anyone could do. If someone gets impressed, In tell them not to be because it's honestly not that impressive. This, I agree with.",
            "It would take the knowledge of the information on what parts of the PC to buy to put together. Like the specs on components etc. I can\u2019t just buy any RAM and any processor etc and expect it to just work because I put it all together. I went through about 8 interviews with google and a couple of those interviews were questions like \u201cwhat type of processor specs would you use for a high performance gaming PC you were building?\u201d It\u2019s not difficult putting together a PC that you have all of the correct components for but building one custom from the mother board up does take some knowledge/skill. IMO",
            "Assembling a computer is fun because it involves researching and understanding what individual computer parts do to a certain extent but literally anyone could do research, its nothing to brag about except maybe over how much fun you had.",
