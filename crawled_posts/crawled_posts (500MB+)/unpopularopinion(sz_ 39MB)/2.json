            "The problem is,  who gets to decide what's false?",
            "Generally speaking, they get away with it by offering opinion shows. Think Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Rachel Maddow, Anderson Cooper, etc. Even their actual reporting uses certain adjectives to influence viewers. A conservative media outlet may say, \u201cExpensive COVID relief bill passes in House.\u201d This isn\u2019t false, but the emphasis on Expensive is what they want the reading to take away. A progressive outlet headline would be something like this: \u201cLifeline to help struggling families passes House.\u201d Again, it isn\u2019t incorrect, but the emphasis is positive and draws the readers attention to being a lifeline, not the cost. \n\nMost large media outlets in the US don\u2019t blatantly peddle absolute fake news, but they present it with a bias. That is fine as long as you know what you are getting. Truthfully, it is nothing new. Media bias has been a thing for a long time. At least as far back as the American revolution there were blatantly bias newspapers that were considered either \u201cloyalist\u201d papers or \u201cpatriot\u201d newspapers. \n\nSo no, we need to cool it with talk of punishment for the press.",
            "Problem is who decides what is false information? \n\nFor the ones who believe false information, information we regard as true is false.\n\nSo it all comes down to who has the authority to determine what's true and what's false: nobody, really. \n\nTruth is a tricky bitch. Does it even exist?",
            "While I agree, the problem is a lot more complex than that.\n\nThe first problem is the rush to be the first to report something. Many companies have thrown reporting standards out the window to be the first to break a story. The result is media that simply reports anything they hear that fits their narrative as fact. No examination or confirmation, often even source free with \"anonymous sources\" cited as the source. In the mad rush to be first, the facts are often left in the dust.\n\nStemming from that is not only a distinct lack of corrections but often no attempt is made to draw attention to the corrections when they are made. \"I'm sorry we got it wrong and reported an unarmed black man was shot in cold blood by six cops and ran it as the top story for two days. It actually was an armed white man who shot six cops before going down in a hail of gunfire. I'll just quietly edit the original story, leave the headline and change the body to address the facts. All better.\" Because why change something getting clicks, we are in it for the advertisers, not the news.\n\nYou also have obvious partisan bias and a refusal to even report on anything that could harm the narrative that particular media company is crafting. This creates such wonderful moments as \"Firey, but mostly peaceful protests.\" And the absolute media silence on people engaging in destruction outside of calling them white supremacists, despite the videos available showing how they are often dressed the same as the protesters who refuse to call them out. Early on there were a couple called out, then it seemed to stop and no one denounced the destruction. Then you have both sides reporting on the election, one loudly shouting there is nothing going on here while the other is shouting about serious shenanigans. The truth might be somewhere in the middle but our betters have stated there was nothing wrong so there is nothing wrong. \n\nThe best thing people can do is refuse to consume news media that fails to adhere to proper reporting standards. Let the companies fall due to their own hubris. But that won't happen. People will flock to whatever tells them that their worldview is correct.",
            "Yeah, unethical behavior from the media is a big problem now. You go to whatever site or channel you want to see the news politicized however you prefer, but everyone knows you can't trust any of it.",

            "This is not an unpopular opinion.\n\n\nI don't disagree but it will never happen. Who will punish them?\n\nThe government? The government, given the allowance, will happily punish media for publishing things they don't like and calling it false even when it's true. And while this might suit you fine with the current government party, you have to consider that one day a party with which you disagree will be in power.\n\nThe viewers? Viewers could absolutely stop watching news that is false, lowering ratings BUT people will flock to what they believe is the truth/suits their beliefs even if it's false. \n\nA third party? A third party is still going to be made up of human beings who hold bias, whether they want to admit it or not (see police, judges, attorneys, politicians etc.) and will then punish media they disagree with even if it is true.\n\nAn AI or algorithm? Also a tool that will be made by human beings and therefore biased. Even if you could manage to remove the bias -which is impossible currently- that could be very dangerous.\n\nThe problem is that individuals are ignorant, sometimes willfully, or lazy, or apathetic or do not have the tools or a combination or maybe something else entirely.  They do not take the time to do the necessary research -not a Google search- to really understand the topics, and their nuances, that media is discussing. Media is somewhat a problem but the bigger problem is the consumers of that media.\n\n\n**TL;DR** media is only a tiny bit of the problem. The bigger problem is the consumers of said media.",
            "Not a good idea. Take India as an example. The government has done just this and uses it to harass people like Rajdeep sardesai (who criticises them) when even a minor mistake happens. Doesn\u2019t even need to be that actually. The guy literally said that the family of a guy \u2018alleged\u2019 that the police had shot the guy dead and when it turned out false they went after him. Even though he had only reported what the family said. Also even the best intentioned news organisations will make mistakes sometimes and the people in power will always use this rule to harass them while leaving alone the people they like.",

            "A large portion of the societal problems we're experiencing today, especially when it comes to the growing political divide, is a consequence of news organizations changing their business model to benefit from social media.\n\nWith the rise of social media news organizations moved from trying to be a destination that people would go to on the internet, or a subscription service people would pay for, to being something that would be shared through social media. It turns out that the best way to get something to go viral is to outrage people, so news organizations started cherry picking and distorting facts to create maximum outrage over a story. \n\nProbably the most obvious example of this are the stories of police brutality because the narrative of police officer abusing his power to commit murder for racist reasons is generally offensive to everyone. The problem is that these are the only stories about policing that are published, the only facts that are published by a large portion of news organization are those that support this narrative, and people are uninformed about factors that could result in reasonable doubt for a jury in a trial. The net result is that the media works people up into a frenzy when the event happens (leading to rioting), then the jury fails to convict the police officer for reasons the general public are uninformed about, and then the media works people up into a frenzy a second time (leading to rioting).",

            "Thank you for making this post so visible, despite it not being unpopular in my opinion. I had this same questions a few weeks ago. \n\nThe reason this is so prevalent nowadays is because the FCC decided to revoke the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. I am on mobile, so forgive me for not knowing how to hyperlink in a comment. I copy and pasted the important pieces (in my opinion, please read it for yourself) of the link below. \n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Fairness-Doctrine\n\nSummary of a very short read:\n\n\u201cFairness doctrine, U.S. communications policy (1949\u201387) formulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that required licensed radio and television broadcasters to present fair and balanced coverage of controversial issues of interest to their communities, including by devoting equal airtime to opposing points of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 1949 the commission promulgated a report, In the Matter of Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees, that interpreted the public interest provisions of the Radio Act and the Communications Act as a mandate to promote \u201ca basic standard of fairness\u201d in broadcasting. Licensees had the duty to devote airtime to fair and balanced coverage of controversial issues that were of interest to their home communities. Individuals who were the subject of editorials or who perceived themselves to be the subject of unfair attacks in news programming were to be granted an opportunity to reply. Also, candidates for public office were entitled to equal airtime.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fairness doctrine was never without its opponents, however, many of whom perceived the equal airtime requirement as an infringement of the right to freedom of speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution. In 1969 the doctrine survived a challenge in the Supreme Court case Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, in which the court found that the FCC had acted within its jurisdiction in ruling that a Pennsylvania radio station had violated the fairness doctrine by denying response time to a writer who had been characterized in a broadcast as a communist sympathizer.\u201d \n\n\u201cIn 1985, however, the FCC decided that the doctrine had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d upon freedom of speech.\u201d After this, cable networks decided to challenge whether the doctrine was applicable to television. \n\n\u201cIn 1987 the FCC formally repealed the fairness doctrine but maintained both the editorial and personal-attack provisions, which remained in effect until 2000. In addition, until they were finally repealed by the commission in 2011, more than 80 media rules maintained language that implemented the doctrine.\u201d \n\nBasically, the mandate for it was removed.",

            "Punished by who? And for what? The code of ethics that journalists abide by is not a legally binding code. If journalists do something that is actually illegal, of course they\u2019ll be prosecuted for that. But just doing something unethical or reporting something that wasn\u2019t true by mistake or being very biased in your reporting is not grounds for them to be \u201cpunished.\u201d\n\nEveryone agrees that good journalists should be ethical and objective in their reporting. That\u2019s not controversial. What I take issue with is the idea that they should be punished for something unethical - that goes directly against the 1st amendment.

The best and only real viable punishment comes in subscribership, or lack thereof.\n\nIts not the first time in history that journalism was a general shitshow. As before, it\u2019s on the journalism trade to clean up its act and find standards again. Not an easy task in the Information Age where anyone with a keyboard can claim to be a journalist, and the most salacious and emotionally triggering headlines get the attention. News outlets gotta get paid too, and rightfully scared of losing their monopoly on public thought to independent journalists. Some with no journalistic standards at all.

            "Back in the \"good ol' days of American broadcast TV (and radio) news, no news anchor could render an opinion about any news story unless it was clearly marked on the screen as an \"Editorial.\" Walter Cronkite used to do these occasionally, but during the news itself, everything was straight information. What happened, where, when, and even why, but the why had to be purely fact-based, such as quoting an expert, a respected survey, or an investigative report.\n\nAlso, the broadcast channels in the US were bound by the FCC's Fairness Doctrine, which essentially stated that any political candidate who was featured on air must be followed by equal time for the opposition party candidate. But this wasn't just for candidates. Networks did this for any political opinion expressed at all. 60 Minutes once had a segment during their hour-long show called \"Point/Counterpoint,\" where two people of opposing views would go back and forth, uninterrupted, to speak their views. As an example, Donald Trump would have never had the wall-to-wall coverage he got in 2016 if the Fairness Doctrine applied to all broadcast and cable news stations.\n\nBroadcast TV news and radio hated the Fairness Doctrine because it was very inconvenient to always have to keep track of which politician got what amount of time. And it was easy to run afoul of the FCC. So, starting with President Reagan, the Fairness Doctrine was repealed, and we haven't had it ever since. \n\nBroadcast cable news, like CNN, were never bound by the Doctrine, but in the 1980s, the practice of balanced news was a part of the news DNA. Which is why they had \"Crossfire,\" a live, more antagonistic version of Point/Counterpoint. (Which at one point was co-hosted by a bow-tie wearing Tucker Carlson.)\n\nNow, there is no law preventing a channel like Fox News or MSNBC from being a shill for one party. There is no law preventing our current \"opinion-based news\" seen on every channel. And the only ones policing the censoring of children's faces, or freely reporting false information, is the channels themselves. There's no Snopes for TV news channels, unless you go to Snopes.com and they happen to cover the transgression. \n\nI'm afraid that any effort to curtail the news channels now will be decried as censorship and shackling the freedom of news gatherers.",

It came to light that she likes being whipped until her ass looks like roast beef. I mean black... bleeding... like \"you need a doctor\" severe. I won't describe more than that, but you get what I'm saying. Now, I'm far from the kind of guy who is going to say \"Get on your knees and pray to Jesus, young lady, until God fixes you and your tastes are wholesome and righteous.\" I'm kind of a freak myself, so I don't take that tack, but this was way past the out edge of anything I have done, could do, or want to do even in the kinkiest mindset. \n\nI had to wonder why some people feel a sexual desire for things which literally go against their human biology, that - by any metric - qualify as literal torture. This is treatment which, when done under different conditions, causes life-long psychological trauma and PTSD (never mind the physical effects). As a very sex and kink-positive person I hesitated to ask the question: Is something wrong if you seek a form of treatment that healthy, well-adjusted people seek to escape? Can you say it's okay if you want someone to injure you so badly that your skin is literally coming off?\n\nAnd to dig deeper: What does it mean if you're someone who wants to inflict it? If you are aroused to imagine yourself restraining someone and hurting them so bad that they scream and cry and carry what any medical professional would call serious abrasions and lacerations? If you saw it done in a movie, the character doing it would always be the villain and/or the psycho and everyone in the audience would know it. What does it mean if you want to be that person... to inflict so much pain that you would literally be charged with torture?\n\nI'm not trying to shame anyone. I'm not trying to make anyone feel guilty. I certainly don't want anyone to hate themselves.

They're made to be easy to put together. \n\nAnd I freely admit that I tend to have spatial problems sometimes, like I can't part my hair while looking in a mirror because I'll brush the wrong way.

Or the unfinished side?)\n\nWith that said, almost every basic product they sell is very easy to understand and assemble, but when you get to their bigger/pricier stuff is where it gets confusing. \n\nMost people would have much more trouble assembling anything bought off Amazon, I think Ikea just gets hated on because it's become the cool thing to do at this point",

Justice systems around the world know that witnesses are unreliable.

        "selftext": "A few months ago, while walking my dog outside, an off leash dog approached. What was only probably 5 seconds felt like a lifetime. This off leash husky ran over, with his owner about 30 FT away,  attacked my greyhound in the jugular, stomach, butt, and all four legs. After the attack, my husband walked our dog to the nearest vet, as blood pumped with every beat from my dogs chest. For 3 tenths of a mile the sidewalk was covered in blood and all the while the other dog owner kept saying \"shes so friendly, she never does this.\" He continued to say that to the vet and the police. My dog was in emergency surgery and was bit 3 veins off the jugular. He was so close to not making it and I was stuck with a $6000 bill that I had to pay if I wanted him to live. No the other dog owner didn't pay, and I have to go through the trouble of suing him. \nThere are leash laws for a reason. I don't care if your dog is \"friendly\" and \"well behaved\". Put it on a leash. If something happens, you're entirely at fault. \nI now carry a taser after what happened. Keep your dog safe, and keep them on a leash. People like me are out there, with tasers, ready to protect their dog. Be responsible. Its literally the easiest thing you can do.\n    \nEDIT: Wow, thank you for the awards. Thank you everyone who sent me warm messages. I didn't expect this to take off like it did and I'm so happy with the response. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n\n\nPhoto of my dog after surgery from the attack NSFW:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gQYLqRv.jpg \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/khSESuz.jpg\n\n\nMy dog right before his stitches came out, almost fully recovered: https://i.imgur.com/TleXHz6.jpg",

            "My dog used to be friendly, until he was attacked by an off leash dog, he wasn't hurt, infect he scared the other dog off, however, because he was just attacked while we were minding our own business, he is now aggressive to other dogs and I have to be very careful when I walk him. I don't walk him in public places anymore and it's really sad.",
            "Before I moved, I lived in a neighborhood where a woman would just let her German Shepherd outside, not on any kind of lead. She doesn't have a fence of any kind either. I guess she thought she had trained the dog so well that he would never leave their yard. \n\nWell, stupid me, one morning I was walking down the gas station, and went by her house, not thinking about that dog. I heard a growl, and then looked up to see a fully grown shepherd running at me from the side of their house, teeth exposed and ready to take me out. Luckily this time she decided to join him outside. She called him back and said something lame like, \"Sorry. He's just a little territorial\". Lady. This is a public sidewalk. It's just a matter of time before someone gets bit.",

            "This also drives me crazy.  I don't know how many times I've been out in horseback to have a dog come running up from around the bend in the road barking with an owner coming around saying \"he's a good boy, he won't hurt you\"\n\nYeah fine and dandy, I'm not afraid of dogs, but my horse might be and I don't feel like getting bucked off when he tries to run away or have to argue with you about \"my crazy horse hurting your dog\" if he decides to defend himself and kicks, stomps or bites your dog.  Sorry but your dog won't win against a 1200 pound horse with steel shoes in full defence mode.",
            "I had to fight off a German Sheppard. I was incredibly lucky, I saw the dog charging in for attack and acted quickly my old girl only got 9 stitches. My council's laws make the attacking dog owner pay and I had witnesses.\n\nI can only carry dog pepper spray in my country. If an off leash dog approaches I just spray them now. I'm not putting my little old lady through that again. It's mostly citronella and does no harm the dog. People have yelled at me but there's leash laws for a reason.\n\nI fostered a greyhound to go from racing kennel to house-trained, they are a beautiful breed.",

            "I agree, my dog is well behaved but I will never walk with him without a leash unless he's on private property while there aren't any dogs nearby. Not only can't I see what dogs without a leash are going to do if my dogs ends up being uncomfortable with them approaching him, they also bother me when delivering mail, where I either get humped or I almost stand on a chihuahua's back.",

            "I agree 100%. It's infuriating when irresponsible dog owners let their dogs just charge at a leashed dog. I also hate people with flexi-leashes who let their dogs walk 15 meters in front of them with no means of having any control over them. Other than the unpleasantry of having an uncontrolled dog in my dogs space, the razor thin leash is a tangle hazard and causes serious problems. If people could just give each other some space and be more respectful a lot of biting incidents could be avoided.",
            "When I was in a car to go to the pet shop the other day, I saw somebody with an off lead dog walking right by the road. The road is incredibly busy and I wouldn\u2019t even trust my on lead dog by it. My mind was completely at a loss at how people could be so idiotic as to trust their dog by such a busy road. And what really bothers me? If an accident did end up happening, the dog owner would surely blame the driver for what happened. Really bothers me and I feel so much for the dog.",
            "There\u2019s a mile long cycle lane I use to get to and from work every day. The other half is for pedestrians. There are always people walking their dogs there without a lead, and the dogs often wander into the cycle lane. One time this happened and I ended up crashing and had a huge cut down my face which meant I had trouble eating and talking for weeks while it healed. I know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s had this problem on this cycle lane. It\u2019s ridiculous and has left me with a slight fear of dogs, which really upsets me as a I love dogs. I just wish these dog owners would be more responsible!",

            "This is also true for people who have dogs that don't like other dogs. My husband's old rescue HATED other dogs. Although she never attacked any dog, we had a feeling she would if she got close enough. Regardless of how friendly your dog is, keeping it on a leash protects it from running up to unfriendly leashed dogs. My husband would have to pick up the 50lb dog and desperately try to get away from the off leash dog. People would give us dirty looks like \"my dog wasn't going to hurt her\". So annoying. We did that to protect your dog.",

            "Poor pup! I\u2019m so sorry about your dog. That sounds gruesome and brutal. \n\nI\u2019m definitely not trying to minimize your story but THIS becomes even crazier when you have children.\n\nThe other day, I took my two year old for a walk. This dog was running all around the block, barking at other dogs, and being a little menace. \n\nI decided to pick up my son and carry him...which is my fucking prerogative. This woman starts yelling at me from her driveway.... \u201cITS OKAY! HE WONT HURT ANYONE.\u201d\n\nFirst of all... you can\u2019t promise that. Stories like this are a great reminder that they are ANIMALS. You do not have control of your unleashed dog.\n\nSecond... I didn\u2019t say shit about your dog, so why don\u2019t you mind your own business when it comes to how I\u2019m caring for my child?\n\nAnd last... I get this a lot from dog owners. Whenever I\u2019m teaching my son to be cautious around dogs, the owners seem so offended. \u201cOh he\u2019s a NICE dog!!\u201d they say. Which, okay, sure, but I don\u2019t know that. And I\u2019m not being rude or hurting your dog\u2019s feelings by looking out for my kid....\n\nTLDR: If I don\u2019t want my kid to be around your dog, get over it.",
            "My dog is an ass. He is always on a leash because he is an ass. He has a yellow warning ribbon on his leash because he will bite the face off your dog if it runs up to him. I don't care how nice or friendly your dog is...my dog is an ass...I keep him on a leash to protect your dog from him. If you don't keep your dog on a leash and he gets his face bitten off by my dog it's not my fault and the law agrees with me.",

            "I HATE when people say their dog is friendly as it is running up to me and my GSD who is on a leash. Before we paid for private training Stella was fear aggressive and would bark, hackles raised at any dog within three blocks. But I had her on a leash (never long than 4' either) always and could control her. What I can't control is one someone's friendly dog walks up to mine because they are off leash. I no longer have control of what my dog will do because I can't keep her away from the other dog. So frustrating. So even if the off-leash dog is friendly, on leash dogs might not be and need the separation.",
            "I agree people trust their dogs way to much, dogs are animals and will do unpredictable things. Hypothetically even if their dog was somehow perfect and didnt do that I get very mad when a friendly off leash dog walks by me  when Im walking my dog because even though my dog is very nice and has never even done as much as show his teeth to a human an overly friendly dog stresses him out a lot. I can pull him away because he is only 30 pounds but the owner of the other dog also needs to do their part by keeping their dog under control too. I can gt my dog under control and stop the situation from escelating if they pull their dog away too.",

            "I have the opposite problem. There are a bunch of little dogs in my neighborhood, and my 120 pound Akita (which were bred for bear hunting in japan) could easily kill them. Not even being aggressive, but just by playing he could accidentally kill them. It's not ok to worry about my dog killing another dog just because you weren't responsible enough to keep your dog on a leash/in your yard.",
            "Totally agree. I was walking my neighbors dog in a public park, and then this unleahed dog ran up to \u201cmy\u201d dog. They started doing the normal stuff dogs did I guess, and then out of nowhere the other dog attacked \u201cmy\u201d dog. The fight scared me so much when the fight went down the sidewalk, I just let go of the leash. Thankfully \u201cmy\u201d dog ran away and up the neighborhood road me and the neighbors live on, and had sprinted to my house. Owner kept saying \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d, I asked him to help me look for my dog, he didn\u2019t care. He still didn\u2019t put his dig in a leash after that.",

It's just me this lady and her dog on this nature trail with no one else around. So I commit and give the lady a wide berth when I run passed her, I'm looking at her dog and back at her and back to her dog, and the dog was thankfully just happily panting along and didn't see me as a threat, but it was still terrifying.

My dog is the most soppy, friendly dog I've ever met in my life (11yr old AlsatianXCollie) and she loves any form of attention, but shes also a massive black dog, why are so many parents ok with their kids coming straight up to fuss her without asking me first?

            "It just is the considerate thing to do. Those people who don't leash their dogs I have to wonder how they got so arrogant, selfish, or oblivious that they don't see they are at least causing others anxiety and possibly causing real harm if something happened. It is like they think the world is all for them and that they know everything and what anyone else feels doesn't matter. \n\nSo yeah, unleashed dogs (especially anything larger than a lap dog) kind of tick me off.",

If he gets curious about a tree while we're in the woods I don't want him losing his footing and falling down a huge dropoff and breaking his legs.\n\nLeashes aren't just about if a dog is vicious and needs restrained. It's about *your* dog's safety as well as those around you.\n\nAnd yes he's on a harness, not a collar. Not trying to break my dude's neck.",

            "Any proper husky owner should know that *no* husky is \u201coff leash trained\u201d. They are one of the highest prey-driven breeds of dogs and have been known to kill human children with their excitement/high energy drive. Any person that walks a husky off leash - at least without some sort of training enforcer like an e-collar - has no idea what they\u2019re talking about and they should not be owning huskies. \n\nHuskies are bred from one of the hardest working breed of dogs, *and* they\u2019re distant descendants of wolves. They need to vent out the energy they have in a safe way. Walking off leash is a recipe for disaster: all it takes is one animal to trigger that unstoppable prey drive. Anything a husky considers prey is fair game to them, and *nothing* will stop them from getting what they want. This person was ignorant and stupid as fuck for even thinking otherwise. Dogs get mad about shit that humans don\u2019t get, and you can\u2019t stop dogs from getting unreasonably angry at another dog - but you can control that behavior with leashes and training. \n\nSource: lived in a house with a husky that I helped train/married to a man who grew up with only huskies",

I was coming out to take him one walk one day. This dog came flying down the street and jumped on him. He outweighs him by at least 50 pounds. Without thinking, I tried to pull him off my dog. My hands and arms got all bit up and my baby ended up with bites all over his face and neck. He is a rescue former bait dog, so he just played dead. Didn't fight back. I'm desperately leaning on this dog's lungs to try and make him release. She's standing there screaming at me that I'm hurting her dog! On my property! When I finally separated them, she continues to scream at me. I'm dripping blood. He's dripping blood. I'm carrying him to my car. Her dog is totally fine. I ended up with a $1,000 vet bill. My insurance covered my care.  Her husband came over to see how we were later on and paid the bill. She never apologized.  In the past month, my Ring has caught her 5 times walking her dog down the street without a leash. My dog and I still have healing scars all over. I just sent the Ring videos to the dog control officer. Some people are so self important and disgusting!",

If your precious German Shepard or pitbull attacks me or mine, I'm shooting the bastard until it ceases to breathe. \n\nI will NOT be mauled by a dog again just because some lazy ass owner lacks the brain cells necessary to leash their freaking animal. /End rant. \n\nI am also so sorry about your dog. My advice is to sue her if for no other reason than principle. The only way she'll learn is to eat the finanical cost of her poor decision. Or petition to have her dog marked as vicious so if it ever attacks again it'll be put down. I'd give her the choice. Pony up or risk fido taking a long sleep.",
            "The irony here it's that most of (if not all) owners of well behaved dogs have them on leash.\n\n I'm a rookie dog trainer, and I have my dog trained. The only public place in which I have him off leash is on a big forest that's in front of my house. This went on for a year until some weeks ago a guy walked by the street passing the front of my house. I couldn't stop my dog from barking and approaching the guy. He wasn't going to bite him or anything, he was notoriously scared. But the guy doesn't know that, he only knows that a 40kg Weimaraner is barking and going at him.\n\n I believed my dog had a impecable recall and was socialized perfectly. Yet he did that, totally on me. What I'm trying to say is that even someone with some training background like myself have problems controlling their dogs by misreading a situation, anybody can. So for that people having their dogs off leash, don't. Your dog is probably the sweetest cutie pie in the world, but might approach another dog that is not.",

I was getting ready to leave and heard a thud against the door, so I open it up and see two pit bulls on top of my cat trying to bite and kill him. He doesn't attack other animals that are his size/larger, he doesn't even attack our other cat who tries to hurt him. I punched and kicked the dogs, they didn't move, but I did manage to let my cat bite my arm and cling on and I pulled him out of the mess before he realized it was me. I put him out of the dogs reach and scared them off before they could catch him again. We spent 20 minutes getting him out of the tree and I have scars from the puncture wounds he gave me.\n\nHe wasn't hurt much at all, I had a wound that needed to be covered for about a week and luckily wasn't infected, and the dogs ran off and I haven't seen them again. However, when ever I hear a dog barking it makes me freak out. This was 3 years ago and I still can't hear a dog bark without feeling like I'm in some kind of danger. I used to love hearing a friendly bark but now I can't. All because some idiots left their dogs off a leash.\n\nNot but a few weeks ago, a dog ran up to me barking while I was riding my bike, I couldn't tell if it was on a leash. It didn't come closer after I fell off my bike and I didn't *see* a leash. Lucky me, my brakes got locked in place and the bike couldn't move. So I had to carry it home thinking about a dog running up behind me and attacking.\n\nSorry for the rant but I strongly agree here.",

            "I know this will probably get lost in all the comments, but I think it\u2019s also very important to note that you can\u2019t just keep your dog on a leash or rope of some kind. You need to make sure that what you\u2019re using is strong enough to hold your dog, and if you\u2019ve tied your dog to a post or something, you cannot leave it unsupervised.\n\nAround five years ago, my family went camping and we brought our two mini labradoodles with us. Towards the end of the trip, my mom and dad were walking the dogs while us kids played in the pool at the campground. Suddenly, we heard a huge commotion and all ran over to where our parents were. A dog, I\u2019m not sure what breed, had been left tied to a post, unsupervised, and when he saw our dogs he tore away from the post, snapping the rope in the process, and attacked the younger one. My mom had to restrain our older dog, who treats our younger one like her baby, while my dad attempted to pry the attacking dog off of our younger dog. He was successful, though he got bit multiple times in the process, and then my parents had to rush our younger dog to the nearest veterinary center, leaving me, a 13 year old at the time, to take care of two younger siblings, their friends, and our older dog in the cabin we had rented.\n\nOur younger dog ended up being fine. We were extremely lucky because my mom normally walked the dogs alone while we were on that trip. If my dad hadn\u2019t been there, our dog would have died. This was still incredibly traumatic for all of us involved, and it now takes our younger dog a very long time to stop being scared of new dogs she meets, even if they\u2019re significantly smaller than her.\n\nPoint being, keeping your dog on a leash is extremely important, but please also make sure that your dog isn\u2019t strong enough to snap it in half.",

So he just stands there unaware if someone is coming down the street.  The dog will see someone far sooner than he will realize.   Luckily nothing has happened yet.

If you startle a dog, its no longer a matter of \u201ctypical behavior\u201d.    \nI have a small pit bull.  Once she was frightened of something (i can\u2019t remember what) then my other dog startled her and she bit him.  She was not trying to tear at him or gnash her teeth.  But she couldn\u2019t let go.  I could see in her eyes that she was not in attack mode but scared instead.  You could tell she didn\u2019t realize what was going on.  We had to get her to relax before she was able to let go.  This dog has always been a big fat marshmallow.......but you never know.  I tell my kids not to put their face in hers.  Not because i think she might attack, but because I\u2019m scared something else could startle her at that exact moment.  It only takes once.  .  So yes,  you never know what a dog is capable of so please keep it on a leash.   Also, be careful if you live in the hood.

She was going after another dog (daycare setting) and she got my hand instead of the other dogs throat. The bit would have likely killed the other dog. I still need surgery on my left hand.

She's really sweet around people and for some reason our other dog, but for any other dogs she's extremely violent and will attack them. Because of this we take extra precautions when we walk her. She will never be off leash ever and she will never get to go to a dog park. I don't know how many off leash dogs have ran up to her, and I have to pick up this 60 pound dog to avoid having her attack.

            "This is terrifying to me, but the other way around. \n\nI live at an apartment complex and I own two pitbulls. Both very sweet girls, but also still animals nonetheless. I would **never** let them off a leash in a non-fenced area with dogs they don't know. BUT - several owners here let their dogs off leashes, and it's mostly Yorkies. Obviously, little Yorkie isn't going to do any damage, but *if a Yorkie snaps at my dog, or attempts to attack, I still have a pitbull that will kill that dog in seconds*. The Yorkies have ran up to us a few times and they most just bark from like a foot away, but I am *so* not afraid to kick that dog before it can get closer. \n\nNot to mention, people let their dogs off leashes in the confined stairwell. We live on the third floor, so you can imagine my anxiety that a dog could come bolting up and just attack my dog (it's nearly happened before, I have an anxiety attack like everyday because of it).",
            "I had this happen to me too. A teenager let their 65lb family pit bull out without a leash or collar. I was finishing up a walk with my 35lb border collie mix on a leash. Unfortunately it saw us (across the street and three doors down from its house!) before I saw it. It bolted for us, attacked my dog, and in the process bit me. Both of us ended up going to the hospital. \n\nThe only thing that got that dog away from us was a large dose of mace directly to its face, TWICE. The second time I sprayed it, I didn\u2019t stop until it ran away. Mace is now a permanent ornament on my dog\u2019s leash.\n\nThe family still tried to tell me it was always such a \u201cnice and loving\u201d dog that has never attacked another dog or person before. They had the audacity to suggest that I pay to get their dog back from the shelter (it was on a 2 week hold after the incident because (surprise, surprise) it didn\u2019t have ANY of its required vaccinations and the shelter had to verify that it didn\u2019t have rabies).\n\nAt the end of the day, we don\u2019t understand the nuances of animal behavior. Dogs communicate with one another in ways we don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t observe.

When I opened the door, the dog ran outside and attacked our dog (maltese).\n\nSince my roommate had friends over, they didn't give two shits, just drinking beer and whatever.  They were trying to blame us that it was our fault it happened (and kept their stance).  They were all ganging up on us, defending the friend.  One of then commented (along the lines) that I should be more prepared and take responsibility for having a small dog cause something like this could happen.  Never been more angry in my life.  We had to take the dog to 24 hr emergency (was at night).  They didn't want to pay (and at the time I was willing to go half) but they didn't want to at all.  After reading up on shit, talking with others and hearing more of their shit, it was 100% their fault and wasn't going to accept anything less than 100% of the payment. Eventually they paid us back after months of arguing and frustration.   They even mentioned they had issues with their dog before.  Their eventual reason for paying was that court wouldn't look favorable on pit bulls, not that they were in the wrong.  It never got to court.\n\nLuckily she ended up okay.  Sometimes dogs are dogs, and you can be mad at a dog.   But people are far, far worse.  Don't let them get away with their shit.",

During a run in the park, I literally climbed a tree to get out of the path of 2 off-leash dogs fighting to the death. It was absolutely terrifying. The sounds they make when they intend to kill are hellish. The screams of the humans in the park were gut-wrenching. Once their owners separated them, I hauled ass out of there. No way was I gonna be a witness to the police for either of them---BOTH dogs were off leash. Another time I got chased by a large dog with bared teeth, growling/rage barking, and raised hackles who escaped his yard while I was on a run. He was snapping at my thighs (where the arteries are of course). Ended up defending myself with a razor scooter somebody's kid left in a front  yard. Clocked him good and ran faster than I knew I could. No idea what happened to the dog. He was gone when the police/animal control got to where I bashed him with the scooter.

            "Keeping them on a leash isn't enough. You Have to train a dog rigorously. I had a German shepherd who was a rescue.  First I  trained him to sit, then stay as I walked away. Got to the point where I could walk to 30 feet and he wouldn't  come until I told him. I also trained him to walk with a leash.  You do this by training them to leave slack on the leash, no tugging, and you train him to listen to your voice, not to need the restraint. He would walk beside me, then I would tell him to stay, drop the leash, and walk away then call him to me.  You start out in your yard or an empty park, and then escalate the training until you are doing it in a busy park with people all around. You train them that your voice IS the leash.  That way you should still have some control if you lose the leash somehow. You give them treats and praise when they do it correctly and you admonish them in a deep voice when they make a mistake. Also do not physically reprimand your dog EVER.  If you beat your dog expect him to be violent at some point in his life. Socialize your dog often, ensuring that he is used to all ages and kinds of people and understands that when your out of the house that he is to be nice to everyone. You give them an abundance of love and they will return it. If you don't have time to do all this training you dont have time to own a dog. \n\nIf you think you have to train your dog to be aggressive you are wrong.  They will be more protective and they will exhibit aggressive behaviors when appropriate if you show them unconditional love. \n\n\nNo one bothers to train dogs anymore.

They were all barking but they were like shiz-tzus but there were so many and they just nipped at my ankles and the owner just casually walked up and grabbed all fuckin 6 of em and she\u2019s like, sorry about that.

            "I absolutely fucking agree. I love dogs. Love em. But but it\u2019s obnoxious when people don\u2019t put them on a goddamn leash. First of all there\u2019s a significant percentage of the population that is scared of dogs or just doesn\u2019t want anything to do with them. You have to respect this and assume everyone is like this when training your dog to be in public. \nSecond, your dog is not as well trained as you fucking think. Everyone thinks that their dog is well behaved but they let them have way too much freedom when they\u2019re adorable puppies so now your dog that doesn\u2019t bite people and sometimes listens when you call will bark super loud when it wants something and yelling at it in English doesn\u2019t help, stupid.\nNo to go off on a rant here, but I worked at a dog friendly brewery in Colorado for a couple years and people were UNBELIEVABLE with their dog behavior. Not only are they not attentive but they really don\u2019t give a shit when they get a couple beers in them. Jesus Christ. Leash up your dog you assholes.

            "I don\u2019t trust my dog as far as I can throw him. I love him, but he\u2019s got a mind of his own and stubborn too with a lot of pride and ego. Most of the time he\u2019s really good with other dogs, but I\u2019ve seen him when he meets a dog he doesn\u2019t like or another dog does something he doesn\u2019t like and he can become very aggressive. It got to a point of paranoia on my part where I didn\u2019t let him meet any dog that wasn\u2019t at least 50lbs (he\u2019s 75) and female (he\u2019s male and got neutered as early as is recommended). He\u2019s a good boy, he\u2019s very nice and loves people and most dogs, and I\u2019ve since relaxed on letting him at least meet smaller dogs and male dogs. Would I *ever* let him off his leash? Absolutely fucking not. I don\u2019t even take him to dog parks anymore cuz he\u2019s so damn prideful that if another dog\u2019s bothering him for god knows what reason he might get aggressive. Ironically he never starts any sort of engagement, but I wouldn\u2019t say he has ever \u2018lost\u2019 one either. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine how horrible I would feel if my dog hurt another persons dog or, god forbid, another person (unless they\u2019re robbing or attacking me, then he can have at it). It\u2019s wildly irresponsible letting your dog off the leash in a public place, and even in \u2018controlled\u2019 environments like dog parks you should know your dog well enough if they\u2019ll behave or if that\u2019s simply not an activity you can do with your specific dog. \n\nIt just boils down to being considerate and not being ignorant or negligent.",
            "My cat, Hobbes, was brutally killed about 6 years ago by two dogs off leash that their owner was running with on the strand near my parent's home. Cat was just sitting in the front yard, suddenly this asshat runs by with his two dogs and they just straight up over our wall and start attacking. Hobbes obviously didn't last long against two large dogs, and he swore up and down they were safe, and friendly, and all that shit. At that point I'd gotten a baseball bat from the house and warned him that if he and the dogs weren't gone in ten seconds there was going to be a lot more violence.\n\nNot my proudest moment, for sure, and the threat was too extreme. That said, if you're a dog owner and you let your pet roam free, fuck you. You are extremely self-centered and inconsiderate.",

I never walk my dog off leash but one time he saw another dog who was barking at him and the sudden strong jerk of him trying to run to the other pulled the leash out of my hand.

            "An old friend who delivers and has dogs gave me this advice to deal with charging dog. To paraphrase\n\n*Do not turn and flee. Back away slowly if possible. If you have time and something several feet long point it at the dog to keep it at a distance and move away to the side always facing the dog (turn and it will bite your legs, arms, etc.). If you have something in your hands like a grocery bag, hold it at the dogs eye level out in front of you between you and the dog like bait. It will fixate and attack it and as it does give the hardest kick you can to its chest or uppercut to its head with your foot to knock it back. The surprise hit from no where will get it to back off, but it's still a threat and you can usually side step away using the bag to parry or repeated alternating kicking motions to keep it at bay. If the dog is close enough to kick, it is close enough to be a bite threat.*\n\n*She has been bit before by dogs that snuck up from behind or when there was more than one and always calls animal control (police) to the scene. I saw her left forearm swollen up like a baseball under the skin (she said she was looking at her scanner in her left hand). Always report any encounter. A biting dog goes into rabies quarantine at the expense of the owner, and a is put down if there is a second occurrence. Attacking a human is person crime. Dispatching an animal is a property crime, but not if in self-defense. The next victim could be a child chasing a stray ball, whose face is level with a large dog's mouth.*\n\n*Bite wounds can be very serious and rabies shot protocols painful. Even if the dog has had its shots, its mouth can be dirty from just chewing on a dead rabid squirrel. You don't have symptoms until it reaches your brain and is then* ***fatal*** *.*",

It might have been the most loveliest soft hearted friendly dog but I did not know that and I wasn\u2019t going to wait to see if it bit my girl first to find out! AITA?",
            "I keep my dog on a leash because I don't want him to be hurt. He is VERY friendly, but that can be his downfall. He has next to zero dog manners and will run face first into another dog to say 'hello,' and will often start trying to initiate play before they are ready. He's still a puppy and while he IS figuring it out, he isn't quite there yet.   \n\n\nHe is also a herding breed, and no matter how hard I've tried to break him of the habit, when he gets excited he heel nips. If he wants someone to come play, he will likely run after then and try to herd them home. Even if he doesn't know them from Adam. It's really embarrassing and has scared people before. I would hate for someone to accuse him of being aggressive, because he's anything but. But heck, I would be scared too if a random dog came biting the backs of my legs!",
            "Another thing is that other dogs may not be friendly. My dog is one of them. For some reason, he cannot be around other dogs whatsoever and training will not make a difference. We believe it might be due to trauma prior to us adopting him. We choose to keep our dog within our house and when we do take him on walks, he is on a tight leash.

        "selftext": "There is no legitimate reason why best animated film is going to Disney every single year, almost without fail, since the award was invented in 2001. 2017 is probably the best example for this. The two greatest animated films that year were Loving Vincent and the Breadwinner. Loving Vincent was revolutionary in terms of medium, having each frame be a full oil painting. It also told a beautiful story and the cinematography was magnificent. Breadwinner was also a magnificent story about a Middle Eastern girl searching for her father. Either of these films should have won best animated picture, but they didn't. They lost to Coco. Don't get me wrong, Coco was good, almost great even. But it was nowhere near as revolutionary nor as important a story as Loving Vincent or the Breadwinner. Coco won simply because it was Disney Pixar. The only reason Disney is winning every year is because they are overrated and super well known, whereas these other films are indie films. But the best picture shouldn't go to a film because of the company that produces it, but rather because of the quality and importance of the films itself. Indie films and 2d animated films continually get stumped by Disney for best animated picture. In fact, only once did a 2d film win, and only once did a foreighn film win, and that one time for both of those was when Spirited Away won in 2002. Never again has a 2d or foreign film won, and never has an indie film won. \n\nDisneyland is a fucking scam. It's a 1984 community that feels so eerily unsettling and inhuman. They brainwash people with their slogans like \"happiest place on earth\" and they cover up anything bad from their audience. Not to mention the corporate greed, and the continuous raising of prices for tickets. Disney also own half of Anaheim city, and most of the nearby hotels and motels are secretly owned by Disney. Some goes for the nearby gas stations, diners, etc. Disney pretty much runs the city of Anaheim in secrecy, and the Anaheim government is perfectly fine with that because they get big paychecks out if it. Disneyland isn't even as great as everyone says it is. The only reasons people go so much is because people are sad, and where better to go than what is advertised as the \"happiest place on earth\"? People take their kids there because they think that their kids have to go to Disneyland at least once to have a good quality childhood. People I know seem to go to Disneyland often simply to show how fucking rich and well off they are. They're using Disneyland as a way to express their higher class, not as a way to actually enjoy themselves. Walt Disney imagined a Utopia, but it seems to me that he got a Dystopia instead. He wanted to use his money for good, for human progress in technology, but instead the company hoards it and just uses the money to get even more money. Imagine the good charity that the company could do with their money. That is what Walt wanted. He wanted money for the people, not for the corporation.\n\nWorking at Disney is terrible. If you work in animation, any drawing you produce at the time, whether on duty or not, are the property of Disney. This prevents people from being able to do freelance or to work for other companies at the same time. (This also means that theres vaults of cartoon porn that Disney owns because the artists draw shit like that for shits and giggles). If you work at Disneyland, they treat you like shit and they don't pay well either. But hey, you get free tickets, so it's all good (sarcasm). Disney oppresses their employees and they get away with it all the time because they have big money. \n\nDisney is continuously fighting their competition until they win, and they almost alwats win. And by competition, I don't mean enemies, but allies too. This can be seen in the Sony argument where Disney continually demands more and more, until smaller companies have to give in because they know that they can't make it opposing such a powerful entity. This is what happened with Spiderman, as Disney got greedy and started demanding more profits and Sony said no, so Disney broke off their deal until Sony finally gave in because they'd make even less money if they cut ties with Disney all together than if they gave them most of the profits for Spiderman. This bullshit has been pulled off so many times by Disney.\n\nDisney is taking over the film industry and the marketing industry and it pisses me off so much that almost everyone is just ok with that. Disney also keeps producing films that stump smaller films in awards because the game is rigged in favor of bigger entities. Movies like Frozen, Brave, the Incredibles, etc are only popular because of the company that is making them, not because of the quality of the films itself. People expect a Disney film to be good, and oftentimes people's opinions will be biased based on what they go in expecting. People need to support smaller companies and indie companies more often than they do, before there aren't any left to support.",

The style of animation is amazing in all those films. \n\nIn my opinion, the French hold the title for best animated films though. The Little Prince, Nocturna (probably my favourite), The Painting, A Cat in Paris, Mune, April and the Extraordinary World etc. That\u2019s to name a few. They have such dreamscape movies that no other country can seem to match. So much more depth in their stories and the animation styles are so gorgeous. \n\nI highly recommend all the films I just mentioned.

They still have the rights to their work outside of that. Many artists who I follow post art regularly that is personal work. Many of them do commission work outside of Disney.

I'm in my early 20's, and I've met like 3 people in my life who did not grow up watching Disney stuff. Nostalgia is powerful, and Don Draper's mini-monologue on it from Mad Men puts it best.\n\nAlso, while Coco may not have been the best from a technical standpoint that year, it was also a HUGE cultural event that really gave so many Hispanics a sense of pride because it was a story told about us, and we don't get those often.

You feel like the independent films are being skunked and Disney films don\u2019t deserve the awards? The problem here is that Disney has been a powerhouse of animation for so long, it\u2019s going to take a while for those independent films to break into our culture and become widely viewed as an entertainment option for children and adults alike.  Which brings up another point...\n\nI can\u2019t show my 2 year old a movie of a middle-eastern girl searching for her father. He\u2019s not interested in that nor does he have the capability to understand the underlying concepts that make that movie great (which I\u2019m sure it is).  He wants to see Cars, and fish (\u201cish!!\u201d), and a talking snowman!!   So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll show him, because I believe it\u2019s age-appropriate and wholesome.  And at some point as an adult, maybe he\u2019ll look back at that talking snowman and feel that same childhood wonder he felt when he watched the movie for the first time.  And maybe he\u2019ll want to visit the Disney Parks to look for some little shred of that feeling. Because this world is cruel and ugly, and Disney parks are a respite from that. That\u2019s what the parks do for many people.  In my opinion, it feels lovely to be able to pause the world and step into a fantasy bubble.  It\u2019s the same as people who love reading, or video games, or anything that takes them away and makes them happy for a moment. It\u2019s a way to step out of reality and step into something beautiful, if only for a moment.",

Mainly animation, but also stuff like history, mythology, art, and music.\n\nI went to Disney World when I was 12, and I've been yearning to go back.  I can't say how it compares to Disneyland, but there was definitely something spectacular about the whole thing.  The pristine park, the amazing decor, the fact that they made the wait lines interesting has always been impressive to me.  And somehow you never see anything out of place.  You say they cover it up, but maybe they're just extremely quick at handling situations.  I can't speak for how the employees are treated, though.\n\nStill.  I think Disney needs to make some bold new choices in the film's they make.",

Waste of money and time for a kid to read old yeller if he is great at math. Instead put him in two math classes. I also have to teach myself to cook as I\u2019m in my earlier twenties and I can\u2019t just eat take out all the time anymore..would have been nice to have a home ec class to learn that in school. Same for wood shop so I could learn to make things or a required gym class to keep kids excited about exercise.

As it turns out, I didn't even care to learn them because I had convinced myself school just wasn't worth it. As boring as it was, I now suffer from being wholly unprepared for the real world ad a result. So please, if you read this and you're still in school, DON'T QUIT! It may be hell.

            "I think people are being more rhetorical when they say that.\n\nWhat they mean is that most people would get more out of learning how to do their own taxes, as opposed to, for instance, ancient history.\n\nWhile I found the latter absolutely fascinating, and dont consider it a waste of time, I cant say that I call upon what I learned in those classes very often, and in my daily life that information is generally useless.\n\nWhereas taxes, gotta deal with that at least once a year. \n\nAnother thing I'd say would be actually useful for people to learn in school... basic vehicle mechanics (like, how to change your oil, basic maintenance, etc). I can't tell you how many folks I know, fully grown, that have no idea what the little arrow on their gas gauge means...\n\nThen there's home economics... better known as \"how to cook and clean\". So many kids I knew skipped out on taking that class, and it's funny nowadays listening to them talk about their learning curve as adults, assuming they ever progressed beyond boiling noodles and burning toast...\n\nI DO AGREE that a lot of this talk comes from people who, IMO, lack drive to learn on their own. Doesn't mean they don't need to learn it, though. At least institutionalized learning would help the folks without the drive, to learn anyway.",

            "As a student I agree, but we do need more life classes available for kids to enrol themselves in for those who actually care. But we complain about school so much because the system is fucking terrible. It\u2019s not really about what we\u2019re learning about but how we learn it/are taught it. The way kids are treated in school, especially mentally ill and neurodivergent kids is absolutely terrible. Every kid needs specialized schooling and a safe space. \n\nI couldn\u2019t handle public school between the stress and my physical and mental illnesses. I need 12 hours of sleep a night\u2014which is impossible to get with insomnia and spending so much of my time doing school stuff. I could handle waking up at 7am, sure, but I would be absolutely exhausted by 12pm, to the point of literally falling asleep. You really don\u2019t get a break. Lunch, sure, but only if you haven\u2019t missed anything or need to catch up on any work, cause if you do then you don\u2019t get a lunch. And you don\u2019t get anywhere to actually have your break. Our cafeteria had enough tables for the grade 11/12\u2019s, but everyone else was on their own, aside from a  few benches here and there. I spent almost every lunch sitting on the floor in a random hallway. \n\nI have dissociative identity disorder and CPTSD and can go 20 minutes on my best days without dissociating. They\u2019re also accompanied by long-term and day-to-day amnesia so you can imagine how much I can forget everything\u2014or just not even be conscious enough to learn it! \n\nEveryone has things that need to be custom fit to their education. Kids are definitely not getting that at all. How many other kids did I know my age who had depression, anxiety, eating disorders, were being abused, were self-harming, suicidal, etc? Way too many and way more than you\u2019d even think. \n\nSpending a year and a half at that high school, we had a neurodivergent kid take a knife during foods class and start threatening people with it.  That poor kid never got any of the help he needed. He was arrested and then sent right back to school. We also had a guy with a gun planning to come inside the school but he was seen before on the other side of the road and the school was able to go on lockdown. Swat teams came. We were in lockdown the entire day with no idea what was going on. All we knew was there was a gun. The only info I got was from my mom that I wasn\u2019t even allowed to be texting. \n\nWe had a student commit suicide. We were on strict restrictions for the month. We had to be accompanied by a staff member whereever we went, including the bathroom. My friends were doing cocaine among other drugs in the school. I got into weed (and greened out in the forest in a foot of snow during lunch). I had cuts all over my neck and face the entire last half of the year. I was extremely suicidal. I thought my only way out was to kill myself. Luckily I managed to get out and start online courses, after I went through a two month drug binge. \n\nElementary school did countless other things to traumatize me. In grade 6 the school found out I self-harmed. I was cornered and asked terrible and triggering questions over and over (how do you cut? can i see your cuts? how deep do you cut? do you see fat when you cut or dermis? how much blood? etc.). They approached it in the complete wrong way. \n\nI ran away from home that day. The school told me I couldn\u2019t go back unless I seen a doctor. I seen a doctor who did absolutely nothing. That was the end of it. I got so so much help and support.",
            "I agree with you except I would like to point out that the whole argument is bullshit. The school system does teach you how to do this shit. It's just not explicit. You learn basic math through algebra, your taught English to read and understand the language used, you learn science for critical thinking and gain an understanding of basic physics chemistry and biology, and you learn about history and the fundamentals of our government. Your expected to be a semi competent human being and apply your knowledge to novel situations. You should not need your hand held through each individual situation nor is it feasible for this to be done. To avoid confusion I want you to know that when I say you I am speaking collectively not to you specifically.",
            "I agree fully.  The same people who are saying they'd like to learn about taxes wouldn't have even paid attention enough in class for it to matter.  this is nothing but moral grandstanding by degenerate kids who think they're making some wise and profound point by pointing out that they're not getting their \"life lessons\" from school, but it's utter bullshit.  It's not hard to do your taxes in the majority of scenarios.  If you're a small business owner or homeowner or have kids, it's slightly more complex.  If you're just working a regular ass job and no dependents?  It's easy as hell.  In any event, Google is a free resource lmao",
            "My opinion is that if people feel like their taxes are too complicated to do (which may well be a valid opinion), the solution shouldn't be to teach it at school but to simplify the whole system of filling out taxes.\n\nI mean, it's a bit like if a lot of people injured themselves while cooking, you wouldn't create classes where you teach students how to cook without injuring yourself. You would incentivize companies to design and sell kitchen utensils where people don't injure themselves anymore.",

I wish they would have replaced geography or humanities or history or even some math classes with with stuff like how to buy a house, how to do your taxes, how to vote, etc. Most of what they shove down our throats is useless crap we regurgitate for a test and then never use again.

Personal finance would have been a lot more valuable to have learned at a younger age because I definitely didn\u2019t know about all the maintenance costs or bills you\u2019d have to pay as an adult and I\u2019m just now at a point where wealth has steadily grown.",

            "Completely agree. I am also a high school student, and the \"learn about taxes\" argument annoys me, since it makes any attempts by high school students to criticize American education seem like it is out of laziness. \n\nMy two biggest pet-peeve arguments for what needs to be taught in school are \"taxes\" and \"how to buy a lambo cash\" (it is amazing how YouTube controls my generation). Any person with an internet connection can Google \"IRS 1099,\" \"IRS W2,\" or \"CA FTB 540 2EZ\" and find amazing, free information about how to file taxes. With accountants or software, you don't even need to know how to fill it out. On a similar note, tax forms change almost every year. If you are specifically teaching how the current-year taxes work, it may not be applicable for the next year.\n\nAt the same time, the \"rampant consumerism\" argument annoys me. There are three components to making lots of money: knowledge, work ethic, and luck. Schools provide the first (yet often the people making this argument don't take advantage). Work ethic is entirely under a person's control, and yet many of the people who want to \"buy a lambo cash\" don't have a strong work ethic. The last element, luck, is entirely out of your own control. It is a better use of time to learn the skills to help you get a solid, high-paying job and maintain a strong work ethic so that if you get lucky, you can take advantage.\n\nThat being said, I think that US education needs reform. I wish that my state mandated a financial literacy course for all students. Ideally, it would contain info about how to find good deals for loans or banks, how to invest, and why delaying gratification matters. It would likely help resolve economic problems in the USA if people understood how money works before they go off to college. In addition, it would help create more equality because financial literacy training mostly comes from parents, and if parents don't understand financial literacy themselves, they can't effectively teach their children.\n\nMaybe taxes could be a part of a theoretical \"financial literacy\" course, but I think that there are more important aspects of financial literacy than an IRS form that changes every year. My state has a mandatory \"life skills\" class (which was a waste of time and left most students with a more favorable view of drugs than when they started) that would be a great opportunity for financial literacy education.",

            "Finally someone says it!",
            "I totally agree with this. Most students don't care because it doesn't apply to them at that point in life. I was a straight A student and I wasn't too interested in learning about retirement savings and IRAs as a junior in high school, luckily I took a keen interest on my own with self learning after college.",
            "Downvote. He knows too much",
            "See. That's just the thing though. I never understood the complaints about \"schools need to teach taxes\" etc. Because in my state (new mexico) if you were a student who finished math on time (meaning you didnt fail any math classes before senior year) then your last semester of senior year you had the option to take financial literacy. Which is a class that teaches you how to balance a check book. How to do taxes. How mortgages work. Basically the financial basics of being an adult. So whenever I hear someone complain about it here specifically. Its exactly for the reason you stated above, they were crappy students who just want to complain about school because they didn't want to try. Because this class was opt in and most people had the option to take it so long as they made it through algebra  I&II, geometry and I believe trigonometry.",
            "One underlying issue is motivation. High school students are motivated by things like social status, romantic relationships, parental approval, particular interests, and sometimes vague notions of what they might do professionally later. Abstract activities like math are just not aligned with the motivations of most kids except if they see it as a gateway to college or in rare circumstances if they enjoy it for its own sake.\n\nEffective learning requires motivation to accomplish a task or reach a goal. You are motivated to learn what is required to complete your objective. One huge issue in education is that we teachers try to force feed material to people who have no goal to use it (other than the indirect goal of getting a passing grade). I don\u2019t really see a solution that is a silver bullet for everyone.\n\nMy instinct and experience tell me a lot more people would self actualize if they were offered a wide variety of low stakes, ungraded, exploratory classes. Couple those with advanced classes that go into depth for the students who find enough interest and motivation to dig deeper.\n\nAs an aside, all of this is assuming kids who have their basic physiological and psychological needs met, which is itself a huge issue.",

            "\"School should teach us more practical things!\"\n\nVocational, apprenticeships, night classes, libraries: exist\n\n\"No, not like that!\"\n\nI definitely agree with you. I generally think that wider curriculums are great and allow for people to explore passions, but I would also argue that school isn't supposed to teach you everything. It's main objective is to teach you how to learn and ask questions.",

On top of that, I can barely do any after school activities because I already get home at 6. If I do any after school activities I am extremely stressed because of homework. To make things worse I have ADHD which causes me to do homework at least 2x as slow. People might say. Well other people have a ten hour work day and get home much later than you. And I know. But to pile this on a MIDDLE SCHOOL student is ridiculous. So as a B student, I want to say that homework is the hardest thing about school. This is not including puberty, social awkwardness, mental pain (because I know a lot of kids that have depression) and many more problems. The school system needs to change.

I highly doubt all he kids that say this would have actually pay attention still. \n\n And for people saying \u201cit\u2019s for the kids who wouldn\u2019t of payed attention still,\u201d yeah nah as someone who graduated recently, it doesn\u2019t matter what class it is, they just hated school because the teachers and work load.  It wasn\u2019t about subject, they just liked complaining",
            "Every year people from my school complain about this, and I refer them to the class they could take that would teach them taxes. It\u2019s not a core 40 requirement in my state but if you talk to the guidance councilor even once they\u2019d bring it up. Education is partially a students responsibility at that age and you\u2019re right, if they\u2019re don\u2019t look for it, then they can complain it\u2019s not there.",
            "Are those students actually eager to take classes on how to do taxes? Probably not. However, that's not the point.\n\nThey're addresing the fact that it's easy to lose motivation when our classes seemingly have nothing to do with adult life. (Or at least, they feel like they don't.)\n\nThis does not make them lazy or juvenile. It means that they are aware of the shortcomings of our education system. And I completely agree with them.\n\nI just finished my first year of college, and plan to move out in a year or two. I can confidentely say that high school did not prepare me for this in any way. \n\nI'm going to have to figure it out with the assistance of my parents and peers. But what of the people that don't have friends or parental figures to learn from? They haven't had any education about adulting. That is an issue that needs to be addressed.",
            "Teenage me would not have liked to learn how to do taxes, but 18 Year old me wished I had been taught how to do taxes and lots of other mundane things that parents might forget to teach their kids but end up being really important.",
            "Slightly agree but mainly disagree, I believe you\u2019ve framed the argument in an unfair manner, most people complain about not learning anything useful. A lot of kids do remember shit from their highschool science, maths, English etc, I believe it\u2019s totally worth teaching alongside life skills",
            "Honestly I hate it when people complain about curriculum.  I agree there are some stuff kids need to learn but most of the stuff they learn is actually valuable information.  Besides what the fuck do you what them to learn of do with their time?!?  Most kids are just lazy fucks tbh.",
            "oof! so true! im not on the teachers side either but this i still absolutely agree with this!",
            "People, with normal households of course, depend much too much on the school system to teach them anything, what happened to parents showing their children basic things like, cooking, taxes, what happened to raising your kids? School systems should not be there to raise children but to teach things parents can't quite teach",
            "While this is true, I don\u2019t think want is the important factor here. But seeing as taxes are one of the absolutes in life, it would make sense to learn. You learn a lot in school you don\u2019t want to, but need it. Whether you want to or not is kinda irrelevant if you need it to live a normal life.",
            "My unpopular opinion is that if the general population was well educated on finance and economics, left wing politics would suffer majorly.\n\nNot to say all on the left are illiterate, but there are tons on ideas on the left hat come from ignorance and encourage people to vote left, examples like the wage gap myth, lack of understanding of how stocks work, far left economics like socialism and communism which have been shown not to work.",
            "Taxes are mad easy. We had to take personal finance senior year. I still took out 60k in student loans and signed up for credit cards as a college student even though I was advised not to. Some people are just lazy and dumb (like my early 20s self)",
            "I once read a person on reddit say \"a bad teacher can have a bigger impact on someone's life than a drug dealer\" because they can kill their love for learning.\n\nThe latter is true to an extent, but the desire to learn comes from withing the student as well. Not everything is going to be be fun and games when it comes to education.",
            "Lol I was thinking about this yesterday or the day before. Yes the education system needs to be reformed as you said. Obviously most people telling schools to teach how to handle taxes don't actually want to learn about that exact thing. But their main point is that they want to learn things they will need in life and not things they don't.",
            "Why are taxes so complicated in the first place...",

            "My school had a class that taught exactly that, called financial literacy, everyone complained about how the class was B.S. at the same time they complained that we should learn more about real life like taxes.\n\nPeople just want a reason to complain and if they get what they \u201cwant\u201d they still aren\u2019t happy.",
            ">hey don\u2019t give a damn about doing taxes they just want to complain about the school system.\n\nOkay, but they're right.",
            "Disagree , as an accounting major i think learning about taxes in highschool would have helped",
            "Actually I do wanna learn about taxes, and did",
            "At the time I would have hated learning about how to do taxes, now that I have to actually do it I wish that we did",
            "I did poorly and goofed off in school because of lots of reasons. Home life, needing a job, bullied, and severe lack of helpful interesting topics. There was 2 basic computing class each catagory for design, programing, and, \"generalized computing\" 150 spots in total per semester for a class of 1900. They were all taugh by the same teacher. \n\nInstead they recommended I take deeper math classes.I want to do computer work but they filled to fast so they told me I should go take Trig1. \n\nThis was after they wouldn't allow my algebra credit to move with me from Texas. They also had requirements for state history meaning as a senior i was stuck in a freshman level state history class. \n\nClasses that would teach me what to do with the money I was making to make sure it would last. Classes teaching me how establishing, using, and abusing credit look. Classes showing us how buying property, cars, long term payments and the terminology of loans and investments works. \n\nClasses to look at how insurance companies work and how to shop them for what you need rather than get sold. \n\nClasses that teach leadership and management skills. How to negotiate a raise, how to interview, and communicate and advocate for yourself and those around you.",
            "Maybe things have change, but school did teach us about taxes... its called math, and standardized testing.\n\nTaxes are basic addition and subtraction combined with putting the answers in the right box.\n\nPeople need to realize they were taught how to accomplish the fundamentals; everything builds on basic concepts.  It really is up to you to apply and change the variables and apply those to the known fundamentals.\n\nDon't blame others because after 12 years you only memorized things and didn't learn how to think.",
            "You\u2019re right, but I don\u2019t think that was the point.  Should we complain only about the things that directly relate to what we are willing to do? Should we complain only about the things that apply to us? These complainers probably just see how the school system is inconsistent with its message, which is probably \u201cprepare students for the world.\u201d  You would still be right though.",
            "People should ask their parents about this stuff, or read about it at a library or on the Internet, or watch a video on YouTube.",
            "You're right\n\nAt the same they need to teach you about money.\nNone of the kids/teenagers in school learn anything about money, no accounting, no cash flow etc.",
            "Totally agree. I\u2019ve taught enough high school math students to know that most of them won\u2019t be enthused about anything you show them. Not that taxes and other \u201cuseful\u201d skills shouldn\u2019t be taught in school, but students shouldn\u2019t fool themselves into thinking that they\u2019d like it more than the math they\u2019ve been doing.",
            "I try my best at school, and work hard. Some things are tough and some of the things that we are taught are questionable, but I try not to complain. I work hard and achieve great grades.\nHowever, I know that I'll be going to university soon and I would like to be taught some life lessons.\nSure, we have PSHE/Citizenship, but the things we are taught in those classes are either useless or taught in a shitty way, with awful, childish animations.\nBeing taught how to pay bills, how to do well in a job interview, how to pay taxes are all things that we are going to need to do in our lives, so they should be taught because of how important they are.\nPeople say \"It's up to the parents to teach that\", but what if your parents don't? What if you struggle to talk to them? Or what if they are just not great parents? \nSchool should teach at least the basic life lessons- especially when it comes to finance- because, once you're in debt, it can be so hard to get out of it.\nThis is just my view on things.",
            "If we learned about taxes, students would complain about something else",
            "Here's another unpopular opinion. Taxes shouldn't be taught in schools because taxes should not exist.",
            "I had a personal finance class in high school and I got a B- but I still use lessons from that class every day. I learned how to stay put of debt, how to save money, how to find better deals, how to invest and so much more. That class is the only good to come out of 4 years of high school.",
            "It drives me nuts when adults/kids say that in Canada... they do teach it you just weren\u2019t listening lol. I think it\u2019s written into the curriculum now actually... I might be wrong but at the very least the skills are taught, it\u2019s whether the student takes that knowledge and actually applies it to real world situations, like taxes. Which goes back to your point, that most don\u2019t actually want to learn, they want to complain about the school system. Interesting opinion, thanks for the food for thought!",
            "Wouldn't have to complain if taxes were voluntary. If tax is such a good idea, you'd think everyone would want to pay into it, right?",
            "Nah, I really think learning real life things is really important.",
            "Schools need to teach, above all else, basic finance. This can include taxes and how they affect take home pay. Tax brackets, FICA, etc",
            "Everyone bitches about not learning taxes. \n\nIt's literally matching boxes. Box A from this page goes on box A on this page. I could give my tax forms to my 9 year old and he could do it. It's not difficult. If you can't figure it out because you have complicated tax returns you probably need to use an accountant anyway. And if you can't figure it out and have simple tax returns your guardian/caretaker probably does it for you",
            "Turbo. Fucking. Tax. Best $50 I spend all year",

            "For 99 percent of people taxes are so incredibly obvious that you literally can\u2019t do it wrong unless you are willfully stupid. A class on doing taxes would be a huge waste of time",
            "I agree. Also there\u2019s no practical reason to have a class on doing taxes given you can learn how to do taxes from 15 minutes on google",
            "This one really hits home. Even people I went to school with bitch about \"not learning about taxes and finances\". We went to the same class and I learned all that. So the issue isn't that it wasn't taught, it's that you didn't pay attention.\n\nLife can't spoon feed you everything.",
            "I\u2019m someone who legitimately wants to learn taxes in school, but when I mentioned this I noticed that most of the kids who agreed with me were the kids that just complained endlessly. It\u2019s honestly pretty frustrating.",
            "Of course I dont want to learn about taxes, I dont want to pay them",
            "I disagree, I wish school would have taught me proper life skills. Maybe even how to PAY A BILL.. maybe?? I honestly don\u2019t know how. And I don\u2019t know anything about credit, how to rent an apartment, how a credit card works. Wtf is APR? If school taught us all of this I\u2019m sure I\u2019d already be living on my own, but instead I still live with my dad and pay HIM the money to pay my bills. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m currently in the process of saving money to move out of state, but I\u2019m going to have to call my mom for every small question when I could\u2019ve learned it in the 12 years I was at school.",
            "I agree. I think these kids see people bring up good, well structured arguments agaisnt an education system (whether is American, British, whatever) and are like \u201cyeah man school sucks\u201d.  Just get on and do your work so you can spend less time in school",
            "Oh my god I was literally coming onto this subreddit to say this. Not only that, in my school we HAD a planning/learn about the real world class we had to take and not a single person took it seriously. Why? Because that stuff is boring!!! And just a prerequisite to graduate!! Plus, I know for a fact that if you learned that stuff in high school you will 100% forget it by your first tax season. Sure, it\u2019s important to learn about adulting and how to do taxes etc. But if you make it mandatory in school to learn it, no one will actually learn it.",
            "You\u2019re right, I\u2019d rather learn it from my parents who taught it to me quickly and easily instead of a year long class. I think we can all agree that would be extremely boring.",

            "There's __a lot__ of misinformation here. To address a few statements: \n\n>Once you are over the age of sexual consent, there are still age limits on who you can have sex with.\n\nFalse. The age of consent (unlimited) is:\n\n18 in 30 states\n\n17 in 6 states\n\n16 in 19 states\n\n(Includes US territories)\n\nThis means a person of that age can consent to a sexual relationship, even with a teacher unless otherwise legislated. \n\n>Teachers cannot ever have sex with students.\n\nTrue in most cases. It doesn't matter if the teacher is 19 and the student is 17. In almost all cases a \"relationship of trust\" means consent is not possible and \"consensual sex\" is statutory rape, just like if an adult received \"consent\" from a youth\n\n>Sex between two people under 18 (or whatever the age of majority is) is illegal.\n\nFalse. There are only 4 states in which someone under 18 can't have sex with someone else under 18.\n\n>A minor can never have sex with an adult under any circumstances\n\nFalse. I'm not saying it's right, but legally what OP is saying is not correct (in Canada at least, and in very limit areas of the US). See the following quote from the Canadian government's site:\n\n>__Close in age exceptions__\n*A 14 or 15 year old can consent to sexual activity as long as the partner is less than five years older and there is no relationship of trust, authority or dependency or any other exploitation of the young person. This means that if the partner is 5 years or older than the 14 or 15 year old, any sexual activity is a criminal offence.*\n\nA 15 year old, despite being under Canada's age of consent of 16, can have sex with a legal adult of 19, and it is not a crime.\n\nSource: clinical director of psych practice, work with incidents of child abuse and educate concerned parents of sexually active teens and their partners fairly often",
            "It was legally not rape.\nThe age of consent is 16 in Alabama.\n\nThis is one of those things that I don\u2019t get about Americans.

Inappropriate for a teacher yes, but rape is a stretch.\n\nEdit: [ok the boy from the first example may have been 14](https://meaww.com/alabama-special-education-teacher-accused-having-sex-high-school-student-catherine-lynn-coffey) . I got the women mixed up, my bad. \nBut the point still stands for the 2nd and 3rd examples op posted (16 and 17yo boys who are above the age of consent. In the 2nd case it was between a 16yo and 22yo teacher in South Carolina, where again the age of consent is 16)",
            "I don't know about the first two links, but in the last two the victims were 16-17, which is above age of consent in most countries and states. It is still wrong, because she is a teacher and that's abuse of her authority, but it is not rape.",

In many societies, they would be considered full adults; and if they commit a heinous felony at that age, would be tried as adults by the court.\n\nAcross the US, there is even agreement that those under 18 can marry (except for in two states):\n\n>\"[C]ouples are allowed to marry at a younger age with parental consent or with judicial authorisation, with the minimum marriage age, when all exemptions are taken into account, ranging from 14 to 17, while in 12 states there is no statutory minimum age when all exemptions are taken into account.\" (\"[Marriage Age in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_age_in_the_United_States)\")\n\nSo yes, we get that you as an [18 year old guy who was harrassed by women](/r/KindVoice/comments/eqlqsw/l18_m_got_swarmed_for_a_poorlyworded_post_on/) want to [argue that women can be just as terrible as men](/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/eq2gub/girls_can_be_creeps_too_yknow/).\n\nThis just isn't the best way to make that case.",

I don\u2019t even have an argument for this but if you think that you can identify as a whole different species you need therapy.\n\nI understand that reading about your horoscope can be fun, stars are pretty and if you wanna read about it or just enjoy the zodiac sign aesthetic that\u2019s more than fine, BUT if you start justifying your shitty behavior because you\u2019re x sign, you\u2019re just trashy.\n\nSex positivity is fine and healthy but there\u2019s no need to be openly doing your kinky stuff in public, if you want to walk your partner on a leash, that\u2019s cool, but the other people at the dog park are not consenting to be a part of it, it\u2019s not kinkshaming, but there\u2019s places for that kind of stuff.\n\nThese are examples of my point, my opinion goes for any other crazy belief that people try to pass as normal and acceptable.\n\nI love that we\u2019re becoming more accepting and people feel comfortable enough to be themselves but there should be some limits, calling people \u201cbigots\u201d because they don\u2019t respect your wild beliefs is a bit extreme.\n\nEdit: I meant to say that English is not my first language, evidently I do speak at least some English\n\nEdit2: I wrote this post because an acquaintance saw a picture of my house on fb and said I shouldn\u2019t place mirrors in front of each other because they are portals to the other world, I laughed it off, she was serious and then called me a bigot for laughing at her beliefs.",

Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!

Public kink stuff is maybe a little different, and I may be the unusual one but I actually think there's a certain level of that that is fine because when it isn't also overtly sexual in a mainstream way, others probably don't even know what they're looking at.

It can simply be a group or organization. Respect for privacy has fallen through the roof in more ways than one and it shows. Mass scale social market, things like twitter or facebook, have crazy power over public vs private life ideas.\n\nAnd then all that leads into high centralized power of everything rather than delegating power to people who want to privately live how they want to live. Now it must be public and it must be accepted if it's on the list of the currently most powerful.",

Now, I am going to get shit for this for saying that, but this is what I observed in my 5 years in the US and multiple conversations with some friends and families and some professors at my university. This individualism is good for building independence, but kind of also kills the bonds people might have due to a lot of transactional behaviour. For example the rental thing like this. You take care of us and we take care of, the unspoken parenthood and children contract also needs to be acknowledged.  \n\n\nEdit: I see a lot of comments about \"Western World\" part.

That's also with one of his parents being an accountant and the other was a mortgage broker, so he would have been exposed to the finance world early on, obviously the lessons never stuck.\n\n Experience is the best teacher because you get the test first and the lesson second.",
            "Our rule from the beginning was that the kids could live with us as long as they needed, however, they must either be in school with passing grades or pay a small amount of rent. The oldest is the only adult so far at 22 and he still lives at home. He wasn't really interested in college so he went to work. He pays his share of the phone bill, his own auto insurance, and $50 a week toward groceries and utilities. It is not our intent to punish him but we do expect a level of responsibility from our kids and we expect them to contribute to the family in tangible ways. The younger ones help out with chores but since he has a full time job and some side gigs, it's easier for him to pay his share. If he has a slow week or has an unexpected expense, he can help out by doing other work around the place instead of me hiring someone. We're very flexible with it, but he has to contribute to the family like the rest of us do. \n\nI think any adult who is still living at home and is able should contribute in a meaningful way to the family. If they're working, money is a good way to show their appreciation and help out. If not, they need to find an acceptable alternative.",

He says its to teach her responsibility, to get her used to paying bills and being a adult.\n\nShe's barley getting by.\n\nShe doesn't make enough money a month to pay for rent, car insurance, gas, medication for her depression and stomach issues and random things like her car getting rammed into.\n\nFurthermore he gets up her ass about her bedroom. It's mess. A big depression mess. If she's paying rent to live here who gives a fuck what her room is like. SHE'S PAYING FOR IT.\n\nMy sister shouldn't have to choose between getting gas for her car or buying medication. She wants to move out but she can't save enough money to fully function on her own. Whatever money she's saved gets used because something always happens. \n\nMy dads argument is, \"Well my father used to charge me and my sister rent when we turned 18.\" Yeah well he used to beat you too, but that's not something you chose to do.\n\nWe need to throw out this idea that just because our parents said it was okay means that we can carry on whatever shity things they did to our kids. Times were different back then. It didn't cost as much to live. Now, kids are being hired on at extremely low wages and its so hard to get that small number raised. \n\nMy father cannot constantly yell at my sister to move out while also being the shackle that's keeping her.\n\nIf he stopped charging her rent I bet she could move out in less than a year.",

I had worked since 12-13, first a paper route and then a job at a cafe. All because my dad didn\u2019t want to buy me shoes or clothes that weren\u2019t school uniform. I was 12 and just started secondary school, I wanted nice clothes so I could fit in, I had never had a friend before and really wanted to make one and be able to go out, I wasn\u2019t allowed out in my school shoes. I never made friends because I couldn\u2019t get my own phone contract and I couldn\u2019t have went out even if I did have friends because I was working all of the time. If I wasn\u2019t at work it was homework, it wasn\u2019t that it was chores. If I wasn\u2019t busy I was being a freeloader and lazy. \n\nI was abused, exploited by horrible managers and now have a very unhealthy relationship with work and authority. I can\u2019t work now. I\u2019m a 20 year old who can\u2019t leave the house on her own. I have such severe chronic pain that I need help getting up from my bed. I can barely walk to the shop, my flat feet don\u2019t help. Growing up I was forced to stand up for hours and hours and continuously clean and bend over with no rest. Last week the doctor told me I have a prolapsed disk in my spine causing severe pain in my sciatic nerve. Everything hurts! Sitting, bending over, sleeping on my back. I now take extremely strong painkillers just to do basic shit. \n\nIt\u2019s devastating. My entire life I wanted nothing but to be normal but I never got that. My dad\u2019s selfishness robbed me of years of my life and my dream job. My degree is animation, my dream was to work as a storyboard artist in a studio all the way in California, work on cartoons. I can\u2019t do that now. My agoraphobia is so extreme I can\u2019t go grocery shopping by myself. My autism and adhd went undiagnosed for years and now as an adult I won\u2019t get treatment off of the NHS because there isn\u2019t enough resources. My degree is now useless. I can\u2019t work \u2018normal\u2019 retail jobs or a 9-5 jobs either. Until my first year of university I had never been to the cinema or out with friends on a \u2018girls day out\u2019, or been to the beach or the mountains or skiing or anything. I\u2019m making up for lost time with my partner but it\u2019s not the same. I didn\u2019t have fun when I was younger and what happened then still haunts me. I will never be able to do dance or rhythmic gymnastics or figure skating or aerial gymnastics, all stuff I dreamed of as an 8, 9, 10 year old. All things I begged for as a young teen and was told \u2018get a fucking job\u2019, but a job took so much time that I couldn\u2019t have extracurriculars. \n\nIf you read this and you\u2019re a parent and you want to take money from your child or force them to work a job, don\u2019t. You will rob them of years of their life. They\u2019re not being lazy for not wanting that, school is already too much for them with the amount of homework they get. They are literally a CHILD. They shouldn\u2019t be working and attending school fulltime, ever. You will damage their health and future, you will make them miserable. Stop being a selfish prick, if you can afford to financially support your child then you just should. Your responsibility doesn\u2019t end at 16 or 18. My dad hasn\u2019t paid for a single thing for me since I was 14 years old. If your response to \u2018can I get a new razor, bra, deodorant, clothes\u2019 is \u2018get a fucking job\u2019 then you\u2019re a selfish prick and shouldn\u2019t be a parent.

            "I agree 100%. My parents charged me rent after I turned 18. Had they not, I would've been able to save up for a house so much faster. I've since moved out at the age of 20 but it really upsets me that they imposed such a financial setback for me to get on with my life.",
            ">No, your responsibility as a parent doesn't end when they hit a magical number of years. You chose to be a parent, that's a lifetime commitment, not an eighteen-year contract.\n\nYea the tables turn way too quickly once you turn 18. Too many parents shapeshift into landlords once you hit that magical age. Damn shame if u ask me.\n\nYou should want your kids to surpass your achievements. Parents get jealous of the youth. They swear we have it easier but Jesus H. if I need some breathing room I'd at least like to know I could go to my parents' house. It's supposed to be home base. I think many parents who put their kids out like that are just cynical motherfuckers and they should probably end up in a nursing home when the time comes.",
            "I actually agree with this so much.",
            "It isn't the same United States that let people thrive at 18 right out of high school anymore. \n\nExpectations about parenting should change. I got my ass kicked out in the middle of school and having to try and work full time and study for the rest of my day put me so far behind my peers it's insane.",
            "When I got my first job, it was an interim position. That meant that there was no guarantee that I would be employed after my year was up. My parents didn't want me to move out and risk being unemployed while having to pay rent/a mortgage that they let me stay home. However, I was still making a salary -- nearly $45,000 per year -- which meant I could easily afford to live on my own. \n\nWe discussed me paying rent for that year. I was more than happy to put down something like $300 a month (much cheaper than the $900 a month I'd pay on my own anyway) to help cover the food and utilities I was using by living at home. I was using over half of the electricity with all of my electronics, so my living at home had a huge effect on their bills. \n\nEven with paying rent, I was able to combine what I had left over with my savings account balance to put something like $50,000 down on a house. How many 25 year-olds own their own house? I certainly wouldn't have been able to had I not had the opportunities to stay at home that I had.\n\nI lived at home all during my pursuit of my Bachelor's and my Master's, and I didn't pay rent then. I agree that pursuit of education and passions should come first. But if someone is earning enough that they could move out, but they just don't, then I think it's only fair to contribute. I don't think it's a black and white \"the kid should never ever pay rent\" issue.",

            "Notice how all the \"fuck you kid get a job and pull yourself up by your impoverished bootstraps\" type people in the comments are all American\n\nThis idea is propogated by the notion that your child will somehow be so financially incompetent they cannot even possibly comprehend or learn how to manage any of their finances or even budget at all unless they pay you out of their earnings\n\nIf that is the case I'd say you've simply failed at explaining how budgeting works, and if that really was your goal, you would simply draft up a budget sheet for your child based off of their income, and then give it all back to them once they move out, again, if that really is your true intention, and you don't care about the money, you might even have your child pay for financial management or budgeting classes, again if your real, true intention was to simply make your child learn how budgeting and financial management works\n\nFollowing the boomer bootstraps mentality, if your kid has to get a job and pay up, you should actually just get a job and pick yourself up by your own bootstraps and pay your own bills and to put food on the table for your children. If you can't do that, then just get another job, or go to school and get a better job, and polish your resume as many bootstrappers like to spew out, stop being irresponsible and lazy by leeching off your children as extra income, and get to work\n\nThe fact of the matter is you do not care about whether or not your child learns financial management / budgeting, and you sure as hell are not going to take your own \"advice\" and stop being hypocritical, by pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and actually paying your own bills, you just want to be lazy and have some extra beer money / free utilities because all you care about is yourself\n\nThe only real excuse you might have to charge your kids, is if you were struggling with poverty tier / low income despite your budgeting, even then, again following your own bootstraps mentality, you should just go to school and get a better job, you lazy communist",

I see tons of adults in China these days absolutely leeching off their parents.  Parents in shitty retirement homes so that the children can have the house that the parents bought. At the same time, Americans often don\u2019t even pay for their kids to go to college. I only know ONE Chinese American with student loan debt. One. Out of over a hundred. And these are all families that came to the US in the 80s with nothing. They scrimped and borrowed from family. This is why the median Asian income is much higher than the white median.

I lived with my grandparents growing up (they actually lived with us too in our current house but have passed) so the relationship my kids have with my parents is super important to me. I have a good friend who worked at Facebook right out of college (yes they pay a ton) and lived with his parents in Manhattan rent free for 5 years. He saved so much.

Economies of scale and so much more love and community. \n\nBut I also have a deadbeat cousin who lived rent free for a few years. I\u2019m not sure kicking him out would have helped. His parents were always the bad stereotypes of tiger parents who pushed the wrong stuff imo. Just study til you die. No passion for learning or for work. Life is about money.

            "I live in Vancouver Canada and it\u2019s currently ranked #2 most unaffordable place to live in the world. I was born in Canada and my parents immigrated to Canada from Hong Kong. I stayed and lived at home with my parents until at the age of 28, where i got engaged to my fiance. I contributed $500 a month to my parents even tho they didn\u2019t need the money. It was just the principle. During that time I lived at home, i was able to save up for a down payment for a place which has now since doubled in price on the market. I would not have been able to afford a place in Vancouver if it wasn\u2019t for me staying at home living with my parents. \n\nMost asian cultures I find have a stronger family values and are brought up on the idea of helping the family vs the stereotypical white culture where you either get kick out when you\u2019re done highschool.

            "As someone who lived in my mother's house rent-free for years, I disagree, and here's why:\n\n* It enabled me to not grow up in a normal, healthy manner. She didn't ask for rent or help with things around the house like groceries or necessities, so I didn't learn about caring for my own living space or appreciate using the groceries before they expired-- because hey, there would always be more free food, right? It enabled me to quit jobs at the drop of a hat because it was a low-risk move for me; I still had a roof over my head and someone to care for me, so who did it hurt? Spoiler: **both of us.** To this day, I'm still stunted in ways I shouldn't be because we depended so heavily on each other.\n* It enabled her to be co-dependent on me. She wasn't making me pay rent because she felt she needed to still keep taking care of me financially because it was part of being a parent. She felt guilty about getting divorced when I was a kid, and that I had emotional and mental health issues growing up. Even when it was hard on her, she asked nothing from me because she felt it was her duty to care for me because no matter what, I'm her child. She thought she was helping me, but she was hurting both of us. I love her, she's my best friend, but we both know me finally moving out was best for both of us.\n\nYou say parents shouldn't charge rent, but also shouldn't let their child leech off of them;  the area in between is *very* grey. I also have someone in my extended family who's in her 30's, living in her parents' basement. She went to school, she has a degree, has a job, is making income... and contributes nothing. She spends all her money on herself and does nothing to help out around the house. She's emotionally manipulative towards them, even going as far as to demand they pay for repairs to the car *she* bought that they have *nothing* to do with. She spends her money on sports cars and clothes, whatever guy she's doing that week, and going out to the club. When they finally suggested she should be paying them rent until she can find her own place, she had an absolute fit. Are they not allowed to ask her to pay rent when she's contributing nothing, let alone demanding *they* foot *her* bills?\n\nI understand where you're coming from, and you're partially right. Your children are always your children, and you shouldn't throw them out or start siphoning off of them when they're barely making anything, but there comes a point when asking your child for rent is a fair thing to do-- at least it is here, in the United States. Housing is expensive, whether you rent or are paying a mortgage. Bills keep going up, and most families aren't in a position to house an extra adult who's not earning income. If your kid is in their early 20's, trying to get through school-- yeah, maybe give them a break and don't ask for rent, just ask for them to help out around the house and chip in if they can from time to time. If they're in their 30's and 40's, making money and choosing to act stupidly with it, you have *every* right to ask them to start paying their own way-- because if you don't, they never will, and you'll keep enabling them to not be their own fully formed adults because you feel obligated to care for them for the rest of their lives, and they'll be enabled to believe they don't have to be fully formed adults because mom and dad will take care of them... until one day you're not there and they don't know the first thing about being in the adult world on their own.",

            "I'm from Eastern Europe (Russia) and when my parents got a job at a high-tec company abroad and we moved it was a cultural shock. Like in our culture family is the MOST improtant thing ever. Like people will get offnded if you offer money for anything, like even as a gift. And overall I found that our family bond were much stronger than in the West. Like Family is all you have sometimes. So yeah overall I hate the whole \"rent\" thing, just make my stomach swirl and make sme really uncomfortable. No money is worth lost friendships/bonds.",
            "Somewhat disagree.  If they're at home working full time, no plans to move out than yeah. Charge them rent, teach them about responsibility and how to handle their money.\n\nNow if a kid is staying at home, working part time and is attending school.  Then yeah, that's very kind of the parents to help their children like that.\n\nI think you nailed it though when you basically said it's a bit of a cultural thing.  I moved out at 19 and that's even a little late compared to my friends who were the same age at the time.",

            ">Of course, I don't mean you let your kid leech off you till they're 40, never working or doing anything worthwhile with their life rotting away in your basement. But, provided that they are actively making something of themselves, be it education, pursuing their passions or something that will eventually lead them to achieve full independence and move out anyway, adding an unnecessary expense to their budget just makes the time they take to get to that point even longer.\n\nSo you admit there's a deadline and you can subjectively determine when it is (sometime before 40 apparently), but you just don't like when people do it \"too early.\"\n\nDumb opinion.

We moved from overseas so them still living with us still makes sense. They have never lived in the states so getting them acclimated to crazy american life is just good parenting. Both of them work so if they want something specific they can buy it themselves. \n\nWe do pay for their phone lines for example but those brand new Iphones they have, they paid for. My son makes his own car payment and pays for his monthly insurance and my daughter will do the same once she has her license. Obviously don't let your children live with you like leeches but if you can make it a little easier for them to take care of themselves in the long run, then by all means do it if you can help.",
            "I personally think there is benefit in all employed adults contributing financially to household bills. I can't imagine thinking that I should be entitled to live rent- free with my parents for as long as I please. \n\nBut I also get why people would choose not to do this so you do you man. \n\nYour opinion is definitely unpopular where I come from.  Not so much the rent part (both options are pretty common) but to link the charging of rent to being a failure as a parent. That's... super rough. Take my upvote.",
            "It depends.\n\nMy parents' rule was that we would graduate from University or College, then have 1 more year at home rent free. After that we could either move out or start to pay them rent (and the amount was still a pretty big steal, less than half of what renting a small apartment would cost and comes with the luxury of free meals, etc.). I thought this was very reasonable.  \n\n\nMy brother has started 2 College programs only to fail or drop out, and is working minimum wage jobs. We're in Canada - minimum wage here is a lot more decent than the US. He's 23 and has no motivation to do anything other than continue his current shtick and play video games all day when he's not working. So my parents started charging him rent - you don't just get to sit at home mooching off your parents with no motivation for anything else until you turn 40.",
            "I hear what you\u2019re saying friend and I agree. Ideally we would follow some of these Asian, hispanic, and middle eastern communities (among others). Allowing our children to live with us until they can stand alone as adults and then The children allowing the parents to live with them when they\u2019re older. It would be a better system for Americans and others. I will add a personal note, I\u2019ve told my spouse our Mother in Law could live with us if she needed (she has a disability and lost her husband last year). Also I don\u2019t plan on charging my kids rent,\n\nI was charged rent and paid a lot of my own bills between 18-22. It didn\u2019t harm me that much overall. It helped me in ways, and held me back in ways. My mother could\u2019ve handled it better. She admittedly did need the money, but then again I may have contributed without the mandate. I agree with you.",
            "I agree. My philosophy is this...my child didn't ask to be brought into this world. My husband and i took it upon ourselves to create her. It is our responsibility to take care of her. And there is no end date on that. Our support doesn't just stop once she hits a certain age.",

My parents didn\u2019t financially need to do this whatsoever but they did it to make sure that I had an element of responsibility while I wasn\u2019t in school, which I appreciate when I reflect on it",

            "Mmmm I\u2019ll have to disagree. Maybe if the rent they are requesting is high like 300 or more, which would make it difficult to save up money. But 1 or 200 hundred can be a good exercise and teach kids how to budget before leaving the house.",

            "Idk man your parents are not supposed to literally babysit you until they die. Maybe them forcing you to get a job is the best thing they can do as parents. Yes if the kid is learning at university or college it sort of makes sense, but straight up leeching is a nono.",
            "If the child has the means to pay rent and isn't in school/saving for a house/etc, then not teaching them life responsibilities (like paying rent) is being a shitty parent.",
            "My mom had me pay a ridiculously small amount to live with her after college (like $250/month). But she saved it all. When I bought my first house she gave it all back to help with moving expenses. It was really nice to have a small chunk of money for that. I ended up using it for paint and other minor house renovations.",
            "I\u2019m 27 and living at home currently. I pay my parent a sum akin to rent each month. It\u2019s not as steep as actually renting, but it\u2019s enough.\n\nI eat food, use electricity, water, trash... I incur these expenses like everyone else, so I pay a responsibility. Being disciplined to have monthly expenses is a good thing as well, as if I never paid into the cost of living here, it could be harder to adapt later.",
            "My parents did that and still do it to my little brothers they actually put the money in the bank for his savings but don't tell him (or even me till I moved out). For me even if the parents kept the money or did use it for groceries there is a lot of people I know (I'm in Cali) who are in there 30's still bumming with there parents. Kinda does encourage you to get your own place but I know this won't fit everyone. My parents also said if you are not going to school to further your education then you will be working and paying rent since ye be an adult.",
            "I'm 19 and I help pay the car insurance as well as rent. They nurtured me and brought me up to be the man i am today and spent a lot of f'ing money to do so. So it's only fair that once im able to lift my own weight and just start to pay back what they've sacrificed for me, i do so.",
            "Have you ever considered that this is a good way to teach their kids on how to budget and responsibly respect a budget?\n\nMost reasonable parents do this and they don't serve eviction papers when their kids can't pay lol.",
            "Everyone parents their own way... Multiple methods work fine and are situational. Unless there was some other factor I'm not anticipating, I would charge my kid rent if he wanted to live at home after college, and I don't need the money. I would likely save all his rent money and give it back to him once he leaves home to help him along the way (but I'd never let him know I was going to do this), but I don't think any parent owes that to their kid. \n\nThis is completely different than assuming my commitment ends at a specified age. He will always be my kid, and I will always be there to do what I think is best for him. I don't  believe taking care of a grown capable man like he's incompetent is what's in his best interest. Learning to be independent and gain confidence as a young adult (along with making some minor mistakes you can recover from) is incredibly important. Some kids are risk takers and can't wait to run out into the world, others may need a push to get going. But unless they're in college (or something similar), or have temporarily fell on hard times, I don't think you're doing them any favors.\n\nI couldn't afford dinner a lot of the time after I moved out (and my breakfast and lunch weren't very impressive either); I went to bed hungry almost every night, but my parents would always fed me if I stopped by. I learned a lot from that experience, and I know it was as hard for my parents as it was for me. It was a parenting decision, and a good one for me, even if you don't understand it.",
            "I always liked the idea of charging rent when they have income, saving it all, and then giving it all back when they move out to put down on a house or whatever they need. Be upfront about it, encourages long-term saving and helps everyone.",
            "I saw a post the other day about a kid that was charged rent by his parents, who had been taking that rent money and putting it into a savings account, which they gave their kid once they graduated school. Not only did it teach them how to manage money and the responsibilities that come along with bills, but it set them up financially for their first few years out of school. Just a wonderful job, all around, by the parents.",
            "A couple months after I turned 18 my mom and step dad started making me give rent. My parents are not rich but they always made rent and from what I understand where not in any danger of losing the home we rented.\n\nI was already working since I was 16, when I started paying rent I didn't really appreciate it and my friends also thought it wasn't fair, but in hindsight I think it tought me a little bit on how to budget and what to spend my money on. I understand your argument but I think it can do good as well. Its real life experience that young people are going to need if you want to succeed.",
            "My mom made me pay rent from my very first job **ever.** However, there's a caveat. It was very clear to me that 100% of that money was going into a storage account. \n\nBasically we worked out how much I made in a month. Then we figured how much I ate as snacks, as opposed to core meals, and we went down the list. What could I put into my \"savings\" (read: rent), and what could I buy for myself. Things like hair care products, going out on a date, gas in my car, the snacks I ate, and if I rented a movie \"On Demand.\" \n\nAll of that money I paid to my family, however, came back to me later on. It was never meant to be *taken* from me completely, but rather as a tool to teach me how to budget myself, manage my money for necessities, and, most importantly, how to say no to myself when I wanted something but didn't need it. \n\nThat said I have friends who's parents did much the same, but they handled it *slightly* differently. Essentially they could \"pay\" rent permanently, and they'd be treated more like an independent person, or they could pay rent temporarily like I did and they'd get it back later. \n\nYou'd be surprised; a few of my friends chose to give up some of their paychecks to set their own (within reason) coming and going hours, what they ate and when, and so on. Obviously, like any room mates, they couldn't come home at 2AM making a ton of noise, and since it's still \"home\" there are some rules that wouldn't make sense with a regular room mate, but it's not a bad gig. \n\nThe only time, I think, that it's truly problematic to make your child pay rent is when it: \n\n1. Cuts into their ability to support themselves. \n2. Doesn't teach them anything or prepare them for anything. \n3. Isn't an unfortunate situation of needing the money for the communal home. \n\nIf it teaches them something, doesn't cut into their ability to support themselves (in whatever way they do at home), or it's mandatory because the whole home is poor, I see no issue with asking for rent.",

            "I actually just talked about this. I plan on charging my child rent when she hits the age to work and wants a job. Doing so IMO will teach her how to manage money and all the rent she pays will be put into a secret savings account that will be hers when she leaves for college/moves out. I would never put a legitimate financial strain, but I think it teaches good life financial lessons. Not to mention hopefully a reasonable boost when she leaves and gets the account for herself.",
            "In Asian culture, it's not just rent you are paying, but also life-long financial support to parents (even if they can support themselves) which is called 'filial piety'. Honestly it's a joke and I have moved away from them, Asian culture breeds a lot of narcissistic parents.",

It took me decades to even eat broccoli because it is VERY bitter to my palate, as are brussel sprouts, wine, coffee, asparagus and a few other foods.  I'll eat broccoli without complaint, but that bitterness is incredibly strong and not pleasant at all.  Yes cheese helps, but as they say, it defeats the purpose.  Yes I know not everyone gets a bitter, astringent flavor or sour flavor when they eat foods where some of us do.  Everyone's perceptions are different, if they weren't this would be a pretty bland, boring world where everything was the same.  It's part genetic, part learned behavior, and a lot of 'picky' eaters are just attention seekers. I've also wondered if I destroyed my palate in my youth being a picky eater as a kid, but then being picky became too much effort.  Still many foods are bitter and/or astringent and hard to swallow.\nAn interesting watch on Youtube is Irish People Try, where they try a lot of regional/international foods and two people sitting next to each other can't comprehend how their taste buds are so different with the same foods.

            "To expand on what u/Chrisonthemountain said, there are two types of chihuahuas: apple head and deer head(yes, there are long hair and short hair but that really doesn't make a difference). \n\nApple head are what most people think of when they imagine Chihuahuas. They have bulging eyes, too short a nose, and a myriad of health problems from selective breeding. Sadly, the AKC views this as the correct trait.\n\nDeer head chihuahuas are not a product of selective breeding and as such look healthy and not like God playing a cruel joke. Not only do they actually look like a dog but they body size is usually bigger and more proportionate. They also have very few health problems and their temperament is not aggressive. They bond very closely to a single person and unlike their deformed brothers, only react with anxiety when separated.\n\nFinally, chihuahuas have been around for hundreds of years. They were depicted in paintings by the Toltecs and were burned with their bonded person when said person died. As I mentioned earlier, they don't have many health issues besides the trait Xolo dogs also suffer from: losing their teeth. As such, these dogs can live up to 20 years.\n\nTL;DR: Apple headed chihuahuas are an abomination. Deer headed chihuahuas are actually natural, healthy, and a good companion with a long and rich history. Don't get an AKC approved apple head chihuahua.\n\nPS. I don't even like small dogs. I just feel bad for this one getting shit on all the time.",

I never thought much of them as a dog, but my neighbors have two and, to be honest, they\u2019re a super sweet breed of dog, friendly and people-oriented with behavior that\u2019s more like a cat than anything else.

            "Vet student here \nA widely accepted view in the vet community is that small dogs aren\u2019t more aggressive than large dogs. It is that large dogs face more consequences for aggressive behavior. If a German Shepard has aggression issues, they could potentially seriously injure someone, resulting in fines for the owner and possibly the dog being put down. Large dog owners know this and over check their dogs for aggressive behavior. If a small dog as the same aggression issues, they are a nuisance at best. So small dog owners don\u2019t correct aggression issue as vigorously resulting in the \u201csmall dogs = satan\u201d stereotype.",

Have fun training a Doodle, or dealing with your Bernese dying from literal heart break because you don\u2019t spend enough time with them. Chihuahuas sleep up to 16 hours a day on average, and have crazy life expectancies, and are very low maintenance. They\u2019re the cats of dogs. They\u2019re also closer to the wolf than the Husky! They also have something called *clears throat* personalities? Look at the owners of said dogs to understand their behaviours.

Treat small dogs like you would a big dog, people. Don\u2019t scoop them up without warning (most animals don\u2019t like that anyway), don\u2019t push their buttons and laugh when they snarl at you. \n\nWell bred Chis are honestly really healthy and long lived, aside from the dental issues that arise with age (as it is with many dog breeds).

I told her no she couldn\u2019t bring it in but it could stay outside in our outdoor laundry/garage building. Few days go by and it was gonna get super cold. So my daughter asked again to bring him in because it was cold and I agreed. We brought him in and gave him a bath trimmed his nails. At this point we gave him a name. Peanut. Over the next few months Peanut and I became super close. My kids said he was my spirit animal. He was grouchy and would snip at you till you pet him. Lol. That dog was the best. Sadly he passed away 2 weeks ago. I miss him terribly. 2020 has sucked terribly. In July I had stomach surgery. By the end of July both of my jobs let me go because of said surgery. Then my dog died.

            "As a chihuahua owner/lover I obviously disagree!!! \n\nWhile I agree chihuahuas definitely have a tendency to be more aggressive, I think that definitely comes from them being so small. \n\nThink about it, smaller breeds have to stick up for themselves bc bigger breed dogs (and humans, esp children) tend to underestimate their size and think they can be dragged around and picked up. So being snappy is kind of their only defense mechanism. No one really messes with the big husky bc they have big teeth & can destroy you easily\ud83d\ude02 \n\nOne thing to note about chihuahuas though (and you have to give them credit for) is their loyalty to their human. Once they know you\u2019re not out to get them they\u2019ll ADORE you. The chihuahua I have now rarely snaps at me (the few times she has mostly resulted from getting her nails clipped lol) and she\u2019s legit my best friend. \n\nSo yeah chihuahuas can be assholes but they def aren\u2019t \u201cdisgusting\u201d",

            "I used to think like this too then I found out the real reason behind this behavior.\n\nChihuahuas and certain other small dogs get what's called Small Dog Syndrome, not because the breed is aggressive but because the dog has been conditioned to be. \n\nIn his head, he's just like any other dog and wants the same respect and personal boundaries. But some people see small dogs as harmless toys and with good intentions cuddle them a little too much or overstep boundaries. With a big dog this doesn't happen as often. \n\nEventually the Chihuahua learns the only way that you will respect it's boundaries and avoid squeezing it, forcing it on your lap, or just generally annoying it in a way a bigger dog would not tolerate either, is to snap at you. And eventually snapping leads to biting. \n\nIf your small dog is uncomfortable and wriggling listen to him. Don't ever squeeze them or break their trust by forcing them to do something, even If that something is just sitting on your lap. \n\nWhen in doubt ask yourself, would you do this to a German Shepherd that could bite your arm off? If not, don't do it to a Chihuahua. Just because it's bites are small and harmless doesn't mean it doesn't deserve the same respect as any other dog. \n\nPeace out.",

My sister, doing one of the dumbest things imaginable, jumps on bears back ( i dont know what really happened, but i think she done something to piss bear off ) so he proceeded to bite the fuck outta my hands and feet, and i was basically stunned in fear ( im horrifyed of that dog ) and just sat there while he was biting the he'll outta me.

            "In my city, the homeless people are the ones making the trash especially in downtown and under bridges. Local people put trash cans out there to help the homeless clean up their own trash, but most of the time the homeless ignore the trash cans and continue to junk the streets. Even piss on the concrete when port-a-potties are present.",
            "People have done this. The big issue is a lot of \u201chomeless\u201d are drug addicts and not just hobos down on their luck. It\u2019s hard to pick up trash when you\u2019re picking at your foot for 12 hours.",
            "Easy way to do this is to do a refundable deposit on plastic bottles for example. Homeless people will go round collecting them for a bit of extra money",
            "Although this is a good idea in theory, the reality is that many (if not most) homeless people aren't homeless because they need a job.  They are homeless because they have debilitating mental illness that prevents them from getting or keeping a job.  \n\nOne prominent diagnosis among the homeless is schizophrenia, a mental disorder that completely devastates the vast majority of those who suffer from it.  Auditory and visual hallucinations, disorder of thought, disruption in communication ability, and depending on the particular form of schizophrenia, possibly severe paranoia.  The hallucinations that they experience are not the same kind as someone who has dropped a couple of tabs of acid.  They are very real to them, meaning they usually can't distinguish between someone really talking to them and the other voices they are hearing.  The same applies to visual hallucinations.  The demon they hear and see on the other side of the room are indistinguishable from the friend standing next to them.  \n\nAs far as getting them to pick up trash, even if they could muster enough thought-clarity to actually show up for work, it would be short-lived.  All of their symptoms would scatter their thoughts to the point that they might forget what they were supposed to be doing, time would be meaningless to them, the CIA chasing them would cause them to run and hide, God might command them to do something else, etc.\n\nThis doesn't even include homeless people who suffer serious physical ailments.  For example, a not insignificant percentage of homeless people have one or more limbs amputated, often as a result of a war injury.  In these people, severe PTSD is likely to accompany the amputations.\n\nAs far as homeless people who simply need a job and who have no debilitating mental or physical issues, this might actually have a chance of working for some people.  However, even these people might present challenges to such an idea.  A dive bar that I once frequented allowed me to become acquainted with several homeless people who would gather enough change to come in for a PBR or two.  The one or two who were generally \"normal\" had made a decision that they would rather be homeless and eek out the minimal amount of cash to stay alive than report to a job everyday.",

            "Some cities around the U.S have programs like this that bring income to the homeless and even help get them real jobs making enough to support themselves. It\u2019s a great idea and I 100% agree more large cities should start doing this. Some people just need to be proverbially kicked into gear to get their life back on track. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that many homeless people are very mentally ill, which is usually how they ended up in their situation and are unfit to hold down a job, or they have a dependency on a substance (drugs, alcohol, etc) so there\u2019s no telling how willing they might be to pick up a trash bag and clean up their community. \n\nI digress however, I will always support this idea so that any homeless person can find a way to make some money and a future for themselves.",

When I used to do it back in my rough days, I would just swipe bottles and cans out of dumpsters and trash cans, because you need to walk like 10 city blocks to get the same amount of loot you find in one dumpster/trash can. EVERYONE did this. We would often dump garbage cans on the ground, spilling trash everywhere, to make it easier to get the bottles and cans.\n\nIn order to make enough money doing that to live though you wouldn't be able to sleep (and there's only so much garbage to go around, and if you don't think people would fight about it, well, we did fight). So I at least pretty much only used it for drugs, and occasionally food.\n\nI guarantee you that if we paid homeless people to pick up trash, it would be the same as with recycling. They would break into dumpsters to steal trash to turn in, and dump garbage all over the sidewalk so they could pick and choose the densest and most valuable garbage, and then they'd go turn that in and leave the rest on the ground, and they'd fight over it, and use the money for drugs.\n\nGetting a place to stay with someone who insisted I get a job was what got me back on my feet. If you want to help homeless people, give them temporary housing that they're not allowed to keep unless they have a job (designed to kick them out after they'll have enough money saved up to make it on their own). Give businesses and landlords tax breaks for hiring and leasing to homeless people coming from these programs. (And fix the damn drug laws so it's only a crime to sell the stuff or use it around kids. Buying and using drugs should not be a barrier to getting employment - because we used the drugs since our lives were shit and they made life bearable. I stopped AFTER I had more stability in my life - making people stop in ORDER to get stability is bad looks.)\n\nHonestly, you \"liberals\" who are like \"oooo instead of helping homeless people get back on their feet permanently, let's throw them dollar bills for shit like begging and picking up trash, so they can have just enough to eat and fuel their drug habits but never enough to get their lives together!\" and then smugly walk back to your air conditioned homes sipping your lattes, patting yourselves on the back the whole way for being so caring and woke - you make me angry.\n\nWhen I was on the street I hated people like you, because you're the biggest hypocrites of all.

The copious amounts of blog articles, IG posts and Youtube videos of their childrens lives from the first weeks of pregnancy onward has come to a point where people are getting pregnant on purpose in order get views, they are adopting kids from other countries in order to get praise, they are buying puppies they don't train because it's clickbait. I can bypass the other platforms to do with makeup and fashion and travel and fitness without much trouble because it's not a genre that relies on minors or animals to drive revenue.\n\nAt the very least, once these kids are old enough, they should be able to get a percentage of that money back from their parents as earnings during their time as a Youtube content pawn.",

I was so disgusted by all of them.\n\nKids would literally beg their parents to stop, go home, or quit. My final straw was producing a video for a little boy who does unboxing videos and halfway through he just started sobbing- like full body, choking sobs. Parent snapped that he was just tired and needed a nap so I shut down production. Parents INSISTED that the kid was fine and to let him sleep for a bit. They came back after a couple hours and made the kid(who had the fakest smile frozen on his face) apologize and he ended it with a very small \"I didn't mean to ruin everything. Please don't hate me.\"\n\nReported it to the head of the department and requested to never work with that department again.

Those parents are driving the most expensive cars, living in mansions, and wearing all name brand because no one regulates child labor/earnings for social videos. Its tragic.",
            "One problem with dividing income by contribution is that not all people agree on how much someone contributed to an episode. Let's say Kid #1 had twice more camera time than Kid #2, but Kid #1 was sleeping most of the time he was on camera, and Kid #2 was literally doing backflips and responding to live Q/A with the chat, who deserves what percentage?\n\nIt's going to be difficult for the parent, Kid #1, and Kid #2 to determine what is the appropriate dividing of the income, but if the government does it for them, what does the government know about who contributed most?\n\nI also sense that there is going to be an internal battle that might divide the family.\n\nWhy not let the kid and parent voluntarily negotiate the amount each is going to get rather than the state mandatorily assigning a number and division by force? The former option is much better in my opinion and requires less government involvement in media.\n\nI am always skeptical when bringing in the government to distribute income, because the government is insanely wasteful of resources, is terribly slow and time inefficient, is often ineffective, and sometimes even applies unnecessary force. Usually their involvement is with good intentions, but the end result is lackluster.\n\nTo see how the government handles dividing of resources, just look at child custodies and divorces.

You see some that put out daily videos, when do these children get the chance to actually be children? To play without cameras and people watching, to spend time with their family and just relax?

One day I was looking through my work\u2019s hashtag on Instagram, saw that this girl had an Instagram that was completely controlled by her mother. The bio said something along the lines of \u201cAspiring Influencer\u201d. It comes off as very weird that her mother, this girl was 10 at the time, is advertising her daughter online as an influencer. If I recall correctly, the captions too were really weird, like promoting products. \n\nAnother friend of mine just recently had a baby, and she made an Instagram for her child where she posts photos of her kid. It\u2019s funny because she captions her child\u2019s photos with things like \u201cmommy is posting about me again, I don\u2019t like it!\u201d. Now, my friend isn\u2019t profiting off of her baby, but one day that kid will be old enough to realize that having an Instagram run by your parents when you were 6 months old is pretty weird. \n\nAnyways, just my opinion.

            "After we had our first kid the youtube algo started suggesting videos of mommy vloggers. The amount of people out there who insist on traveling with their 2 month old for views is fucking disgusting.

It was filmed pre pandemic but still, way to risk your newborn getting sick in a place where you\u2019re not insured fucking morons. It was really interesting because most of their videos showed the flight and then the trip itself. They didn\u2019t film a single video after they arrived in London and I can only guess it\u2019s because their kid got sick. It\u2019s also just terrible parenting advice.

            "I recently asked my parents and neighbor who is the director of my local health department on whether parents have complete and full control over a child\u2019s body. \n\nI asked the neighbor, if a kid comes in for a vaccine, which the parents want them to have, but the kid is extremely defiant and does not want the vaccine, and is actively running away and fighting and preventing anyone from holding him for the shot, what do you have the nurses do?\n\nDo the nurses use force? Have the parents use force? Or do the nurses say \u201ctalk to your kid and come back later?\u201d\n\nOr do they refuse to administer the vaccine if the kid doesn\u2019t want it?\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong here, I\u2019m all for vaccines, but vaccines and minor health records and sex education and WIC and other things is about all the health department here does, so vaccines are just one of the few things that is applicable. If my neighbor was a nurse at a clinic or hospital, I\u2019d ask what would she do if a kid didn\u2019t want unnecessary surgery that the parents did want. \n\nSo, my neighbor said that situation has never came up. So she could not answer. She wouldn\u2019t know what to do. She did say vaccines are important and I clarified that was just the only relevant thing she was able to do. \n\nMy parents, on the other hand, flat out said they own the child\u2019s body. Whatever the parents want done, is getting done. If they have to hold them down, or knock them out with anesthesia, or whatever. They say a child does not know what\u2019s good for them, and for a younger child, that\u2019s right. But I\u2019m also talking about unnecessary surgeries, like a tonsillectomy, which is beneficial but not needed. Or plastic surgery, which is purely cosmetic. \n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure if doctors would refuse surgery if the kid didn\u2019t want it. I know doctors would refuse surgeries if the doctors themselves don\u2019t think it\u2019s required, but if a doctor sees the benefit, but the kid is vehemently trying to avoid the surgery, what would the doctor do? \n\nAgain, young kids do need guidance. But once that start having a mind of their own, for all optional choices, they should have a say in the matter.\n\nBut because legally they don\u2019t, it\u2019s perfectly fine for parents to use their kids in vlogs. Acting is one of the only things a child can work in, besides helping in a family owned business. But child actors don\u2019t get paid, their parents do. The parents can save that money, or spend it towards the child\u2019s interests, or waste it. It\u2019s their money, not the child\u2019s. \n\nAnd that\u2019s flat out ridiculous.",

It was a hard decision, I'm not going to lie, but my husband and I agreed, I needed to survive.\n\nI think the decision would have been, slightly, easier if we hadn't had any kids yet because I'm a fully formed human and the baby isn't.

            "I agree on principle. The notion that it's somehow more of a tragedy when a kid dies than when an adult dies is supremely fucked up on the basis that the mere potential for a life is more important than an established life with more connections to other people, more memories, more likely to be a fixture of society, more likely to have dependents, and more of an emotional bond. The odds are that the kid is going to grow up and be just as disposable as the adult, and just because we look at the kid's life with rose-colored glasses and compare that to the adult's life, which may have had some negative aspects, we pretend that the kid's life won't also have negative aspects just because they haven't happened yet.\n\nNo. Fuck that. You've got more opportunities to have more kids, if that's what you want. That baby would have to have a lot of time and effort poured into it before you've get even comparable returns out of it.\n\nMy wife miscarried at 9 weeks, and while it's sad for her, I'd much rather that loading bar of life fail at 25% than get all the way to 99% and *then* fail. If I'm moving a file over onto a new hard drive, I'd rather my computer tell me that there isn't enough space at the very beginning than fill up all of the remaining space and *then* tell me that there isn't actually enough space.

Also, I don't want to give up my life for someone who doesn't actually exist yet and I'm not sorry about that opinion at all.

Like there's Barbie movies too in which Barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas Ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. \n\nIn Peppa Pig, specifically, the father of Peppa is an engineer. He has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. It's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. Meanwhile \"Mommy Pig\" is awesome and pretty much flawless. The whole thing is pretty insidious.\n\nFrom an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? Like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.",

            "Having 2 daughters I've watched A LOT of Peppa Pig and I will say that tjis show in particular isn't as bad as some others. The mother pig just doesn't serve as big of a plot point and spends most of it just being \"there\", while Daddy Pig takes actions (folding paper airplanes, trying to hang a picture, riding Peppa's bike) that wind up with humerous twists for plots. There is one episode I remember that Mommy Pig wants to pick blackberries like she did as a girl and winds up caught in the blackberry briar. I think that it is the lighthearted, minor misadventures-format of the show that leads to the major player making a minor fool of themselves. \n\nOther examples:\nMrs. Rabbit works at every occupation in town and occasionally does things with a helicopter I would classify as \"bumbling\". She also tends to freak out needlessly on occasion. \n\nDoctor Hamster (maybe her name? The vet.) loses her pet tortise several times despite it being a tortise.\n\nMommy Pig gets flat-out insulted by Peppa on several occasions and just takes it in stride (appropriate since it comes from a preschooler, but makes her seem simple).\n\nSitcoms in the 90s were terrible about this. It seems like they're making improvements but they have to keep some bumbling in some of the characters to move the plot.",

We\u2019d just gotten pregnant and I thought that was pretty profound at the time.  Never really noticed, but after a while the pattern across certain shows was clear.  Sure, it might get a laugh but the message is not good.  \n\nAlong the same lines, shows like Ryan Toy Videos were giving my kids the impression that a Mom and Dad buy their kids every new toy and dedicate their entire lives to playing with them.  It\u2019s not realistic.  I saw this happen first hand, and my kids were already living pretty large.  \n\nHow your perspective on some things change when you actually have kids...  I don\u2019t believe in not letting other parents decide what their kids watch or listen to - that\u2019s condescending and insulting to others.

            "I kind of disagree with your analysis. I'm a dad. \n\nOften parents or adults are seen as a bit bumbling, especially from the kids perspective, but rarely are they actually idiots.\n\nYou give Peppa Pig as an example, but as you say, daddy pig isn't actually stupid, nor is mummy pig exceptionally smart. Daddy pig's flaws are generally that he claims to be an expert in everything and doesn't ask for help.  Daddy pig is actually good at quite a lot of things, but not so many as he claims.  Mummy gets to be the disciplinarian, and can be a bit childish, and the more severe, overly cautious and strict.  Daddy's whimsy and carefree nature balances the two out.  Neither are perfect.\n\nDaddy pig is more likely to be willing to laugh at himself, be self-deprecating and be less serious.  Mummy is more likely to be self-conscious, serious and nervous. So yeah, Daddy pig gets to be the brunt of more jokes, but because he invites them, laughs them off, and lightens the mood. \n\nYou're looking for things to pick at.  Daddy and Mummy pig are not role models for kids in the first place, and even if they were, they're not particularly disempowering. Peppa is the role model, and honestly my 5-year old daughter often says that she doesn't like how Peppa complains about everything.  While I find that Peppa's behavior is unnecessarily gendered in many cases (Us girls want to play fairy princesses, not icky boy things like dinosaurs and fire trucks), the majority of things that she acts as a role model for aren't gendered things, and most of those involve George in some way or another.  Or the overarching messages from parents and other characters, some of which are going to be male and some are female. \n\nBut I think this is the real trope in these shows.  Dad's are generally goofy and fun, but very protective of their kids.  Moms are generally strict and nervous, and need to be calmed down by a goofy dad. \n\nI think this comes from the way that generally we leave mom to raise the kids, so she gets to do the more constant correction, moms are the green beans while dads are more the dessert. \n\nAlso, I strongly disagree that girls are heroic and boys are foolish.  I think you're projecting your own insecurities here. I think about most every kids show that my daughter watches and it's just not the case.\n\nNormally what I see is that there's three flavors of show.  One is the ones that have specifically decided to show a female lead.  These shows try their hardest to make the show kind of balanced. Peppa Pig is one of those, something like Dora the Explorer is another. \n\nAnother is one where they're trying their best to be fully inclusive.  A show like Dinosaur train is a good example (and a show I really do like) where it can be a bit stilted, but it tries to show each character with a specific personality.  (Buddy is different from the rest of the family but brave and smart, Tiny is smart and conscious about her size but is gregarious and good at dealing with her insecurities, Shiny is skilled but vain and prissy, Don is weird but caring and smart in his own way). \n\nThe last category, and this is what I find is most common, is the \"standard\" type show, where most characters are boys, but there are token girls, and the girls are forgotten about until it's time for them to be \"EMPOWERED\" and then they're forgotten about again.  I think of something like \"Paw Patrol\" and nearly all of the shows I remember growing up with. \n\nI much prefer the second variety.  The first is something I can deal with because in my viewing they actually DO try to be fair to everyone.  Rarely do I see a show where they're actively making fun of boys.  \n\nThe last is the worst because it shows girls kind of as a sideshow, and that's where the boys do become bumbling idiots and the girl saves the day, and then is ignored for 5 more episodes while the boys do everything until the featured girl episode where she fixes all the bumbling boy's problems.\n\nBut Peppa Pig isn't a problem, I find it's an annoying show, but there's nothing wrong with Daddy Pig at least relative to Mummy.",

I wish more people would believe this and embrace/live it!",
            "Honestly, that's not the problem I have with Peppa Pig. I hate that Peppa's character is so mean and bratty, and I feel that it sets a bad example for kids, and I definitely don't want my kids watching it.\n\nAlso, the shows that you are mentioning as being empowering to girls are made *for* girls. That's their target audience, so of course there's going to be a message of female empowerment. I believe that's perfectly fine, given that for so long, women and girls have not felt empowered. They've been told that they can't do the things that men/boys can do. I think building up the self-esteem of little girls is great!\n\nThere are plenty of TV shows that are targeted towards young boys that empowered them. Boys have always looked up to superheroes, and they still do. I don't see anything wrong with that, and it's not just live-action movies with unrealistically handsome men; there are animated superhero series that come on all the time. Not to mention shows like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Pokemon in which the protagonists are *boys*. There are also shows like Paw Patrol, PJ Masks, Gravity Falls, and Star vs. The Forces of Evil in which both boys *and* girls are empowered and do things to save the day.\n\nI don't feel that female empowerment is an issue at all. I still hate Peppa Pig though.",

Think Red from that 70'S show, he's so far in the opposite direction that it's funny (especially considering the culture of the 70s, free love and hippies). That's why a character like his is so funny in that 70s show but not Full House.\n\nIdk about Peppa Pig specifically but in sitcoms it's a form of role reversal from cultural traditions and that's why it's funny. You see it with everything and not just dads. Think Bobby from King of the Hill, Meg or Stewie from Family Guy (which play on tropes already), Lisa from the Simpsons.\n\nIt's a form of satire where it's so far opposite from what people believe to be true in real life that it's funny",

            "I think that's an issue for shows aimed at both boys and girls. I agree with you that shows like Peppa Pig definitely should improve how they show men in their show, because women do seem to save the day in that, but a lot of shows aimed at boys do the same thing but with boys (like Ben 10, Bob The Builder, etc). There never seems to be a show that shows men and women equally saving the day.\n\nI think it would be nice if shows for kids could just show that men and women can be equally good at stuff, as opposed to it seeming like in the shows aimed at girls, the girls are good and save the day, and in the shows aimed at boys, boys are good and save the day. It shouldn't be made that cut and dry. ",

            "I think there's a flip-side to this particular argument to be made as well. I want to preface this by saying that I think you're right that fathers are not often portrayed as competant--and I think this can be chalked up to being an easy laugh and a recurring comedic situation. I think it's worth mentioning, though, that it goes hand in hand with who is portrayed as the \"fun parent\". Dads get to be fun, and moms are often the voice of authority, more no-nonsense types. It's still a misrepresentation toward both, going for a stereotypical pattern that we can recognize and maybe get a chuckle or two out of as a viewer. A trope. But things like this, to some degree, might indicate something more deeply rooted in society and culture that states (even if untrue) that we receive different things from each parent based on their gender. Dad plays airplane, mom kisses boo-boos, dad let's you eat junk food, mom makes you eat your broccoli before leaving the table, dad watches monster movies with you and Mom comforts you through your nightmares.\n\n\nAgain, none of this is necessarily true.

The Male characters are always the 'smart' ones, Edmond the elephant being a clever clogs, Mummy Pig always going to Daddy Pig or Grandpa Pig when there's a technical problem she needs solved, like fixing the computer. In the last episode I watched, Peppa asked if, when George grows up,  she would be able to have a ride in his rocket. Why can't Peppa have or fly her own rocket?\n\nAdditionally, you say \"I don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while[...]\". Every once in a while? So I guess the majority you want the boys to save the day? Wouldn't a better change be a relative even breakdown of saving the day?\n\nI think the bigger problem with the show is that Peppa's rude and arrogant behaviour is constantly rewarded, as if it's something to emulate.",

            "I totally see your point and in the otherway : it's king of a problem for the little girl too. When all the girls model you have are meant to be perfect and flawless (physically and/or in their attitude) where is the place for feminine flaws ?

At the reception, I had so many relatives and family friends embrace me and shower their love on me and my spouse in the most emotional way. I'd never seen most of them that open, and it rarely happened again. I would never trade that experience for anything. I didn't know how much they all truly cared about my happiness.

For example my mum made the cake and we hosted the reception in my parents garden.\n\nWeddings are  just extraordinarily expensive for what they are.

            "Don't know if it's been said before, and I am also not of the older generation, but I can't help but wonder if the whole idea of having strippers and bachelor parties is a result of how marriage was viewed in the past or in hollywood. It seems like there was a culture of women pressuring men to marry them and men not valuing marriage as much so women were ring hunters and men got forced into it. So the stripper was the \"last hurrah\" before the \"ol ball n chain\" they were about to marry prevented them from having fun. Now, the culture about marriage is shifting as it is not necessary so the people who do get married probably genuinely want to and don't think of marriage as \"the end of fun\".",

It was a nice relaxing 3-day vacation away from civilization, until one of the grooms suggested 'ordering girls'. That started a ball rolling, and a bunch of the dude-bro groomsmen started pushing for it. I rationalized that we're so far away from town, and if we got 'girls', I mean... not to judge, but we're in cottage country. Do cottage towns have 'girls'? C'mon, we didn't go to Las Vegas or anything.\n\nAnyway, after being called a fa*got, they got them to come from an hour away, and the only person who got their dick sucked was the groomsman who pushed for them.

My husband called me right after it happened (meanwhile I was at my bachelorette party) and was almost in tears because he said he felt like he was basically sexually assaulted and hated that it was disrespectful to me.

In fact, I even tried to post the *opposite* opinion and the power-tripping mods on here wouldn't approve it. So, it isn't remotely unpopular.\n\nAlso, why so are Redditors so deadly serious about bachelor parties? Some people look at it like a mildly embarrassing, humorous tradition that acknowledges commitment. Also, according to some people's interpretation of marriage, it's supposed to be the last woman you ever see naked, including porn. So, that is why the theme of it makes sense, at least.\n\nSo, it's essentially a ceremony that acknowledges men have some sexual interest in other women, even after they are married. It then teases that fact with a woman who gives you extremely light, pretend sexual interest that you then \"resist.\" In quotes, because obviously, sex isn't actually on the table. It's just a show.\n\nIf you want to do it, it's fine. Or, if your partner is uncomfortable with it, no one is saying it *has* to be done.   I'm just tired of the not-so-subtle moralizing around a ceremony that isn't supposed to be serious to begin with.",

The strippers did like a humiliation to the groom and all the groomsmen. Then they were like your the youngest here you should pay for a lap dance I told them no. So then my cousins paid for a lap dance for me then after the lap dance the stripper propositioned  me to pay for sex in front of my cousins. I told her no then for like next half hour my cousin just kept trying get me to pay for sex by calling me gay. I finally had enough so left and went to the casino and won 300 bucks at blackjack. Later I found out my cousins cheated on his wife with a prostitute on the regular but his wife is still with him.",
            "I went to a friend's bachelor party and his best man did indeed take him to a strip club where he had a miserable time. All he wanted to do was go home to his fiance and his best man kept buying him lap dances that he didn't want and felt guilty about. On top of that he was incredibly drunk.  And who had to babysit him and his hangover the next morning? Not his best man. Me and his fiance. \n\nI feel like if you're going to throw someone a party, you should do something you think they'd enjoy, not force some antiquated rite of passage in them for your own enjoyment.",

            "I was in a band that played at a bachelor party at one point, the strippers were putting bills over their coochies and riding the grooms face. No idea how people can do shit like that before they get married. Isn't that what you do when you're single and full of piss and vinegar?",

            "Strippers in general are a kinda trashy activity enjoyed but immature man children. I dont know a single person who I respect that thinks strippers are cool or a worthy waste of their money. Now this isn't to put down actual strippers, that's a difficult job and I have nothing against them. I just don't really care to pay for their services. For a Batchelor party though it is especially weird. This whole tradition of trying to get the groom to almost cheat before he gets married is so bizarre. It's really childish. My Batchelor party we had a great meal and a limo and my best man gave me a bunch of psychedelics and we went to an escape room which I did surprisingly well at considering my mental state, then a pub crawl for the rest of the night.",

            "Agreed, it is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard of in my life. Whether men or women do it. If you want a stripper you clearly should not be getting married if you want anybody other than your fiancee. Nobody ever agrees with me so thank you. Glad I am not the only one who thinks so.",
            "I am in my late 30s and have stood in a lot of my buddy\u2019s weddings.  Only a couple of the bachelor parties ended up at strip clubs. And those were the guys who were always pushing the group to end the night at the strip club when we were single. One of them got a blowjob and ended up not getting married.",
            "I sorted by most controversial and it's pretty much only people respectfully disagreeing with you and saying that it's not weird, but literally just for a good laugh and fun time and that if a spouse or fianc\u00e9e are okay with it then it is completely fine. \n\nNobody called you a low testosterone simp, nor did *anyone* call themselves alpha or attack you in any way. If you took any of those comments to mean that, maybe you should look into your insecurities. \n\nMaybe let people live their lives and enjoy their time and stop being so judgy about a sexual / personal relationship that you have absolutely no part in. If it's not for you, it's not for you. Doesn't make it weird. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I kind of understand it from a \"party\" aspect...but the sexuality just makes it so disgusting to me.  All I could think about was that I was surrounded by boners and it freaked me the fuck out.",

Is that a big number? In raw numbers it is, and 10,000 people reading their response to it is a lot of revenue. But is it a lot in percent? Not at all. 10,000 out of 336 million active accounts on Twitter alone is paltry. That\u2019s 0.002% of accounts. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s a good thing that people get offended at some of these things.

            "I remember listening to a talkback radio show that was aimed at an older, conservative demographic. The topic of conversation revolved around a person or persons who wanted to ban the word \"man\" because it offended them. This topic obviously got the host and his listeners fired up as it meant he believed he would no longer be able to say words like ,\n'MANchester', 'MAN-made', 'reMANded', etc.\n\nI feel this sort of anger is so misdirected and is exactly what OP is talking about. It was just an incredibly small minoroty of peoinsi that seem like they represent a larger group of people by the way they label themselves and because of the \"viral\" nature of social media.\n\nI feel like if people actually consider the reality of the argument, they would actually see how unrealistic it is and realise that its not even worth thinking about. Nobody is going to ban you from saying a word. How could you even police something like that? Especially a word that appears insde other words that dont give it a gender context (seriously, \"remanded\" doesnt have anything to do with men or women so why would any rational person take offence to that word being used as it is intended?).  Instead people just see it as an accepted argument of \"libtard snowflakes\" and use ot to fuel their bias towards left-leaning groups because of other arguments that they actually value as being important.",

It's just that in the past 60 years, we've seen a relatively rapid change in what people consider offensive or not offensive. So now there are people who are like \"that's offensive\" mixed with people who are like \"that was never offensive when I was younger, why are you so offended by it now?\" The reverse is also true for some things - we're much more okay with sex and sexuality than we were back when a woman wearing a swimsuit in public would be arrested for indecent exposure.\n\nThat plus the whole media and internet thing means that you can say pretty much anything and find someone who is offended by it - and that quickly turns into a \"people outraged about thing\" story if their reaction is newsworthy.\n\nAnd it gets even muddier when people who disagree with a thing but aren't \"outraged\" (or *are* outraged but it's totally justified) just get labelled as such by the opposition to discredit their opinion. Trumpism sees this a lot, with all the stupid and horrible things he says and does being objected to, and then his supporters go \"the liberals are just offended by everything.\"",

There is little dialogue for a lot of the movie's run time. Sure there are sound effects and limited dialogue, but a large part of the movie is relying on the visuals for the story. \n\n2. The visuals are astonishing. Everything is done well enough that it keeps you engaged as you watch the movie. The world created is convincing and immersive, it feels like a place that exists. The attention to detail is fantastic, things like the scratches and wear marks on WALL-E, the textures of the different materials, the way dust and gases look and behave. All things that could have been ignored or done to look good enough are done to look great. Every frame is artwork in the movie.\n\n3. The story is good. The setups have payoffs. The characters have natural and satisfying arcs. The pacing for the story is great.\n\n4. The use of sound effects is great. Since the movie isn't very dialogue heavy for the first half, they have to use sound effects to convey messages and help tell the story that is unfolding, and they do it in a believable way.",

            "I'm confused by your argument. Firstly, no one is equating sexual liberation to Malala Yousafzai. Those are two different kinds of female struggles on two largely different scales, and we're allowed to have both. Frankly, I think this goes beyond female sexual liberation and into fighting a pointlessly prudish society, but yes, female sexual liberation is part of it. That's a topic for another time. \n\nSecondly, how can you say you \"don't care if you sell nudes\" but also judge someone for selling nudes? Are you dating someone who sells nudes? If a person who sells nudes gets into a relationship, it's between them and their partner to decide if they welcome that into the relationship. It's totally valid that you don't want your partner to sell nudes, but what does that have to do with you? I don't judge people who want a polyamorous relationship for being polyamorous just because I want to be with someone monogamous. I don't judge someone who wants kids for wanting kids just because I don't, and probably shouldn't date someone who does. My advice to you would be... Don't date an Onlyfans user. Problem solved. \n\nHer value isn't diminished by you not wanting to date her. She's just making money and enjoying life. She's not claiming to be fucking Malala. Never heard anyone say that.",

I\u2019d like to share an anecdote from my friend who used sites like \u2018seeking arrangement\u2019 which is basically rich dudes paying beautiful young women for their company and sometimes escort activities. At first, when we were early 20s, she felt it was empowering and hell her rent in London was constantly paid and she took me out to mega fancy restaurants and we\u2019d discuss how making money out of men was liberating and celebrated that freedom. Now we\u2019re hitting 30, and she has now spoke of her regret, and how it has left her feeling ashamed and hollow, she\u2019s not sure why, but she feels very differently about the whole thing now and is trying to forget. It is different to selling images totally, but maybe it\u2019s close enough. I honestly feel a bit guilty for encouraging her and saying it was empowering because I was following the discourse of one branch of feminism. It\u2019s one persons experience, but it has changed the way I see this sort of \u2018business\u2019. No judgement for those who do, but it has made me think twice about doing it all myself and left me wondering if there is a wider psychological impact down the line!\n\nEdit: I shared this to add another perspective to a discussion on women\u2019s \u2018empowerment\u2019, please stop assuming my friend is a certain way with a certain personality, so far you\u2019ve all got it wrong and it reads as being really unkind and super judgemental.",

The two are not comparable. They do not impact each other. If I don't finish my dinner, it does not get teleported into the mouth of a starving child. If a woman on the internet whaps her boobs out, it does not diminish Malala Yousafazi's strength and accomplishments. Nor is the former disrespecting the latter because of the scale of their 'cause'.\n\nI'm a big believer in 'An none it harm, do what you will'.

            "Great unpopular opinion! I appreciate having an avenue to discuss certain topics like this. As such, I\u2019m going to try to explain why I think it is empowerment, and do my best to remain civil - this is an important topic.\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to say that I think empowerment is as much individual as it is social. If a woman feels empowered by selling pictures of herself, then it is in fact, empowerment. She\u2019s developed more love for her body and has evidence people would literally pay to look at it.\n\nSecond of all, I think a lot of the volatility of these comments, and ultimately the root cause of the opinion comes from a long history of demonizing sexuality in women. In topics like these it\u2019s very important to ask yourself \u201cHow would I feel if a man did this?\u201d And I\u2019m sure a lot of people would respond, \u201cThat\u2019s fine I guess, just not for me.\u201d Which is EXACTLY the sort of empowerment that women are looking for when it comes to their body, and their choices - look how prevalent topics that pertain to those two things are in mainstream media. Ultimately, when a woman decides to do something such as sell a nude, she\u2019s suddenly scrutinized to hell about it, the comments in this thread is proof enough. \n\nLastly, I want to come back to empowerment. It\u2019s really important to understand why woman empowerment is such a large issue. There are plenty of places in the world where women have far less rights than even say, the United States, but it\u2019s not a topic that stretch purely to what a woman legally can and cannot do. It\u2019s also socially what a woman can do - it\u2019s needs developing in a lot of areas frankly.\n\nI wanted to say thank you again for writing out the topic. I had to spend awhile thinking about my response, so it was a great prompt for me. That being said, it\u2019s pretty early for me and I\u2019m not usually a very eloquent person, so I hope you forgive me if my point doesn\u2019t come across very well - I\u2019m always happy to elaborate!\n\nAnd before I post, I wanted to ask that if anyone felt compelled to respond, that they mull over the prompt and try their best to remain civil as I have. Thanks!",

            "This is both a bad take and a very popular opinion.",
            "I\u2019ve always found female empowerment to be the exact opposite of what the mainstream says it is. Female empowerment is owning your body and not letting it be a cheap commodity for people to buy; it is being judged by your intellectual abilities and skills without the negative influence of being ogled by men.   How is it female empowerment to be entirely dependent on random men being able to see all that you have? It\u2019s just another form of prostitution, though they will never admit that.\n\n\nGuess what? It\u2019s natural for people (men or women) to have thoughts about the opposite sex when overly exposed to them, so it\u2019s up to yourself to limit this. You can\u2019t demand men stop looking at you like an object if all you do is look like one, it shows a lack of self respect. People have lost their standards. Female empowerment is being proud of who you are and what you are able to do, not what you look like. The latter is only shallow.",
            "So I am all for women controlling their own sexualization. I think the real problems arise when men control it or women sexualize themselves solely for the pleasure of men. The book Female Chauvinist Pigs by Ariel Levy is a really excellent book to read if you have any interest in expanding your mind on this subject, OP. She points out the problems with women claiming everything is empowerment when in fact some of these ventures do more harm for women than good.\n\nFor example, a women selling her own nudes and taking all of the profit to help pay her bills/survive IS empowering. Whereas women flashing the camera on a Girls Gone Wild video would bring them under the category of female chauvinist pigs. \n\nAlso, the documentary Hot Girls Wanted may help you understand why women should have more autonomy and control over the porn industry.",

            ">you just want easy money without somebody judging you for it\n\nAnd why is that wrong? Literally everyone in the world wants easy money, if they can do it by selling nudes, so be it.\n\nAlthough I agree about it not having anything to do with female empowerment, it's one thing to be proud of your body and getting the point across that you don't have to be ashamed of it, but doing it for profit doesn't exactly scream activism.",
            "Ok but consider this: the definition of the word \"empowerment\" literally means that an individual has (more) power to do whatever they want (in this case with their body). So yes, if a woman wants to sell her nudes, that's her decision, and by doing so she empowers herself. She can also be empowered by other people who aren't judging her for her decision.\n\nWhich means that selling nudes is female empowerment, and so is wearing a burqa, and so is not shaving your legs or whatever.

            "So here\u2019s my perspective. In high school, I did what most girls did and sent nudes to her boyfriend. I only had one serious boyfriend throughout high school - this was someone I thought I loved and could trust. He ended up showing my photos to anyone that cared to look. It was upsetting and I was alienated from my friends, ostracized by family (this happened in a small town). He got to look cool and I was left to feel like shit. When I turned 18, I began posting my own nudes on tumblr because I wanted to regain control of the situation. If everyone could access my nudes, then he wouldn\u2019t have anymore leverage to feel cool. There was nothing he could show to people that they couldn\u2019t see on tumblr or reddit. It shifted the power paradigm for me personally. I feel in control of my body and sexuality by being open with it. Some women are empowered by modesty and that\u2019s awesome too.

Half the world sees Burqas as opression, body hair is disgusting, makeup is catfishing, abortion is a sin, dressing like a nun, dressing like a slut, prude, whore all of these have been debated to death. \n\nStill. \nStill. \nPeople won't get the simple concept of- my body my choice. \n\nIt's a woman's body if she wants to make money off it or if she wants to keep her body private- it's her choice and that choice is empowering. \n\nEmpowerment here is having the choice to do whatever the fuck you want to do with your body despite what the world says. You're not feeding someone's body or nourishing it or caring for it or handling the growing pains and struggles that come with it. And since a person's existence doesn't and shouldn't revolve around society's validation, they can do what they feel like with their body.\n\nWhen that choice is ripped off of a woman she loses her power to choose- which is not empowerment. \n\nAlso it's between buyer and seller. You don't like nudes being sold? Don't buy them. If you're buying them, don't judge the seller. \n\nLike damn stop judging what other people do with their lives.

In this way, we often find it presented socially as something that a woman needs to reserve. This restriction that we expect women to uphold places limitations in women regarding what they can do with their own bodies. Have sex/be sex positive and she\u2019s a whore, don\u2019t have sex and you\u2019re a good and virtuous woman. Either way, her quality is somewhat reliant on how she uses and treats her body. Taking ownership of that body and sexualizing it at will means that she has agency over her body above and beyond what is expected of her. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a matter of free will and resisting cultural norms meant to repress her ability to use her body. The fact that the limitations placed on her are sexual in nature is of no consequence. She\u2019s not forcing herself on anyone, she doesn\u2019t owe anyone access, and if she can find compensation doing something that she would otherwise be expected to keep hidden then why wouldn\u2019t she? We all sell the rights to our bodily autonomy by selling our labour and time to employers anyway. How is selling access to images of your chest any different? If you think that it is, I think there\u2019s a pretty safe chance it\u2019s because you feel like sex is something that women owe to men. A woman doesn\u2019t owe virtue to people, in the same way that you can\u2019t expect a woman you just met not to have had 40 sexual partners before you met. If that rubs you the wrong way, then that\u2019s fine. Just find someone more to your liking. That\u2019s a matter of autonomy for you too!

That's consistent, he won't even look at them outside the tub but in his bath he'll eat them.  Not the same for any other vegetables.  He will eat baby carrots raw, but not carrot sticks or any other carrots with a different shape.  I could literally take the same exact baby carrots he's eating, cut them, hand it back, and now it suddenly doesn't taste good.\n\nYou cannot apply logic to a child.

But because of the age gap we have our own tastes in vegetables. \n\nMy best example is with asparagus, my mom cooks and seasons asparagus. When I was my sisters ages, I would have never eaten it. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the \u201cgross vegetable\u201d\nBut I eat it now all the time.

She's so proud of her dinners because she can see the results of what she grew herself from seeds. She lives with my mom and my sister who turned their entire front lawn into long raised beds. Even though my mom has professional cooking training from the culinary institute my niece was starting to get a bit picky with foods, this has entirely killed that in its steps. She used to never eat dinner at dinner time, now she'll go out and dig up a bunch of potatoes and start washing them for dinner all on her own, drawing recipes etc. If you have any space at all, a garden will teach your children how amazing veggies can really be.

I've baked and smoked and dehydrated. I've hidden them in casseroles. Stir fry? Fat chance.  My kid has turned down the just delicious garlic bread, because it had the barest of parsley sprinkled on top. Every blue moon or so, i can drown some steamed broccoli in a cheese sauce and it might get eaten.   I'm a pretty good cook, but my kids won't eat veggies if their life depended on it.",
            "I would say, IMO, that it's more a lack of resolve. I have several friends  who let their kids decide what they'll eat. \n\nKid: \"I don't want that\"...\n\nParent: \"fine.. what about x... what about y...\" \n\nIt becomes a negotiation that the kid is already now leading.\n\nI met my step son when he was 5, and it took a year before he finally got it, that he's got to eat it. Mostly because like a lot of kids, he finds something he likes and that's all he will want.\n\nForcing him to eat new dishes has expanded his palette.\n\nBut getting back to your point, I like that you do mention it's about proper flavors. I'd even urge those cooking for a picky child \"how would you season this differently next time?\"\n\nInvolving my kid in the cooking process has been a great experience and helps him understand \n\n1. there's a lot of work into making his food and to appreciate it and \n\n2. he'll be better equipped as an adult to fend for himself.\n\n\nedit: grammar. i suck at it",

Add to the water a pinch of thyme, a bay leaf and ground pepper ( no salt )\n\nOnce half the water is gone add onions and bell peppers. Add in some chicken stock ( add stock and taste the water to guage how much you need ). \n\nLet it cook until it's almost dry and serve. \n\nYou can change up the vegetables for whatever you want and experiment with the cook times, some veggies cook faster than others. \n\nCut up some chicken breast and add it at the same time as the string beans to make it a whole meal tjat was cooked in one pan.\n\nInstead of chicken stock, you can use beef stock and soy sauce and add some minced beef and canned diced tomatoes to it instead of chicken.",
            "Or you feed them way too much junk food and because of the many varieties of addictive properties found in all junk food as per designed by its manufacturers, your kid becomes addicted to it and would rather get to the point of starving than eat something they both find bland as compared to junk food, and for the fact they've convinced themselves that the junk food is healthy because it tastes soo good but the veggie doesn't taste as good so it's can't be that healthy. - (Kid logic)\n\n\nThe best option is to never allow your kid junk food or soft drink otherwise addiction will set in then you'll struggle to get them to eat healthy or drink water. Also junk food sucks the energy out of your body so your kid is likely to do less exercise for the amount of junk food they eat, then that becomes a habit and before they're 10 they're obese. Then there's the body positivity movement that provides an excuse for this life style leading to an early grave. So you fucked over your kid, how do you feel.\n\nI'd feel pretty bad.\n\nBut ultimately I agree, you can cook veggies and meat in such a way to make it really appealing to kids and have them enjoy your cooking.",

When she walks into work she\u2019s learned to just go to her area and avoid the office staff due to their miserable attitudes every single morning.

I sold it last year. \n\nIn the beginning, it felt like we were helping young creatives from all parts of the world become self-made entrepreneurs through their ability to make original content and connect with an audience. We helped people from all walks of life make a good living. Many of them didn't fit into the traditional entertainment industry, but they found a tribe online. It was a gratifying feeling. Over time however, the \"influence\" became more important that the content. It started to feel icky to me, so I sold the company. \n\nThere are still a ton of amazing creative people making really cool content online - and some can make a good living doing so. The byproduct of this is influence. But now so many people are just in it for the influence/clout. This leads to lowest common denominator stuff like butt-selfies, thirst trapping, misbehaved man-boy vloggers, manufactured internet drama, buying followers, unfortunate prank videos and so forth.

            "The phenomena has always existed but one of the first to successfully advertise and expand a business empires this way was the British porcelain makers of the 1700s. Gifting their wares to socialites for them to show them off and make other people jealous, effectively making them the influencers of the day. Overpriced fragile crap is somehow a symbol of wealth and status instead of waste and crazy combined. When industrious merchants figured out how to take advantage of this to advertise their products, things really took off and became integral to the beginnings of real global mercantilism, industrialization and consumer culture as well as further outlining class divides together with the chasm between rich and poor in modern civil societies across nations. A couple hundred years later advertising has become its own industry for better or worse leeching off any and all advantages made in the field psychology; Freuds nephew successfully used his uncles work to become a star himself in the American ad-industry at the start of the 1900s.\n\nEvery addiction starts with boredom and when people are bored they make up games to distance themselves from reality. What the heart desires the head is full of. Small brains, small pleasures. Dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins are the quartet responsible for our happiness. Many events can trigger these neurotransmitters, but rather than being in the passenger seat, there are ways we can intentionally cause them to flow. Hence the act of giving is its own reward as every action comes with a reaction. Uncomfortable truths are often fleeting to our own thinking, yet always there if persistent, open and willing to face them, learn from them and move on to arise to new challenges.",

I\u2019m not saying the influence is overall bad, I think that millions of families who are influenced/emulate this same role models creates a uniform blanket that smothers individuality IMO.\n\nSocial influence has a deeper meaning than simple advertising.

It struck me as the most gracious and kind response that I have ever heard.  As a parting gift I got her an iPod nano so she could listen to books in Chinese while she worked.

We are actually \"maintenance\" but nobody cares, since they only see the late shift cleaning. 2 years ago I spent 4 days shoveling the school out if 5 feet of snow because nothing could make it there to plow. These are just random things. I love chatting with the kids, they make me laugh hysterically, and alot of them ask for advice. But some of the older ones... ive had basketball players purposely shit out diarrhea next to the toilets, multiple times, also in sinks, and urinals. We are also the ones who set up events, while the PTA laugh with eachother, and look down with disgust at us, but some are nice. Same with teachers. Im friends with alot, and others think we are their servants, even the working foreman of the schools, who is also a head maintenance tech at one specific school, gets asked to set up \"drapes\" or \"light covers\" and my personal favorite so far, \"bouncy ball seats at the computers for the kids\" which are 100% a hazard considering if they fall backwards theres another students chair and desk right there!

When he retired everyone donated some money as a thank you... we ended up with over $20k. That shows how much of an impact he had on us. He cried when we gave him the money. I was talking to him as we ate his farewell cake together. I asked how he was going to spend his retirement. He said he was going to fish until he got tired of it. I asked him what he would after he was tired fishing. Probably something else I reckon was his reply.

What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. President,\" the janitor responded, \"I'm helping put a man on the moon.\u201d\n\nTo most people, this janitor was just cleaning the building.

My family are working class, I come from a less well off area than a lot of the middle class/ upper middle class people I go to school with, and didn't see myself as any different to the kids I go to school with, until I saw the way they treated cleaning staff. A lot of the cleaners live in my area- I used to get the same bus as one, another lives in my area (I see her and her ADORABLE son all the time around town) and I have been really friendly with another since she helped me find my lost coat a few years ago. I never even picked up on the way the cleaners are treated until one day, I casually said hi to the lady who helped me find my coat (we had been having quick chats every other day for years by now) and someone in my class gave me the weirdest look. Afterwards they asked me why I made such an 'effort', she's 'only' a cleaner. 'Only' a cleaner? She might well be the only reason the reason you've not picked up the fucking coronavirus, the reason your jacket didn't get chucked out, the reason your prestigious fucking school is so prestigious in the first place, because she's the one cleaning up all your messes so that the school stays clean, so that you don't have to clean up after yourself and can focus on your education. \n\nAfter that I started to pick up on how my peers, and even some teachers, looked down on support staff like the cleaners. And it really pisses me off. Like, one of my family members ould easily be in the cleaner's position- ffs, OP's mum is, I could be one of the cleaners if I hadn't been lucky enough to get my scholarship. Why is it an unpopular thing to treat someone as your equivalent? Why? \n\nSorry for the rant, I just really get where OP is coming from with this, It's so fucked up, and people, especially kids, need to be taught the importance of cleaners, and other jobs that are looked down on, like builders, and binmen, and other 'working class' jobs.",

Firstly, because in every circumstance I hear this discussed, people will use the phrase \"I don't *owe* you anything\" as some sort of excuse to be rude and treat people like garbage. Secondly, you \"Owe\" politeness as a social contract as an exchange you pay into society as a whole, as we all pay into society via the social contracts and are thus owed a debt by it.

Politeness is a matter of manners, and manners are ways people express emotions without stating them. Kindness is one of those emotions, are at least an action resulting from emotions.\n\nI can be very rude, and still be very kind. For example, I had a math teacher in my first year of high school who poked fun at his students, but it was ok because while he did do that, he also was genuinely kind to hiss students, cared for the, and helped me when no one else would -- and it wasn't just me, everyone who was in his classes agreed with this analysis.\n\nSeeing as politeness is a type of sub-textual language, it probably is kind to do one's best to make sure they communicate in such a way where they're understood. It's kind to be kind in such a way where the person one is being kind at understands what's going on. However, there are several, sometimes contradicting ways to do this, there are several, sometimes contradicting ways to be kind.\n\nI agree we owe kindness to everyone, but I would posit that we don't necessarily owe any one way of expressing that, just as long as we do our best at making it clear what we mean.",

            "Harambe was killed because wild animals are unpredictable. Gorillas have a behavioural instinct to toss their offspring onto their back. But gorillas are super strong so if it did it to the kid it would have accidentally killed the kid. If it got darted the dart would not be strong enough to tranquilize the gorilla and it would have caused the gorilla to panic and kill the kid. All cases result in 90% chance of the kid dying so it results in a choice of what matters more - a child's life or an animal's life. The zoo keepers were duty bound to put the safety of humans first because that's the way things are and animals have poor rights anyway. Though the parents should have been punished for letting their kid escape. Also the zoo keepers should have been punished for not designing the enclosure because it was both the zoo's fault and the parent's fault since there should have been no possible way for the kid to get into the enclosure even if it tried. Moral of the story is that things aren't so \"black and white\" for lack of better term as they seem. \n\nHowever lots of animals get killed because of humans. For example in horse racing if a horse kicks a rider it gets shot or put down. This can even be if the human is bad at riding the horse or training it but the horse hardly ever survives. Same goes with dogs that bite humans. Dog gets put down - sent to a kennel. A few dangerous dog breeds are even banned in most country but dogs have been bread to be that way by humans. We created them and we decided they are too dangerous now so they should be locked up when they are just carrying out their natural or learned behaviours.",
            "I believe the rationale is that a wild animal that 'tastes human blood' is more likely to seek it again.\n\nAt least that's the case of sharks. They're usually harmless but when one gets bitey, it's more likely that same shark does it again. I've heard the same about bears.\n\nRegarding Harambe, he wasn't euthanised, he was shot in order to protect the kid as the ape could've harmed or killed him. Nobody is happy about that but who would risk a child's life?",

In those cases, i don't see a problem euthanizing them to prevent deaths.",

Mama swan is on high alert!\" She kept inching closer with her phone. Mama or Daddy swan had enough, charged at her and did not let up until she was ass-first in the pond.

            "If I\u2019m remembering from my trip to Florida last year, alligators (and other wild animals) tend not to think of humans as prey. However, if they kill/eat a human, they will begin to think of people as prey and start to hunt them. Which is why getting too close to wild animals is dangerous for both you and them. You because they\u2019ll kill you, them because they\u2019ll need to be put down so they don\u2019t threaten other people.",

            "In many African countries there are drive-in \u201czoos\u201d. Basically, the animals are free to move, they\u2019re not in cages, and the tourists are the one advancing through the park, but they must remain in their car. There are hyenas, tigers, and lions, and yet tourists keep getting off the car ALL THE TIME. So many of these parks had to close because of this. There is a video of a French family with two little children and a baby getting out of the car to pet hyenas. HYENAS. The hyenas were kind enough to just intimidate them into going back to their car. But if these hyenas wanted to kill them, they would\u2019ve, and these people would have absolutely no chance of survival. Hyenas are, relatively, more dangerous than lions as they are much more aggressive regardless of the context. Don\u2019t mess around with them. Or any wildlife.",

Yes people doing stupid things have stupid things happen to them but one thing about animals is that a lot of them don't know how easy it is to kill people these days. Lions in particular are a huge problem on that one; once a lion realizes that people are easy they'll start actively hunting people. When the world was still wild we killed the crap out of anything that was much of a danger to us and everything else wild we had regular contact with either learned to be terrified of people and run away or just stay away. The other things we domesticated. Either way once a predator figures out that people are easier than their usual prey they quit going after their usual prey.

Just a safety reminder: If you hear an odd croaking sound coming from a hatchling or you see an grassy mound with small eggs, leave the area because the mother will be on its way to defend its hatchlings or eggs.

            "From a woman's point of view, I've had multiple male friends of mine confessing their love for me and wanting to be with me romantically:\n\nI get the impression that the reason men tend to feel like they've been put in the \"friendzone\" is because men and women treat their friends differently.\n\nWomen open up to their friends, talk about their problems, and create bonds based on emotions a lot of the time. I'm not saying that men never do that, but it isn't to the same extent.\n\nSo when a woman is treating her male friend as a regular friend, a lot of men interpret that differently, and then feel insulted when a woman isn't reciprocating those feelings romantically.\n\nI honestly feel like if men were able to open up and be vulnerable with each other, then a man wouldn't feel like \"I let her cry on my shoulder, I helped her when she was feeling bad,\" etc, meant romantic interest. \n\nIt would also be nice for the women who hate having the conversation where they turn their friend down and lose a friendship.\n\nBut as I said, just my opinion from my own experiences and conversations with male friends that I've managed to keep as friends (usually because they are already in happy and fulfilling relationships, or not attracted to women).",
            "So very true. \n\nI was talking to this girl I had a massive crush on. We would talk almost every single day for like half a year. I decided to be courageous enough to tell her how I felt, and she said she needed time to think. After a couple of weeks she said let's just be friends. I told her unfortunately that wouldn't work for me as I really liked her, and just being friends would be painful and only hurt me in the long run. So we parted ways and that was that. \n\n This goes for men and women, be with people who want to be with you.",
            "Reading through comments and replies here, I've noticed an interesting trend.\n\n It seems like a lot of the women commenters feel the difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship is whether you have sex with the person. In contrast, a lot of men commenters feel like there's a much deeper emotional connection in a relationship than they'd have in a friendship.\n\n I think this is a pretty interesting lens to look at this whole topic through, especially with stuff like \"He said I treated him like a bf but wouldn't have sex with him\" and \"they were pretending to be my friend while just wanting to have sex\"",

There are so many people out there to choose from, so just move on and find yourself someone who appreciates you for who you are!",

She is married with several kids now and we still talk. She even wants me to visit and see her family and dogs at some point. I would say becoming friends with someone who rejected you is hard, but not impossible and a good friendship can come from it.",
            "Agree. Friend zone is when you won't make a move or speak truthfully because of the fear of rejection. One of the realities is that it sometimes won't work out, and yes, you may change/lose your friendship. If that is the case, it is time to grow up and move on anyways.",

            "The unpopular part of what you are saying is that:\n\n\"People should have open and honest discussions about their feelings without the fear of reprocussions.\"\n\nYeah, goodluck with that. \n\nIf people could do what I said, a shitton of social issues could be resolved. But expressing your self leaves you open for criticism and rejection, which is scary. To add to that, your feelings could make the other person uncomfortable, which is a crime, and could get you fired/ostracized or labelled as something you feel you are not. Sorry, not sorry, but self expression is an open invitation to be criticised or condemned. Want some examples?\n\n\"Hey, Mary. Its Dave from accounting. We have been coleagues and friends for years and I would like to invite you out for a romantic dinner to get to know you more intimatly.\"\n\nMary calls HR. Says you were propositioning her. Says you made a advance on her. Says you asked her to engage in a relationship. She says it is unproffessional for you to ask her to date and try for a relationship. She now feels uncomfortable around you. Even looking at her can be harassment. Your other coleagues gossip about this and you are now a predator trying to get with coworkers. \n\nThats a real story.\n\n\"Hey, Mary, its Dave. I have known you since first grade, and over the years our freindship has developed and I have romantic feelings for you and I am asking if you feel the same?\"\n\nMary complains that all guys just want sex. She says she wants to be just friends, but the reality is you crossed a line you wanted to cross, and now you have been rejected. Will it be akward to hang out as friends? Can Mary have a relationship with someone else and you still be friends, now that your feelings are public? \n\nAnother real story.\n\nAnd this is what makes it scary. And why simple, clear communication may seem like a confident correct thing to do, it can lead to problems, anxeity, depression, loss of job and much more serious consequences.\n\nOP, I am sorry, but I have to assume you have the confidence to express your feelings, and that is extremely hard for people, especially those who are self concious or have felt rejection before and fear it.",

Otherwise they might believe that there's an unspoken \"as friends\" while you're thinking that there's an unspoken understanding its a date, which is way more awkward than just getting your ass rejected.\n\nIf it feels to awkward to insert into the initial ask, you can always follow up with a cheerful confirmation that it's going to be a date, assuming success.\n\nFortunately I don't think your take is actually unpopular except with a certain demographic of people. . . .",
            "Its an unpopular opinion because this is objectively and factually wrong on multiple levels. Let's go for a deep dive: \n\n>Entering the friendzone is always a voluntary process for a guy, and you can leave at any point.\n\nYou cannot. If a woman (or a man) has decided that they want to remain friends, that's the person's choice, they do not consent to more. No matter how much love and affection you use, or don't use, if a person makes up their mind, you cannot change it. You know this OP, stop trying to fool us. We're not stupid. If a straight man is friends with a gay man for instance, no matter how much effort the guy man puts in, he will eternally be in the friendzone. This is not a debate.\n\n>1. You\u2019re on a first date from tinder, you ask her for a second date. But she says that she\u2019d rather be friends. You can simply (and politely) decline her offer for friendship and part ways amicably.\n\nThis explains the process. This does not explain how it is the guys fault for being put there. Your title says it's your fault your in the friendzone... how is this the guys fault in the example? \n\n>2. You have a prior acquaintance with a woman (coworker for example) and ask her out for a drink. She prefixes this by saying \u201cas friends, right?\u201d, you can (again politely state) that this was a romantic offer and to avoid complicating the situation you can retract the offer. \n\nYes again, this explains the process every guy is familiar with, not why it's the persons fault for being in there. \n\n\nYou provided no evidence to support how one can advance from the friendzone to pursue a romantic relationship.bold and objective claims better come with some bold and objective facts. You provided neither. It's an unpopular opinion because it's objectively and factually wrong\n\nNow, before the inevitable comments come in saying \"i looked at your profile & posts ...looks like you just got out of a relationship, you must have gotten friendzoned.\"\n No, I didn't.

Kind of felt like they wanted the benefits of having a man around without committing to a relationship. There's enormous pressure on young men to \"be nice,\" a.k.a. be pushovers, and I don't blame any of them for being roped into this mentality. It needs to change though, and young men reading this should know that they'll be more happy moving on from these women and focusing on finding one that will reciprocate their romantic interest rather than holding a torch for someone who is leading them on. In my experience, the women that do that are just using the men in the friend zone.",

            "A guy has even more control than he thinks. Way before being asked out.  All you have to do is flirt a little in subtle ways. Subtle flirting will keep you out of the friendzone. I've never been in the friendzone, but I remember reading a long time ago that if you flirt enough, she will classify you as romantic material. If you don't excite her, she will friendzone you. How many times have you seen women say, \"I just don't see him that way?\"\n\nIm not even good looking and I weigh almost 300 lbs. But women in college really liked me. This is because I learned how to chat it up and in a non invasive way while flirting just a little.\n\nThe irony is that I was married in college when I perfected this. Some women even asked *me* out. One kept trying to get me to leave my wife and run off with her. But while I never actually cheated, I became rather addicted to making cute girls smile at me. \n\nSo what do I mean when I say \"subtle flirting\"? Just make them feel happy and special for *their* benefit. Compliment on hair, notice new things on her. And talk talk talk. Women love a social guy. I had to rebuild myself from the ground up to be social.\n\nHow many times have you sat next to a cute girl in college and thought to yourself, \"I wish we knew each other.\" Well you can. It is easier the first few days. Literally stick your hand out to shake and say, \"Hi, my name is___\" She will smile with a surprised look every time, then tell you her name. Then call her by name every time you greet her. This will make her feel special.\n\nNobody online understands me when I say this, but I replace her name with \"pretty lady\" every few greetings. And I say it casually like it is her name. She may act like she didn't notice, but she did. And next time she sees you, she will react much more positively to you.

            "I think the only valid point you've made in this thread is about failing mental faculties from a medical neurological standpoint. \n\nNot to take this deliberately political, so I'll try to ignore policy specifics, but I think Joe Biden might be a perfect example of where your concern should be. \n\nYou cannot deny that he is embracing a progressive stance. Maybe not as progressive as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren (both also way over 65). But his stated or evolving platform is not regressive. Many would argue that his position is 'progressive-enough' in that it's not so extreme it would disrupt the country/world like some far-left ideas, but will still advance incremental changes in a progressive direction.\n\nHowever, there may be some serious concern about his medical neurological state. And more concern over how it will change over the next 4-8 years. I am not in the medical field, but I feel voting for Biden is actually voting for his Vice President (a role that is usually not critical to the electorate). I think because of his questionable consistency, his party is making a mistake by getting ready to nominate him. But I didn't/don't have this concern (mental health) about anybody else that was competing for the nomination, regardless of age. For any other candidate, my primary concern would be their policy platform and how it does or doesn't align with my ideals.\n\nSo, back to the point, your original statement is just ageist, and like most other -isms, it might start from an anecdotal point of validity (I don't want your grandfather in charge either, based on your brief description, and neither of my parents are suitable) but it is being unfairly extrapolated to a broad class of persons that just happen to share one common factor. There are amazingly smart, capable, mentally sound, highly progressive people over the age of 65 that you would arbitrarily and unfairly exclude. \n\nBetter is a medical test, with certain red flags being made public. I wouldn't vote for someone with dementia or alzheimers, no matter how progressive.  Right now, the only real test is the media spotlight. In Biden's case, the less he's in the spotlight, the better he seems. In a normal campaign, I feel either he would be much more exposed by now, or my concerns would have been put to rest. I can forgive someone who gets tongue tied occasionally. I don't want to vote for someone that maybe should already be under medical psychological supervision.",

            "Since the brain does not mature until after age 25 we shouldn't rely on anyone younger than that. Since public service requires the ability to understand government we should have proof that a candidate can pass a test on the US Constitution and the Constitution of any state they are representing. Since governing requires the mastery of vast amounts of material from various areas a candidate should prove that he or she can read complicated material and summarize it accurately. Since governing requires mastery of writing skills then the candidate should be able to prove that skill. Since governing requires the ability to conduct interpersonal communication at a very high level of complexity a candidate ought to have experience in doing so. \n\nThere are some individuals who can present proof of these skills in their 30s but they are rare. Other countries have a much more rigorous curriculum than our colleges and universities; those who are leaders of Scandinavian countries have a stronger educational background than do young adults in this country where college is too often seen as four years of partying. \n\nI would vote for anyone who has shown a mastery of the above skills, understands how government works, has a vision of how to solve our countries problems. Sometimes that person is like a John Kennedy and sometimes that person is a Winston Churchill; sometimes that person is a Gerald Ford or Abraham Lincoln or Jimmy Carter. The way thinking is done properly has not changed much since Aristotle; the content of thinking may change but any student of history can verify that issues of how to defend a country, control the economy, bring justice to the legal system and fairness to the employment system surfaces in every country regularly.\n\nI agree that term limits would be a useful way of breaking up power blocks. I think a member of the House of Representatives should serve for 4 years at a time with a maximum of 8 years as is true of the President; I think the same should be true of Senators. But the problem is that the Constitution is not easily changed and would require a greater level of agreement than we have now.

            "1. Blanket banning people based on their age is stupid and discriminatory. I know people in their '70s that are more progressive than 99% of society. Of course older people tend to have older views \u2013 but that isn't remotely the case for anyone and banning someone like Bernie Sanders, who was fighting the police back in the '60s over black people's rights, just because your grandpa is kinda racist is dumb, to say the least.\n\n2. Older people that have been in politics all life have a lot of experience, and that experience shows. People like Angela Merkel have been as good as they could possibly be (considering how effective they were at reaching their goals, not if those goals were ok). You can't run a country on promises and dreams. There will always be fossils around the government because fossils know, after 40 or 50 years of service, how to do things \u2013 just like how a 70 yo. mathematician will fuck a 30 yo. one in knowledge and experience.\n\n3. I don't think Scandinavian countries are more progressive because their leaders are younger. That's just a correlation. If anything, I'm inclined to believe the same values behind such progress are the ones behind people thinking you don't need to be a 80 yo 'statesman' to be in charge.\n\n4. It is not very democratic to tell people who they can vote for. If you have to put rules on who you can't vote, then it's not a democracy, it's just a show to convince yourself you are not a dictatorship.\n\n5. Your vote is not more important than your father's. If a fossil is winning elections, it's because he is the person your country wants in change. Just because it's not popular between your generation, doesn't mean he shouldn't win.\n\n6. It opens the door to other groups of people being banned for not being \"convenient\" or \"reasonable\" as leaders. Next you can ban i.e. communists because 'imagine a communist wins and subverts our country'. It really is a can of worms not worth opening.\n\n7. Sometimes younger generations swing to the right. Yes, since the '60s, younger generations have been progressively more progressive (lol), but that won't hold forever. In fact, there are studies already saying that our new generation is more conservative than the ones before it. Everything points to our society swinging back to the right and that means that, at some point, under your scheme, a more progressive generation would be disqualified while a more conservative one 'runs the country'.\n\n8. Old people will just vote for a younger candidate that upholds the ideas the candidate you banned did. Nothing really changes except the guy in charge has less experience.\n\nI really don't get your point at all. You basically want to overrun the results you don't like and restrict people to candidates that fit better within your worldview.\n\nBut again, I want to reaffirm my first point: some older people kick our asses in progressive issues.",

I don\u2019t think a 10 year old should be allowed to run for president.  I don\u2019t even agree with the 35+ rule, though, that we have in America.  Our country should, and always has, gotten the president we deserve.  Trump is no different.  Biden will be no different either.

There are some 65-year-olds that are sharper than many 30 year olds...and then there are some who can\u2019t remember what they ate for lunch yesterday. It really depends on the person, their health, their lifestyle, their genetics, etc. I don\u2019t think it would necessarily be a bad idea to put an upper age limit on the presidency (there\u2019s a lower age limit of 35, which seems pretty strict, so an upper limit makes sense). But I think it should be somewhere in the 80-90 range, and even then, I feel like there might be exceptions. 90 seems like a fair upper limit, but then again, there really aren\u2019t all too many 90-year-olds running for office anyway. \n\nPersonally, I think we should lower the age limit for presidency from 35 to 30. It seems kind of ridiculous to me that a 33-year-old is not old enough to be president (especially because, if you\u2019re 34 during one election cycle, you basically can\u2019t run until you\u2019re 39, which seems fairly ridiculous.)

People who get into power hold onto it, while multiple generations have their challenges go unheard because those in government are too removed from them.\n\nI find it funny how so many people are arguing that this would be giving an unfair advantage to progressives over conservatives. Perhaps consider that there's a reason for that? Progressive ideas are what the young people inheriting the world want; heck even *need.* By making that argument, you essentially admit that old people in power are governing conservatively over an increasingly progressively-dominated electorate; the more young people grow into voting age and the more old people die. Yet due to the norms around politics, there are no options for these new voters that are what they really want. If that kind of disconnect between people and government doesn't sound undemocratic to you... maybe consider that you're not actually upset about democracy being subverted; you're upset about your personal views being outdated and the normalization of a practice of keeping people who will enforce those outdated views in power unfairly for too long a time being called out.\n\nProgressive views being extremely dominant among young people is no reason to disenfranchise them in favour of catering to those who will die sooner and will have their lives less impacted by policies they fundamentally disagree with. If progressive views is the direction collective thought is moving, holding it back is against a democratic peoples' interest, and does not represent the electorate or improve the future that these now-young people *will actually have to live through.* It does the opposite.",

She is constantly lecturing me about this or that as if I would choose to put myself or my son in harm's way because in her eyes, I will never be a competent adult.

I wasn't allowed to wear tank tops, be friends with a boy, go to my cousin's confirmation party, go in the house alone if we were outside, etc. I didn't have a lot of friends growing up because of him, and it has everything to do with who I am as a person.

They shame me for saying I want to go to my boyfriend\u2019s house, tel me I\u2019ll die if I leave, manipulating and guilt tripping me into thinking I\u2019ll get the virus if I do anything outside of these four walls. I have to go back to campus in the fall and I have no idea what they\u2019re going to do. They\u2019re gonna lose their minds. But I have to live my life.\n\nI love them, I really do. But I know the damage done. There\u2019s so much more I could say but that\u2019s what I felt like telling. I\u2019m strongly considering van life because I haven\u2019t been able to leave the state nevermind go on vacations or anything. In fact last year when my bf and I took an overnight trip a couple states away, they didn\u2019t talk to me for a week. Van life would be so liberating for a sheltered kid like me.",

Signed up to the military the day I turned 18 and left because A) I didn't want to be in debt for the rest of my life for college and B) be somewhere where they had absolutely no control of me.\n\nNow I'm out and have a son of my own, I would NEVER in a 1000 years do the same thing to him, or any of the things they told me I would understand once I have kids.",

I would have to ask a week in advance if I could hang out with someone or I asked \"too late.\" Then my mom would hold everything over my head as an excuse to not let me go. If I did get to go out, I had a 5pm curfew on a school night. So got an hour and a half after school ended to spend time with friends. It wasn't worth the hassle in my opinion and I know a lot of people wouldn't ask me to hang out because it was too much of a hassle. \n\nI wasn't allowed to get my license, my mom never said she didn't want me to drive but I know that was why, she would come up with other excuses. However, my older brother got his license at 16/17. My sister got hers at 16. I got mine two weeks shy of 19 which was almost a year after I moved out. Goes hand in hand with not having a job because there wasn't many places to work where we lived without having a car.\n\nI found out from my (former) step-dad, they divorced many years ago, that she would get a copy of my text transcripts from the phone company and read all my texts.\n\nI found out from my sister who was 5 at the time, that she would read my diary when I wasn't around. \n\nI was looking at MY birth certificate one time when I was like 16 and she told me to mind my own business. She also refused to give me my birth certificate and social security card after I moved out. My step-dad snuck and gave them to me.\n\nI've vaguely talked about it but I hate how dismissive a lot of people act around that behavior.

The students and i had great interaction and the message i gave them was to be open minded, find what feels right to you and keep up with politics. Youth interest and youth voting is at an all time low, and i believe its because we created a culture where \"you either agree with someone or you are a total asshole\". So we learn not to talk about it. Its a shame.

They need to learn how to deal with life\u2019s struggles because daddy and mommy aren\u2019t going to be there or give 2 fucks over every single thing they cry about. \n\nThe key is to learn real injuries from just a fall that startled them. If it is a real injury the kids will come to you. \n\nI\u2019m sick and tired of these helicopter parents getting up in my business telling me that I\u2019m a bad parent and calling the fucking cops.  \n\nI\u2019ve broken several bones as a kid alone riding my bicycle. You get up and walk home. \n\nKids nowadays have zero clue how to take care of themselves. I\u2019m not allowing that happen to my kids. \n\nThere is no one for my kids to play with because Karen won\u2019t let her 8 year old kid ride his bike to the park. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019m in the minority here on this thinking. \n\nOh well rant over.",
            "A lot of parents don't understand that in order for their kids to learn responsibility they have to give them the freedom to be responsible. My 9 year old regularly walks up to the store by himself to get the treats he wants (it's a 3 minute walk up the private road). He knows how to do his own laundry, he can make basic meals (eggs, grilled cheese etc.) there is a place in the woods they go to hangout with other kids. He really just has free roam of our long private road as long as he checks in every hour and if he does inside a house the parent there has to text me saying he's there. It took a few screw ups for him to get the hang of it and of course he got in trouble (lost game or TV time) but he's gotten it down to a T and realizes the more responsibile he is the more freedom he gets and I plan to continue this practice.",

In high school the think that gave me the most freedom was that my high school (which was a combined middle school and HS starting at grade 7) gave out bus passes instead of using yellow buses.  That's free transportation 10 months out of the year on a really decent transpo system for the size of our city.  At age 12 I learned how to navigate public transit and that was the best freedom.  I just had to let my parents know where I was and when I'd be home and they didn't have to come get me from the movies or mall or friend's house (although the first few years they didn't like me bussing after dark).\n\nI have coworkers now who talk about only letting their 16 year old kid go to the mall if they drive them, insisting their child attend a local university so they can live at home etc, drives me nuts.  Give the kid some freedom so they have some experience when they are out on their own, give them the responsibility to keep themselves safe so they gain that knowledge. \n\n And you have to start younger than teens.  Provide a base in the earlier years so freedom isn't a shock.  A nine year old who lives two blocks away from the school does not need to be walkedl by a parent in a suburban neighbourhood on a residential street.  As long as they are being safe a 7 year old can walk 5 houses down to get their friend and then walk to a playground together.  Parents are too afraid to give their kids freedom because they are worried about CPS being called and unfortunately many people are too quick to call CPS for things like parents giving their kids some autonomy and self responsibility.\n\nRant over",

The list of things I couldn't do was endless and at times completely over the top. I grew up with the subconscious idea that if I was not allowed to do the most basic things that my school friends seemed to be OK with, maybe it was because I wasn't as smart or as capable.

I don't think he knows guys.\n\nLet me tell you a tale of the most supreme legislative double dipping and the real reason people can still smoke.  \n\nLong ago, in a lost time known as 'The 90s\u2122' there were some pretty damning lawsuits leveled against big tobacco.  Class action suits filed by many states that were going to finish the job quite honestly: undeniable proof that smoking was killing Americans and that tax payers were footing the bill for it.\n\nSo what did Big Tobacco and Congress do?  They settled.  They offered up payments to offset the medical costs of their product.  And your legislators took the blood money instead of making a stand.\n\nI don't know exactly how the Tobacco Master Settlement works, or all the details, but I do know that a lot of states saw dollar signs in their eyes and took out loans against those guaranteed payments.  So now, depending on where you live, you are likely in the odd situation where your state tells you not to smoke but needs SOMEBODY to smoke so they can pay off some loans they took out years ago.  It is truly fucked.\n\nYou've got your TMS payments and the insane tax rates on tobacco products to blame for its continued availability, the aforementioned double dipping.  In my lifetime, I've watched smokes jump from around $1 a pack to nearly $10 a pack, and I live in the sticks pretty much.  Much more expensive in cities that I've been to.

Immediately this struck me as odd - we had never agreed on the basics of politics and religion, so why would I trust his judgement? I was also about to enter college and would need to devote my efforts to getting a degree - why would you want me to potentially sacrifice that just to vote? I stayed the course and waited another presidential election cycle before registering.

I would have to have a very thin neck and not think of retaliating against this at all, even though I can kill him with a single swipe.\n\nThe second way would be for them to blind me. In this scenario they would need to be fully prepared to sacrifice an arm, a leg, their testicles, two eyes, a nose, half an ear, their scalp, a kidney, and their lungs, and while I am attacking them, they would use sticks or fingers to try to blind me. I am aware that I have small eyes, however, if they really concentrated while I was having a nice liver breakfast, I believe they might be able to hit their target.\n\nTL/DR: I could beat a human in a fight, but if they could blind me or choke me out, I'm absolutely dead.\n\nEDIT: I have been informed that humans cannot in fact live without their lungs.",

            "Ok this might be unpopular, and I do NOT like Cardi B, but in the hip hop community, this is very normal stuff. Rappers always talk big about how \"hood\" they are, as this makes them bigger and more popular.\n\n There are countless male artists who often raps about shootings, stabbing, gang warfares etc. This is almost always blown up way bigger to boost image, nd at times, shit isn't even true (look up Rick Ross.

As a stripper, Cardi B had little to no power and was subject to the will of men to make a living.  She manipulated this power construct in a way that benefitted her.  These men were soliciting sex from her, and she used that to her advantage.  Was it unethical? Of course, but it is nowhere near the violation of morals that comes from a widespread sex abuse scandal.  There are others in the hip-hop community that have done FAR worse and were never cancelled.",

But in my mind, I think Pixar basically botched what *could've been* one of the actual greatest animated moments. I feel like those 10 minutes were always meant to be shown in the *middle* of the film. Almost as if they decided to make that sequence the opening as an afterthought.   \n\n\nThroughout the first half of the film, Carl doesn't really open up to Russell; and we don't really know why he's so keen to get to Paradise Falls or why he cares so much about a stupid house (except we do know since we watched the opening). Eventually, we get a scene where Carl alone enters the broken house and takes out an old photo album, basically giving us another mini-version of the first ten minutes. I'm convinced that in an earlier draft of the script, the opening 10 minutes where intended to be shown during this scene. And I believe that if it had played out like that, the moment would've been 10 times more powerful than it is in the final film. Because then everything would click, suddenly we would understand why this stubborn old man behaved the way he did. The buildup would make that emotional punch much stronger.  \n\n\nBut the way the film is now; we go into the movie seeing a montage about a character we are yet to  care about; and throughout the entire film we know everything about Carl's life and motivations, making his reserved and introverted character pointless since we already understand. It would've served better as a reveal later on.  \n\n\nRant over.",

            "I agree that that is one way it could have been done and could have been effective. But I think they definitely had it at the beginning for a purpose. We learn why he\u2019s a grouch: he thinks that whole life was almost a waste and that he let his wife down by never giving her the adventure that she wanted. And then instead when he goes to get the book he realizes, through the pictures and note, that he was wrong the whole time. They had a whole life of adventures and he spent all this time feeling guilty for no reason. The reveal is that we agreed with him in why he was a grouch when if he had just opened that book after she died then he would have realized much sooner that it wasn\u2019t about the adventure. Moving the 10 minutes to the middle of the movie would have instead turned the narrative into Russell and the audience realizing why getting to Paradise Falls is so important to him. When instead with the reveal the way it is, the narrative is that life is truly the greatest adventure of them all.\n\nSo TL;DR I think moving the 10 minutes would have created a different, but still valid narrative. But it being at the beginning was the intention and the way to go.",
            "I was fully prepared to disagree with you but I think you're actually right, fair play",
            "I upvoted based on the title, came here to jokingly call you an idiot.... and instead.... my god, I agree with you.... do I take the upvote back?",
            "I think you articulated your points very well, but I disagree.\n\nThe timing of this montage changes the character arc of Carl. The way the movie currently plays out, you see a man who outlived the love of his life ... along with a lot of what have his life meaning. Throughout this montage, you see that he has regrets. Not only did he never have a child, but he felt that he let his wife down by living without the adventure he thought his wife always wanted.\n\nNow the rest of the movie. You see a broken man with everything he loved, gone. I'm sure you've heard of elderly couples who have been together for decades and do everything together. When one spouse dies, the other shortly follows (almost like they can't go on with their broken heart). As the audience, we see that going on, and can't help but compare his personality to the 180 between the happiness we know he's capable of. Honestly, it makes me think of my own grandparents who I worry about being lonely.\n\nNow consider Russell's role. He represents the happiness, excitement and adventure he wished he had. Yet - Carl can't help but hang onto the love of his life. As we as the audience see the opportunity he is passing up throughout the movie, we see the tragedy unfolding, and we are rooting for him to let go of the past and live in the moment. When he finally let's go of the past and lives in the moment, that is when he gains his sense of adventure, is happy again, and feels fulfilled.\n\nThe arc you laid out also would have made a good movie, but I think Carl's character would have suffered. For most of the movie, he would come across as the stereotypical grumpy old man, and wouldn't have any emotional investment in his character. The entire movie, we would be wondering why he was hanging on so many things from the past (we wouldn't know it's from the past). \n\nI think that we would have seen him as sort of a villain at first, only to realize he's a good guy (think Snape), as opposed to the way it was written, where we know what will make him happy, and are rooting for him to allow himself to be happy.\n\nGreat post, but I don't agree",
            "Yeah. You totally convinced me. The only counter point I would politely debate is that Pixar also agrees with you. However, they intentionally moved it to the beginning because it was *too* powerful that way; and decremented from the fact they were trying to make a kids movie.\n\nAt the beginning, it's less impactful, and you have the whole movie to pull you out of the rut it puts you in. Otherwise, everyone would be leaving the theater bawling their eyes out. Not exactly the effect Pixar probably wants.\n\nBrilliant post, friend.",
            "I respectfully disagree. A mid-run reveal would have been effective if Russel was the main character, and was learning this information for the first time. However, Carl is the main character, and Carl already knows his own life. A mid-run reveal would have been the editor showing the information to the audience. Without a character learning information, a reveal isn\u2019t impactful",
            "in my opinion the first ten minutes make you care about carl also the movie is about carl moving on from ellie (represented by his house) and finding new joy in his life .to me  moving the scene to later in the movie makes the plot make know sense up to the half way point you mentioned .",
            "Removed: straight fact, not an opinion\n\nNah jk, good post, OP.",
            "This way we actually root for the old fuck. If we didn't know his story we would've thought he was just a grumpy old annoying fart who's pointlessly doing this weird shit and is even directly endangering a child in the process let alone anything that was below him. There is no driving factor good enough to keep the story going for us the viewers. Him suddenly literally uprooting to leave would be jarring to say the least cuz we would be like wtf. But this way the thing has structure and is basic enough for kids to get cuz remember it's for kids. And them dropping this shit in the beginning is such a big dick move we don't expect.\n\nBy the end of the movie we would've gotten sick of his attitude and behavior. This way we actually know the purpose behind every step his old ass takes and why hes so stubborn we root for the guy till the end. They might've made a cool oh shit moment where it all clicks but the rest of the movie would suck and would be stale. \n\nI like oh shit moments just as much as the next guy but most of the time it's stupid to hinge the entire plot and driving force on it. The sixth sense had a great one cuz of how unexpected it was but the reveal wasn't what drove the movie forward it was the cherry on top.",
            "disagree\n\n1. The use of balloon in the initial montage set up and normalize the use of balloon and floating house, and emotional weight in subsequent scenes. Without the montage, we lose the cathartic and freeing feeling when Carl floats his house with balloons.\n2. A large part of the audience is children who wouldn't be able to put together the clues/ emphasize in the same way as OP.\n3. The first ten minutes of movie is often revealing about the rest of the movie. If the first ten minutes of our movies is wacky montage of the house travelling via balloon, it sets the action/adventure which i feel takes away from the narrative.\n4. If it's to be shown later it would be interlaced with dialogue and reactions from Russel/Carl. Try to imagine \"married life\" and all it's various transition and change in tones but broken into pieces. It just wouldn't be the same.",

Of course it's going to be a montage about someone you don't care about.  You don't know them yet.\n\nGuess what?  After 10 minutes you know about the guy and care about him....so when he acts like a dick, you give him some leeway.  Otherwise you'd have to slog through a huge portion of the film not really committed to the character's story because you don't like him.",

The scene perfectly sets up the rest of the story. I think that's why it's great to have it in the beginning. The whole movie carries a certain mood, it's so light hearted and enjoyable. I don't think they could have carried the mood so far if they placed that emotional first 10 min anywhere else.",

            "Later in the film he yells at Russell saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for any of this!\u201d, and that\u2019s the message of the film. \n\nDid he really think that when he went inside the house as kid, he was gonna run into the love of his life? No, he just heard some kid\u2019s voice coming from it and was curious to check it out. Was he and Ellie trying to save money for a deflated tire, broken leg, or even house damage? No, they were saving it to one day go to Paradise Falls. Did he make his house float so that he could run into a Boy Scout, a talking dog, a giant rare bird, or even his idol from when he was a kid and go this insane adventure? No, he was solely focused on getting his house to Paradise Falls. \n\nThe movie was never about the goal, but about the journey to that goal. Films like Stand By Me did the same thing, but Up takes it surprisingly more deep. It allows kids to fully understand and adults to appreciate more about life and time. That\u2019s why when Carl makes it to his goal, it doesn\u2019t feel fulfilling. There\u2019s nothing else to do, kind of like where he was after Ellie died. He was holding onto to his goal so much, that he wasn\u2019t appreciating the ADVENTURE. That\u2019s the main point of an ADVENTURE movie, right? And when he reads those last words Ellie left in their adventure book, it hits the nail right on the head.\n\nIt\u2019s great storytelling that is made for families, but perfect for everyone",

            "disagree.\n\nputting it in the middle would've disrupted the flow of the movie, dropping a huge emotional bomb right in the middle of a relatively lighthearted story.  I've seen this happen in virtually all Korean movies (including comedies)  where there is always an unexpected death in the 3rd act, mostly to elicited a tear jerking moment.\n\nAlso its supposedly a kids film and parents might want to skip the first 10mins for younger kids, who are too young to understand.",
            "When I first went to see up on my birthday, I showed up late and got to just right after that whole sequence. I thought up was a fine movie, but seeing that beginning sequence when I watched it later changed my entire view on the movie. I\u2019m not really making a point here. Just felt like sharing.",
            "Respectfully, two issues with it:\n\n1. It is there so you are mourning with Carl the entire movie. Making it a revelation midway through it shortens that time and prevents you from experiencing his personal growth. \n\n2. The problem with changing the film's order is that it makes the story about the kid's relationship with the old man, and cheapens the intro cut into a side story. While the kid and the old man's relationship is an important aside, the story is all about the old man coming to grips with the loss of his wife. Changing the sequence would necessitate changing the point of the movie. Instead of it being about love, loss, mourning, and acceptance, it becomes just another \"don't judge a book by its cover\" movie. \n\nThat scene belongs in the beginning because it frames the whole rest of the old man's struggle, which is the actual story in the movie.",
            "I don't disagree but like other have said, it would have created a very different emotional journey for audiences. \nFor one, that first scene makes you understand and feel attached to Carl. Without that he's just some old dude that hits a guy with his walking stick and bullies a boy scout.\nYou also have to consider that younger audiences need quicker explanations and without that initial gut punch I don't think the movie would be nearly as well known",

            "I agree somewhat, but I also think that the opening montage made me care about Carl when I otherwise would've disliked him, and I might not have stayed interested in the movie long enough to get that payoff if they hadn't grabbed me in the first ten minutes.\n\nYour idea may have been the better one, but I can't say for sure.",

            "Except that it wouldn't, it would make the end scene 10X less impactful.\n\nThe reason why the ending is impactful is because we knew from the beginning the weight of his journey and motivations, if we didn't know that beforehand we would see him as just a bitter old man to whom we couldn't relate or bond to but because of the first 10 minutes of the movie we can sympathise with him and root for him right from the start... it gives us more time to build up the end scene making it as powerful as it is.\n\nIf they had done it mid-movie half of the buildup would have been gone and I feel that OP completely misunderstood that second scene.\n\nThe second scene that OP calls the \"aha\" scene is a closure scene. Its not a repeat, its the character taking one last look at his past and memories, all the pain he's gone through and coming to terms that it's time to move on, make new adventures.\n\nIf we hadn't had those first 10 minutes, instead of crying we'd be like: who the fuck is Ellie, cool, I guess.",
            "I could definitely see it working midway through the film but I think it's placement is meant to not cause tonal whiplash.",
            "I respectfully disagree. \nWithout the first ten minutes I wouldn\u2019t have had much of a reason to care about Carl until possibly halfway into the movie. It would be a matter of excusing dickish behavior because you now know his past all the sudden VS seeing the trajectory of his life. \nHis ups and downs imply his life is practically over and he missed out on his last adventure. All the sudden he has another chance but just like him, his adventure has to evolve.",
            "I disagree. I definitely see where you're coming from but I believe that if the opening scene were to be put when he opens up the photo album there would be too much information we have to get from it. In that five minute scene we would have learned who his wife was, how they met, their life together and that they couldn't have children. Immediately after we get that information the next revelation we as the audience get is the entire moral of the film. This hurts the pacing quite a bit if we put them together as you suggest. \n\nThe whole reason the opening scene is so impactful is because it tells a wonderful story of a couple's life together. Pretty much their entire life. Except it's not. Because a huge part of Carl's life is about to happen in the next hour and a half for us. The entire point of the film isn't Carl and Ellie's relationship. If it was, that would be what we watch for the entire duration. But it's not. This is just the first five minutes. \n\nKeeping that in mind, when Carl opens up the photo album in the last leg of the movie, he realizes that there is a section that he never saw. This section reveals to us AND Carl that he lived his life. We know. We saw it. So this scene shows us a hard lesson; life keeps going. The adventure is out there. Something the film reminds us of all the time. Except now it's clear that the adventure isn't just with one person. Isn't just with one chapter. We see this with the turning of the pages. He's lived that life but that doesn't mean there isn't another one right in front of him. \n\nAll this is to say that if the opening scene were to be put right before that one, it would have been an exposition dump. Not the story of a couple's love and life together. Therefore wasting it.",
            "I don\u2019t understand how this has compelled so many people. The first 10 minutes shows why Carl is so grumpy and closed off. He had a life he loved, with Ellie, the one he loved. The person he had shared so many happy memories with, was gone for good. \n\nConsider too the setting of the movie. Carl and Ellie has a beautiful Victorian home, that they restored together from shambles. Given Pixar is in Emeryville, one would assume their house is in SF... An area that has seen explosive growth in recent years and has seen so many cool old houses gobbled up for medium density housing (albeit necessarily.)\n\nSo now Carl is in this newly-restored home, without his wife of whom his shared everything, and this pushy suit persistently wants to push him out. DAMN RIGHT HE\u2019S GRUMPY!\n\nEnter Russell and Dug: In spite of Carl being closed off and crotchety, his new reality forces his to face new adversity and develop a new lease on life because of Russell... Signified by the reminiscing with the photo album. \n\nUP is perfect. Shame on you.",
            "No the movie is about Carl learning to open up again and growing emotionally. We need to understand his motivations earlier so that we can understand and accept him as the main protagonist. We already have a reveal in the form of russels relationship with his father.",
            "I'll try to make it short and sweet: if the first ten pages dont rock the boat like an f4 hurricane, the script doesnt even reach a producer. It doesnt matter how good the middle or the end is if it never gets made, right? So if you have a nice flashback in the second act but your first act is a drag, you switch that shit like a girls sexuality in college and send that shit in just so a producer can say \"We are going to fuck so much money out of these kids they are going to sue us for pedophilia!\" (Not a big kids movie fan btw.) \n\nAnyway, could also be because it jumpstarts the viewers emotional investment so they dont notice the annoying waste of story that happens until the thing finally lifts off.",
            "At first glance, it seems that you are correct.  However, a more emotionally-intuitive look at the consequences of putting the sequence at the beginning of the movie informs us that we need to feel sympathy for the old-man character before he shows his grumpiness to us.  The idea of floating his home is so absurd and drastic that there has to be justification for it from the very beginning of the movie.  The emotional impact of the opening scene must be present in order for sympathy to grow for the character right from the beginning.  Otherwise our view of the main character is colored by our tendency to view him as just another crazy, stubborn old man.  Setting up the large emotional lode at the beginning allows for many subtle references to the past and many opportunities to humanize the old man.  I am absolutely certain that the movie-makers did prescreenings with both setups and found that people were more likely to feel sympathy for the old man with the sequence at the beginning.  However, it's likely that no one will see my comment or that I failed to explain myself properly and I will be downvoted.",
            "Your not wrong and I bet you they had a screen testing with the opening in the middle. \n\nThe problems I have with it being in the middle is that it gives you a reason to tolerate Carl when it's in the begining. He's a dick obsessed with his house and has some weird deathwish without the context. Given that it's a children's movie, I have a hard time believing kids would be able the empathize with him without that context, he might even look like the \"villain\" in the movie until that point, diluting the message of the movie as well. \n\nThe other part is it feels bad pacing wise to have a 10 minute story in the middle of a story. It would detract a lot from whatever was going on when they put it in, and not feel good afterwards. They could cut it down to a couple minutes and have it fit better, but that would detract from the impact of the sequence a lot.",

            "I'd have to disagree\n\nThough the impact of the scene might have been greater, I think the message would have been more shallow. Like the magician pulling out the table cloth, it would have been like\n\n\"look audience, you've misjudged this person\"\n\nI think the point of Carl's journey is that he was a good person, but no longer is. The journey is his chance at redemption. By putting the montage at the beginning of the movie, you show the audience that Carl is still an ass hole even if he has good reasons to be. Instead of later finally understanding his reasons, like as a movie twist, you spend the movie rooting for him to find that person again. \n\nI think that's the real way you misjudge his character. The audience assumes that he's old, so is character journey is over, but life is about continual growth. His life didn't end, and he still has a responsibility to live up to the expectations he and his wife had for him at the beginning of the film. \n\nI think that's a more powerful and original message than coming to realize you misjudged the character Carl because you didn't imagine what was causing him to act that way.",
            "Fuck you we dont mess up anything as we are the best animation studio ever.",
            "I strongly disagree.\n\nThe point of the first 10 minutes is meant to give a backstory to Carl\u2019s character and his motivations. If that key element to the movie was left out then we would just see Carl as a mean old man that ends up flying his house to paradise for no purpose. We wouldn\u2019t have any feelings toward Carl. There would be no rooting for Carl. He would not be a protagonist that would be enjoyable to follow.\n\nThere is also the idea that this is a Kid\u2019s movie. If the kids weren\u2019t rooting for Carl as a main character and they in fact made him out to be the villain then the reveal wouldn\u2019t be as effective. Some would argue that Snape became a good guy just because of one flashback revealing everything he did was to protect Harry. This is not equivalent to Carl\u2019s story. Carl wasn\u2019t doing what he was doing for Russel\u2019s benefit even if he has to appear bad. Carl was doing what he was doing for his wife. This reveal later on would provide some justification later on but it wouldn\u2019t make viewers forget the bad taste that Carl had left in their mouths.\n\nIf the first 10 minutes was put in the middle of the film instead it wouldn\u2019t nearly have the same effect. They tell a story of a character that we know nothing about causing us to care for them and then they rip away something we had just started becoming connected to. The punch is there because of how much viewers have already fallen in love with Carl and Ellie. Ellie was a huge punch to the viewers because she was 50% of the cast. There weren\u2019t any characters that we knew of that could fill that void she left. We couldn\u2019t say \u201cthat\u2019s fine Russel is my favorite character anyways.\u201d For Carl, Ellie was a huge chunk of his life and in the first 10 minutes she is a huge chunk of the movie. This paragraph is becoming repetitive so next paragraph.\n\nThe music in the opening is another reason why it would be less effective later on. Musical themes are used throughout movies as a way to show growth. (YouTube channels like Sideways are fun to watch as he analyses the music of films. My favorite is his Into the Spiderverse video). We hear that main theme for Up for the in such an emotionally powerful situation. This beginning is what influences how the theme affects us later on in the film. \n\nI have gotten tired of typing this out because I am on my phone but I would be happy to respond to retorts or questions or whatever.\n\nEdit: Completely forgot another point I thought of. It would be soooo out of place in the middle of the film. A majority of the opening is without dialogue. We don\u2019t even hear them speak a single time as adults. To put something like this in the middle of a film would heavily disrupt the flow. In the beginning the opening is still in chronological order. It isn\u2019t a flashback, it is the main storyline. To put a 10 minute long flashback in the middle of a film with a steady pace and over half of the flashback has no dialogue the flow of the film would be thrown out the window. \n\nMight edit this more as I think of more idk.",

            "My unpopular opinion is that I\u2019m not a fan of UP.  The first ten minutes you mentioned are devastating and really emotional, but then the rest of the movie has weird shit like giant birds and dogs that can \u201ctalk.\u201d  Just super wacky.\n\nAnd I love a lot of the other Pixar films.  I just don\u2019t like this one much.",
            "We need to know why he\u2019s so tied to the house and why Paradise Falls is so important. \n\nYou\u2019re suggesting it basically starts with him waking up in bed as an old man?  Then we just have an old man who beats another person with his walking cane for bumping his mailbox and then ties 1000+ balloons to his house and sails it to South America...and we don\u2019t understand any of his motivation?\n\nThe photo book in the end is to remind Carl that even though they didn\u2019t get to Paradise Falls...Ellie still absolutely loved living her life with him. It was enough of an adventure. He felt like he failed her and he didn\u2019t live a good enough life. It\u2019s an incredibly powerful moment when he looks through and reads what she wrote:\n\n\u201cThanks for the Adventure, now go have a new one!\u201d\n\nAnd right after that he literally throws everything in the house out the window. He\u2019s moved on and is having a new adventure...he literally flying a house!\n\nJust to add: the first thing we here Ellie say in the movie, as a little girl, is: \u201c Adventure is out there!\u201d  That is the set up for the whole movie - she says it while she is inside what becomes their house. \n\nAnother add: If we understand Carl\u2019s motivation it helps us to suspend disbelief at the whole \u201cold man flies a house with balloons to South America\u201d thing.",
            "I\u2019m going to disagree. The story isn\u2019t about Carl and Paradise Falls. The story\u2019s more redemptive. We\u2019re cheering for Carl to get to to the falls after the first ten minutes. We want him to succeed. The story then becomes about Carl getting to have moments with the child they never had. Carl needs prodding to see this which is why he turns a cold shoulder to Russell. Carl is scarred from the life he has had. And Russell is oblivious to all of this and sees it as a chance to get his patches. When Carl sees the photo album it isn\u2019t a recap but Russel understanding why he was brought to the falls and his motivations change from himself to helping Carl. \n\nIn short, UP! Is about three characters (Carl, Russell, Dug) breaking free of their situation. Carl is breaking free from a life where he never had the opportunity to do what he dreamt most to do. Russell is Carl when he was younger getting to break free from only adventuring in the city. Dug is breaking free from his cruel master. The story is about them escaping their situation and getting to do/have what they always wanted or felt like they missed out on.",
            "Isn't it cool how changing the placement of just one scene changes the message of the film! When in the middle, the film's message is one of acceptance and realisation that 'life is the real adventure all along'. When in the middle, it becomes one of not judging people for their appearances, as they may be harbouring something important that you don't know.",
            "I was about to become a keyboard warrior for talking shit about that holy grail and then after reading your point, I have to agree. Not to say they should've done it like OP's point, but that's also an alternative route that would have worked as well.\n\nAs a side note, the only thing I never liked about that movie is the tacked-on forgettable villain. Like, did we really need one? I know villains are supposed to  be the counter-point to the protagonist, but for a movie like this I think it would have gotten away with no antagonist at all. It's just an adventure of an old man and a kid. Or if they must a villain, I think time and age would've been ideal. After their adventure we skip 10 years to see the old man die but we see him with a smile on his face signifying that he had live a long and fulfilling life.",
            "Interestingly what you're proposing is what they attempted with an earlier draft with Finding Nemo and it didn't work. \n\nI think that fault with Up is that it's a feature film. If you treat it like a ten minute movie that ends with the house taking off, it is an absolutely perfect short film. Everything after that is fun but not needed. The story is told. It's enough that he's off on an adventure, we don't need to see him actually make it to the waterfall.",
            "In order for that to have been the middle of the film, they would have needed to spend the first half of the film just observing his life with Ellie. The movie was about the journey he made to honor her after she died. Their life before that was perfectly ordinary, not much to tell. So they basically summarized it so they could get to what the actual meat of the movie was about. Enough to make you understand the significance of the journey without needing to waste too much time on it.",
            "Okay ill upvote because its a good unpopular opinion. But i disagree so hard. The way you wished the story was, is so lame. like of course the old man has a backstory and it would be foreseeable what tragedy might have happened in his life. Idk how to explain it but your version sounds like ive already watched plots like these in a lot of other films already and it adds nothing new\n\nthe way the film actually brought it up is brilliant. Everyone already got the gist of the movie by just looking at the movie poster. But no one was expecting this emotional backstory right at the start of the film like you had no idea what is happening and its like youre in the wrong movie and then youre sitting there like ooooooh man this poor old man..

This character actually had a sad backstory!\u201d, and sometimes it\u2019s too cliche or can distract from the plot.\n\nThis time, we *know* why he\u2019s doing this, so we can wonder: \u201cWill he change?

Yes, we would have been wrong but it might not have been enough to undo that damage. Remember the ents scenes in the lord of the rings? A ton of people disliked that portion. Its boring. Its meant to be boring though because the characters are bored and we are supposed to identify with them. That meta-knowledge however for many people didnt save that part of the movie.  \nI believe in a similar way, if it had gone down how your described, we would have disliked Carl for like half the movie. And even if by the end we understood it, the damage would have been down and we would have been annoyed for half the movie. And in my opinion, you shouldnt have to watch a movie more than once to enjoy it.",

            "Here are my thoughts:\n\nThis is something that I learned to call \u201cinfo dumping\u201d (a.k.a exposition dump) which is apparently a form of writing mistake.\n\nThe problem with the concept of dumping involves the fact that those first ten minutes are giving the audience something to reference to instead of something that drives  the narrative, which is partially the reason why the interest/attention span when watching the movie is gone for some viewers as initial questions are answered rather than asked.\n\nThere\u2019s this other practice that\u2019s kinda different that\u2019s intense to drive hopes of drawing interest from the audience, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned to be called a **narrative hook**. This practice is probably what Pixar was going for. If you want to see an example, Youtubers do this a lot.",
            "I don't think it was about making a better film but delivering the theme of the movie the best they could. Holding off the 10 minutes until the middle would be best for your average movie but not for this one, I think that would have ruined the emotional baggage the audience carries with Carl.\n\nThose first ten minutes breaks our heart so we know exactly what's going on with Carl and we can't help but agree with his behavior, because we just watched life betray him more than once. By doing so we're no longer watching Carl from the outside trying to figure why he's mean, we know exactly why and we feel for him.\n\nThis is how the book reveal almost an hour into the movie is so effective. We sat through that, with those feelings, for an hour. By the time the book reveal happens it's at the point where Carl feels utterly defeated and his dreams destroyed that he says \"fuck it\" and decides to open his wife's book. Making that reveal a tear jerker for someone who was focused on that aspect of the movie.\n\nUP is a movie about living life after losing a loved one and about living with grief. Everything Carl does after the beginning is out of grief and regret because he could never move on from losing the love of his life. He carried a heavy amount of guilt for never taking her to South America and therefore never really lived a life after she died, because you can say his life ended with her. He doesn't have a new lease on life until after that reveal because that was the point of the movie; living with grief and learning to live after you've lost.\n\nSo placing that montage would have ruined UP because the audience wouldn't have enough time to bond and relate to Carl shortly before getting his revelation. Pixar wanted us to suffer along with him. While having the more energetic kid as someone we can still root for.\n\nEDIT: Proofreading",

            "I get it, but I disagree. To me that\u2019s bad and lazy storytelling that I see a lot in tv and movies, in my opinion. It\u2019s \u201cthe twist\u201d or \u201crevelation\u201d to the audience. If shown later, it cheapens the effect since we don\u2019t have foresight to know his motivations. I\u2019m not a writer or an expert by any means, but I feel like the best shows lay the premise and motivations out in the beginning without having to inject things last minute to justify the plot. We can\u2019t relate or sympathize with him if we don\u2019t know it from the beginning for 2/3rd of the movie. So then we have to grasp it all in the 3rd act.\n\nThe genius of it is knowing the starting point and still being able to hold up the story to the end. I think the scene where you\u2019re talking about is for HIM, not for the audience. That\u2019s his growth in the story. Of course we realize it, but with someone whose life was so devastated by the death of his wife, it makes sense that in the moment he finally comes has the epiphany.\n\nWith that said, you get an upvote for an unpopular opinion, but an interesting one! :)",

            "Here\u2019s an upvote for the controversial title. I still disagree with your points, but can understand where you\u2019re coming from. Moving the 10 min to the middle of the film scene would definitely heighten the impact of the 10min sequence higher AT THAT MOMENT. \n\nBut I think the entire first half of the movie would lose so much because of the lack of Carl\u2019s character development. With the first 10 min of the movie, you get a tangible reason for Carl\u2019s grouchy demeanor and not just some stereotypical grumpy old man archetype without reason. He lost his lifelong partner and friend, and what\u2019s worse, feels that he wasn\u2019t able to accomplish anything before her loss. Sets the whole tone for the movie imo, and movie the intro sequence for a minor boost in impact won\u2019t recover the loss of plot depth such a move would make.\n\nEdit: You argue that the sudden reveal for his gruff nature would make for a bigger story. I argue that the initial understanding provided and his character\u2019s progression through the story to his eventual acceptance at the end is what makes the movie so heartfelt.",
            "I see your points and they are fair. I disagree that they fucked up. The movie was supposed to have the sad quiet beginning showing you who he is and why he is unhappy. The movie would feel entirely different if it was a mystery.  The lion king had the tragic death is in the middle and showed his overcoming. It\u2019s just different tones of how the movie would play out or how they want it to feel. I like your idea though. Interesting topic.",
            "I totally, completely, 100% disagree. Putting the reveal in the middle would have depicted Carl as a stereotypical lonely old Scrooge, and by putting the montage in the middle as a \u201creveal\u201d, Up would have been converted to a cliche, stereotypical movie arc. Carl would be the Scrooge who became a grump out of a tragic past love\u2014which we\u2019ve seen in dozens of others stories\u2014and the method we learn his character would have been exactly like what can be seen in dozens of other movies. Up\u2019s beginning montage is powerful because it showed up unexpectedly; for its time, such a deep character reveal at the beginning of a movie was pretty much unheard of. This lended it power.\n\nHowever, this is an UNPOPULAR OPINION subreddit, not a POPULAR one, so take my upvote.",

The first 10 minutes of Up could have been put in the middle for a bigger reveal but I feel Pixar put it in the beginning because of their previous experience with Finding Nemo.",
            "The thing is they do that too often in movies already.\n\nThe difference win UP is that we feel the emotion from the beginning.\n\nIn normal shows and movies we usually see the character\u2019s motivation or the side characters motivation later, at least that the traditional way.\n\nIn UP we feel the pain and drive to get there for the whole movie, which is one of the reasons the movie was known for its emotional drive.\n\nThis is unpopular so I will give you an upvote :)",

            "The only reason I have that comes to mind is that it has us sympathize heavily with Carl right from the start. \n\nTo only be introduced to Carl as seeing him grouchy, closed off, and refusing to befriend others- It can feel annoying, pointless, and stupid without a reason given. And while the reason can be given later on in the movie and the sympathy may hit harder (especially with guilt for having judged too quickly.) Having people sympathize with your character later in the movie is too big a risk. People do leave movie theaters if they don\u2019t like it and it \u201ctakes too long\u201d for them to like a character.\n\nHowever, when we see Carl\u2019s life explained, it has us immediately sympathize with him, and like him because we understand his crankiness and closed-off behavior.\n\nI also find it as a great hook, line, and sinker. Everyone\u2019s immediately invested. They see how they fall in love and the depictions are genuine, thought out, and strong. And when everyone cries from Ellie not being able to have children, to Ellie\u2019s funeral, to when you see Carl is left all alone- You empathize so much that when Carl has an idea to make himself feel happy- You\u2019re all for it.\n\nThis explains the motivation of Carl\u2019s desires- Making it so that the audience roots for him immediately. When there\u2019s risk or obstacles, you are genuinely worried about how Carl (and later Russel, Doug, and Kevin) are going to get through. Because you empathize with Carl greatly, and when you see him struggle, doubt himself, and think about giving up- You worry, you cry, you empathize. When you see him revive, get a second wind, and try try try again- It feels more like him conquering fears, emotional scars, and sadness. We don\u2019t see Carl as bull-headed and stubborn; We see Carl as strong, brave, and loving.",

            "I feel that this fundamentally misses/ignores the actual theme of the movie, which is about dealing with grief and loss of a loved one. In your version, you've made Carl's motivations a secret for half the movie, so then the reveal of his tragic backstory becomes the emotional climax of the movie. This completely undercuts the MAIN MESSAGE of the movie, which is that moving on with your life isn't a bad thing. That the person who you lost would WANT you to go on with your life instead of spending the rest of it mourning them. And also that you can live a fulfilling, wonderful life even if it doesn't resemble the plan that you originally set out with.  \n\n\nBecause we know about Carl and Ellie's relationship, we understand why he refuses to move or sell his house. We understand why he feels the need to get to Paradise Falls, and we empathize with him the entire way. We WANT him to get there because that's what he and Ellie always wanted. We understand that Carl feels like he failed her, and like he failed himself, because they never went on their \"great adventure\" together. In the actual (and IMO far superior) emotional climax, when he rediscovers the photo album in the wreckage of his house (which is not so subtly named \"My Adventure Book\") which we understand that Carl has always thought the photo album was empty. Because thematically, he thinks they never actually went on an adventure. So when he discovers that Ellie actually filled it with the memories they DID make, he realizes that he had been forgetting the great, full life that they had together. This is why they have the first 10 minutes at the beginning. They are Carl and Ellie's life together AS HE SEES IT when the main plot starts. And then we get the flashback during the climax to other memories that they made, and Carl realizes that he was Ellie's adventure. You've heard the \"the real \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ was the friends we made along the way\" meme? It's literally this. And by having this moment be the crux of the story, it re-contextualizes their entire relationship for Carl AND THE AUDIENCE at the same time.   \n\n\nAnd none of that works if we don't know about Ellie's death until the second act.",

            "Can\u2019t agree with this at all. The beauty of the sequence is how tragically it makes you feel without knowing anything about the characters. The fact that 10 minutes into the movie you\u2019re already sympathetic towards the main character is remarkable storytelling. \n\nPlus, it just hits you in the gut. Had the sequence been in the middle of the movie, you\u2019d already know the ending. The fact that Elle wasn\u2019t in the movie up until that point, and that he\u2019s looking at pictures in a photo album, her death in the sequence wouldn\u2019t come as a shock.",

            "I disagree, but I also agree a little.\n\nThe first 10 minutes of Up are the best 10 minutes of any movie. They are also a standalone movie of exceptional quality. They deserve to exist, and deserve to be given the spotlight and be prioritized. Up is basically two movies in one, where the second movie is a standard good Pixar film... but the first movie is straight up unparalleled emotional magic. And I defy you to say otherwise.\n\nHowever, I do agree that the \u2018second\u2019 movie in Up, without the first, would have worked well with the version you envision; and that it could have started and originally be intended to be shown that way. And it would have made it better as a standalone movie...\n\nIt just stopped mattering when they realized that they\u2019d made their flashback sequence way too good to be a mere flashback sequence.

They think up something really heartwarming and sweet for the ending. But the middle? Nothing but a dumb bird and dogs with lol funny voices. There's not a drop of emotion after the first fifteen minutes of the movie until the final five. Lame.",

If kept in the beginning, it\u2019d lead to a bit question to forward to present time clearly without Ellie\u2014 but adding it to the middle like you mention would be a bit overkill with the decently long montage followed after.",

            "I disagree I think the flashback has to be in the beginning. If the flashback wasn\u2019t in the beginning of the story you wouldn\u2019t be invested in Carl as a character and just think this dude is an annoying boomer.",

            "Agree 100% - Time to recut the film.",
            "Hey, I actually disagree with this! Empathy for a character doesn't take an entire movie. I saw this as a kid right after my grandpa died and I think if they slipped that in mid film it would've broke me that much more. The idea was to build empathy for this grumpy old man, not to make the audience cry",
            "I've never thought of Up like this, but I definitely hate how movies often reveal what, I believe, would have made interesting reveals and twists for the sake of making a cool trailer. I know it was a comic, but that new Movie Bloodshot would have been way cooler if they didn't reveal that he was being manipulated in the fucking trailer.",
            "I don't believe that \"Caring\" for a character is a must from moment one..\n\nBeing intrigued is more important.. the storyteller should tell the story in a way that captivates you from the first moment, while arousing your intrigue throughout..\n\nThat way there is more freedom in how he tells the story; the storyteller isn't obliged to build scenes for the audiences sake. He'll tell the story more organicaly.. and when the credits roll and you think about the characters and their journey's you'll care.. \n\nAll I'm trying to say is that \"knowing\" about the character isn't as important as the timing of the reveal.. thats what seperates a good movie from a LEGENDRY!",

            "I thought it was perfect the way it was. Dividing the story allowed us to explore two separate emotional threads. \n\nShowing their life in the beginning sets up Carl\u2019s perspective, from the time of Ellie\u2019s death to meeting Russell. He felt like his best years were over without his loving wife, and has lived as a grumpy old man since. The first half of the movie is him finally beginning to break out of that mindset and go enjoy life without Ellie. \n\nHOWEVER he still lives with the regret that Ellie herself never got to go on this grand adventure. That\u2019s something he has no power to change, and that still hangs over him even as he embarks on his own travels. \n\n[Then he opens the book](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wsG2S_1PRnk), and we see that he\u2019s *never* been able to bring himself to get past the \u201cStuff I want to do\u201d page because of that regret. But now that he turns that page, he/we finally get to see Ellie\u2019s perspective. Now he realizes their life together *was* her grand adventure, and now he feels free to fully love and embrace his own life after she\u2019s gone.",
            "I don't agree with you, but that's a valid argument. I like it in the beginning, but I wouldn't have minded it in the middle as you described.",

            "That sounds super cliche and frustrating. Take the upvote",
            "I think that's a fair point, but I think putting a scene that sad in the middle of the movie would have been so emotionally devastating it would have made laughing out having fun difficult. By putting it first you get the trauma out of the way and can start to heal over time with Carl.",
            "Damn I actually agree after reading that. It definitely would\u2019ve made more sense that way.",
            "I'll be the one to disagree saying no. I disliked the movie overall (not to the point of considering it a bad movie, but certainly a way hyped movie which is far from how good people make it sound like) BUT that scene is fantastic, by far the best in the movie (and this is something I think we can all agree in). If this scene had happened in the middle of the film, I would had never seen it as I would had stopped the movie way before that as that scene was my only driver to finish the whole movie.",
            "I disagree. We needed to set the tone. We needed the old guy to be someone we care about from the beginning. Showing why he is grumpy and not wanting to move at the start helps build his character more than the cliche \"asshole turns out to be a decent person with shitty circumstances\"",
            "am i the only human who hasn\u2019t watched UP.",
            "I think it's so the audience doesn't hate the main character for 30+ minutes. No one dislikes Carl because you immediately get his backstory whereas if we had to wait we'd get a different feeling throughout the first half seeing him being cold to everyone",
            "I will say that the way it is now gives us a better sense of how Carl felt because it was like we wanted it as long as he did because we knew the story the whole time. Had we not loved Carl from the beginning, would you have made it that far in the story? Maybe, maybe not. But you're right it would have been much more emotional.",
            "Well it could be tested with a bit of editing for someone willing.",
            "I disagree.  The character arc in Up is mainly from the point of view of Carl and how Carl can move past Ellie's death through his wacky adventures with Russell.  The montage in the beginning shows us *why* Carl is such a grump curmudgeon in the beginning (losing Ellie) and who Carl can *is capable of being* (Carl while still with Ellie).  In a way, it foreshadows the ending completion of Carl's character arc.\n\nIf the montage was placed somewhere in the middle, we would just see an old grumpy dude at the beginning who's just a dick to Russell seemingly just because.  The montage in the middle of the movie would still lend itself towards a character arc but it would be less impactful as we would have to watch the first half of the movie with no investment in who the character of Carl is.  In essence, Carl's character arc would only start in the middle of the movie (post-montage) leaving the first half of the film kind of bland since we don't know who Carl is and would have no reason to care about him.",
            "I was going to disagree but you actually have a really good point. Also as a side-note, Michael Giacchino makes the scene way more powerful with the beautiful score.",
            "I always thought the photo album scene was more emotional than the opening, it's half way through the film and the viewer has developed a connection with the characters by this point.\n\nI must say I came here thinking I'd disagree but now OP mentioned it, I agree! The opening and photo album scene should have been delivered together!!",
            "I think the point of having it over and done with was to make way to focus on the relationship betseen carl and russel. The story is about carls love for el, but its mainly about the grieving process and moving on. If you were to throw that emotional rollercoaster in the middle it would distract viewers from russel, dug and carls recovery, instead making them focus more on carls relationship with ell. Also it would darken the tone of the film a lot more, right where its supposed to be picking up. Pixar loves to make us cry by getting us to remember fun times in a sad situation, ie >!wall e grabbing eves hand when u think he ded!<, reminding us about wall-e's dream to hold someones hand. Removing the exposition makes the story confusing until it is just depressing in the middle with that scene. The house is a sort of metaphor for carls inability to let go of his wife and move on, but we cant understand that if we dont get the full story of why hes alone. Plus pixar already does this when he reads through the photo album again, thats the second major tear jerker, >!when he sees she already had her dream fulfilled, which is shown in the 10min opening, by living and loving him!<, is waaay bittersweet, because now the story resolves, carl can move on knowing his wife died in peace, and now he has something to look forward to, dug and russel.",
            "Sure you're right, but realize that it's a Disney movie. Putting the montage at the front makes the film overall more light-heated and digestible, while retaining the moving/engaging qualities that suck you into the character. A strong emotional punch is too much for a mass market family movie.",
            "I clicked on this thinking what an absolute pile of horseshit of an opinion, then I read the post, and I totally agree.",

            "At first I disagreed but once you painted the picture it sounded like it would totally work",
            "I disagree entirely!! When I watched the movie, I was drawn into those first 10 minutes. I thought we were following the main characters, and they were sweet and adorable. And then she died, and it was a sucker punch that ripped the heart out of me. \n\nIf we had started with Russel and Carl, I wouldn't have been NEAR as invested. And I would have known that Carl was alone by the time we got to that sequence in the middle of the movie, so I knew Ellie was dead, and it wouldn't have hurt nearly as much. I think the unexpectedness of that intro is part of the beauty of it. \n\nThat heartbroken feeling at that beginning is what makes you care about Carl. Because you feel the loss of Ellie throughout the movie, just as he does.",

            "Ok good job you've convinced me too. Someone needs to make an edit to make it like that",
            "I still think it\u2019s very effective the way it is. In just 10 minutes the life of this character is established and you understand him and his motivations so that throughout the film you are seeing things in context.\n\nCarl goes into the story longing to give his lost wife what she always wanted, making up for all the things he didn\u2019t do, and then the second scene where he goes through the photo album has the same effect on the audience as it does on him, he realizes that he already did give her the adventure of a lifetime just by loving her, and now it\u2019s time he lived for himself. His perspective is changed and he comes to a deep realization. \n\nI don\u2019t think it would have worked as well if we learned everything about him all in one scene 2/3s in to the movie. His arc is much better structured this way, the movie starts at a logical point.",
            "Make a fan cut and see if you\u2019re right",
            "There's a pretty simple way to test this. Rip the movie, edit the intro into the spot you're talking about, and show it to people who have never seen the movie. It may be imperfect because you don't have all the tools of a video production company at your disposal, but it should be enough to test your claim.\n\nI'll argue that Pixar almost certainly already did that if what you think is true and it was originally intended to be in the middle. They probably did some testing and found it didn't work there. But, hey, maybe not. Maybe it was a choice to, as others say, establish Carl as the main character and get early sympathy for him despite his cantankerous behavior.\n\nThis isn't something that we have to go on arguing about. We can try it out and see.",
            "This movie is about Carl dealing with the loss of losing his wife Ellie and the guilt he feels for not being able to fulfill their dreams together. \n\nCarl is the protagonist and we as the audience are meant to go on this journey together which is why it works to understand his motivations at the beginning of the movie."

This is because my mom always tells me \"If it weren't for god I would've **\\[*****insert messed up action*****\\]*****\\****\". So when I got older, I realized just how messed up that actually is.\n\nThe reason as to why it is messed up  is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion. What if that religion never existed? What would you do if you all of a sudden didn't like religion anymore? What would you do then? Would you go, and kill people? Would rob banks? Would you do all the horrible things you wanted to do previously?\n\nThose who think this way usually don't even know or care for the reason *why* they shouldn't do horrible things. They only seem to not do awful things only because they think that something bad will happen to them, based upon their religious belief.\n\n*Now to clarify, this isn't to say that I hate people who believe in religion, or think all people who use religion in their life think this way (although, I do personally despise religion, as it has caused a lot of trouble in my life). This is to say that I think if you use religion as your entire reason for not doing awful shit, then you aren't a good person in my eyes.*\n\n**\\*Note: Some of the things my mother has said were REALLY bad. She even said that she would've killed me and my siblings by now if it weren't for god. Yeah.......Really.

I'm talking about a sizable amount of religious people who refrain from evil deeds simply because they fear harsh consequences based on their own religion.** ***I repeat not all people think this way, but a sizable amount of people do.***\n\n**Edit 2: Displaying my opinion the internet isn't edgy.**\n\n**Edit 3: Don't disregard what I say simply because of my age. If you think this way, you're being closed minded.**\n\n**Final Edit: This is a nuanced topic, so there is a lot of room to debate here. I'm okay with that. However, please try to be respectful to others in this thread, and don't attack, and insult people for their own beliefs on the matter. Everyone should try to learn something from thread about humanity, morality, and religion as a whole. Thanks for teaching me a few things here guys, I appreciate it.

But religious texts and their principles remain the same throughout the ages, which create a sense of consistency through time.\n\nSlavery as we know it today is absolutely wrong. Yet back in the 1800s any white man who owned a slave wouldn't have been considered doing anything morally wrong, because it was an accepted practice in society. Now we agree that keeping slaves is morally wrong, because current morals say that all men are equal.\n\nBeing gay or lesbian is also increasingly accepted now by normal standards, yet just in the last century it was considered morally wrong to have same sex attractions. What was once considered immoral has now changed into something that is accepted by society.\n\nMy point is that morals are relative. Who is to say that the actions we commit now won't be considered immoral in the future? Would that make you an immoral person?\n\nWhile I might not agree with everything that religious texts advocate, at least the message they preach remains consistent.\n\nJust my two cents :)",

            "There is a HUGE problem with this kind of argument. This view comes from a perspective where society encourages nice actions. For example all our lives we are told not to kill, therefore naturally one should be inclined not to kill. Our environment largely dictates what we perceive as normal. Killing is abnormal, not killing is normal therefore not killing is the default. Yes, in a society that discourages killing, ofc you don't need religion to tell you not to kill because society is already pressuring you not to. But take a society that has little to no developed moral code, this logic doesn't apply. The thing is, humans are inclined to be selfish and greedy and only look after themselves. During the beginning of the pandemic we saw hoarders become the talk of the town. WE KNOW THAT IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES PEOPLE WILL BE JERKS and that's exactly what happened. However someone that actually follows religious moral codes would be inclined NOT to do that because they have something outside of both society and themselves that suggests the correct way to act. Or let's take the Aztec civilization. They sacrificed their own children, but to them is wasn't wrong at all. Obviously murder is wrong, but they had  no society that's discouraged it so they didn't care. That's where religion comes in and would tell them that those practices are wrong, despite what their society would suggest.",
            ">you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion\n\nThis is the core of your argument and it\u2019s not very well though-out. Are you saying each individual invents their own moral code *sui generis*? If so, you\u2019re simply wrong. Our moral codes are deeply dependent on how we\u2019re raised, where we\u2019re raised, what we\u2019re exposed to. If you recognize that we put together our own moral codes based on the factors I mentioned above, then there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with religion being one of those inputs. \n\nEssentially, what I\u2019m saying is that people can make religion *their own moral code* (to use the phrase in your essay) and it\u2019s no longer the contradiction you propose.",

            "I feel like you are generalizing a lot of religion and just basing it off Monotheistic religions. (I'm assuming some form of Christianity) I understand the sentiment that a bad person is still a bad person if they feel forced to be good. However, I think there are a lot of people that do need a 'moral figure' to help them get through some difficulties. I have serious depression and have incredible difficulty getting out of bed. After going to therapy, I was recommended just creating a 'diety style figure' for myself and ask it for help and motivations from time to time. Some people with serious issues do need that type of figure. Someone that can 'guide them' especially when you lose hope in your own abilities. \n\nI feel like a bad person can only be defined by how willing they are to better themselves. If you do bad things and don't want to change, then you definitely are a bad person. But if you do bad things and decide to look to a god to stop yourself, it doesn't inherently mean you are a bad person. I find it incredibly hard to define a moral code with my issues and self-doubt, and I completely understand someone that feels the need to have someone else do it for them.",

I\u2019m not doing good deeds because I want favor by God or in the afterlife, but because I want to do them which I think holds more weight than someone thinking that they should do this because it is a good thing and will get them into heaven or whatever. Some people actually think like that too. \n\nMildly, because I think religion/spirituality can help people get on a better path and become more of a \u201cgood person\u201d through that, but there\u2019s plenty of \u201cterrible people\u201d who use religion to justify their actions.",

That if there is no God outside of humans to give us an objective moral code, the only other choice is to be at the whim of our own subjective moral codes which you have no right to denounce any one else's.  One of the main reasons why I still believe God has to exist. And most likely it is a good loving God that exists like the one mentioned in the old and new testaments, because even though evolutionarily speaking we should be like animals where we shouldn't give a crap if homeless or elders get euthanized for the good of the species, we still place value on them for some reason.. and this points to a universal appreciation for the concept of \"love\" that you will find throughout our species.

Everyone knew you, and you would get punished.\n\nWhen humans started to form large groups or societies bad people could get away with things because the group was so large. Religion- An epic force that could see what everyone was doing, and enforce the rules and punish people- sort of bubbled up as way to deter people from immoral behavior. \n\nOstracism from the group was a deterrent for immoral behavior when groups were small. And when societies formed religion was absolutely necessary to deter immoral behavior because the threat of ostracism was not nearly as bad. \n\nSo religion was actually created to prevent immoral behavior.",

How do you stop yourself from doing bad things like say, kill people?\" Something along the lines of that. It was the dumbest thing I had ever heard. I tried to explain to him that the reason I don't kill people is because I would feel bad for them and their family, they didn't deserve to die, it's wrong and all that. He just didn't get it. Then he tried to convince me that I was religious in a way, cause if I could see that something is wrong, then that must mean that I am actually scared that some higher power would punish me if I did it.

            "Theres a reason divorce is so rampant in the non-religious western world and nearly every person you know has been cheated on. And don't tell me that only religious people cheat because the people I've spoken to aren't religious at all or call themselves religious, but aren't really practicing it. Religion is reason most people are polite and prefer to be polite and not kill people or rape or cheat. However the rampant sex culture in the non-religious west and the free boyfriend and girlfriend culture makes people think that premarital sex is fine and has no consequences. Plus having intercourse with tons of people and experiencing so many of them will lead to trust issues and comparing in the future. So it makes people think that through culture cheating is fine as long as you get away with it. If people were constantly watched this wouldn't be the case. Us religious people say that God watches us while even if you think no one else is. Non-religious people don't see anyone else watching. So they are more likely to commit an evil act when no one is watching. Having sex with whoever isn't punishable now in the west which is why cheating happens and STDs are just skyrocketing. They haven't reached the point in that culture where killing isn't punishable as well, but they might as well because theres nothing stopping them. Without religion anything is permissible.",

Nobody is doing it to be \"Sexy\", or \"Cute\", like some people do with baby talk, that I feel is definitely weird and a little bit gross.

This is quite literally actual baby talk, that people use to talk with babies, but for animals and fun.\n\nI respect your hatred tword it. I get it. There are things I have hated for no reason as well. But honestly you sound like a very unpleasant bitter person who is to far stuck up his own \"mature adult\" ass. Reality check, growing up does not mean losing appreciation for cute things. Making stupid little games and jokes where appropriate is something normal adult people enjoy and they should. Life is not just about going to work, paying taxes/bills, and being \"grown adults\". Im not trying to insult you, again I get it. There are things I don't like/hate that most of everyone else seems to like. But I do my best not to be bothered by it and recognize that it might not be everyone else who is wrong, but myself.

The second reason is that younger people tend not to have any money to fund a campaign, and are busy actually establishing themselves, instead of running for office. Someone like Trump or Biden doesn't even really need donations to run for office, as they're both so wealthy. \n\nAs a guy who ran on an anti-establishment platform, Trump only did so well because he A) had his own money, and B) because the mainstream media was so offended by him that they ran 24/7 coverage of his campaign. If you get an anti-swamp nominee like Bernie or Tulsi, the established powers can usually either spin a narrative against them, or suppress their campaign entirely by fiddling with the rules.\n\nIt's not in the interest of people who hold all the cards to let a young person into positions of power.

            "I can't say I agree simply because the conditions that most directly affect cognitive ability in the elderly are very inconsistent. For instance, my father had early-onset Alzheimer's, making it so that by the time he passed at 64, he had days where he didn't remember my mother, and his ability to handle basic math had long gone. According to the doctors, the only reason he made it as far as he did was because his mind was actually extremely capable (he was a documented genius). Compare that to my maternal grandmother, who is in her late 80s and is only now showing very early signs of dementia. Cognitive function is too variable as it is, trying to judge it based on age seems unnecessarily inaccurate. I do think we should find ways to lower the median age of politicians to more closely match that of the population, but that has more to do with proper representation than cognitive ability.",

Term limits would promote a diversity of thought, help limit chances for corruption, and ensure that no senile lifer is just dominating every election. That way if there is an older person running they would be forced to run based on their beliefs and who they are rather than the fact they have x amount of years in office and that\u2019s who we have.

You hold THEM responsible for bullying and making your highschool life miserable which in term created a repellent for relationships. \n\nYou have explained what OTHERS have done. What actions have YOU taken? \n\nLife is not a Team Sport, nobody is going to pick you up and live your life for you. Life/relationships  are a Free-for-All. Meaning, you are responsible for where you are and who you know. \n\nHow do you win the Free-For-All? You stop playing dude! You just gotta stop thinking about what other people are doing to your life, and start thinking about what YOU are going to do. Otherwise you will go through college with the same situation since YOU didn't change your actions. \n\nWhat do I mean by change? Well, what is making you unhappy? Do you have hobbies or activities that you enjoy? Are you spending your time doing the things you love, or are you doing things reluctantly because you think this is what other people want you to do? \n\nHow does this help with finding a relationship? \n\nDesperation, if you spend all day thinking about finding a girlfriend. What are you looking for? Would YOU date someone who is so desperate for a relationship that they would be willing to date 'anyone'? Or would you prefer someone that you could have shared hobbies with and enjoy each other's company? \n\nThis is what they mean by \"Just be yourself\" and \"put yourself out there\" they aren't saying \"to put the minimal effort out and expect a loving relationship\". They say to be YOU, meaning whoever YOU want to be. \n\n Who are you u/firenationommulate ? You're fresh from High school and have your life ahead of you. What do you want to do in the world (other than be in a loving relationship)? This is what potential partners/friends will want to know from you before deciding if you are worth their time.

It is not weird, it\u2019s actually very normal. So many people enter their first relationships when in college (or college age) or even later. 200 people is a small group, the chance of finding someone who is your type and whose type you are _and_ you both like each other (someone can totally be your type but you can still not like them that way, it happens all the time) _and_ the timing being right is very, very small. \n\nYou are you and you are exactly right for someone (several someones actually). You probably haven\u2019t met them yet and you might not for a while and that\u2019s okay. Because you _will_ find them. You may find some less ideal matches before you do, you might not. But finding love is for a big part about chance and the only thing you can do about it is continue to be yourself and grow as a person because that helps you get noticed by the right person. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be okay, you\u2019ll find that person",

            "Many men share the same sentiment as you, but I\u2019m a bit concerned with the way you phrased some of your thoughts.\n\nIt is 100% okay for a man to desire sex. We are all human, and sex is a natural desire. I do, however, think that it is a bit tricky expressing that desire these days as a man. You shouldn\u2019t have to feel ashamed for wanting sex, and I think it\u2019s actually counterproductive to try to prove to women that you\u2019re \u201cjust a good guy\u201d and that you\u2019re not just pursuing them for sex. There is nothing wrong with that belief, it\u2019s just not something that you should feel you have to prove to a woman. If you truly are a good guy with good intentions, then women will be able to pick up on that.\n\nMore importantly, stop thinking you are \u201cnot good enough for anyone\u201d. Your internal thought patterns and belief systems play a huge part in how you will be perceived by other people. If you do not feel that you are worthy, then how can you expect anyone else to want to date you? \n\nI think you should look inside and work on building yourself up and finding validation within yourself instead of seeking it from others. Sounds like you have some self-esteem issues, and being in a relationship won\u2019t magically fix that nor make you happy.\n\nSorry if I sound blunt, I don\u2019t mean to come off too harshly. It\u2019s just that I think very similarly to the way you do, and I needed a wake up call to realize that I had to change. I am currently in the process of trying to better myself too.\n\nFeel free to DM if you\u2019d like to discuss this further, and I can also help point you towards some resources that have helped me begin to reshape the way I think of myself as well.\n\nAlso, if you are depressed and feel you need help or just someone to talk to, [this is a good resource for online therapy, and it\u2019s free.](https://www.online-therapy.com/?ref=197609)\n\nGood luck with everything, keep your head up.

Wake up in the morning and do simple routine things like make your bed brush your teeth and while you\u2019re in the bathroom say to your reflection \u201cyou\u2019re an amazing guy you deserve to be happy\u201d and do it with a smile. \n\nAt first it\u2019ll be hard and it\u2019ll seem fake and it sort of is but after awhile you\u2019ll start making that normal and it\u2019ll start to feel real. Women like confidence (not arrogance) and can see if you are or not. So laugh when you want to cry, smile when you get sad and every now and then just go outside to be alone so you can cry, I mean like that ugly cry that wheezing, snot running down your face cry. Then tell yourself you\u2019ll be okay. \n\nIf you ever need a stranger who may understand to listen feel free to message me.",

Giving your love out the way you want to, to someone who is just as young as you, can be dangerous. Of course we are always susceptible to changing our minds, but it's defenitely most common during our teenage years.

I had no real friends growing up because I was chubby and weird cause I'm an artist and grew up in a small hick town and everyone would just shit on me in my hillbilly town I grew up in. I threw myself in to learning to play and write music it consumed me in a good way. My guitar was and is my friend that lays its head on my shoulder. Eventually, you will grow up and the things that are such a big deal as a kid just dont matter anymore and you will find people who will be better to you. Yeah, I was lonely and depressed often as a kid but it just made my music better. Embrace who you are and rock that! Having swagger and self confidence goes a long way as an adult. It's what I did and it worked. I'm now married to my best friend and she really is the best. I never had sex when all my friends were I was to introverted and had such low self esteem not to mention most the girls were to worried of what other people would say if they were with me. While my friends were having sex I was mastering guitar and it paid off cause I didn't have kids and stds and didn't learn to disrespect or use women. Yeah I had sex way before marriage but that doesn't mean you have to if that's not what you feel is right for you. Then I branched out by meeting people outside of that shit town online and life got much better. But it took me moving out of that town to have a better life. I know how bad it feels to be lonely but just know you won't always be and it's worth the long wait and loneliness when you find someone special. Just remember all those fuckers that make fun of you will mean nothing when you get out of school. Throw yourself into music or art or whatever floats your boat. My guitar has never let me down its never been late or not called or told me I'm weird or a loser or fat etc etc. Hell I even got hate dm's on Reddit yesterday from a post where I was trying to kind and friendly. Kinda made me feel bad at first but then I was like who gives a shit. Also, I suffer from manic depression they now call it bi-polar and this caused me to never be able to shake the pain inside me. If that's what's going on talk to your parents or whoever can take you to a doctor and get meds. It took tons of different meds till I found one that worked properly. Now I don't have a constant darkness hanging over me and it's allowed me to feel dare I say happy. I'm sure you have a million people on here willing to be nice to you especially after this post. But if you get to deep in darkness and have no one to turn to you can message me and I'll be a friend and ally and talk with you and will never judge you and will just be a friend. Stay safe and just remember those jerks wont mean anything when your out of school. Most of those people I went to school with ended up with shit lives and being horrible people. I kept my dignity and have and always will be a good person and that feels better at the end of the day. \ud83d\ude42",
            "Honestly I felt the same until I realized that feeling was largely because of biological desperation. My theory is many people/men start to care more about feelings and relationships after not having anything is so long because biologically your body just wants to reproduce - so mentally you\u2019ll start to bargain. \u201cI just want sex\u201d turns in to \u201cI just want love\u201d, that turns in to \u201cI just want cuddles\u201d then \u201cI just want a hug.\u201d\n\n\nBut once you get these things you\u2019ve been desperate for, most people immediately return to wanting sex.\n\n\nYknow how women complain men just used them - although sometimes that\u2019s true, I think some guys really feel they want an emotional relationship after such a long chastity - but once the sex is fulfilled, that need/want tends to die down.\n\n\nBut a bit of advice - I understand it\u2019s hard to have no relationship and how it is to fantasize about them - but remember to not settle. Many people have such a low self esteem, they settle for less because they think \u201cthis is all I\u2019ll ever have\u201d or \u201cthis is the best I\u2019m gonna get.\u201d But trust me - more people want you than you think.

            "Through Grade School, High School, and College. I didn\u2019t feel ready for a relationship, nor was there anyone that seemed interested. \n\nSomewhere through high school, I made a commitment that I would stay away from sex until I felt like a was ready financially and responsibly for a kid. Had too many cousins have kids early and I did not like seeing their struggle. They seemed happy, but they lived in cramp places, had money problems from time to time, usually struggled getting decent jobs...\n\nIn College, I was feeling more prepared. I knew I could manage my money well, but I wasn\u2019t quite there. I still lived with my parents, and I still only worked a minimum wage job through most of it. My final year of college, I quit my job to spend the last year focusing on school and looking for internships/work. A girl from my old job reached out to me, and we started going out. Unemployed, I was even less eager for big responsibilities, and it was tough for me to do too much on no income. I told her this, and she said she was fine with that. A few months later, after several attempts by her to persuade me into sex, I reminded her what I told her in the beginning. After she said \u201cWell I thought I could change your mind,\u201d our relationship didn\u2019t last much longer after that. I set clear boundaries, and she was aggressively trying to shift them before I was ready. \n\nA few months after that, I finished school, got a decent job with the help of my degree, and eventually found a home of my own. \n\nNow, I am pretty content with where I am. 29 years old. Paid off school, my car, etc. No debt other than the house, with plans to pay it off in about three years. I try to maintain my health. Eat right, exercise almost daily, hobbies, resting... Focusing on self-care and personal happiness, but if I run into someone willing to join me at this stage, I\u2019d be willing to give it a try.",
            "I was scrolling through my feed, saw this, and I just had to stop and say thank you very much for the reassurance that there are people like me out there. I was quite a late bloomer. I didn\u2019t start to like girls until my mid-twenties. I\u2019m now almost 30 and have never been in a relationship. The closest I came to being in one was when there was a girl I tried to see and sadly, was never able to. I waited 10 years to see her. I loved her for who she was. We were completely open and honest with each other about everything and she still accepted me for who I am. That felt so good to know. I was in an online cyber high school and she was a student there as well. She completely randomly found me and messaged me because she was bored and was looking for someone to talk to. She found me when I didn\u2019t want to be found and when I was hiding from the rest of the world because I wanted nothing to do with other students after public school. Yeah, I was that \u201cweird kid\u201d too. In the beginning, though she was suicidal. I helped talk her out of it though. I knew what to say to her because I was the same way once. At the end of that talk, I promised her a big hug whenever I\u2019d see her. That\u2019s what hurts the most for me - knowing I have to break that promise now. After 10 long and agonizing years of trying to see each other, I couldn\u2019t control my anxiety and depression anymore and ended up having to say goodbye. All that time, every single day, I would daydream about giving her that hug. She found someone else and I understood that she couldn\u2019t wait for me either but I will always want to be more than friends and just couldn\u2019t bear it anymore so that supported my decision further. Now, I\u2019m not currently ready to date anyone because one, this goodbye just recently happened and two, thanks to COVID-19, meeting someone else right now that I will end up caring about and not being able to see them until this finally all goes away will only put me right back into the same situation I was already in. So I\u2019m just going to have to wait it out, as difficult as it is. I really have no other choice.\n\nThanks so much again for sharing though.

A broke man in a dead end job, being short, too fat, bad teeth, etc are not attractive to most women. Men have there preferences as well. Every one is shallow about something and men and women are both attracted and discussed by similar and different things. \n\nYounge women are more fertile and this attractive to a lot of men. Older men with a lot of resources and stability are attractive to a lot of women. Everyone settles for something.

            "I agree that both are using each other. I think it's really cool that you've reflected on this, cause the perception of the deceitful gold-digger is quite prevalent.\n\nIt's a transaction. It always has been. To think it's one-sided is naive. It does beg the question, however, whether the transaction is balanced or nor.\n\nI do not think a transaction where one party enters to obtain something they need to have to survive, and another enters to obtain something they'd like to have, is balanced. There is an inherent power imbalance.\n\nTherefore, I do not feel sorry for people with wealth exchanging some of that to obtain access to another person's body. Especially if the person without money is fighting for their survival. That is not equal and is honestly very few steps away from being exploitive.\n\nI feel sorry for women living in poverty, finding that their only way to obtain financial security is to sacrifice their body, love and sex life. That's an awful place to be.\n\nLikewise, I feel bad for young men living in poverty, finding their only chance for a better life is to go with the middle aged women who prey on.\n\nEspecially when this dynamic pans out between 1st and 3rd world countries, so the access to a stable income is highly contrasted, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nJust as with the wealthy men, I do not feel bad for these women. Rather, I judge them for exploiting that someone else is living in tough conditions, and are willing to make sacrifices to get out of there.\n\nNot just that, I judge them for using the exploitative relationship between 1st and 3rd world countries, the resident of the former having access to wealth the latter would otherwise never have access to - of no fault of their own. To use that geopolitical, century old imbalance and injustice, to exploit someone who never had the same opportunities as you.. I have no respect for that.\n\nAs adults, we should strive to be aware of the power dynamics we take part of, and strive not to take advantage of others.\n\nSacrificing money will never be the same as sacrificing parts of yourself.\n\nSo..

During their engagement I heard her tell my sister \"I mean, I won't have to worry about money or bills with him, ya know\" as she continued on about how she isn't even really attracted to him physically but she loves how secure she'd be. She called it \"the smart move\".\nYet, again, they seem happily married. You wouldn't know if you didn't hear her say it and she has no history of using men or the like. She just met a guy with a good career and...yeah. She'll be ok so she took it. \n\nFor others it's just not being alone. I have friends and relatives that I know for a fact are with their partner because they prefer to have someone there than be single. I mean, does that make it less valid? I'm not sure. Probably not.\n\nI guess this kinda bleeds into my lifelong belief that every relationship has one person \"settling\" more than the other, that no relationship is started or based on equal and pure love.

            "\"Most\" and \"should never\" don't really work together, OP. Actors as a rule run the same gamut of intelligence and education that the general public does. Celebrities in general are basically a small sample of the entire populace and are shockingly representative of the wide range of specialties and expert knowledge that the rest of the world has. For every Jenny McCarthy, there's a Tom Morello. For every Serj Tankian, Nick Offerman, Ken Jeong, Emma Watson, Natalie Portman, Mayim Bialik, etc, there will necessarily be someone on the other end of the spectrum - a shit-disturber who, were they not rich, would be stuck in some hole wasting their time and health doing whatever held their attention for more than ten minutes at a time.\n\nHigh level adherents of Scientology are by and large a good example of this. Tom Cruise, John Travolta - there are a number of incidents which involved them which would have caused them to be locked up and placed on a psych hold. Instead Cruise can torment his exes and screw with his kids because he's shielded from the law, and Travolta's beliefs from Scientology against psychiatry got his kid killed. So no, these people should not be listened to.\n\nTom Morello - graduated from Harvard in Poli Sci. Compared to the general public, an expert.\n\nMayim Bialik - neuroscientist. Consummate expert.\n\nDolph Lundgren - I forget his exact field, but he's got a master's in something sciency iirc. Maybe a PhD.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger. The Governator - just an Austrian hick right? Not even close. Dude picked one discipline, bodybuilding, and became the best in the world - maybe all time. He then picked another, and another, and so on and so forth. If you tell me he isn't one of the brightest men currently alive based on the sheer breadth of experience and his excellence within his chosen professions, then you have got some wonky standards.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson - dude lived through the end of segregation. I would say he's well-qualified to speak on systemic racism, given he's absolutely been targeted by it, and may have gotten away from it based partially on his celebrity. Terry Crews, Jay-Z, and many others have similar qualifications.\n\nNick Offerman is an expert woodworker, Serj Tankian and System have been campaigning for Armenian freedom and rights for decades, Ken Jeong is a literal medical doctor. The list is not a short one.\n\n\n\nThe issue with idiocy and celebrity is that they feed off of each other. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jenny McCarthy used their platforms to propagate their stupidity and misinformation, and it made them more famous. The cycles continues. Donald Trump literally became president by spewing untrue bile all over Twitter and is attempting to hijack American democracy by continuing to do so.\n\nTo not listen to people who have no qualifications in general is an excellent idea. However, to say that all celebrities or actors should be ignored is not a good policy. If Danny Trejo goes on TV and says \"don't join gangs\", I'm not going to ignore it. Besides it being a good idea, Danny Trejo is an expert on being a felon because he was one. His being an actor doesn't discount that. Likewise with Ken Jeong and medical knowledge. \n\nAs with anyone else, the smart thing is to simply check on the person's qualifications and go from there. Stupid people are much more likely to be loud about their opinions. Oftentimes actual experts or at least people with a solid level of knowledge won't comment publically because they defer to people with even more expertise. \n\nTl;dr listen to people who know what they're talking about, whether via experience or learning. More actors look dumb because the smart ones don't speak up, but the level of intelligence in the entertainment industry is no lower (and in fact is probably a little higher on average) than the general public.",

            "The problem with actors divulging their political nonsense is not because of education but because actors congregate and aggregate their political opinions primarily from only a few major cities;\n\nNamely LA\n\nThey're also mostly rich, and lack scope and perspective of how the average person lives their life, what they care about, and how political policy effects them.\n\nActors are relatively clueless about politics 99% of the time because they are too rich to be effected by most political decisions and elections; and therein gauge their positions on what's \"popular\" & \"likeable.\" Being \"popular\" doesn't mean amongst all people, but amongst those in their industry and those who might contribute to their industry. \n\nThese factors lead to a feedback loop, ultimately spiralling out until they become deaf to opposing views and literally cannot discern whether what they said is \"correct,\" but is instead perhaps only pure opinion, or what is \"right.\"\n\n\n\nThey can say what they want, yes.

        "selftext": "There is nothing okay about photographing people in public without consent, the same should apply for celebrities.\n\n\nImagine, you have something that puts you in the public eye a lot, whether it\u2019s your job or something to do with being part of a famous family. And one day you\u2019re going for a walk in the park when suddenly someone starts following you and taking pictures of you before you can even make direct eye contact with them, just snapping photos of you like you\u2019re some kind of landmark. What will they do with those photos? Who knows? Not like it\u2019s any of your business, right?\n\n\nLet\u2019s put it in a different perspective. What if you aren\u2019t a celebrity, you\u2019re just some average joe on your way home. Would it be ok for someone to yell \u201chey! Smile! Ooh turn your head this way for me!\u201d Whilst they start following and photographing you? Of course not, that\u2019s pretty much the definition of an invasion of privacy. So why is it ok to do it to a celebrity? And how well known do you have to be for them to get away with it?\n\n\nI genuinely hate the \u201coh well it\u2019s just one of the side effects to being famous\u201d answer. No job or occupation should make it okay for people to snap photos of you whilst in public and doing stuff outside work.\n\n\nEven at movie premieres, the places paparazzis are actually expected to be at, they take it too far by practically chasing them around whilst they try to leave the theatres.\n\nAlso half the time it\u2019s done without the person even knowing that they\u2019re being photographed, such as those annoying articles nobody even cares about where they talk about what they saw Demi Lovato have at Starbucks the other day. Nobody should have permission to make someone\u2019s personal life public to everyone when they\u2019re just doing the same thing as everyone else. If I started following the guy who owns my local KFC and started posting pictures of them and writing articles about what they do in their free time on Facebook then I\u2019d probably get called a stalker and get sued for harassment. But it\u2019s fine if said person happens to be famous?\n\nHell, Princess Diana was indirectly killed by paparazzis because she got in a car crash whilst trying to get away from the swarm of people chasing her! Someone literally died because they were so focused on escaping a group of paid stalkers that their car ended up crashing.\n\nPaparazzis are the literal scum of the earth, the bottom of the food chain. Only able to survive by latching onto people with more money so that they can document the stuff that should be private.

For example: when a celebrity is pregnant they say something like \u201c[insert name here] shows off growing baby bump during walk in [insert location]!\u201d As if they\u2019re getting up on a stage and telling everyone when actually they were just walking around whilst pregnant. A pregnant woman isn\u2019t \u201cshowing off\u201d her belly just because you can see it, she\u2019s just walking around and *surprise surprise!* it\u2019s not really easy to hide your belly when it\u2019s growing a mini person inside it.\n\n\nThe whole thing about paparazzis and reporters just make my blood boil, whether it\u2019s their annoying personality or their complete lack of respect for someone\u2019s privacy.",

Think about it, every public Vlog on YouTube counts as filming people in public, including those who may or may not know they are being filmed.

He was the deputy head of security at the H\u00f4tel Ritz and had earlier goaded paparazzi waiting for Diana and Fayed outside the hotel.[3] Anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his blood may have worsened Paul's inebriation.[4] No evidence was found that paparazzi were near the car when it crashed.[5] In 2008, the jury at a British inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving by Paul and following vehicles. It was also found that none of the occupants of the car were wearing a seat belt.[6]\n\n...\n\n> Henri Paul, the deputy head of security at the Ritz, had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 Mercedes-Benz W140 in order to elude the paparazzi;[11] a decoy vehicle left the Ritz first from the main entrance on Place Vend\u00f4me, attracting a throng of photographers. Diana and Fayed then departed from the hotel's rear entrance,[12] Rue Cambon at around 00:20 on 31 August CEST (22:20 on 30 August UTC), heading for the apartment in Rue Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye. They did this to avoid the nearly 30 photographers waiting in front of the hotel.[12] They were the rear passengers; Trevor Rees-Jones, a member of the Fayed family's personal protection team, was in the (right) front passenger seat.[13] The occupants were not wearing seat belts.[a]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales#Circumstances",

            ">There is nothing okay about photographing people in public without consent, the same should apply for celebrities.\n\nSure there is. If I take a picture of Times Square, do I need affirmative consent from each individual in the frame? Public spaces are, ya know, *public*?  The distinction is important. It is what makes it legal to film police officers in the commission of their duty. Filming in public without consent allows you to protect yourself with video evidence. If someone was about to assault me and I started videoing to establish their criminality, would I have to stop filming them kicking my ass when they revoke consent? There is more at stake in this conversation than the privacy of celebrities.",

            "So this is a pretty interesting gray area. Private citizens do have this right, which is why when filming or photographing private adults or children permission/consent is required. \nCelebrities or those who actively seek \u201cfame\u201d fall under different requirements. The idea is that once a person seeks fame and exposure (the way an actor or singer might) that they are creating a public persona which can be photographed under certain circumstances when that \u201cpersona\u201d is in a public place. Paparazzi are still subject to trespassing etc. meaning they can\u2019t (or aren\u2019t supposed to) for example sneak onto private property and take photos of that celebrity in a private home. The idea being that in a private setting the famous persona doesn\u2019t come into play, because the celebrity is at home. \nI\u2019m no expert though, I learned this from an arts management professor in college while minoring. \nThere\u2019s probably more nuances. \nBut yea paparazzi do crappy things sometimes.",

Usually it\u2019s in stores, at the Magic Kingdom (Merida), and in places with a lot of asian people (usually East Asians from the country that are visiting America) like inside Epcot Japan and China, because so many foreigners want to see their own country at Epcot which is so understandable, and inside mom and pop restaurants that usually only have people from their communities visit (but they\u2019ve always been nice to me, except for in Italy.)

If someone is making a youtube video, for example, in a public place do they have to get consent from every single person that happens to walk through the background? If I'm in a public place doing something really terrible (ie. robbing somebody) and someone happens to film it, do I have a right to take that video down and sue? Security cameras record everything. Are those not allowed now?\n\nDon't get me wrong. All I'm saying is that filming in public places isn't the problem. The problem is stalking. Of course that's illegal and maybe I could see an argument in going after more paparazzi for it ESPECIALLY when people are being followed home and filmed through windows. Maybe the biggest problem is that for some unknown reason there is a market for this behavior which incentivizes it. Why are people so obsessed with what famous people are doing 24/7? I've never understood this. This is something that will never really be solved but maybe next time you hear about a leaked sex tape or a magazine full of celeb gossip maybe just don't pay it any attention. It won't entirely fix the problem but that's all we really can do.",

Paparazzi have the additional protection of being part of a free press.\n\nThe last thing we want is a law that says it's harassment if the press photographs a public person in a public space because they don't want it.\n\nCan you imagine how politicians would use this?\n\nNow, there is likely some laws that can be passed to figure out when something becomes harassment, but it's not clear cut that it would survive legal review.

            "From the Plight of Gen X, we understand both sides. The big complaint from older generations is that there was a lack of interest in the younger generation taking up the mantles of leadership. So the average age of a lot of groups I participated in was 60. There were plenty of mentors out there, but telling a younger kid to mentor them to lead the chess club, become an officer of the community madrigal singers, or organize the folk heritage dance club wasn\u2019t going to happen. These groups and organizations didn\u2019t know they were going to be victims of the \u201cyeah, Boomer\u201d era. \n\nThe internet changed everything. Digital groups and social media became the new way of organizing and doing things. Many groups of organized people just died out (literally) and eventually became niche until they disbanded.\n\nSo this community of fostering by the older generation has been lost because they didn\u2019t understand the technology or communication practices of the digital age. (My mom still can\u2019t use a computer.)  and the younger generation lost connection with their grandparents because of the internet. There was an entire world out there to explore, overcoming geographic boundaries, and language barriers, and information was there to be had. The older generation got lost in the dust. \n\nYeah, we know how the old bureaucracy works. It\u2019s the pre-internet world. We had to get all the information without web browsers. Now, we\u2019ve come to rely on the internet. If it isn\u2019t online, it just seems awful. \n\nI have younger friends complain to me, and I\u2019ll ask, \u201cdid you call them?\u201d No. \u201cI get anxiety when I call?\u201d  Younger generations prefer emails and text chats. Or so it seems. I read somewhere Gen Z is starting to move back towards human interaction. Millennials are the ones that will suffer the worst brunt of this. \n\nI feel bad for your frustration. But it\u2019s also a lack of empathy and understanding too. It\u2019s your naivety that shows. The older folks grew up in a world without internet, and a wait staff server worked that job to support a family. We do expect them to be on time, and if they are going to be late, to call ahead.  (The old union saying is \u201cif you\u2019re early, you\u2019re on time. If you are on time, you\u2019re late. If you\u2019re late, you\u2019re fired.\u201d It took me a while to realize that work starting at 9am means something different to me. I\u2019m supposed to arrive early, get everything ready to go, and then when it\u2019s 9am I immediately start work. I see other people arrive at 9:05, make coffee, chat with coworkers, eat breakfast, and by the time it\u2019s 10am they actually start working. There\u2019s definitely a paradigm culture shift that has occurred somewhere between boomer and Gen Z. \n\nAll I can say is that you should ask for help of the older generation with as much in person engagement as possible. They do want to help you. But it\u2019s easier to do it pre-internet methods. Phone calls, in person visits, and pleasantry. Then you can educate them on what life is really like in this day and age, once you finally have them engaged. \n\nI get it. My dad didn\u2019t understand the wealth gap until I explained to him I got offered the same job I worked 20 years ago, at the same salary I had 20 years ago. He sorta got it when I explained that sure, the skill set may be the same, but if you add inflation to that salary for each year, it should be paying more. Instead, they wanted my highly qualified skill set for a price that was 20 years ago. \n\nGood luck.

I've also met 16 year olds that are fully aware of how brutal the world can be and know exactly how to handle it.\n\nI will agree to what I think is your point: that we should either prepare people approaching 18 better for the world, or make it easier for them to learn. That part I will completely concede, and agree with.",

You may not understand the intricacies of it, or the long term effect or how far reaching the repercussions are BUT that's not important - since you do good things because they're good and avoid doing bad because it is.  For the most part, society have done the thinking for every new born person. So you don't need to know all of that.  You grow up with a society with norms and laws. You all need to do is do what you already know is good.  And that don't need more than 7 years to know. Age is just an excuse.  \n \nSo yeah 18 is just magical number we come up with. Even at 50, some are still acting stupidly as kids. And even at 10, some kids takes advantage of their younger siblings and other younger kids. \n \nBarely an adult is made up concept.

If you\u2019re not a woman it may not have occurred to you, but almost every young woman I know who dates men (I am also 25) has had these power dynamics played out in their romantic and sexual relationships with men. I don\u2019t wanna get all weirdly specific critical gender studies about it but if you date men that are older than you it is almost inevitable. Truly they don\u2019t even have to be older or significantly older for it to happen but since your frame of reference for these dynamics is age we can go with that since it\u2019s most common with older men dating young women. When you\u2019re younger it\u2019s really, really difficult to discern but a lot of women, fuck myself included, come to the realization/how to spot it happening/how to get out of relationships like that and it could still happen again in a different way. There are people vocally against age gaps in relationships before a certain age/past a certain number of years. I am not one of them, I will continue to date and be with older men because I worked out my own personal ish and I prefer it, but post relationship clarity does expose some \u201chuh\u201d moments. Once you analyze and clear out what\u2019s actually harmful and what isn\u2019t you can somewhat avoid some of the major ones but there\u2019s always a little something with a significant age gap. Men my age almost never date/marry women who are the same age as men I date, it\u2019s less common and less systematic, but it happens and they may not want to look like less of \u201cmen\u201d so they don\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019m not discounting that experience at all but it\u2019s *so* common with women and many of them are left more effected from these relationships and the fallout than they are from lost of the things you listed.",

            ">>Your goal should be to help and guide young adults.\n\nWhy the fuck would I want to do that? I don't owe young people shit, they're just competition.",
            "For generations, we typically started having children around this age. I'm sure many people around this age with children do not feel like kids because they were essentially forced to grow up. Most older adults have no idea what they're doing either; they've just been forced to figure things out enough that they no longer have feelings about it.  Both groups are trying to figure things out; the younger ones are just more nervous about it.",

The manager who excused the 15yr old's terrible behavior of stealing food isn't helping that person grow, he/she is hindering it.",

Some people are far ahead of you in development, others are far behind, and some stay that way for most of their lives.\n\nBut we don't really have a definitive way to determine if someone is mature that wouldn't cost time, money and be incredibly invasive and demeaning, so we just say \"hey, you're 18, you can fuck or kill for the government now\" and toss you a beer on your 21st like you're guaranteed to be ready for it.\n\nI've met 51-year-olds who behave like 13-year-olds. Maturity is not how many times your planet has revolved around the sun. It's an independent number that can't be easily grasped for everyone.\n\nBut who really gives a shit? We're all fucked up by something. Stop panicking over every little thing. Avoid the heinous shit and hope for the best. This planet's on a one-way collision course with extinction anyway and that's alright with me.",

            "I agree with this 100%. However, I'm not sure from what perspective you are saying this and there is one point I take issue with regarding video games. When in a relationship with someone that plays video games it is much more diffiicult to interact with them or feel like you have someone around to cohabitate with than it is with movies or a phone. \n\nIt seems like, from the experiences I've had it has to be all or nothing. My asking them to disengage from the game for periods of time to be present so I actually feel like they want to be with me is taken as my saying they can never play. Even with COVID meaning my current situation is living with somone unemployed who has all day every day to play I'm still the bad guy for asking for some time away from this.\n\nI get guilted about this being how they de-stress and how it's a stressful time. Well, sure. But I work and am gone most of the day and I have other activities and friends that keep me occupied for most of my time. I'm only asking for a portion of the day most days. Their ignoring me almost completely for the games is a source of stress for me, and having an active partner that obviously enjoys my company would be a way to de-stress for me, but I'm not given that opportunity.\n\nI get guilted about how I usually have on the TV and have my phone. Well, sure. But those are just inherently things that are less immersive so we're still able to organically interact. With games there is a 0% chance of organic banter, and I'm actually often a source of frustration for interrupting the never ending games.\n\nWith games it is an all encompassing activity that one sits in a gaming chair alone doing. \n\nI was of the mind prior to my personal experience with a \"gamer\" that it was unfair to paint their hobby as worse than others within the frame of a relationsionship. Now that I've had some experience however, I feel it is very much a different type of animal. If the person sets limits on themselves and realizes their gaming is in the way of interacting with their partner, its fine. It is not something that is easily done though... \n\nI'm sorry if this is out of line and not at all what you were referring to, but it is definitely the difference I've noted, and one I feel is important, if you want to be in a relationship.",

Creating is when you write a book, draw something, take pictures of a landscape, play your guitar...

Sadly, a lot of people waste all their time consuming.\n\nWhy is this bad? Well, you can't make profit out of consuming but you can generate benefit from creating.\n\nBut, would spending all the day creating be bad for you? Well, yeah. You would end up draining your brain and losing interest in these activities, which isn't really good.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that you could invest all your time doing exercise, planning your diet, sleeping well but, if you don't give yourself a moment to rest from this, would you really be happy?",

The universe is set to destroy itself & recreate itself all over again anyway. It\u2019ll be here a hell of a lot longer than our species, but ultimately just like us, it\u2019ll die off as well.

            "Yeah that\u2019s some bullshit. I hate shit like that because at the end of the day, that celebrity is no alien...they\u2019re a real human being just like me N you so if you take away popularity and fame, you are now are left with your girl/man drooling over another man/womans image right in your face. If I were you I\u2019d become huge Billie Eilish fan right about now and make her your wallpaper.

            "My ex would always do this. I started feeling like she really didn\u2019t care about my feelings. I never did that in front of her, I never even mentioned that I do find anyone else attractive out of respect for her because she was cheated on prior to dating me. It just sucks hearing someone you love so much just talk about other people as if you mean nothing to them. I never brought it up to her however and she only started to do something about it after my friends got involved because they noticed I was upset with it. She did it constantly, almost every time we were together. I know I should have spoken up, but I just didn\u2019t want to make her feel bad. This was my first relationship btw, so I really didn\u2019t know what to do.",

            "I agree, I\u2019ve never been in a relationship before, but the way most people gush over celebrities seems way more affectionate than the way they gush over their SO sometimes. \n\nIf their SO seems hurt or insecure about it, they\u2019ll just defend themselves by saying \u201cdon\u2019t need to be so insecure, it\u2019s just a celebrity crush I wouldn\u2019t be mad if you have one too\u201d. The only thing that separates being outwardly affectionate about a celebrity and that good-looking Taco Bell worker down the street is that the celebrity is famous and \u201cout of your reach\u201d. It\u2019s like if you\u2019re this affectionate for a celebrity that you don\u2019t even know on a personal level, what would happen if they showed up at your house and started flirting with you? \n\nIn that scenario the excuse of the celebrity \u201cbeing out of your reach\u201d just goes out the window and the only thing justifying you being this affectionate for them as opposed to the Taco Bell worker is that their famous (which doesn\u2019t seem like a good justification imo). If you engage with their flirting it means you questioning their celebrity crush was justified, but if they don\u2019t engage in the flirting it just seems like they\u2019re hiding their true feelings cuz you were just talking abut how hot, sexy, and charismatic they were in the movie we watched, but those feelings just magically disappear in person?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind if it was a quick and simple \u201coh they look pretty\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re SO is one lucky person\u201d, but spending a minute to talk about all the things you love about them and how they make you feel a certain why just by looking at them seems weird.",

And he always gets royally rewarded.\n\nBut yeah, I'd usually agree with you. He just knew about my Loki obsession before we got together, so I couldn't hide it from him.",
            "Yeah, thinking a celebrity is attractive is fine, cute little faux-crushes are fine, but some people who are in relationships go a little overboard with it.  At some point it does start to get disrespectful. Any time I've ever been in a relationship and the woman has done this I've turned it around on her. A little immature, maybe, but sometimes people need a dose of their own medicine. I'm in my forties and date women around my own age--making my \"celebrity crush\" that I gush over someone younger than her really seems to drive women crazy.",

Years ago in Sydney I was out on a double date, me and my brother and two girls.\n\nThings were going ok-ish until we went to maccas in Kings Cross...and met two Australian olympians, fresh back from the Olympics. I think they were weightlifters. They were very stongly built. They still had those \"contestant\" neck ribbon things on, we talked to them and discovered they were legit. I think they also had on the top part of their Olympic uniform. This was back around 2000.\n\nAnyway both girls absolutely gushed over these guys..who were friendly and polite. To us as well. We said hello and then hung back while the girls almost melted over them They managed to stretch it out for 5 minutes or so until the guys said they had to go. \n\nWe had our food and took them home and never asked them out again. I get it, compared to them we are nobodies. And you thought maybe you had a chance (they were both nice looking girls.)

Even saying shit like \u201cOh yeah they\u2019re really hot\u201d is extremely disrespectful in mine and her opinion. I\u2019ve seen people who, like you, say they\u2019re ok with celebrity crushes but then I\u2019ve watched my friend\u2019s face every time his girlfriend practically moans a certain celebrity\u2019s name and I can feel his pain. I know he isn\u2019t actually ok with it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be that guy but, in my experience if a girl has a trait that really hurts your feelings she probably won\u2019t change, because if she even does change it\u2019ll only be to keep you happy, her real thoughts will reside and probably come out at a later date. It\u2019s up to you what you do with that information.",

I wish you the best!",

However, now I am much more secure, it no longer really bothers me so.",
            "Dunno about rude but it's awkward, and weird. I wouldn't be in a serious relationship with someone if I felt they'd dump me for someone \"better\" given the chance - celebrity or not.

            "My first husband was an ass and he had a major crush on Mila Kunis. I don't blame him she is very attractive and a great actress. My issue came from him constantly gushing about how hot she was even when we weren't on that topic and setting her as his background on his phone and changing the photo constantly to a newer better photo of her. Most of the photos she was wearing little to no clothing. When I would ask him why he did this he never really had an answer would just kind shrug and change the subject. I understand having celebrity crushes but but his was a bit of an obsession.",

He saw some Alita manga and said \"if Alita were real, I'd leave you in an instant\". I know it was a joke but it really took the wind out of the sails.

I like Harry Styles and I talk to my fianc\u00e9 about him (not a lot, but about his music or new videos, etc). He likes a metal singer (yes, female metal singer; yes they exist) and talks about her a lot and sends me her pictures on Instagram.

You would just remain with staring and all. But crushes are ridiculous. Sorry, but I doubt that a person can be in love with multiple people at the same time.

I never understood how that label has never been passed on intense sports fans when they do practically the same things. The only difference I can see is that some (only some) sports fans actually engage with the sport physically but a lot of them don\u2019t. Engaging in sports is a far more virtual experience than a lot of people would care to admit.\n\nEDIT: Posted this because I had argument about it with a coworker, idrc if it\u2019s popular or not honestly.

Fantasy football started as a relatively innocent hobby for sports-fans, a bit of an extra edge to regular fandom, but it has since evolved into a monumental endeavour where you need to be as knowledgeable and updated as a professional pundit.\n\nWhich indeed makes it as geeky as knowing by heart ever D&D class'es special traits, rolls etc.\n\nAnd, let's be honest, everyone agrees that hardcore sports fans are huge nerds too. A dedicated fan will surely remember his team's scores and players, but few do bother with every detail or stat (like, you may guess who your team's best player was in 2015, while only a madman will rattle off detailed stats for said player or for the entire squad).\n\nSomething that absolutely nobody will compliment as impressive, if not with a slight judgemental and perplexed \"really?!\" vibe.",

It's takes small steps exposing them to new opportunities, for example, I'm about to go and see a young (20 y/o) guy who spends most of his time in his room gaming usually only to leave the house for a weekly game of D&D. Today we are going to work out how to make a dice tray out of recycled materials. We'll need to go to the recycle center and paint store, come up with some creative solutions, do some research online, and figure it all out using basic tools. It's fun, he loves it, and he loves sharing the things that he makes with his D&D crew. We've already made a dice box, game mats, and a phone holder, and started learning CAD.

            "Our society has abandoned a generation of young men. They have genuine problems unique to them and society refuses to acknowledge those problems. For example, fatherlessness is one of, if not the top predictor of future crime, mass shootings, etc. in young men. We also live in a culture that routinely denigrates them for political reasons. Young minds are susceptible to this type of extreme toxic demonization across all social media.\n\nEconomic problems also play a huge role. There are very few clear paths toward career success in life anymore. Even building a family is difficult and expensive. Most psychological benefits these things use to give people can be had with video games. And when wages haven't increased meaningfully in 40 years, half of America lives paycheck to paycheck, and 40% of people cannot afford an unexpected $400 expense, everything becomes difficult at that point.\n\nMany young men helplessly develop in problematic ways. And once they become incels, neckbeards, \"nice guys\", or whatever else, it is socially acceptable for everyone to denigrate them further which only reinforces the damage that has been done. The only things that can fix this are genuine compassion and honest meaningful communication, things which most people lack. We are at a point where a generation of men has been lost for no good reason and we are yet to even acknowledge this as a society.",

Friend A has to go, so me and B boot up CoD. He heads out, so I put some time in Scarlet Nexus. Friend C pops in chat and we talk about the game (he\u2019s playing Scarlet Nexus too). Friend D jumps in and him and C go play Tarkov. Later in the evening, everyone is on and we load up our Minecraft realm.\n\nThe games change monthly, some times it\u2019s IRL for board games, sometimes we\u2019re all in chat watching Friend D playing Disgaea 6 and all talking about what item to level up or how to clear the grid here, doesn\u2019t matter really.

My job requires a higher score in math and science from the asvab so it's normal to have extremely intelligent albeit socially inept students (often times gamers). One kid was exceptionally bad, scary bad, because it consumed his life. He was late to everything, always dead tired, and I found out recently, disappearing for 45 minutes at a time during class to run back to his room to game for a bit. There was nothing that motivated him to change. No amount of heart to heart counseling, yelling, deduction in pay, extra work, longer days to influence him to sleep in his limited free time broke this kid of his gaming addiction.

It was a community I found online where people didn't realise I was an awkward unpopular teenager and didn't treat me as such that helped me develop social confidence that bled into IRL.\n\nThe real bad addictions come about because they find little connection offered to them in real life. It can become a cycle with the two things feeding into each other if they're not careful, but you can't always say they're socially poor because they got addicted to games. Just as likely that the reason they turned to the screen to find meaningful connection is because they didn't find it elsewhere.",

Every time I try to make new friends i end up stereotyped like the fat freak guy and end up alone at home fkin crying  , I can't go to exercise at the gym because I have panic attacks whenever I feel watched by someone ,and although I keep studying hoping I find something else I want to dedicate my life to.\n\nI can't find anything I like at all and always return to think about the dream I had as a kid but then notice I'm poor and it will be nearly impossible for me to fulfill (I wanted to be a pilot , but here licenses are around 200k$ , yes , laugh all you want) , so I return to getting depressed as hell  , it's like a vicious circle. \n\nI've tried therapy countless of times , but I cannot pay myself a private psychologist , and the  ones paid by my medical insurance  had been useless.\n\nThis made me to just give up trying to make friends and life in general , I'm slowly hating everyone and everything a little bit more , I think I'm becoming a misanthrope ,and  you know , i know it is pretty selfish  but I would kill for having a true friend. \n\nSometimes I feel that living just isn't made for me I swear , I've been fucking suffering since I was a kid and no one gave a fuck. \n\nSo yes , usually when someone is not \"following the social norm\" is because is fucking suffering inside.\n\nHave a nice day :3",

            "I used to work for a state lottery. \n\nIt is a non-anonymous state. As some commenters have stated, the integrity of the game is the basis of a lottery\u2019s rationale to name winners. If the players don\u2019t know who wins, there will be widespread misconception that the games are rigged. Some states allow tickets to be claimed by LLCs, trusts, or other legal third-parties. The lottery I worked at doesn\u2019t abide by that approach, using verbiage in the senate bill that founded the lottery to justify that tickets must be claimed by a person, not an entity. \n\nIn reality, lotteries don\u2019t have much concrete footing when it comes to winner anonymity. They want to maintain integrity, but they want the publicity too because it gives players hope that a big prize is possible and further drives sales. \n\nIn my experience, there are two ways winners could remain anonymous:\n\n1) Claim you have a security concern that will put your life in danger should the information be made public. It\u2019s not an option the lottery I worked at made known, but we would forgo publishing the information if a winner expressed concern for their safety (I.e. domestic abuse, elderly living on their own, even living in a bad part of  town, etc.). This was really only an option for mid-tier prizes (typically less than $1 million). This did not apply to a major jackpot like a Powerball or Mega Millions.\n\n2) Play the waiting game, take the lottery to court, and put them on blast in the media. That\u2019s what a woman in New Hampshire did when she won a $559 MILLION jackpot (Sources: [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/13/593141325/call-her-jane-dough-new-hampshire-lottery-winner-can-stay-anonymous-court-says), [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/us/lottery-winner-privacy.amp.html), [NH Lottery](https://www.nhlottery.com/News/2018/New-Hampshire-Lottery-Will-Not-Appeal-Powerball-Ru)). The winner had signed her ticket not knowing her information would be made public and the NH Lottery would only issue a check to the ticket signer. Admittedly, NH Lottery tickets can be claimed by legal third parties, which was a main basis of her legal argument. However, seeing as many states don\u2019t have laws mandating that lottery winners must be made public, they\u2019re standing on unstable ground that could crumble under public and legal scrutiny.",

I hold his gaze, then he slowly withdraws. A minute goes by\u2026\n\n\u2026and he starts right up again. So I wait a minute, then time it and give the seat another good shove.

No, right.\" She's been glued to our family ever since. \n\n\nIt's summer time, and she's at our house every other day now lol. She doesn't cry anymore. She screams less or freaks out less because screamig doesn't mean she gets her way.

The old buildings have those metal buzzers that always seem to work correctly. You push the button for the apartment, and the resident hears a buzzing noise, then they let you in. Simple and easy. The new buildings all use giant touchscreen tablets, where you have to navigate through and find the resident. \n\nFor example, there's two new big apartment complexes in my town. One has the touch screen tablet inside the main entrance, and you need to navigate through the menu to buzz in. It's so much less responsive and more tedious than pushing a button. The other building didn't even bother with that. They just stuck the tablets outside, where they're exposed to the weather. I went there the other week and had to call the resident because the outside tablet was totally broken with a cracked screen.

Often times the class to go in that student\u2019s schedule is foreign language or a class in the arts. \n\nIt sucks because funding is tied to testing but testing doesn\u2019t always tell the whole story. SO MANY kids suffer unjustly because of the emphasis on testing. They miss out on classes that they enjoy and they lose the opportunity to expand their passions. All because they haven\u2019t scored in the \u201cadvanced\u201d category.\n\nEducational funding is all about percentages. If a district has 100% of kids passing a state test, they can no longer gain positive points in that rating category. Having 100% of kids do well on the test is AMAZING but there is no room for growth so if they score 100% the next year, there are no improvement points and schools often lose points.\n\nIf you want more info on this, read up on \u201cyearly adequate progress\u201d.

            "I would like to agree with you but from my experience with language learning in school it is very ineffective. There's a lot of factors required to make the experience enjoyable and retainable. My teacher was an absolute asswipe and was extremely rude to the entire class, and  hence, no one liked going to her class. Also the language has to be interesting and enjoyable to learn, as well as actually useful in the world. My school's choice was Indonesian. It was not interesting to learn, the grammar was too difficult to be worth learning and is not really useful on a global sense. Only one country speaks Indonesian. \n\nI think that is should be either compulsory or at least very much encouraged. There should be a range of languages available depending on where you live. But in all honesty the best few languages to learn would be English, Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin. They are widely applicable globally as nearly anyone you could run into in the world would speak at least one of them or at least an offshoot of one. English will get you through most of the western world such as north America, western Europe and Oceania. Spanish through most of South America, and the Mediterranean. Russian for anywhere in eastern Europe. And Mandarin for just china but seeing as there are a large number of businesses in that region of Asia, being able to speak Mandarin would be a huge step for growth there.\n\nThere's my rant on language learning, sorry for spelling.",

They never taught us basic sentence structure or Spanish grammar, but to be fair no one  taught us far into our own languages grammar so we wouldn\u2019t be able to understand. It was just the names of fruits or places. Our 6th grade Spanish teacher taught us more, and he really tried. Apparently only I appreciated that. Because my entitled classmates got mad that the teacher was trying to make us write actual sentences in spanish instead of just learning individual words. Man, that got me FUMING. Everyone hated him because of that, I said something about it and I was the quiet kid so everyone just sat there and listened silently but I knew my point didn\u2019t go across.

Children's brains are easily malleable. In some cases, there are just things you can only teach a child; an example would be perfect pitch (which goes hand in hand why tonal languages are best learned at a young age).  \n\n\nTo be fair, it only works because the 3 languages all have their specific uses; we actually need to use these languages in an everyday setting. I am assuming you are American, and thus have the innate ability to speak English. If that is the case, then knowing English means you can already get by without speaking any other language. Except maybe Spanish, you wouldn't have the need for a second language. That lack of immersion means eventually after school you will forget the second language altogether.",

I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and\u00a0I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.\n\n\nMy wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.\n\n\nShe loved being pregnant.\u00a0Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.\n\n\nThe hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.\n\n\nEvery guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?\n\n\nEdit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. As I stated above, I am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.\n\nEdit 2: No, it's not a sexual thing. Also, to clarify, I am happy as a straight male and I do not want to transition to become a woman.",

Having separate tournaments and titles for women makes it seem like men and women have different baselines when it comes to chess.

There are tournaments and titles for everyone and there are tournaments and titles that are for women only.",

            "There is women only chess, but not men only so part of the opinion is sort of uninformed. As for the titles I completely agree, they make no sense whatsoever.",
            "Sort of agree.  But to clarify one point that may not be widely known, chess does *not* have separate male tournaments and titles.  Tournaments are either open or restricted to women only.\n\nThere is a huge gender disparity in chess.  It has traditionally been a very male dominated game.  Kasparov once said \"there is real chess and women's chess\".  He has since renounced those comments but it highlights what much of the chess world thought in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThis attitude caused many women to not want to play competitively.  Female only tournaments are one way to encourage female players into the game to address the balance.  And - it *is* working.  More female players are playing today than ever before.  In 2001 around 6% of internationally ranked players were female.  In 2020 this is now around 15%.\n\nUltimately I do agree that in games like chess we should not be separated by sex.  But while it seems a bit unfair there are valid reasons behind such things.",
            "The extra women titles are a way to get more women into chess, a historically male game, something I definitely can get behind. It doesn't devalue the universal titles, it doesn't devalue the achievement of other players. **Any gender can still compete in the normal tournaments.**\n\nIt does not have any negative consequences to other people, it simply adds some extra attention for women in chess. I agree that in an ideal world, all those extra titles shouldn't exist, shouldn't be necessary. But today, there are still less women interested in chess than men, and that's a bit of a shame. So I don't see any problems in trying to get more women interested in a game I personally enjoy.",
            "Apparently you and a lot of other people on reddit don't understand the purpose of female player tournaments.\n\nThey exist to promote chess and make it appealing to female players to keep on competing and thereby promoting chess to young girls. Its about making money, and keeping chess alive. If young players would see female players be dominated and finishing badly, they would have less interest in taking it up.",
            "Lol, I used to think this- but had this perspective laid on me; \n\nIn a esport game I follow, DoTA2, there\u2019s been all female tournaments before. Why? \nIt\u2019s to give women a space to compete in an otherwise male dominated arena. \nDo they separate out the women from regular tournaments? No of course not, if they\u2019re skilled enough for a pro dota team, why shouldn\u2019t they compete? \n\nBut for someone getting into it, it can be extremely hard as a women to break out into an industry that\u2019s male dominated. \n\nIt\u2019s just about creating opportunities. Diversity is healthy for any competitive scene.",

She sits at top 84 if you plug her into the top 100 men chess player. Plus women are allowed in every event, tournament and league men play in because they're mixed competition. This is really a woke shit take on the subject; if there were no women titles and tournaments, at the elite level women will get objectively destroyed. \n\n**A difference of 200 ELO in chess is noteworthy, let alone in the elite competition**",

            "It\u2019s actually really important to keep the women\u2019s only games and titles because it\u2019s one of the few sports and competitions that women in some very female repressive countries can actually compete and play. If I remember right the only sport that Saudi Arabia lets women compete in in the olympics is chess (or it used to be) and one of the reasons these titles still exist is because otherwise a lot of women wouldn\u2019t be able to play or compete on an international level at all. \n\nThere were some girls I knew growing up with very religious parents who were only allowed to compete in women\u2019s chess because there were no boys (yay batshit homeschoolers) and if there were mixed games, they weren\u2019t allowed to go. So it\u2019s not just Saudi as these people were hardcore evangelicals.\n\nIt would be better if we just had a world where talented women were acknowledged as people but... we\u2019re not there yet.",

You get sick of the sexist comments, the belittling, being told men are simply smarter than you and you have no chance...which is somehow what I'm reading in this very thread?!\n\nIn male dominated fields - as long as this \"toxicity\" exists women's only categories will need to exist. \n\nThe women who want to play to enjoy the game have an option to escape the guys who make fun of them, and those that want to play at professional competitive levels also have an option for them.\n\nHaving the option is extremely important. I would have quit chess instantly due to the shitty male community if it wasn't for women's only category. Lots of the guys were really lovely to us, but the majority were not. I eventually played mixed but only because I made it long enough that the bullying didn't affect me enough to quit. \n\nIt encourages women to play and without it you'd have even less female players than you do now.",

            "Counter-argument: There *should* be women only chess tournaments for the foreseeable future. \n\nLet me explain why.\n\nThings are slowly changing as we speak, but until extremely recently women were simply not breaking into the top 5 of chess tournaments, and rarely into the top 10.\n\nOut of roughly 1600 chess Grandmasters, only about 35 are women.\n\nSo until now the only real way to get women some recognition and prize money in chess has been to hold female-specific tournaments.\n\nBut female only tournaments are a good thing for exactly this reason: women can have their time in the spotlight which then can influence more young women to take the activity seriously.\n\nThe more women who take it seriously the more female chess Grandmasters we will eventually see.\n\nSo until we see more female Grandmasters, women-only tournaments should remain a thing.",

            "being wrong and having an unpopular opinion are not the same thing. did you even research this for 30 seconds before you posted it? or are you just that horny for karma?\n\n\n\u201cThe Women\u2019s World Chess Championship match is the culmination of a two-year cycle of events. Those events financially help the current top women players to concentrate on chess exclusively, as there is prize money for each event in the cycle. If the cycle were abolished, then it would be much harder for those women players to make money from playing in chess tournaments. Women would also become relatively invisible in media stories about chess.\n\nA four-time Women\u2019s World Chess Champion, Hou Yifan, is ranked at #75 among men and women combined. Though she is the highest-rated woman on the list of active chess players, as #75 she likely would not qualify for the Candidates Tournament in the World Chess Championship cycle and the prize money and media attention associated with it.\u201d\n\nyour sole argument that men and women don\u2019t have separate baselines when it comes to chess is not one that supports your own overall point of getting rid of women\u2019s tournaments. it\u2019s a scientific observation that has absolutely nothing to do with why women\u2019s tournaments exist. \n\nyou\u2019re just wrong, dude.",

            "Chess player here. I\u2019m not an expert on the neurological differences between men and women here, but there has always been a significant difference between the top male players and the top female players, to the tune of about 200 rating points. I\u2019d suspect it has something to do with sex-linked traits, as men are generally more likely to be born with neurological differences? It\u2019s definitely peculiar, because it\u2019s not testosterone this time. Perhaps men are also overrepresented in chess. There\u2019d certainly be plenty of anecdotal evidence to back that hypothesis up. Either way, seems to me it\u2019s a statistical consequence of the nature of high-level chess.\n\nI don\u2019t really have any idea of what to do here, and I suppose there really isn\u2019t much of a problem? Tournaments aren\u2019t actually segregated at the top level, there are just women-only tournaments, and then open ones.",
            "This is so wrong, although I\u2019m glad to see actual unpopular opinions here for a change. \n\nThe issue here is that you presume there are a separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments. This is not true at all. \n\nYou are correct that it is not like physical sports where sexual dimorphism can create an advantage for one gender over the other. However the people who administrate chess tournaments are not stupid and they realize this as well. Which is why there is no such thing as a men\u2019s chess tournament. Women are equally able to compete in any chess tournament as men. \n\nThe only difference is that there are specific, parallel chess tournaments that are set aside specifically for women, and specifically for the reason that women are under represented in the chess world. They do not supplant the usual chess tournaments. They are simply added on in order to encourage more women to play professional chess, and they have worked. \n\nThe title of Grandmaster, along with the lesser FIDE titles of International Master (IM) and FIDE Master (FM), is open to all players regardless of gender. They have a separate title Woman Grandmaster which is only open to female players; however this in no way affects the standing of the GM title and most of the top female players have held both titles. \n\nHaving separate tournaments and titles just for women does not in anyway diminish the world championship. Nobody is saying that women winning the WGM title is the same as winning the GM title. And that\u2019s important, because when women achieve GM standing they are given the respect that they are due. The women\u2019s tournaments are completely separate and they only exist to highlight an underrepresented group.\n\nI think they should do more of it to be honest. There has only been one African-American GM (Maurice Ashley) and African-Americans are heavily under represented in the chess world. I think having African-American chess tournaments would help to motivate more young black people to take up chess and see the pro chess world become more inclusive. Doing so would not in any way  imply that African-Americans are genetically less capable of playing chess. Surely you don\u2019t disagree with this concept?",

It\u2019s not Netflix fault there.\n\nAs for the originals imo there is an industry wide complacency when it comes to quality of cinema and series. Lots out there seem mass produced and rehashed with little or nothing to make it special or memorable. If a movie or show happens across a good writer it\u2019s often ruined by casting, directing, or poor acting. People truly good at the art seem to be in low demand nowadays since so many shows and movies are not tied to cinema, dvd sales, and merch. But more so in subscriptions and adding the title to a list.  \n\nNo one takes risks anymore because they just aren\u2019t as profitable or at least aren\u2019t worth going for because playing it safe is almost as good. \n\nEdit:at least that\u2019s how I see it personally.",

I often wonder if Pringles vie to be middle of the pack, because that's where it's safest. I gotta think if you're one of the last six Pringles on the bottom, you have to resign yourself quickly to the fact that by the time you get to someone's mouth, you'll be next to dust.\n\nAlso, my fingers don't fit in that case. I'd like to pull one chip out at a time, but can't. I gotta tilt it and then I get a handful. And again, that heavy duty container doesn't guarantee they will all be chips in mint condition. Far from it in fact, as I've had to eat single chips in two or three servings at times. It's brutal, as I think any Pringles diner would attest.\n\nFinally, I just have a problem with the unnatural processing of a Pringle. In reality, perhaps it's no different than how a regular chip is made, but the idea of pressed and rolled and seasoned and measured potato discs that fit precisely in a cylinder just makes me uneasy. I mean, what if chicken or steak came that way? (actually, come to think of it, maybe it already does - deli meat...)\n\nAll that said, I have no problem downing a whole can in one sitting.

            "Next year there are only two films coming out. And I think they will have less attention than what we have seen this year. But in 2021 there are like three TV shows and likely 4 films (Spider-man 3 will be announced by Sony soon). So that over saturation will really start then. But then again the Netflix shows were on this whole time of phase 3. So I dunno, maybe it won't crash like Westerns did. IMO you won't see these next films breaking a billion. Endgame will be the pinnacle of the franchise.\n\n\nAdditionally, I think that critics are afraid to be hard on Marvel films. You have to understand that critics these days have to account for subscribers. They know if they criticize certain films then it will make certain viewers or readers unsubscribe or story reading. They probably think that by giving these films a pass it's okay. I mean look at how they reacted to the Last Jedi, then they see people critiquing it and then Solo gets genuine reviews because the critics knew SW wasn't bulletproof anymore. It will take people really turning on a Marvel film for them to start giving it genuine criticism.",
            ">They\u2019re over-saturating the market to the extent that they\u2019re really  going to go the way of the Western at some point. Talk about franchise  fatigue. Yeah, *Marvel isn\u2019t immune*. They\u2019re going to crash, and crash hard at one point.\n\nCompletely non-facetiously: this is interesting because if it's actually an unpopular opinion, then that also means it's likely false, since in order for franchise fatigue to kill off a franchise that fatigue would need to be common, i.e., \"popular.\"\n\nEither way, speaking for myself, I do feel pretty uninterested in Phase 4. Infinity War and Endgame were big events for me because they were the culmination of years of storytelling. Nothing at the beginning of Phase 4 is going to be nearly as interesting. Nothing they've shown post-Endgame has really piqued my interest at all.\n\nI do feel like the MCU has went from having a great vision to being fragmented and undefined. Captain Marvel was supposed to lead the MCU after Phase 3. But Marvel seems to have backtracked on that a lot when the movie, while successful, proved to be a bit too controversial and Bree Larson developed a strong negative reputation (fair or not). Now they're planning on doing a female Thor-like character, and I can't help but wonder if that's their hope to do what Captain Marvel was supposed to do. Either way, I don't know what the hell is really going on, but it feels like directionless stagnation to me.\n\nPart of Phase 4 is also going to be on Disney's streaming service, which frankly I will not be subscribing to -- streamer fatigue is possibly going to affect Marvel just as much as franchise fatigue.",

I'd give a vast majority of them good reviews, because it has what people are looking for. The movie rating scale for Marvel movies has to be framed in a \"cool cgi, with good fight scenes, and the occasional chuckle\" scale, not an artistic creativity scale.  It's like buying a good gun game, then getting disappointed that the villain is just some lackey from Russia, or going to X comedian and getting disappointed that said comedian relies on jokes against his/her weight/race. People know what they're getting when they go, and that's fine with them. Have to frame it with their mindset and base it off of the qualities they want.\n\nIDK, I agree with a lot of what you said (not particularly creative, and obvious cash cow), but I don't think that should take away from their success or ratings.",
            "Lol this is so stupid. Saying the positive reviews \"really aren't honest\" is the most pretentious thing to say about movies since you're acting like your opinion is the true one. They have largely satisfied a large group of people for over a decade, and it's something unprecedented really. The Dark Universe and DCEU, along with countless others, are doing what Marvel has done a while ago now, and so to claim Marvel is the one who \"earned the success the least\" is stupid. And from the box office standpoint, nothing has indicated any fatigue yet. This \"comic book fatigue\" thing has been said when the first Avengers came out. Even before then. Transformers fatigue got real when the last one made the least money. Justice League made the least money for DCEU at the time, so you could've had an argument there, but Marvel has only gotten more popular. And now a Spiderman is about hit a billion, which has never been done before.",

            "TLDR: I feel bad, but the law makes sense ONLY because of the practice of homeless people perma-parking motor homes (that have broken down) in less than ideal places for people who own a home or pay rent.\n\nOk so, I agree: people should be allowed to park in a legal space and sleep. The biggest talking point for this is something a lot of comments touched on, drunk driving. In cities like NY or Los Angeles (specifically LA for this anecdote), you really cant just park anywhere and sleep, you\u2019ll probably get asked to leave by police. The police are on this stuff because of how many homeless people there are, and seeing you asleep in your car, they assume you\u2019re homeless too (sleeping out of your car), or at best doing something wrong. I have friends who had to put up with this during dire times, and it sounds awful.\nON THE OTHER HAND, having had BIG homeless encampments (GoT style tent camps) get set up outside/nearby the apartments I\u2019ve lived, it makes sense why this law exists. That literally is the other side of this coin: there are permanently homeless people out there, and unfortunately since most of these people don\u2019t take care of their \u201chome\u201d (stretch of the sidewalk), people often call police to have them removed. It starts with one tent, truck, motorhome... it rapidly evolves into a size-able community.\nThe worst of it is when they stack trash on sidewalks so that its too big a job to make them move, or, as stated up top, when they park a motor home somewhere with zero intention of moving it. Once I saw people PUSHING a motorhome... \nIt really is a shame, but its a classic case of \u201cthis is why we cant have nice things.\u201d",
            "While I agree, in some places it\u2019s a liability issue.  Insurance sucks.  As for the \u2018passing out drunk in your car to sleep it off\u2019 in some states the law is written in a way that if you are in your car while drunk, even though not operating, it can be assumed that you previously drove drunk.  Unfortunately that\u2019s how the law is written in some places, even if it\u2019s a disadvantage to those who are really just trying to be responsible and sleep off a night of partying.",

            "There is only one main reason they make it illegal to sleep in your car in most cities and that is because most Laws are anti-poor.\n\nI was doing an 20 hour drive and thought I could drive the whole way but then started to fall asleep.  I was in the middle of a city, it was 3am so I pulled off onto a road that was in a industrial district and got lucky, there was NO ONE and NOTHING around.

He then informs me that it is Illegal to sleep in your car in this city between sunset and sunrise.  I just look at him and I say \"Officer, I'm not trying to be disrespectful but are you serious?\"  He replies, \"Yes, that's the law.\"  I then say, \"It's legal for me to park here right?\"  He replies yes.  ANd then I say, \"It's legal for me to sit in my car while it is parked here right?\"  He replies, \"yes, that is legal.\"  and then I say, \"But if I fall Asleep I've now broken the law?\".  He replies, \"That's correct.\"  I say, \"I apologize in advance for sounding like a jerk, but can I just sleep in my car and you write me a ticket because it would be the same as me going to a hotel and I really am just too tired to drive.  I only need 2 hours and then I'll be good and on my way, but if you have to write me a ticket, I understand you are just doing your job.\"\n\nHe then says, \"No, I'd have to arrest you and tow your car.  But don't worry about it.  I patrol until 6am so just be gone by 6am.  He hands me back my stuff and I say \"Thanks officer.\"  He says, \"alright, have a good night\" and he goes about his way",

He apparently died the night before and had been in his car overnight.  Someone finally noticed and alerted the authorities.

            "This is such an on point post. You make such a key point too, at the fact it encourages driving under the influence. Because it goes without saying SOMEONE has made the decision to drive due to the rather. \n\nI live about 2 hours from the nearest city Postmates and DoorDash operate in, and when I was strapped for cash, I used to make the drive after working all day up north, just to make an extra 60-70 dollars in my day. I'd be so tired sometimes, I'd stop, clear out my back seat, lay the seats down, and literally make myself a bed. Sleeping half in the trunk, and half way on the seat backs. The key to it was having windows just dark enough I could be hidden, and my car was quite and could run unnoticed in the corner of a parking lot. \n\nTo be honest I couldn't tell you how many times I've done this. Between my drugged up pill years, and my sober adult life. I live in Georgia and don't even know if it's illegal, but circling back to why the law even exist. I know that if it did, it would sadistically be for the purpose of generating revenue for the state. Honestly, what other reason is there to make it illegal!? You're rational thinking is logical. Its your property, and you're literally harming NO ONE. It's an indirect angle the state has on forcing people into making decisions that could ultimately cost them their lives. \n\nSorry to go on, but then stack the pandemic on top of that. Lost jobs, lost homes and businesses. These people might not have anyone to turn to, and are forced into sleeping in their car, running, in the freezing cold weather we're having now. Break their window, and have EMS or the police show up, you're getting to a mental breakdown area then. \n\nYour point strikes a chord with me because of what it truly resonates. You're right. There should be outrage, but when your that beat down, what will do you have to give it that amount of emotional response? Then, when you're back on your feet, you forget about it, because your living in the comfort you've worked hard for, and just hope and pray you don't find yourself back in thag despair. \n\nYou nailed it on this one.",

I\u2019m not sure if that makes a difference to you. The laughter is genuine though. \n\nI quite like it in some cases.

You some kid with a rectangle in your hand with access to any entertainment you can imagine.  My question is why do you give a fuck?  Like ok, you don't like friends,  so don't watch it.

            "Songs about sex are kind of like people who sext. Some are more creative, subtle and like to tease, others are blunt and to the point.\n\nNeither way is necessarily bad, it depends on the person receiving its tastes. \n\nSo though I generally prefer songs that take a second or 2 to work out I think with some songs just spelling out something can work. \n\nAnd I don't think all older music was better, most generations have plenty of good music. We just get nostalgic for the music in our teens (there are studies saying the music you like at 14 leaves the longest lasting impression of any music in your life) \n\nA lot of songs in the past didn't hint at sex because they thought that was better, they had to do it that way because they wouldn't get played on the TV or radio if they did. \n\nSongs don't often get banned anymore or have producers saying they can't be recorded. But I mean the kinks song Lola got investigated by the FBI due to some unclear lyrics. So I don't think back then openly sexual songs would get released.\n\nYou definitely wouldn't get songs like WAP, because for the longest time women singing about liking sex was seen as very taboo. \n\nSo they made it more vague, apart from songs/lyrics like \"when I think about you I touch myself,\" which how did people not get the meaning of that??",
            "Lyrics have always done this as others have pointed out, but I think the main difference is 'back then' it was actually rebellious and contrary to a lot of social norms. These days, sex is ubiquitous. Everyone looks at porn, everyone masturbates, we all do it and it's understood and generally accepted.\n\nBelieve it or not, but back in the 90's people actually didn't admit to masturbating that much. Playboy barely showed genitals. But lyrics about sex these days are just saying the same shit everyone else is.",

She leaned over for a better look.\n\nAn oscillating fan lazily turned, blowing air out of the bathroom. The room began to take on an unpleasant smell.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should... umm... crack a window\u201d, said Marsha, reaching for a nearby latch. \n\n\u201cNonsense\u201d, said Sad_Guy, suddenly on the couch next to her.

Kneel\u201d, she said.\n\nSad_Guy stayed on the couch, trying to count the steps to the door.\n\n\u201cKNEEL!\u201d, she shouted, as another explosive fart rocked the room. The smell began to wash over Sad_Guy, causing his eyes to water, his vision blurring. \n\nHe fell off the couch and got on his knees. He opened his mouth an apology but methane choked off his words. \n\nMartha was then in his face. \u201cYou have no power here\u201d, she said, as she turned to leave. \n\nSad_Guy toppled over, his face on the carpet, as he watched her approach the door. \n\n\u201cSee you around, Sad_Guy\u201d, she said, as she creaked open the apartment door. \u201cOh, and by the way, it was always my silent ones that were the deadliest.\u201d\n\nShe gave him a sly smile then she was gone.\n\nSad_Guy tried to get up but found himself... paralyzed. Then he noticed a shimmer in the air, by the door which Marsha had just used to leave. \n\nIt seemed to be expanding, growing in his direction. \n\nHe thought back to 5th grade science, about solids, liquids, and gasses. \n\n\u201cA gas expands to fill the room!\u201d\n\nSad_Guy gasped for air as the shimmering gas swept over him, and with it, darkness.",

The skills you develop playing video games are not particularly transferable, they make you better at playing other video games and that's about it.\n\nWith television, you aren't 'switching off' your brain, you're more focused on the narrative being presented to you.\n\nThere are shit skinner box video games that do nothing good for you, and shit television, and there's television and video games that are worth the time. Either one done to the exclusion of physical activity and face to face socializing is a problem, and to the extent that video games are more addictive and engaging, they're more of a problem in this regard.",

Soon enough you\u2019re playing 6, 8 a day, and in throughout all weekend. \n\nAfter a few months, you still have a shitty job with awful pay and now your wife wants to end things because you keep staring at a screen for multiple hours per week and doesn\u2019t give her any attention.",
            "Unpopular opinion; just do whatever makes YOU happy. Don\u2019t be seeking validation off others.",
            "Play video games. Watch the Sopranos.\n\nNot at the same time though, you should really watch Sopranos when you can give it your full attention. It's a very detailed show that rewards close watching and its greatest strength is its characters - you get to know them as if they were part of *your* family, you watch them grow and evolve (or fail to do those things), and you come to intimately understand their relationship dynamics and inner workings. It's so, so much more than just a mob show. It's a show about family and what it means to be in one - both regular, lower-case-F family, or, y'know...*the* family.\n\nAnyway, four dollars a pound.",
            "I think it's pretty accepted these days in my experience, but that wasn't always the case. \n\nI've had many conversations with people who don't play games and say something to the effect of \"It just seems like a waste of time.\"  If you ask them what they do for fun, they will list things like tv, reading, hiking, going to bars etc... but for some reason, they don't feel like those things are a waste of time. I thought about this many years ago and it seemed to suggest to me that what they actually mean when they call games a waste of time, is that they do not enjoy them, and so they would therefore be a waste of time. This appears to be a basic empathy gap right? IE \"I don't find them fun and don't get how other people could.\"\n\nI think that is part of it, but it's also social conditioning. Most kids who played video games a lot as children were shamed subtly or openly about it by their parents/teachers/other kids even. Eventually at some stage of their development, they might have unconsciously decided that the negative feelings that arise from what their parents/teachers/etc say to them were greater than the joy they received from playing them. That, or they just didn't find them that much fun. So coming from this perspective, it's understandable that they would think they are a \"waste of time.\"",

Now of course, playing games for 12 hours a day isn't a good use of your time, but there's nothing wrong with playing games for say one or two hours a day.",

Plus, they're not mutually exclusive, i for one like to spend time doing both equally. Also who is turning off their brains watching tv?

It\u2019s a work of art by an individual/group looking to express themselves and we take it in and appreciate and experience that expression.\n\nSame goes for movies. The director/writer had a vision of something artistic that they wished to display. Theyre displaying their own creativity.\n\nGames? How is it any different? A collective group of people had a creative vision and they developed it. And we get to experience this vision. The difference is (and this is moreso in favour of your argument) is that we get to interact with this artistic expression.",

            "I agree.  Gen-X\u2019er here.  I think as boomers, who played fewer video games and seem (at least to me) to be more apt to dislike video games, \u201cleave the scene\u201d, gaming in advanced ages will be less frowned upon than watching the boob-tube (to coin a boomer phrase).  The TV over gaming thing is becoming more an age delineated thing...\n\nThere\u2019s great promise in game based therapies for different physical and cognitive issues, and I can totally see the principles incorporated into a lot of mainstream games as a sort of mental vitamin...\n\nWe are also getting to the point in technology where we can go a lot further with those things as well as jobs involving robots, drones, and remote work (even surgery).  Gaming is actually great prep for that.\n\nGaming is also great for critical thinking if you have a diverse gaming repertoire...  What a lot of people (especially boomers, and I\u2019m not here just to bash boomers, the age based distinction is relevant) in the anti-gaming sentiment seem to miss, is that when education shifted under boomer rule to rote memorization, no child left behind, teach to the lowest denominator, etc. there was a lot of critical thinking left out and gaming has started to put that back in.  They killed our art, music, auto shop, metal shop, wood shop, and other critical skills, and gaming is taking steps to replace those skills as we move more into digital worlds...\n\nTV can\u2019t compete with that for someone with an active intellect and a desire to learn... and a lot of people have that desire but don\u2019t get a lot of direction...\n\nSure, there are plenty of social issues that need to be addressed, but that\u2019s a different discussion entirely...  but honestly, those are more perpetuated by TV media than anything else and is why we are seeing more cord cutting and a-la-cart TV...\n\nEssentially, we are seeing the evolution of education to include gaming in more socially acceptable settings...  like esports which are a multi-billion dollar sponsored industry, and the explosion of console gaming...\n\nSo I think more and more people are going to share your opinion as time moves on...\n\nTL;DR - Gaming is becoming less stigmatized when compared to TV because it\u2019s becoming more useful and is replacing skills we took out of the classroom, and kids aren\u2019t as stupid as boomers make them out to be.",

No story, just pick up where I left off and not worrying about what happened to x character on x subplot.\n\nTV is like that for me. I can just pick it up where I left off, most of the time it's because I have seen it before and am doing a rerun or it's because it has no story and is a trash program about police or how something is made or some nonsense.\n\nLockdown however has made me be able to catch up on certain series and I even managed to start The Last of Us II.

I think alot of people know when they feel tired after watching TV they'll just switch it off but the pull is there with video games that makes you not want to switch it off even when your body is telling you it's tired and time for bed. This is just me speaking from experience of being addicted. I don't play anymore cause I don't trust myself unfortunately.

I had a special ultrasound, which showed multiple deformities. My poor baby had massive fluid on her brain, spina bifida on her lower spine (which meant she was likely paralyzed), holes in her heart and her esophagus wasn\u2019t properly attached to her stomach. She was weak, frail and suffering. \n\nI had known something was wrong for a long time but I couldn\u2019t quite put a finger on it. I even had a horrific nightmare days before the doctor called me about the bloodwork. All of my dream came true and it still haunts me. \n\nIn the end, three blood tests were performed that confirmed her diagnosis, along with the specialist\u2019s ultrasound AND an amniocentesis. \n\nOn January 20, 2018, I gave birth to her after receiving medication to put me into labor. She was a full pound. I got to hold her and say goodbye. It was the hardest day of my entire life and I still think about her every single day. She was dying inside of me. The vast majority of babies with Trisomy 18 do not make it to birth and the few who do die within an hour to a couple days.

The elder child has had to endure helping take care of his sister, emotional neglect and has gotten into a lot of trouble. Sure, she's a great kid but she will forever be a child and the state will likely have to intervene at some point because they ain't getting any younger, the eldest may actually want a life of his own and she's incapable of caring for herself - all for one's selfish desire to have their own.",

It\u2019s a cruel and miserable existence to be forced to live in constant pain. \n\nAnd before people say \u201cwell what if you acquire a terminal illness/injury half way through your life?\u201d \u2014 now you\u2019re getting into an assisted suicide debate.",

Being alive is not the same as living, and I couldn't bear to bring her into this world knowing that she will suffer until the day she died, and that day could very well come decades before it should.

The parents  decided to keep the pregnancy  because  they wanted  to spend  what time they could  with their baby. The baby died a few hours after birth  and the family  donated the organs.  Im glad that family  found their peace that way  but I think of my friend and her choice  to terminate  was her way of finding  peace.  I mean, if she had waited  to give birth at full term, imagine  how traumatic  it would  be- to meet your baby and  watch it suffocate to death. \n\nI think if you are going  to be pro life you need to be empathetic go those going  through  abortions.

All I really know is that this is not a choice I would want to be faced with. Also, losing your child after a year as opposed to losing your child in the womb as opposed to losing your child at forty-five, those are all terrible and valid losses. Each of the losses deserve to be grieved. For all we know people choose to go ahead with a pregnancy because it just doesn\u2019t compute that their child is gonna die, because having a child die (unless you\u2019ve had it happen) is quite unfathomable.

What was a death sentence even 20 years ago is now a manageable complication today. \n\nI won\u2019t assume that you\u2019re not a parent. But there is a moment when you hold your baby for the first time, and you just want the world for them. It\u2019s not altruism, they\u2019re your kid, of course it\u2019s selfish. Everything we do is. But in that moment, you give them your hopes and strength and dreams to be whatever they can or want to be.  It\u2019s no small thing to destroy that.",

I provided several peer reviewed sources to back my claim. Never heard another thing from him. Looked into his history and the dude is supposedly a Dr. Pretty sad when a guy who spent 10 years being educated resorts to middle school tactics of plugging his ears when he is challenged.",
            "I don\u2019t think this is true at all. Many are reading made up sources, or sources making false claims, or only talking about one side of an issue. The problem is that they aren\u2019t looking at facts-which really cannot be disputed. You can objectively answer if you go off of facts, and not just things that you hear, or random articles you read. If you are talking about sources largely based in *opinion* than sure, but if you go by facts than you are actually educating yourself. People have become too lazy to do their own research or look at factual evidence being presented to them. And yes, I will go as far as to say that some people are being brainwashed by their sources because they fail to look outside of them. When the radio stations or tv programs you watch tell you not to look at other sources, or tell you to simply believe what they are telling you, then yes, your statement stands true. They only want you to listen to their sources and want you to drink the same koolaid they are drinking. This is why it is important to look outside and educate yourself with facts. Not just the *opinions* that you are listening to. At least in my circle if someone says to \u201ceducate yourself\u201d it\u2019s because you are not presenting factual evidence of anything, or are regurgitating falsehoods.",

            "I have done full-time activism work, and the \"Educate yourself!\" is ONE OF THE WORST statement that the current SJW's are throwing around. It goes against the very core of actual activism, and as we've seen in the last few years, you cannot trust people to find the right sources with all the disinformation floating around the internet.\n\nTo SJW's: I don't care that you're tired. I don't care that you're exhausted from having to explain something over and over again. If you really care about the issue, you'll be delighted to answer good-faith questions as many times as it takes. If you really care about change, and not just about being right, you'll know that the point in time when someone is coming to you with a slightly-dumb & slightly-ignorant question is a CRUCIAL moment in organizing: You have someone who is actually willing to learn a little more & to listen (which is very rare! never waste this opportunity!), and you can either be helpful and take a moment to teach them something, or you can be sanctimonious and snap: \"I'm TIRED! Educate yourself!\" If you go with the first choice, you can frequently take someone on the fence and move them into a position where they support you; hell, they may be pleased enough by the interaction to actually go home and do more research. But if you say, \"Educate yourself!\" chances are very good that they will turn against your issue, at least a little bit. And then it will take them another 10 positive interactions with someone on the same subject in order to overcome the negative interaction they had with you.\n\nTo recap: \"Educate yourself!\" hurts movements. If you have ever said it, you are dismantling support on the issues you care about. It needs to stop, and it needs to stop immediately.",

            "Just using the word \u201ceducate\u201d make you sound so patronizing, like you hold the truth and you\u2019re enlightened. The only way you can educate someone is if you\u2019re both \u201cconsensual\u201d i.e. when you willingly sign up for a course where you will be taught by someone else. Throwing information you believe is right at someone isn\u2019t education. If you know they already disagree with you, how is using the word \u201ceducate\u201d, which rids your argument of any humility, going to convince the other person? I just think it\u2019s patronizing and not constructive. It makes me think of religious missions where indigenous populations were \u201ceducated\u201d, where their \u201cignorance\u201d was pitied by white saviours who knew they held true knowledge, and who genuinely thought they were doing something good. People who say they\u2019re educating someone else (in a dynamic where clearly the other person did not demand to be \u201ceducated\u201d), or who tell people around them to educate themselves display that same kind of arrongance. See, we don\u2019t have the ability to always have the best values and to always think the right thing, because that changes as we mature and evolve as people. So it\u2019s okay to have ideas that we later will find to be foolish or \u201cwrong\u201d. But the one thing we have control over is to have HUMILITY about our opinions, experiences and values, and we can display that through the words we choose to use. In my opinion, choosing \u201ceducate\u201d is a display of close-mindedness and arrogance.",

Even tho they are fighting against fashism, they are actually causing more fashism.   \n\nSame with BLM. They are fighting for equality in a country where discrimination is ILLEGAL by law. They are causing more separation and harm to the black community. Imagine what would happen if Police got defunded and there was nobody to protect black community from discrimination?

The entire process is them fertilizing a certain amount of eggs, transplanting the ones least likely to have genetic problems into the mother, and tossing the rest and/or freezing them and then tossing them later if the parents decide not to try again. If you believe life begins at conception, i.e. fertilization, then any embryo that does not get implanted is murdered the same way an aborted embryo is murdered.\n\nThe only reason people don\u2019t make a huge deal out of it like they do with Planned Parenthood or other family planning clinics is because it\u2019s EXPENSIVE. It\u2019s for upper middle class and above. Meanwhile, abortion is often seen as a lower class problem. \n\nSo anyway, pick whichever side you want, but whatever side you pick, actually follow through on those beliefs.

            "That's a compelling argument. On the same premise, this also applies to Intrauterine contraceptives/devices.  Many IUDs work by thinnning the uterine wall so fertilized eggs don't attach themselves to it. But nothing prevents the eggs from being fertilized and if they do, they automatically die because they can't attach themselves to the uterine wall. I guess you can it \"intentional miscarriage\" and by your premise, it goes against the fundamental Pro-Life beliefs.",
            "I've always been confused with something similar. I've heard the argument that abortion is wrong because its god's will to have the child, yet if you can't conceive naturally isn't that *also* god's will?\n\nI think its shitty to be vehemently against abortion and at the same time support IVF.",
            "I had this same thought recently as I was watching a podcast where a woman who considers herself prolife, had IVF. I dont remember all the details but basically they had 4 viable embryos, implanted 3 (she had triplets) and i dont remember what happened to the fourth. And her husband is a doctor.",

I mean..uh.. my daughter did it and look we have two wonderful grand kids now isn't that great!\" It never sat well with me. It didn't take long during that lecture to decide if I couldn't have my own, I'd adopt and avoid irresponsibly fertilizing a bunch of embryos that had no chance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's kinda rare that I run into a pro lifer that agrees with me on that oddly enough.

            "Love the argument. To plays devil's advocate (though I'm not sure if I disagree or not to be honest) I'd say that from a pro-life view life actually starts at fertilization AND implantation, since even with 'regular' sex you can fertilize an egg and not have it be implanted, so a pregnancy won't result (but you wouldn't count it as an automatic miscarriage because no pregnancy has happened yet). So IVF fertilized eggs haven't actually started life yet because they haven't been implanted yet. \n\nAlso I think there isn't religious shame or the stigma of irresponsibility attached to IVF because as you said it's expensive, it's intentional, and I'd guess most people are older and likely married adults. It's not seen as someone not trying to 'take responsibility' for the 'consequence of their actions'.",

            "Alright I am going to write my paragraph long response here and I am sure (and I almost hope) that no one reads it and it gets buried but here goes: \n\nI am a doctor. I am Christian. I am pro-life in that I believe abortion is wrong. But I also believe people should choose to do the right thing so I don\u2019t agree with any laws restricting abortion and planned parenthood because doing the right thing ONLY because the wrong thing is illegal and because you have no access to the wrong thing is just as good as doing the wrong thing. God put Adam and Eve in the garden with the tree of knowledge of good and evil because he wanted them to choose to not eat from it. So women should have the right to choose to do the right thing if they want to. \n\nNow for IVF. I did a med school rotation with a world known IVF guy. He was also Christian. I had the same question but I was honestly afraid to ask. I kept my head down and passed my time. Three weeks in he asked me \u201cdo you think the fertilized eggs that we don\u2019t use and dispose is abortion?\u201d\n\nI froze. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I didn\u2019t want to tell this obviously Christian dude that I thought his life work contradicted his faith. I said \u201cno\u201d. He asked how. I froze again. \n\nBasically his thought (one that I have grown to adopt) is that abortion is ACTIVELY doing anything to stop a birth from happening, given that the birth would happen if you did nothing. So if, left alone, a child would be born and you stop it, then it\u2019s abortion. In the catholic sense, it\u2019s a sin of commission. Left to their own devices, the fertilized eggs would not become a child. Therefore IVF is not abortion. \n\nThis is my opinion that I have adopted from him. He was a great guy who did a lot of good work and never forced his opinion on anyone. Even when he told me this, a lowly med school student, he discussed it with me and didn\u2019t force his opinion on me. I believe (and so did he) that women should have the right to choose for themselves.",

Its why people keep calling them hypocrites, because they *say* they care about the fetus. But what they *really* care about is the woman, and how she *consented* to being pregnant.\n\nBecause sex is solely for procreation. Thus to have sex, is to consent to procreate. And to abort, is to walk back on that initial consent, ~~in to sin~~ which is morally wrong.

We have had abortion for years here and we are slowly trying to get rid of it , because our population is slowly dying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut at the same time , the maternity government program here is collapsed so I understand when people say that they cannot afford to care for children.",
            "Interesting. I didn't know I needed this discourse until now.",
            "There are programs to donate unused eggs to infertile couples.  There is also the possibility that the prospective parents use up all the eggs.  Furthermore, there are many different shades of being pro life.  You could be against abortions past the age of viability, or after the 1st trimester, or some other variation.  So I disagree - at least in part.",
            "Powerful argument. I had no awareness of this. Thanks for sharing.",
            "Wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s because of abortion being a \u2018lower class issue\u2019 it\u2019s just ones more known about",
            "Suuuper late to the party, but just pointing out there are IVF centers/ egg donation clinics that are faith based and do NOT throw away any eggs. (They are typically more expensive) In fact the one I enrolled to donate to had an entire sponsorship program where women could donate their unused embryos and other couples could use them for their IVF cycles. (Drastically reduces the cost of IVF). They are also most often the same clinics that refuse to treat same sex couples or single patients.   \n\n\nThere are people who act in accordance with their beliefs when it comes to this. I still think it's obtuse, but just saying.",
            "Interesting take, I would wonder what people consider conception though. My guess is that most wouldn't consider it a conception until it attaches and can grow, otherwise the act of sex would often be against the pro life stance as many eggs become fertilized but don't take.\nKind of like how people from either side are not against miscarriages, just sad when they happen.",
            "Not sure whether I consider myself pro-life or pro-choice. There's an incredibly hard and nuanced discussion to be had that seemingly neither side wants to happen.\n\nGenerally, I personally think abortion regulation in the US is too liberal. However, I'm fine with how things are in most European countries.\n\nViability, as defined in the context of a pregnancy doesn't really satisfy me as a cut off point.\n\nGiven this stance I don't really have a problem with IVF, yet I would likely be for more restrictive abortion rights.",
            "So, the only issue I have is the conclusion hinges solely on the premise that:\n\n>If you believe life begins at conception,\n\nBecause if people don't believe this, then the whole argument and the conclusion is moot.\n\nA second point: you have to define what **life** is and exclude everything that doesn't qualify. Does a lump of cells have \"life\" in the same way that a person has life? A fetus is a lump of cells, but so is a tumor. Does a tumor also have life? If there's a distinction between the two, then you're talking about something **other** than just \"life\".\n\nI'm with you on the reason that you believe it's a middle class problem and could probably make further arguments to fortify the belief, but the conclusion is really lacking a connection with the premise. It only applies to those who **believe that life begins at conception/fertilization** yet you overgeneralize to the point of a black or white fallacy, an either-or scenario, while in reality there's a myriad of possibilities.",

            "That's like saying you can't be pro-life and miscarry",
            "There are options within IVF that do not involve waste.  I can't speak for every facility, but when my wife and I did IVF we were given a choice of a) storing the embryos indefinitely, b) discarding them, c) donating them to research or d) donating to other prospective parents.  We ultimately chose to donate to others so there wouldn't be waste.  I get where your argument is coming from and I don't disagree in cases where couples choose to discard, I just wanted you to have complete information regarding IVF.",

            "most Pro-Lifers would argue that the process of the pregnancy is what sustains the life. \"all things left the same, the human child will be born\" is a typical statement.  So fertilizing an egg outside of the mother most likely wouldn't trigger any kind of response from a pro-lifer, because the egg won't continue to grow outside the mother regardless if it's been fertilized or not.\n\nThe important part in the pro-life argument is that without some kind of manual involvement - the baby gets born.  They would likely draw the line at \"Conception\" being when the IVF egg was put into the woman.  If you decided down the road that you didn't actually want the child after the IVF process - you would fall back in line with aborting the child in the womb.",
            "I don't know about other countries, but in Brazil clinics are required by law to store all fertilized eggs (forever) as they are seen as \"life\". As abortions are illegal in Brazil (with very few exceptions: rape, risk for the mother, anencephaly), this requirement has a sensible legal reasoning (not saying that I agree or disagree with it)",
            "To push into this further, if you are struggling with fertility and are pro-life maybe this a great couple to consider adoption as opposed to IVF.  The costs are both high but you are putting your time and money towards a life that already exists and needs a parent more than you need a baby.",

            "There are a lot of things ProLifers really shouldn't be okay with but they tend to be a pretty hypocritical crowd",
            "Just like all other posts, this isn't an unpopular opinion, but rather a very popular one, pro life people aren't actually pro life, but rather pro birth, if it takes a hundred discarded embrios just to produce one more human with the other existing 8billion, than so be it. Abortion prevents the production of a human and therefore it's a huge no-no",
            "I did IVF and I would never choose an abortion from a moral standpoint. We decided to give each embryo created a chance, none of them were thrown out. It took several years to transfer each one, and we had a lot of heart break along the way, but we feel at peace that each embryo created got its opportunity. We did get lucky because all of the embryos created were chromosomally normal."

However, I spent a year in Djibouti, right next to Somalia and spent some time in Ethiopia as well. \nDjibouti itself was everything I was ever told to expect from Africa and more. Limitless poverty where the vast majority of the population lived in trash bag huts in a barren desert made entirely of dirt and rocks. \nHuman life was next to worthless and goats were worth more than children. An open bed truck would roll through town carrying trash and children would be waiting. \nAs it would roll by, they would hop on in groups of 10 or more and throw trash out of the back to collect later. The truck driver would then absolutely floor it and swerve, attempting to knock the children off at speeds of 50+ mph. \nThe roads were in a mild state of ruin and non imposed traffic laws cause many accidents. The roads outside of the city itself were covered in literally hundreds of over turned semi trucks and trailers that the country did not have the infrastructure to remove.\nPeople lived in many of these littered throughout the road. \nPeople were killed for next to nothing. The wife of the leader of Djibouti owned a monopoly on the milk market and people were executed in the dirt for being caught transporting it across the border. \nEven the wealthy there lived in rundown apartments crumbling from the outside. The security walls around the outside were covered in broken glass scavenged from the street to discourage people to climb them.\nThe police themselves were thugs and I personally witnessed them handing assault rifles to random people on the backs of open bed trucks in the middle of the street. \nNot all of Africa is like this of course but there definitely are places where the stereotypes ring true.

I had a very difficult time being friends with girls and making meaningful relationships with them because if I was ever treated like absolute crap by someone, it was a fellow girl who liked a boy that just liked me or was dating me. This followed me from high school well into college... it was always a girl I had never met who was the ringleader and her posse, which usually had some girls that were somehow intertwined in my friends group... they were like reconnaissance or something. \n\nAs I got older I learned that women are definitely my allies if I could put aside my own gender biases. I did, and have since been able to keep sustainable and meaningful relationships because I finally got rid of one huge factor that drives wedges between us... competition. The moment I stopped seeing other women as competition was the moment I finally grew as a woman. From a young age It\u2019s ingrained in us that other women are competition for everything, and that causes rifts. Women are supposed to support women because we\u2019re already trained that our place is to support men, we aren\u2019t supposed to support women instead of men, but in addition to men and because we should want to see each other succeed and beat the odds. This doesn\u2019t mean supporting all women, even if they are just god awful people who stand for everything we don\u2019t, of course.",

There is a fundamental difference (which is a problem but that's beside the point) between how natives and non-natives learn the same language:\n\nNatives learn it in the compartment order listen-read/write, while non-natives in learn ti read/write first. \n\nTherefore it is far easier for a non-native to know which form to use, since when they learned the words they were **effectively different** (letters are distinct, and the graphic form of the word is your main interface to it, not the words' sound). When native speakers learn words -and this isn't the case only for English, but particularly so for it- many of them are homophonous. Nothing helps tell them apart but context. Orthography is only a subsequent stage of linguistic development, and the phoneme-grapheme-meaning association is mainly arbitrary (there's in many cases no rule as to which should be which). \n\nMy point is, non-natives have the advantage here, not natives.

I'm a native French speaker and in French the same things happen when people can't distinguish between different words, only it's way worse and way more often with way many more words since almost every word has silent letters in itself but also added silent letters for plural and agreement and others as such. So when I see a native speaker with an awful spelling, I forgive them since they've never pictured any difference between words when spoken orally. However I don't get how a non native could confuse words, non natives know exactly what words to write since they've learnt the difference from the beginning, so in my opinion, non natives are the ones who have no excuse.

In all likelihood, they can then sue the everloving shit out of you if it's severe enough.\n\n2. Phobias. I shouldn't need to go into depth here.

And if a person is in the shop and gets spooked by the animal, the animal can be endangered by an subconscious response (i.e. kicking it away from them).\n\n3. Kids / idiots interacting with the animal in an unsafe way. Possibly agitating it, possibly injuring it. Now the store owner has to get the dog put down because it bit a kid when the kid pulled on its tail. Or the store owner is paying vet bills because a guy stood on his paw and injured him.\n\n4. Someone feeds the animal something it shouldn't eat. Now you have the stench of diarrhea or vomit in your shop. Unprofessional doesn't even begin to describe it.\n\nI like dogs. I like cats. But in a professional environment where you're serving all sorts of people, you really don't want to let them mix. Most people are fine with it, but the edge-cases of extreme allergy/badly behaved kids will put you out of business and possibly get the animal injured/killed.

            "I will echo that I love this, but I am wary of any store that has live in animals in cages. Cats in particular can be very noisy when hungry and they're easy to feed (both food and schedule wise) so I totally get having them around.\n\nBut things such as lizards? I used to work for a small climbing gym. The owner got some geckos and a lizard (in separate cages). The owner was the one that usually fed them, but in the later of my time there, she was extremely bad at actually coming in, even when she had scheduled herself to be in. This meant that we weren't always sure when the lizard and geckos were last fed and also weren't sure as to what they were needing for their diet. We talked about getting a cat for the gym because we got a mouse problem, and I was overall more enthusiastic about that because (in my experience) cats will let you know if you have forgotten to feed them.",

            "Unfortunately my hairdresser has a very grumpy dog, and he likes having him at the store. No matter who or when, as soon as you step foot into the store this dog will come running at you, barking (not in a friendly way). Even if you are calm and ignore it, the dog will keep barking at you for a solid minute until he decides he\u2019s bored with you, and walk away. Note that this is a very nice and expensive hair salon, and the main hairdresser is very popular and known for his abilities. I think he knows that his dog may annoy (or even scare) some clients and doesn\u2019t care, because he knows his most affectionate clients will always come to his store (he\u2019s right, his hair salon is always full). I have to say, that as much as I appreciate his skills, I am reluctant to go there as often as I would like to, because that dog makes me nervous (and I usually love dogs).  I just think it\u2019s very selfish of the owner to let his dog  be agressive to clients just because he wants to hang out with his dog while he\u2019s at work. If I was a person scared of dogs, it would have been very scared and never came back. \n\nBut sure, if that dog was nice and friendly I would love to have it there to pet it sometimes This dog clearly doesn\u2019t want you to get close.",

            "As a service dog handler this has been problematic for me in the past. ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s not clearly posted. Walking into a place completely unaware there\u2019s a loose dog right inside the door is a terrifying and dangerous experience. My SD has been attacked in the past by loose dogs and you never know how a loose dog will behave when another one suddenly appears in its store. Even if it\u2019s a friendly dog, it trying to interact with my SD means my SD can\u2019t focus. If it is well-behaved dog who the owners immediately call away and that ignores my SD so that we can shop in peace without having to watch out of the corner of my eye, then I\u2019m alright with that. \nThere was once a place for painting ceramics where my sister was celebrating her birthday, and they had a dog that roamed the place. I asked if they could restrain/put somewhere else/remove the dog while I was there with my SD, and they refused. My choice was either to have my SD lay calmly on the floor whilst having this little white dog sniffing all over him and distracting him from being able to focus properly, or not to go. I didn\u2019t go.\nI think the biggest thing here is that if the owners are responsible and respectful and the animal is well trained then it\u2019s cool and awesome. If they\u2019re not willing to accommodate people or their animal is not \u201cbombproof\u201d then it\u2019s an unnecessary risk/hazard especially when they\u2019re completely loose in the store.",

            "Hrm yeah that\u2019s troubling. Raises a few concerns for me ..\n\nI\u2019m a disability advocate in my work, and I tend to be clear with people that disability is a factor of living in a world that has only been designed to suit the able-bodied.\n\nThere is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with anyone who has a disability. Let\u2019s get that much clear. \n\nMore than anything, the way the world is designed, social expectations and the way our society functions, the buildings and tools we use \u2014 these are what\u2019s _wrong_ \u2014 because these all tend to privilege the able-bodied and ignores the _equally important needs_ of those who are living with a disability.\n\nI probably would stop short of what you\u2019re describing though, which to me sounds more like a _fetishisation_ of disability, of taking it and trying to behave like it\u2019s an advantage without actually changing behaviour in any meaningful way to cater to more diverse needs, a refusal to learn and adapt despite talking themselves up as some sort of disability and diversity hero. It\u2019s a very common thing neoliberal organisation\u2019s do, sadly. That\u2019s not really cool because it leads to exactly the sorts of feelings you\u2019re talking about. \n\nIt\u2019s a type of particularly on-the-nose abandonment, and gaslighting.",

I also know that I\u2019m considered \u201chigh functioning,\u201d so I\u2019m able to mask it and can operate in the neurotypical world more easily, and therefore I have the luxury and agency to have a nuanced perception of myself.",

Maybe it\u2019s music. Maybe it\u2019s geology. Maybe coding. Maybe astrophysics. Eventually you will stumble across some subject matter that will set your brain on fire, and that is when you will achieve next level \u201cadvantages\u201d people talk about.

            "Thank you for saying this. I\u2019m a mom of a child with ASD. Sure he can do many mathematical stuff and taught himself to read at age 3. But he has difficulty playing with kids his age. He often hangs out in the periphery when kids play but never approaches them. Even if it\u2019s a play date. Even when I introduce him to the children. He will follow or stare at them. I\u2019m not sure if he is lonely or unhappy. He doesn\u2019t not say his emotions. But growing up isolated from other kids I had hoped for a different childhood for my son. I don\u2019t think Autism is a disease but I think it has a lot of disadvantages. The media pushes this narrative which I heard called toxic positivity. I think we should be more like you.

            "I go back and forth with this one.\n\nI'm a-spec and I'm not shy about sharing it.  My special interests actually help me quite a bit with my current job and will probably help me in the future with my career.  But my social life is awful.  I can't keep a close friend for more than a few years.  I've never felt close enough to someone to consider a lifelong commitment like marriage or starting a family.  I was mocked relentlessly as a kid for being different and, until I changed school systems, my reputation as the 'crazy person' wouldn't go away.  I've failed more classes than I care to count and constantly bounce between feeling like I'm in total control or feeling like my life is going to fall apart.\n\nAutism has helped me in a great many ways and I couldn't envision myself without my neurodivergency.  But it's not a 'superpower'.  I'm not 'gifted' or some shit.  I've spent years in and out of therapy, gone to professionals, and even taken up studying psychology casually just to try and better understand myself.  I've had to spend years unlearning a decade and a half of negative social reinforcement telling me that I'm a mistake.  That I should kill myself.\n\nTo anyone who feels empowered by their autism (or other neurodivergency), more power to you.  Truly, I'm thrilled that it makes your life better.  And there are moments where I feel incredible using skills or sharing knowledge I only have because of my special interests.  But it's not easy.  It's not fun.  Some days, I wish more than anything that I could connect to other people and form the kinds of deep, mutual relationships they have.  I don't think I will ever connect to a single person enough to share my whole life with them, and sometimes that hurts.",

            "I have actual ADHD and it's torn my life apart. I feel you.\n\nThe few people who are aware of what \"hyper focus\" is think it's a super power, but it's torture. Every fiber of your being is focused on a single problem and you are unable to stop yourself like some kide of runaway freight train. It's \"cool\" if the problem can be solved in 2 hrs or less, but it can easily lead to forgetting to eat, sleep, shower, and practice self care/hygiene and last for days.\n\nI can't remember important parts of my life because this disability affects how my memory works. I was in my 20's and afraid I was developing dimentia or alzheimers. It makes it impossible for me to hold down a steady job because my mind always seeks new knowledge above all else and if it can't find it it will sabotage me. For real, a stable factory assembly line job is probably one of the worst hells possible for me because of the static, simple nature of assembly line work.\n\nMedication is not a cure, it's a temporary treatment that may become addictive to me one day and cause drug seeking behavior. But I need medication to be mostly functional because without it I am a cyclone of uncontrolled thought and actions and my poor wife catches the brunt of that madness. I have no hope for ever being better. Only that I some day manage to have more \"managed\" days than \"unmanaged\" days.\n\nThis isn't a super power, it doesn't make me special.

            "You are right. My daughter (adult now) has autism. She is eloquent writing like you are, but without going through all the details of childhood and school for her, it has been hell for her. Yes it is a disability, a challenge, a burden, whatever you want to call it. There is obviously a big range of cases from mild to non-verbal; my daughter is somewhere in the middle, not sure she will ever live completely independently, but she just finished getting an AA degree which was probably more of an accomplishment in terms of effort for her than graduate degrees for my other kids. I am certainly impressed and proud of that achievement for her. I am sure people are well-meaning talking about \u201csuper powers\u201d but I can see how that is invalidating. Yes, you have a disability. It isn\u2019t fair, and it is totally understandable that you wish you weren\u2019t born with it. Fuck it. I guess, other than validation, all I can think of to say in hopes it is helpful is this. First, maybe it is ok to say to people who are trying to be nice that really, no, you have a disability and it makes your life hard. Just say it. No one should pretend it is different, that isn\u2019t fair to you. But then my second thought (that might make it easier to talk about it with people) is that you can\u2019t change it so don\u2019t waste your life angry and unhappy about. If you can accept yourself as you are, and focus on what you can do that makes you happy, then the discussion about your autism isn\u2019t defensive or upsetting, it just acknowledging, accepting and liking who you are. The goal in life  is happiness and that is just a state of mind, which is a way of saying that you can change the way you feel inside even if there are things in life you can\u2019t change. I don\u2019t mean to be trite and say everyone has something to overcome in life, but usually they do. They feel ugly or overweight or stupid, they have chronic pain or anxiety or psychosis, they have been abused, poor, have cancer. It is an infinite list of shit people can face and just have to overcome it. You don\u2019t overcome a mountain all at once. You climb it one step at a time. So I hope and pray for you what I hope and pray for most people: change what you can, accept what you can\u2019t, like yourself for who you are, and work at being happy\u2014not rich or good looking or smart or neural-normal or whatever you think will make you happy (but won\u2019t). Play the cards you are dealt it is all you can do, but it starts with accepting yourself and liking yourself, not really giving a shit what other people think, and then going after what you want to do. Good luck!",
            "Huh that\u2019s odd that you\u2019re labeled as ableist when you have (I guess it depends on how severe and how you consider it) a disability, and you\u2019re speaking of yourself? \nI think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to feel frustrated with others not empathizing but that\u2019s because most wouldnt have an understanding of what it\u2019s like and only think that what they see in movies and other media is true. \nI think you\u2019re right in the sense that it shouldn\u2019t be seen as a benefit and a super power or whatever, and I think people think of it this way because of popular media. \nWhat I think does make sense that people are doing is raising awareness for people with disabilities and an understanding that they\u2019re not always visible etc. And overall reducing the stigma around it and normalizing it so disabled people can lead normal lifestyles where people react normally to them rather than having those rude/inappropriate responses they may have to disabled people.",
            "I got in an argument on reddit a few months ago with a bunch of people who were basically saying that the idea of a \"cure\" for autism was extremely offensive. Obviously if they can have arguments on the internet about the subject all of them have a fairly high functioning form of autism. I basically said I think looking at the possibility of a \"cure\" as a bad thing because you're just fine without one is a pretty selfish viewpoint. They seemed to not care that there are A LOT of people out there who's lives have been destroyed by autism. You value that aspect of yourself?

            "This hit a little bit too close to home. This is 20h too late but I just have to vent.\n\nI was deemed a genius in 6th grade. I was top 10 nationally in my country overall in these kind of mental & subject related tests. Super human was the word they used. But I wasn't really able to maintain a decent conversation with anyone unless it interested me. I had no way of actually understanding their point of view. I was so locked to routines that if my mom left for work without giving me my daily hug I wouldn't be able to do school. They had to call my mom, make her drive to school and give me a hug, and still then it wouldn't really work because it wasn't the goodbye hug I needed before I left for school. It just wasn't right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was bullied hard because of it. I learned the hard way that doing something incriminating is the fastest way to build a connection with someone. They bullied me so much it was normalized. Not even the teachers reacted to it anymore, that's how normal it was. Not that is a scale, as they'd probably not react to it anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy High School I was so withdrawn I didn't even participate socially. I just attended school, barely. And when I did I was mostly a spectator. I started observing social patterns and made some serious discoveries for myself. So the coolest kid says something and gets a X response. I say it and I get Y response. But it's the same action, why aren't x=y? Well, social status, relations etc were so major factors I couldn't view behaviour on its own. Which was a mind blower for me, because I was one of the kids who always went \"why can't I do x when he did x?\", and I developed this insane self rightousness I can't shake. I just hated it that I was treated differently than others.\n\nI was so socially awkward I just watched films and created my own little world. My fantasy became so vivid I wasn't able to always seperate real world from my world. Yeah, I started mixing them when I talked, so to the other kids I was just this insane lier. Which is true, I told a LOT of lies. How me and my uncle made this mini scooter with vacuum tires so we could drive on walls. Obviously it's a lie, but to 11 year old me it was a truth. But that killed my credibility. I'm not sure what of it is connected to my autism but fuck it, I didn't have credibility and I didn't understand why I didn't have credibility. I was just telling about my day. In my world I worked on a mini scooter with my uncle, and in the real world I didn't.\n\nBut that also means everyone could blame me. I was the official scapegoat for the next 7 years. This fucked me up hard now. I've grown some thick skin, but you call me a liar today or damage my credibility I will hurt you.\n\nIn high school I start spending all my time copying other people. Like way of walking, talking, dressing, interests. I do sports, all in different areas to test new shit. I develop shallow relationship with people without actually getting to know them, nor they me. I now work socially, but I'm miserable and flunking classes.  I repeat, I work socially. Meaning I spend most of my awake time analyzing how I've behaved that day, who I've interacted with and how they reacted, what I could've done better, run simulations on other behavioural patterns and situations etc. Suddenly I have this never-ending rabbit hole taking me to Walter Mitty station 1st class. It's given me this fake form of ADD I can't shake. I now automatically space out into this analyzing mode unless there is something to grab my attention and hold on it. I can't do homework, I can't do simple tasks because they're boring. I find myself an hour into doing dishes, still on the first plate because I'm somewhere else.\n\nI did understand how predictable and manipulative people are though. I became really fucking good at social engineering. Oh right, my *super power*? I have a hard on for details. You have this pattern of doing x, and then one day you do y? I notice it. Or actually, I obsess over it. I can't sleep until I understand how the puzzle make a picture. You leave school going west, and now suddenly you've been edgy for 2 weeks and start going east? Divorced parents? (My friends parents had just divorced, so it was the first recent association that made sense). She jabbed at me 5 days later and I fucking burned her world down. She was so ashamed and hadn't told anyone. She was 11, and I had no perspective on retaliating with something equal. I instantly pushed the red button. In High School I learned to do it properly though. I understood it more. The coolest kid in school cheats on his girlfriend? Easiest rumours of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hate it. Most of the time I wish I was never born and the rest of the time I want to kill myself. If not for my wife. She saved me. I'm progressing every day but holy fuck I'm tired. If not for her I'd be everywhere but here. I don't wanna romantize suicide ever, but I so so long for the silence. My mind is a constant noise. It never sleeps. I'm so tired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of it I feel so dehumanized. I'm so *different.* I feel so much more like a robot than a human because I need to be present at every fucking decision I make in every social setting. If I let my auto-pilot go I wake up to a complete mess of weird shit I've said.\n\nAnd it's so lonely. I feel so so alone. I have these interests and intricate types of humor than no one can follow because I'm just not like that. I have internal humor with myself no one understands. I am *weird*. I have these interests where HEY that one car we just passed had one rim that didn't match, DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT? No, of course they didn't see that, why in the world would anyone notice that? IT'S A SPINNING RIM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut hey, I was top 10 overall in these national tests in 6th grade. Worth.\n\nThis felt good to type. Thanks for the thread.",

I understand your frustration, because I've had people ignorant of mental health issues also think they're an advantage. Yes, anxiety can be an advantage in very specific circumstances. The hyperawareness it brings can help a person anticipate danger more quickly than most, & in many cases, see danger that everyone misses. In itself, that can seem like a superpower to those who haven't experienced it, but they're completely ignoring the number of days where that hyperawareness & constant fight or fight leaves one completely crippled & unable to complete even the most ordinary tasks. In that condition, something as simple as making a sandwich can be too much.\n\nVirtually everything in life, even the bad things, have pros and cons. I'm guessing those people are only seeing the pros & either choosing to ignore the cons, or they simply don't see them. It can be incredibly annoying at best.\n\nI have a friend who insists I can control my mental health issues if I just try harder, be more disciplined, & focus more. He doesn't seem to get that my brain is literally malfunctioning. I've tried to get him to understand it's no different than a failing pancreas causing diabetes, a condition he suffers with. If mental illness (which is simply defects in the brain) can be solved by trying harder, why isn't his diabetes cured by just trying harder.\n\nUnfortunately, people who don't have these conditions have no idea how difficult it makes life. That I'm a somewhat functional member of society is nothing short of a miracle & a testament to my stubbornness & desire to be better. I very much wish those people with the unicorns & rainbows mentality understood that their optimism is not only not helpful but is actually hurtful. I'll bet neurotypical people wouldn't last a month if there were some magical way to make them neurodivergent, just so they can walk in our shoes for a bit.\n\nAll that said, as debilitating & difficult as these various disorders & ailments can be, I'd still keep mine, even if I could be cured tomorrow.

            "I\u2019m in a similar situation. Diagnosed with autism in the\u2026 9th or 10th grade, only had the proper support structures that I needed through elementary school and the first half of middle school. After that I started falling off hard because stuff was going too fast for me. \n\n\nMath classes for instance, we\u2019d spend at most two weeks familiarizing ourselves with mew concepts that we\u2019re then supposed to just memorize perfectly for the rest of the time we\u2019re in school. That was too damn little time for me. I never properly learned how to do research while in school. I can barely write essays yet in my senior year I was put into this advanced college level class or some other crap because the teacher saw that I had good grades or something. All we did was write essays. Barely passed with a 74.\n\nNow I\u2019m 23 and don\u2019t have the skills I so desperately need because through out middle and high school I didn\u2019t get the right help I needed. I wasn\u2019t taught and guided through the things I most needed assistance with. Now I\u2019m dumb, useless to everyone, and a genuine drain on resources. I can barely self-advocate and I struggle to put to words my thoughts. \n\nI\u2019m mad as hell at my schools and the people that ran then. I\u2019m mad at the people who were part of the special education programs because they barely did fuck-all for me and then pat themselves on the back for a job well done. All I really got for the most part was a free period where they told me \u201cdo your work\u201d and that was about it.\n\n\nEdit: To add further, I\u2019ve got trust issues now because I spent so much of my time growing up trying to get people to listen to me about my complaints and yet no one would ever listen to me. I was often blamed for shit I didn\u2019t do and never would do and usually I would end up punished for shit others have done. Because no one would listen to me. It\u2019s no wonder why I have such a hard time opening up to people face to face; I already know that no one gives a fuck what I have to say. I could probably say damn near anything and no one would care, unless if what I say is something really messed up like, I don\u2019t know, \u201cI kick puppies.\u201d If I were to say something like that or worse suddenly I\u2019d have everyone within earshot on me like a pack of rabid wolves. But I say anything about how I\u2019d like some help with something or that I don\u2019t understand something? Silence.\n\nJust thinking about all this is making my blood boil.",

Give the poor little fuckers some realistic goals. Give them a framework for setting and achieving their own. But above all, I think maybe instead of \"You Can Be Anything\" we should be telling them that They Are Already Something, and maybe also that You Are Not Your Job.

I sent the following email to their site:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear XxxxxXxxx;\n\n I like your site and have purchased items for my sons.  I have 4.  So, I must tell you that I\u2019m disappointed you\u2019re selling the product in the attached image.  \n \n\n\\[link to image of onesie with \"I make boys cry\" text\\]  \n\n\nDoes XxxxxXxxx believe that because it\u2019s directed at boys, the message on the shirt is harmless?   Because this is the message you are promoting by selling this products on your site.   Yes, it does convey a negative message that it\u2019s ok to hurt a boy.   A boy is a child.  \n\n\nI get that it\u2019s meant to be light-hearted fun.   My concern is that as adults we may laugh, but think of a small boy reading it.   As this is an infant jumpsuit there is a possibility that an older sibling could read it or perhaps a child at a daycare center.  \n \n\nAnd shirt sends a couple of loud messages:  \na.      It\u2019s not ok for boys to cry.  \nb.      It\u2019s ok for girls to make boys cry.  \n \n\nMy guess is that in the current culture of \u201cgirl power\u201d this t-shirt is very popular.

I very much support opportunities for girls and women to excel.  \n \n\nLet me ask you this \u2013 as you think this product is appropriate to sell, why are you not also selling a blue t-shirt that reads \u201cI make girls cry.\u201d \n\nRespectfully,\n\nDamndame\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI received a response that blew me away.

            "I agree and disagree at the same time. We still live in a society where my daughter, who graduated high school in 2016, was told she shouldn't think she could succeed in sports because she isn't a boy by the staff, teachers, and many parents. Literally told \"you don't deserve this scholarship because you're a girl\" and \"don't expect any support from us. We have boys who deserve it more\". Another favorite crap comment was \"if you were a boy, we could celebrate your state championship but you're *not*\". Was told anytime she spoke about her passions or successes in her sport to \"stop bragging\". *She couldn't even discuss her success*. As long as she stayed in the shadows, she was treated as a \"nice girl\", \"she's sweet\"...The whole experience was maddening when compared to how less capable male athletes were  treated. Fortunately she was self-aware enough to know it was B.S. but, still, at times, her confidence was shaken. This is where that \"girls are powerful\" mind set actually means something. \n\nOn the other side of this, all that stuff ( importance of personal success, physically and mentally, confidence, self-awareness ) should truly be what you practice in your home for all your children not just printed on a shirt or button. Those shirts are meaningless if there's no practicing the tenents. We should want all our children to have the tools to work toward their better selves. To know they are valued. ",

I recently lost my mind over in Prague cause my husband and I found a metal shop and they had a section of girlie shirt and I found a Dark Funeral shirt.  There were tons in men\u2019s, but only one in the women\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019m grateful many shirt printing sites tend to print any design in male and female body style, but it always sucks when I go to a concert and if there are any girlie shirts they almost never have the tour dates on the back.\n\nI\u2019m 27, but when I was in pre-school I remember trying to play with the dinosaurs cause I\u2019ve loved them as long as I can remember.  The boys told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to cause I was a girl.  My parents immediately ran out and got me the same dinosaur toy cause they didn\u2019t want me to feel like I wasn\u2019t allowed to do something just because I\u2019m female.  I never liked the color pink, Barbies, baby dolls, etc. so my clothing options as a child really sucked.\n\nI think they still suck now for kids, both boys and girls and I mostly blame parents who want to force their kids into gender rolls.  For example, I was at Disney World and some little boy wanted the purple lightsaber and his mom told him \u201cno, pick another color, that\u2019s for girls.\u201d  This pissed me off on multiple levels (any Star Wars fan will understand), but I didn\u2019t want to lose my annual pass flipping out on a lady.",

            "I agree with you in theory, but where I am (metro Boston), the old graveyards are some of the most beautiful open spaces we have. I love walking through them. If you re-zoned them, we'd just end up with more condos, CVSes, and Dunkin Donuts.",
            "I notice a lot of the people on the anti-cemetery side in the comments are talking about what they'd want for their own bodies after they die. I used to feel like that... I don't really care what happens to my body after I die... I'm not using it anymore. So it was easier for me to have opinions like cemeteries being a waste of space, not wanting my family to spend the money, etc. \n\nThen my son died when he was 3 years old, and I buried him. I'm not religious at all, so I just did what I felt like I needed to do at that time and that was what felt right to me. It's such a personal thing... everyone is different, but it would have been really hard for me to have his body cremated. The cemetery where he's buried is really beautiful and I visit often. I'm grateful to have this place where I can go to be alone and think about him.\n\nSo my opinion now with respect to my own body is that if there are people who will grieve when I die, they can do whatever they feel like they need to do with my body.",
            "Let's be honest, given the free space, they'd all be turned into condos.

For example, I'd bet my left nut that my home town would put up another fucking hotel on every cemetery, given the chance. So you've got a great practice, in theory, I just don't think the money hungry world we live in would use that space to improve anything but their wallet size.\n\nNot all towns/cities, but I stand by the majority\n\nAs a side note, being buried is a scam anyway. Most all of those caskets break once buried. And even if they make it past the dirt being tamped down they still disentigrate and are destroyed shortly after. The whole burial thing is about nothing but money, anymore\n\nEdit: yes, I understand a select few like hanging out in cemeteries. My partner and I are a few of those people.

            "I don't see an issue with burying people who want that but I don't understand why pumping them full of chemicals and putting them in fancy boxes is necessary. Corpses don't need to look pretty, they're dead, who are they supposed to impress down there? No amount of formaldehyde and makeup will stop them from rotting, trying to resist the natural order of things is an exercise in futility.",

Not a pleasant thought. \n\nCremation is nice because you\u2019re not decaying, and your family members can keep you close. My only issue with it is that, though- your relatives are responsible for your body forever. If your urn breaks, it\u2019ll be like losing you all over again.

Cremation on the other hand is more \"modern\" and actually very harmful to the Earth. Graveyards may seem to be a waste of space but by comparison they're actually better for the Earth and serve a higher, more spiritual purpose.

The people willing to figure out their opposition and try to change their minds. The people who have empathy for things like how someone was raised and who they are surrounded by. This mentality is so isolating and pretty much ensures that your movement will never grow. 'It's exhausting talking to people who don't agree with me.' Welp, radically changing society is hard work. If someone is willing to talk to you or asking you questions, to shame them and then deny them answers is lazy and will hurt your movement in the long run.",

            "I strongly disagree. There are a ton of situations where apathy is unacceptable and straight up harmful. \n\nTake climate change for instance. We're at a precipice where we can choose to address climate change, or we can just accept that the age of humans is over because we've killed ourselves. In the respect of wanting human life to continue for another thousand years, we have to take climate change very seriously. Apathy in the face of climate change is the same as saying \"I'm okay with the destruction of all human life\", and that is *not okay*. \n\nTake police brutality as another example. Incarceration rates. The extreme transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the elite. The blatant corruption in our government. Etc. Etc. Etc.\n\nThere's a million topics that are actively harmful to not pick a side on. Those topics all have a right and a wrong side. You can either be on the right side of history, or you can support the murder of innocent people. Apathy is supporting murder. \n\nIf you don't know, then that's cool. Learn more, take your time, but be active about it. Don't just sit on your hands and cry at the table because you don't know what to believe. You're an adult, and you should act like one.",
            "I think there are some statements where this is true, though.\n\nFor instance (this is a ridiculous example but it\u2019s to articulate a point) suppose there are two people, one of which is anti - human. That is, they are a person who is attempting to bring an end to the human race. \n\nPerson 2 decides they are apathetic to the entire situation. They don\u2019t care if humanity lives or dies. \n\nWhat happens is that apathetic person refusal to act on either side is essentially supporting those with strong desires to kill the human race, because their refusal to act against something blatantly wrong is the same as allowing it to exist and acknowledging it\u2019s right to .\n\nThere are a great many issues that  this is the case. Acting indifferent towards racism is the same as acknowledging it\u2019s right to exist, acting indifferent towards child smartphone usage, ignoring underage drinking, the list goes on and on. \n\nPeople use indifference as a way to run away, but that\u2019s not what it is. We need to look at our issues head on and make decisions, as making active decisions that are incorrect is far better than making passive ones that result in similar situations by accident. Using indifference to run away is pointless and generally an all around bad decision. \n\nHOWEVER, I do agree you shouldn\u2019t make decisions if you think you lack the knowledge. Not making a decision at this moment is different then making the decision not do decide. People that pressure others into making abrupt decisions when you don\u2019t fully understand or comprehend the issues at play are awful, and in fact, most of the time when these phrases are used people use them for this end goal which is all in all irresponsible. \n\nSo TLDR; this IS the case, but people use these terms irresponsibly to manipulate others which is incorrect as you say",

            "This isn't unpopular, but I agree. r/AmItheAsshole is also a good example. People will insult you if you have a different opinion. \n\nFor example, there was a post about someone buying a 1952 telecaster guitar (so a very early model) from someone who was selling his deceased dead's stuff for crazy cheap like 4000 dollars, while vintage guitars are worth way more than that. His wife then said to the seller (his colleague) that his husband said that the guitar was worth way more than that; he asked if he could get it back and she said that her husband probably would not have given it back. He got very angry and verbally harassed her and him. He asked if he was the asshole\n\nSome people (me included) said that he wasn't an asshole, but the good majority said he was \"because he took advantage of him\", and the people that called him an asshole commented under the people that said that he wasn't the asshole's comments that, and defended their opinion with insults and rudeness. (do your research before selling an item tho)\n\nI just think that some people feel superior to others and so they do this shit.",
            "I'm going to agree and disagree with you. \n\nYour completely right that a lot of the policial subs are extremely toxic when confronted with clashing ideas. Having a political sub/post/conversation that responds toxically by banning and mass dog-piling with downvotes is a toxic safe space that promotes groupthink and radicalization. In a perfect world/sub there would be honest conversation about topics and people can debate and discuss their opinions healthily. On that topic though, there are plenty of people on both sides of whatever sub (the in-group and the outsiders) that toxically interject and start arguments in bad faith. \n\nI think Reddit is somewhat justified in banning and muting people that are creating discourse in the sub though. A sub devoted to being positive is supposed to be that, and allowing people to be negative ruins the premise of it. Having people constantly call out and spam political/news subs with \"edgy hot takes\" that are only said to clash with the sub also detracts from conversations. There's a very blurry line between honest discussion and bad faith arguments sometimes, and it can be hard to tell between the two. Subs like r/politics should re-lable themselves as an American, heavily left leaning, political sub since it isn't really a place to discuss any conservative views. I think it's bad that the space is devoted to that, and would like to see the mods promote a more diverse opinion pool for people to discuss things without bashing each other, but people will congregate and circle-jerk each other regardless of the supposed goal of the chatboard.",
            "It's even worse than that: I had a previous Reddit account that got \"shadowed\". It means that, if I log with this account, everything is normal but nobody see what I'm posting. I was wondering why nobody answered me until someone on Twitter told me he was not seeing my post.\n\nThis is even worse than being banned.\n\nBut, the worse is that I never received any warning, I never had any explanation (nor could I know who to ask for an explanation). I had never been into an argument.\n\nTo this day, I still don't know. Someone told me it was because I posted a link to my own blog in a sub that doesn't accept that but that's only a theory.

It is highly hypocritical when they put their corporate thumb on the scale to suppress the unpopular. But, then again, the entire \"cancel culture\" cancer is hypocritical to the core.

Due to a head injury when I was 40, I started having seizures. after 2 years, and 5 different types of anti seizure medication i was still having serious seizures. Had to be put on a ventilator 3x and went into a coma 2x. At work one day I was feeling bad and a friend, who had been bugging me for months to try it, convinced me too cause I could feel it coming on. I took a few hits and it blew me away, stopped it almost immediately. Smoking pot again at age 40, I felt embarrassed and hid the fact that I did as I could've got fired even if I didn't smoke it at work because you'll fail a drug test even if you haven't smoked it in a week. You can have your opinion, but its narrow minded and wrong. I didn't believe it would help me, but its been great for me. Do you know that they have pot made especially for seizure patients, it won't get you high. It was developed specifically for a young girl who was having several seizures a day and worked great, all but stopping them. I understand some people will never believe it works for many health issues, but it does. I truly hope you never have to find out, because it means your having some kind of healrh problem. Its been a blessing for me. I would disagree with you opinion that most people just smoke it to get high and blame it on a medical problem so they won't be judged. Personally most people who smoke it don't give a damn what people think now days. Its legal so really no reason to lie why your smoking it. If they say its for a health problem, then it probably is.

If you've smoked weed for a long time you're definitely aware of what some of the negative side effects can be. If you don't want to admit that you're lying to yourself. The effects of marijuana are different for everyone, but to say it's this perfect and amazing miracle drug is simply false. Can it help people with severe medical conditions deal with symptoms?

            "As someone who doesn't smoke and who's worked extensively in the medical cannabis field at both the front line and corporate levels, I can tell you that you're incorrect, at least given my own experience.\n\nYes, there are plenty of people who only want to smoke to get high, but I think you're forgetting about the much bigger piece of the puzzle which is that legalization opens doors for research with Cannabis that have been closed at the federal level since the prohibition on the 1900's.  Using cannabinoids in cancer and Parkinson research, treatment for epilepsy, a natural, non liver damaging option for people who suffer from migraines and loss of appetite.  All of these things end up being a reality with legalization.\n\nAdditionally, and you can see this, as states legalize, the amount of people who jump at the chance to finally purchase CBD products that don't offer psychoactive effects is on a dramatic rise and has been ever since Colorado first legalized.  The market for CBD is huge, and has nothing to do with getting high, and the market for those products is only gaining momentum.\n\nLegal sale of cannabis is not staggeringly profitable like it was in the black or even the grey market when you take into account licensing fees, taxation, packaging, marketing, etc, so from a business perspective, people aren't getting into this to get rich quick, and as for the consumers, well, I can tell you that, from my own experience, I've spoken to far more people who are using cannabis to relieve some sort of pain or medical condition than I have people who just want to get stoned, especially as legalization has started happening.  Yes, those people exist, but they aren't the majority, and they're also not the ones doing any real fighting for legalization.\n\nSource;  I've worked in the industry for 8 years, Director of Ops for one of the largest delivery services in Los Angeles, as well as Director of Technology and Ops for statewide distribution of cannabis in California.",

I agree with you that *most* people smoke just to get high, but some of us, especially those with unseen illness actually use it to help ourselves. If you smoke just to act stupid, you're smoking for the wrong reasons. Anything can be misused, opioids and other prescription medications  get misused all the time. But statistically, marijuana has been shown to help people with an abundance of health conditions (mental and physical) and it seems to do the job well. However, if someone becomes addicted to it after they no longer need it, it's the same basis as if they got addicted to hydrocodone or something like that, and they would need to seek help if it was deterring them from fulfilling responsibilities. Although weed is shown to be not as addictive, I think we've proven as humans that we can be addicted to anything. Now, that being said, if people DO want to use it for solely recreational purposes you should hopefully do so responsibly. And in that context, how different is it from alcohol or cigarettes?

            "I DO smoke weed each night so I can actually fall asleep haha, not a justification to avoid judgement.",
            "They also don't care about the *negative* health impacts. I went into medical school thinking weed was healthier than smoking cigarettes or drinking... Multiple respiratory physicians have since lectured me on it, as well as 2 or 3 psychiatrists, and one marijuana research scientist.\n\nLong story short, 1 bong hit is equal to between, 5-100 cigarettes, depending on the research paper (here's one of them that says '1-50', depending on the substance [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3215592/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3215592/)), chronic use reduces memory, reduces IQ, reduces educational outcomes, increases the likelihood of dropping out of school, and negatively affects brain development, which is why late teens/early twenties individuals who smoke a lot of weed are more likely to develop schizophrenia (here's another source - one of many [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4827335/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4827335/)).\n\nIn medicine, treatment is about risk vs benefit analysis. Ironically, while marijuana can precipitate schizophrenia, it's being researched as a treatment (NOT a cure...) it in patients with schizophrenia. It can reduce inflammation and inflammatory pain, but it can also cause chronic bronchitis, which is literally an near-persistant inflammatory state in the lungs that leads to serious health issues and even death, once it progresses. You need to think, will the side-effects and long term issues associated with using a particular drug cause more issues than we're correcting? The current research says, for marijuana use in HEALTHY individuals without any ailments that smoke 'because it's fun', the answer is a resounding **yes.** But I mean, if drinking alcohol is legal, and smoking cigarette are legal, then why can't marijuana be legal? I guess that's the big question...."

The creation of this outer crust locks moisture in.  If you heat some food slowly, you allow more time for internal water to migrate to the surface, and this both a) dries the food out, and b) prevents a nice crust or browning.

            "As a chef I have to both agree and disagree, stuff like frozen pizzas and premade meals for sure! Throw that shit in with a few extra minutes and bam, just as good. But as others are saying, any baking of pastries NEED a preheated oven. Its finicky enough with it! Also braised items that go from pan frying into a sauce in the oven, it's fairly essential to have a preheated oven, otherwise the meat starts to cool a bit before heating back up, resulting in a usually tougher product, even if braised longer!",
            "Most of the time when directions call for preheating it's about consistency. Your oven takes time to heat up to the correct temperature, but it's not always the same amount of time. Holding the same temperature for an extended period of time is easier and ensures that the food cooks evenly and thoughouly. \n\nAn analogy would be trying to get your car to a specific speed, say 60 mph and stay there. If you hit the gas from a stop it would try to accelerate as fast as possible to get to 60, but each time would be different sometimes it would take 7 seconds, sometimes 10. You would often overshoot your target speed and have to slow down, but once you are at 60 it's a lot easier to hold it there for a long period of time with little variation.\n\nSo if you don't preheating your oven, the food will still cook, but you are more likely to overcook or undercook your food.

            "The reason you preheat is because until your oven reaches the set temp, the bottom burner or element is on full blast for most ovens. After it reaches temp the burner comes on intermittently and doesn't go all Satan's dick (red hot). That means anything put in right away will cook faster on the bottom.  Knowing this allows you to make the decision of what can go in and what needs to wait. Pizza needs the crust to cook faster so it's perfectly fine to go in immediately. A delicate pastry, you gotta wait. Cake needs to cook evenly, gotta wait. \nPro-tip; get a baking stone. The stone provides some insulation against that glowing element/ burner. Now some items can go in earlier without the bottom browning to quickly. ",
            "Er... no?? Preheating an oven is pretty important, especially when dealing with desserts/pastries. Like, I don't do frozen pizza, but I imagine it's hard to mess that up (without trying anyway), but for actual cooking, please preheat your oven!",

Probably doable inside a single afternoon with the right equipment. Rinse and repeat at the other location with the other half of their ashes.

It's a fucking racket. The only person close to me to pass away so far in my life was my grandfather, and having a wake/viewing/burial was so fucking expensive that our family ended up having a huge blowout about it and we've never been the same. In the end we just mourned our own way, privately, and while it was enough for me, it never sat well with my mom. She's always regretted not having the closure of celebrating him in a traditional way.\n\nI'm personally of the opinion that when I'm dead, it's a done deal. Do whatever you'd like with me. Shove me in a box, stick some animatronics and me and parade me around town, throw me off a cliff, who cares? If they want to throw a funeral for me, who the fuck am I to say otherwise? Hell, if I have any say over it, I want to leave them some money so that can have a funeral, or a cremation, or one single epic night at a restaurant/bar, whatever they want to do.\n\nThis really comes off as less of a thoughtful examination of the commercialization and desensitization of the funeral industry or grieving process, and more like an overly edgy, self-pitying temper tantrum about the lack of control you'll have after you die.

I wasn't fucking gawking you prick, I was sharing in their pain. \n\nThat day in the crematorium meant infinitely more than \"smoking a bowl\" and going about my day.

If you donate your body to science you better link up with people who know what they are doing and aren't a scam. They can deny the body for donation even if papers have been signed and agreed upon.

Yes, of course having a degree in Finance will help you get a job in Finance, for example.  Having that baseline knowledge will make it easier to train you in whatever you are going to do.  But degree requirements are really there to solve the massive information processing problem that an employer has to solve when hiring for a job when there are hundreds or thousands of applications.  \n\nImagine you are hiring for a job that requires even a modicum of prior specialized knowledge or skill.  Maybe you get 100 applicants, to use a relatively low number.  On first glance, it could look like basically every candidate is at least somewhat qualified for the job.  Do you read every word of every CV/resume, every mission statement, personal statement, etc?  Do you check every reference and previous employer?  \n\nEven with a handful of people to work on this with you, checking every last detail of every candidate to see if they have that special something you are looking for would be enormously wasteful timewise.  So, what do you instead?  You impose a simple, easy to verify requirement that almost any good candidate would satisfy, and you cut the rest.  Hence, degree requirement.\n\nThis can go further.  You impose a degree requirement and you still have 40 candidates.  So you ask for experience, 2 years +.  Easy to verify and clearly makes the average remaining candidate better.  Now you have 25 candidates.  Then you say that they must have some training or certification in some skill or software or something you use.  Easy to verify and the average candidate gets even better.  Etc, until you get a small enough list of people that you can really dig into the specifics and find the right one.  Maybe now you have 10 that you can really focus on.  \n\nObviously, *sometimes* these requirements eliminate good candidates, but *on average* they leave you with a pool of more desirable candidates so that you can look into them in more detail.  \n\nSource: Have experience as a candidate and on search committees in the job market for PhD economists.",

However, this can go too far and it allows for people to become abusive *while thinking they are completely in the right*. That's an incredibly dangerous thing.\n\n\nMy ex was one of these people. She cared deeply about fixing social issues and because of that she felt it was fine to steamroll everyone she knew and cared about because their discomfort was worth the change she was pushing. To an extent, I even agree with that. She was way too hypocritical though. Eventually she became dead to my feelings. If she hurt me, I did something to deserve it, or I was overreacting out of fragility and needed to \"get a grip\". She was never willing to admit wrong, and my views were always tainted because I was a guy.\n\n\nI spent way too long in that relationship hating myself because I respected her efforts for change. It wasn't until I sought therapy that I realized how hurtful she was being. Eventually I came to the conclusion that believing the same things she did didn't give her a pass to treat people awfully. So yeah, sometimes the most outwardly caring and seemingly empathetic people can be the most abusive ones in your life.\n\n\nEdit: there's nothing wrong with caring about or trying to fix social issues.

            "This has less to do with being \"woke\" and more to do with a person who used \"wokeness\" to justify her abuse. Being shitty to people who are not being malicious in their intent is not a good way to get people to change, if that's the goal. For instance, when I was younger I had a friend who used to call things gay when he didn't like something. So I laughed and told him he shouldn't say that because people that are gay probably wouldn't like that. He said its fine, when he said that something is gay it had nothing to do with actually being gay it was just a word he used. I explained to him that he was using the word gay as a stand in for stupid or bad and he probably wouldn't like if people said that's so Chris (his name) as a stand in for stupid. He said \"huh, you know I had never thought of it like that. I'll stop saying it now.\" \n\nThe thing is he wasn't doing it maliciously. Most people don't do things maliciously, but \"woke culture\" often times treats folks like bad people for something they say or do when they're not. They're just normal people like you and me who have been exposed to different experiences or taught different things. Your ex sounds like she was abusive to you, but deep down you say she cared deeply about doing what was right by people. Unfortunately she ended up alienating you and I'm sure others because she did not give folks the respect she should have.

The one who was extremely woke flat out told me that I need to get over it because I was privileged. That there were Black women in Africa that have 3 kids that have to deal with this. That I was rich and could deal with it... my parents are wealthy but my dad is an alcoholic and my mom is a workaholic. When my dad found out about it, he literally told me that I \"should have kept my legs closed.\"\n\nAnother friend got jealous and slept with the guy, but that's it's own mess that isn't as related, but looking back it's both funny and just... Ugh.\n\nUnfortunately, I went to the same college as the woke friend. He was pretty awful to me there. He always talked about using me as \"bait\" to get straight guys he thought were hot to talk to... I'd offer to pay for his food because he was from a low income family, and I felt guilty over my parents' wealth... \n\nIt got so bad that the school decided to put a no-contact order on woke dude. I didn't ask, they came to me and said \"we think it would be best for you.\" Anyways, woke dude went on to become the head of the LGBTQ+ club and cause a ton of drama there I guess. Also, he called someone's girlfriend a \"fat bitch\" on Twitter cause he wanted that someone, or so I was told...\n\nNow he works with kids in 4-H and I hope that those kids are okay. I hope he doesn't treat them as poorly as he treated me.\n\nSide note- apparently sometime after the school put the no-contact order in place, he apparently came out as non-binary/genderqueer/something else.

Fine, white, clean sand isn't so bad.  Crunchy, brown sand is awful. A fresh ocean breeze is awesome.  30 mph blow your sunglasses off is not.  I don't know what beaches you've seen but I hope you'll keep an open mind in case you ever happen upon one of the great ones.",

Sure, it's \"better than being there,\" because a lot is, but still. I hate either getting sunburned or wearing sunscreen. Not a fan of either, but you gotta pick one. I hate sand getting everywhere. I hate how my skin feels after getting out of salt water. I hate the crowds. A desolate beach might actually be relaxing, I guess, but I've never been to one. It's *hot*. The beach is for the birds.\n\nThat said, I do enjoy being outdoors. I love hiking. I love camping. I love driving a convertible. And all of those also require sunscreen, but not nearly as much, so it's alright. And camping dirt? I don't know. It's different from sand somehow. I really just don't like the beach.\n\nOh, and my screen name means \"Seize the Snow\" intended in the same way as Carpe Diem, meaning, if there's fresh powder, grab your snowboard and get out there. That can also require sunscreen, and dealing with crowds, and uncomfortable temperatures, but it's all worth it! First, you barely need any sunscreen, just your face. Second, the crowds dissipate as soon as you get to the top of the mountain, so you only have to deal with them at the bottom. Third, cold can be combated with better clothing, but there's not much you can do for heat. There's only so much you can take off. And lastly, it's just *so. damn. fun.* that every inconvenience is excused. Beaches don't even offer that. What people seem to enjoy most at the beach is doing nothing. That's just not for me. I can do nothing at home.\n\nAnyway, just didn't want to sound like too much an indoor curmudgeon-ey troll. ;-)",

            "I like the beach the more specifically I like swimming in the ocean that's what I find relaxing and beautiful seeing all the shells. I would say that the beach is a bad place to relax and sit down but it's a good place to actively play and mess around in the sand",
            "beach episode of amine is the only thing good I associate with the beach",
            "Fuck sand.",
            "Every time I try to eat on the beach I just end up eating sand I swear! Ugh!",
            "Hy. Hot as hell with no shade from the sun, dirty water, sand everywhere, kids screaming, no parking, and your swimsuit keeps riding up your asshole. Shits crazy",
            "What really gets me about the beach is how dehydrated you get. Maybe it\u2019s because I go in the ocean for too long, but my god it really hits you",
            "Realist shit I\u2019ve seen all day",
            "Agreed. I've never really enjoyed the beach and I have lived within 30 minutes of it my entire life (I live less than 10 min from it right now). I don't like swimming when I can't see (the water is brown here). I am pale asf and burn within 5 minutes. Then sand gets everywhere when I leave. It's not so bad if I go to a part that allows me to put a popup tent and sit in the shade, but I've never been a fan.\n\nThat being said, I did visit Hawaii once and enjoyed sitting on the rocks on the shore, or on a clifftop and watching the waves. THAT was wonderful. Flat beaches with nothing but sand and water...not so much.",
            "I miss the beach so much.  It was way better than I ever dreamed of last summer.",
            "Nah man, you can make the beach relaxing, as you pictured. Just takes the right spot and the proper perspective.",
            "I only go to the beach to surf. Also, it\u2019s way better when it\u2019s empty. People suck sometimes",
            "*Insert r/prequelmemes joke here* Sometimes this site really is a broken record, I mean...",
            "Wait- you guys get SUN at your beaches?! (Oregon coast barely does)",
            "Kind of true. But for me it's more like not being able to live there every day is what makes it less fun. It's a production to go, you have to worry about the sun, sometimes crowds depending where you are, if there are public restrooms, etc. If you lived beside it it would be FAR more relaxing.",
            "I enjoy the act of travel more than any destination, especially by night.\n\nEdit: night time",
            "I agree when it is the beach at home, but I like going to all inclusives."
