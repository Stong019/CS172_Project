            "And you would actually trust they could keep the system running for another 60 years or so? With my luck, they would load me into the matrix and the system would throw an error and have to be rebooted.",
            "Is this the new matrix?",
            "Ha ha, no.  I used to work in IT.  I'd look at that simulation, imagine that people like me are in charge of making that system go, and nope the hell out of there.",
            "I just turned 39 and 40 is frighteningly close.  I am no where near ready for retirement, even if it's some elysian version of the Matrix.  I still have so much to do in the real world!  \n\nMy jury-rigged excuse for a career is beginning to stabilize and become more interesting.  I think I might finally be able to start the house buying process this spring/summer.   If the house thing works out, I'm getting a dog next.  I'm even considering working towards developing a social life this year.  ^(I'd like to go on a date some day.)\n\nI feel like I'm just beginning to accept adulthood.  40 seems way too early to vanish from society, even under the most ideal circumstances.",
            "Who'd bring up the kids that you have when you're 30?\n\nHey little Timmy I know you're looking forward to your tenth birthday but guess what? Daddy's going to the farm to live in a jar. Sorry no more playing catch.",
            "You'd have to define \"kept alive\" here.  Like, brain floating in a jar hooked up to the system?  I'm interested.  Some dodgy \"uploading your consciousness\" thing? Nope, that's just code for \"we're gonna kill you but a copy will exist in the sim\".  I'd still be just as dead, a copy of me having a great existence wouldn't benefit me at all.",
            "It depends on how long. If they artificially let me live until I'm 150 then I dont see why not.",
            "Curious how old OP is, and specifically how far away 40 is to their relative sense of life expectancy.",

            "The thing about this is that if it's a company that is selling this to you (as someone in a comment pointed out, if we're still in a capitalist society it'll surely be provided by a company that wants to sell their product) they do have a great reason for the simulation to be really good and to not do anything bad with your consciousness while you're in there,  and that would be money, of course. But simultaneously, how do you know that it isn't just a marketing strategy, and in reality they promise you that so you give them your cash, and throw you out in the crappiest simulation ever with PS2 graphics where you can't leave or communicate with the outside world to tell everyone that the product is a lie and they are literally killing people to make money, or even worse, never put you in a simulation in the first place and that's that for you. You're dead. No consciousness in USB drive or anything. AND they didn't even donate your liver, they sold it to some sketchy mafia underlord that lost his in a knife brawl or something.",

            "Fuck no.",
            "If I could die whenever I want then hell yeah! I mean why wouldn't you? It's the perfect worry free life sure it's not real but why should that matter? I already basically live in my own head this would just be a step up.",
            "What about friends and family? Am i just gone for them? If so...Fuck no, i can spend another 50 years with them",
            "By definition it wouldn't be worry free, because you're literally living on life support and have no way to influence whether that life support is maintained. Unless you allow people within the server to maintain their vote and access to media, but that leads to additional worries. Basically living is always going to have worries, it's just what they are varies from person to person",
            "At 40? So at least 13 years of my life spent in school, leaves me 27 years to do whatever, no, thanks.\n\n0-5 Do whatever\n\n5-18 School\n\n18 to 40 More school/ do whatever",

            "Nope because as much as it sucks, life is meant to be filled with ups and downs. If everything were to be perfect and worry-free it would get really old, really fast.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Why do I have to wait until I'm forty. Take me now.",
            "At 38, with no terminal diseases or major issues, I'd say \"I'm gonna let someone else try it out.\"\n\nThings that would make me more inclined to try it\n\n* Ability to test out the simulation before I give up my body.\n* Knowledge I can program the environment like a holodeck.  Can I go on epic fantasy adventures?  Can I sleep with AI versions of celebrities?\n* Knowledge of what the outside world culture is about the simulation.  Do people think it's cool that once you go to simulated heaven you can spend all day doing fuckabout while the real world generates power for you?\n* Can I still interact with the real world?  Can I interact with other people in the simulation?  Will my wife join me when she turns 40 and we can enjoy simulated life together?  etc etc\n\nOtherwise, highly skeptical.  For all I know it will run for 5 years, I will get an email saying: \"Sorry, but it turns out running the simulation isn't all that profitable, so we're going to be downsizing your experience.\"",
            "Depends on how long I could live this way. If at least 30 years, than yes. I would happily do this. My life sucks, I have no dreams, passions, goals or idea how to change it. Switching to simulated reality would be amazing.",
            "hmm pass, people in my family live to be 100 on average and are in great health up the very end.\n\nAnd gene therapy can't be too far off now, only reason they outlaw stem cell research and all that noise is it is WAY to easy to make a person functionally immortal and 20-30 for eternity.\n\nQuestion is how long until the brain fails... and that happens regardless of if your brain is in a jar, or in your head.",
            "No, seems horrible. No matter how perfect would the simulation be, the thought alone that none of this is real would make me go crazy. And I would never let my memory be erased to prevent it from happening."

            "During winter in a rural no cell service kind of area. Completely dark, no street lights nor anyone in sight. Temperatures were around 20 and it was snowing. \n\nI was walking my dog with a flashlight. Then I heard someone start screaming bloody murder.  Flight or fight kicked in; it truly sounded like someone was being stabbed to death for what seemed like forever. \n\nI chose to find out what the hell was going on. \n\nWhat I found instead was beyond anything I expected.  He was a 5 year old boy wandering down the road all alone. \nAll he was wearing were light flannel pants and a thin t-shirt. No shoes or hat. And screaming so loudly it echoed through the hills. \n\nI dropped my dogs leash and walked up to him slowly; gently and repeatedly telling him that I\u2019m a mom and that he\u2019s going to be ok. \n\nI wrapped him into my arms and carried him to a neighbors home to warm him by the fire and call for help.\n\nEdit: the boys parents were visiting friends. The boy got up at night to look for his parents (who\u2019d left him and his sister home) while they were out drinking. He got lost in the dark and just kept walking and screaming. \nOriginally thinking I\u2019d get in the crosshairs or witness some bloody domestic fight is what put my mind in the scared shitless head space.

            "Holy shit, I've got one for this!\n\nGrew up in Japan, not too small / not too big city. Worked a jobe that had me coming home daily at 2 - 4ish AM daily. I preferred to walk the backstreet that paralleled the main street home because it felt more cozy and peaceful. Nothing of note happened until *one day*...\n\nI turn the corner onto the side street and about halfway down there was a young woman. She wasn't doing anything, just staring at the sky. Staring straight up, *STRAIGHT up*, neck at a 90 degree angle, mouth slightly agape, long black hair hanging. I hesitated but decided that, since nothing weird has ever happened here before, it'd be fine, so I went to walk by. I get up next to her, it's a narrow road so not a lot of room to maneuver, and pause to look at her. She hasn't moved or reacted to me, she's just staring away. So I fight my instincts and ask her if she's okay. She doesn't react. I look up to see if she's looking at something but there's nothing there. So now I'm thinking there's something medical going on, so I reach out and touch her on the shoulder.\n\nShe jolts and and looks at me like she's just noticed me.

            "One time I was walking around my relatively safe neighborhood with two of my friends after midnight (we were probably 16 at the time). This loud red truck speeds by us, which is normal for the road we were on. Then a few minutes later the same red truck drives by the opposite way going much slower. Again just a couple of minutes later he drives by but this time stops a hundred or so feet away from us and just sits there. Realizing that this is not normal we booked it through the yard to the next street over. For the next 20 or so minutes we see this truck creeping up and down the neighborhood while we hid behind some bushes and when we finally thought he was gone, we booked it to my house. He turned the corner onto my road just as we were about to open my front door.",

Grew up in the countryside, where the nearest streetlight was 10 miles away, so I\u2019m comfortable in dark places, so much so that I often take my dog for a walk at around midnight just because I like the peace and quiet of the night. I live in a city now so something about the dark is just soothing to me.\n\nThat being said, one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever experienced, I genuinely have no explanation for. Living in a city I used to drive out 20-30 miles into the country to do some astrophotography. As I\u2019m driving out one night I see this guy walking at the side of the road with no lights, reflectors and a big backpack. Didn\u2019t think much of it other than it being a little odd. 5 miles later, I see the same guy walking again. I haven\u2019t changed directions, turned, and I\u2019ve been doing ~50mph. As I drove past he looked and waved at me. I was pretty spooked but I drove on. I must be imagining things. It can\u2019t be the same guy.\n\nI get to my field in the middle of nowhere, park up and get the camera out, and turn off all the lights so my eyes adjust to the dark. All is going well, and for 30 minutes I\u2019m content, and starting to relax.\n\nSuddenly I hear a rustling near the hedge by the road. Crunching leaves, grass being kicked. It was footsteps. I immediately get a feeling of dread, like I\u2019m in severe danger and something bad was going to happen. I grab my camera, toss it in the car, get in, lock the doors and turn on the headlights. When I turn out of the field. I pass where I heard the noise and saw fresh footprints in the mud but no sign of anyone.\n\nI race back home, driving double the speed limit, constantly checking my mirrors for anyone. I park up around the corner and wait in the car with the lights off for 30 minutes, watching. Nothing shows up, I get home, lock all the doors and sleep with a knife under my pillow that night.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what really happened that night but part of me knows that creepy guy I passed on the road twice was in that field.",

            "More backpacking than a \u201cwalk\u201d but this fucking terrifies me to this day. \n\nOur planned camping spot for the night was full, we\u2019d backpacked all day to get to that location and there wasn\u2019t anywhere close to set up our tents. We called our guy \u201con the outside\u201d to come pick us up as it was getting late, we didn\u2019t have anywhere to set up camp, and a storm was approaching. We hiked to the nearest exit point on the trail, met our pickup guy, and he drove us a few miles to the nearest campsite we were familiar with that we could basically drive up to. Long logging path pretty deep in the mountains that we had hiked to in previous years, so we were kinda familiar with the area. Anyways, we hop out of the van and it\u2019s pitch black out. No moon, it\u2019s April in the mountains and still pretty chilly. We\u2019re cold, hungry, and exhausted. That\u2019s when we notice this motherfucker staring at us from behind a tree. \n\nI know this sounds like a nosleep story but it\u2019s 100% true and probably the most scared I\u2019ve ever been. We notice this guy, no headlamp, no equipment, no backpack, just standing there. One of our group (former marine) yells at him to come out and explain what his deal is. This guy walks a few feet out from behind the tree and we all shine our lights on him, and I shit you not, this dude\u2019s white t shirt is covered in what looks like blood smears. He\u2019s pretty rough looking, long hair, long beard, crazy eyes, and he was wearing a (bloody?) t shirt and shorts in 35 degree weather at night. We\u2019re all pretty freaked out, and this is a pretty experienced group of hikers who\u2019ve seen some shit. We ask this guy what his deal is and he says we can\u2019t camp here. We tell him that that\u2019s exactly what we plan to do, and he says \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea for any of you.\u201d \n\nWe kind of turn to discuss as a group and when we look back he\u2019s hidden back behind the tree. As a group we basically decided none of us were getting any sleep that night if we stayed here, so we packed up the van and left. As we were pulling out, this guy pulled out one of those red-filtered flashlights and *ran* after our van. I\u2019m not kidding, he followed us for at least a quarter mile on foot. He was fast as fuck. We passed a park ranger on the road and flagged him down to tell him how weird that dude was acting, and he said he\u2019d go investigate. I didn\u2019t hear anything about it again for 5 years. \n\nFor the longest time I thought he was probably some pot farmer who had a nearby plot, or a moonshiner who was just living in the woods and didn\u2019t want us near his still. People hunt all the time out there, which would maybe explain the blood a little bit. \n\nBut I was recently at an event with some of those guys again for the first time in years and that creepy dude from the woods got brought up. One of them who still lives nearby broke out his phone and said \u201cI forgot to tell you guys, I saw him again.\u201d Pulls up a news article and there he was. So obviously the same guy. he\u2019d been arrested for murdering some poor girl on the trail. Timelines didn\u2019t match up, so I fully believe we saw this guy shortly after he\u2019d murdered someone else. He hasn\u2019t been charged with anything else as far as I\u2019m aware. I\u2019m not backpacking without a gun anymore.",
            "Many years ago my boyfriend and I decided to take a late night walk around his generally-safe neighborhood.\n\nWe got a few steps past the driveway when a shirtless guy came running over with a hammer in one hand, and a machete in the other. My boyfriend stayed super calm and asked the man what was going on. Apparently, some man had just broken into his apartment and tried to kidnap his young daughter, so he was chasing him down to either shatter his fingers with the hammer or chop off his hands entirely with the machete, and he thought my boyfriend was possibly this man.\n\nMy boyfriend gave me his car keys and told me to take myself home (we lived apart at the time) so I went and got his car and by the time I was backing out of the driveway, the man was screaming at my boyfriend, who was just standing there calmly with his hands in the air.\n\nI drove a block away so the man wouldn't see me, rolled the windows down to try to hear what was happening, and called the cops.

The moonlight would bounce of the water, & all you would hear is the trickle from the slow running river & slight breeze in the trees. I loved those walks. That was until the one night, in the dead silence & pitch black, I distinctly hear a mans voice out of the woods say very clearly: \u2018Young girls shouldn\u2019t go walking alone in the woods at night\u2019.

The blood was running down the stars on the sidewalk toward the street and a cop was just standing there all nonchalant as this dude cried into the lap of someone trying to comfort him. I wish I knew what happened to him, but when I tried looking it up, there were no reports of anything and they\u2019d just hosed off the sidewalk in the night for the morning tourists. It\u2019s like it never happened.\n\nAnother time, while walking home down Highland toward Santa Monica Blvd, I saw a guy pull a gun on one of the hookers that hung around the area and he ran away when he saw me watching. That hooker always said hi to me after that whenever I\u2019d see her on my night walks home.\n\nHollywood at night is a different city.",

            "I have been on many a night walk. Sometimes to clear my head or get a story idea straightened out, but in my youth I would sometimes have to walk about two hours home from work (yay food industry) \n\nIn my countless hours of walking through dark paths and empty streets I only ever got freaked out once. \n\nI was in the last mile or so of a long walk home after a 10 hour shift. I wanted nothing but to drop in bed and fall asleep with no alarm set. My neighbourhood had multiple paths through small wooded areas that you could use as short cuts. I'm walking through one of those and about ten feet into the woods I hear someone whisper 'Is that the guy?' \n\nI noped the fuck outta there with no shame, and ran the long (well lit) way home. \n\nCould it have been my mind playing tricks on me?

            "Walking the dog at night, when I got home, two shifty dudes was waiting outside my house.\n\nThey asked if Hayley was inside.\n\nI said there's no Hayley in my home. They pushed for more, giving me a description of this Hayley. I said no again, and offered to ask the local police or something since they weren't from the area.\n\nThey left, but not really, they waited in a car that didn't belong on my street.\n\nHayley was my next door neighbour's daughter. So I was pretty pissed off that my address was used for some reason, but I wasn't going to tell two random assholes where she lived either.\n\nI looked outside the window from upstairs in the dark, they were parked outside. Left after maybe 15mins. I was ready to call the police if they hung about longer. I called hayley's dad about it since he was on a taxi shift. He didn't know them. Next day, both Hayley and he can't over to ask about it. Hayley feigned ignorance, claiming she didn't know them either. \n\nThe matter didn't go as far as that but I was mildly on alert for a couple of weeks since then. This happened before covid lockdown. \n\nEdit:\n\nAdditional info/conjecture\n\n- I'm friendly with the neighbour, he is a taxi driver and fixes cars so he looks at my car if I have a problem. I take his parcels when he's not in.\n\n- I am NOT friendly with Hayley. She's in her twenties, and pretty and blonde. Im polite to her but feels like anything more would come across as creepy. I'm not connected to her socially or anything further than Facebook. \n\nRest is conjecture - judging by what I know of her- she's a party girl, she does live it up a bit. That's not an issue. \n\nShe did have an ex boyfriend who are now not together. They had a kid together. It was messy in so far as they used to have massive screaming matches right outside the house. He seems like an asshole. Turns up in either a van (a builder) or an expensive looking BMW. \n\nI knew her ex from school- he was younger than me but a few years and was a bit of a dick. \n\nSo either he did something or she did something and brought shit onto my doorstep. He could most possibly be a dealer, but I'm biased and this is just conjecture, I have no proof and I'm not friends with Hayley for her to actually tell me. \n\nThe general vibe was that she dodged a bullet. Not literally, but those guys definitely was looking for her and not for a nice friendly chat. \n\nAnd yeah, if she was the one messing around pissing off random dudes, giving a fake address which is next door to the real one sounds pretty dumb. I'm not on bad terms with her in any way, so I don't think she would've done something like that to mess with me.",

As we are just entering the field we see the shadow of a human figure stand up at the far end of the field. We just think it's our friend coming out to meet us until we see the shadow turn and look directly at us. It then just drops and starts sprinting on all fours directly at us. I mean faster than I've ever seen.  \n\nI'm shitting myself thinking I must be going crazy and I'm seeing things but my buddy grabs my arm and points telling me to run the fuck away. We both sprint out of the field and across the street as far and as fast as we can possibly go. To this day I have no idea what was chasing us or if I really saw it, but my buddy remembers the exact same details the exact same way. Don't think I can go into fields at night ever again.",

            "This one happened to me a few years ago when I was in my early 30s.\u00a0 I live in a Southern California coastal town near a major university but close enough to wilderness areas that encounters with skunks, possums, and raccoons are a daily/nightly part of life.\u00a0\n\nI  had a somewhat timid pitbull (a past housemate locked himself out of the house and had to break in...when he finally got back in, he found my dog hiding under a table crying) who sometimes demanded late night walks before bed.\u00a0 Her favorite route was near my house around a large local park along a key thoroughfare between a shopping hub for the localcommunity and the university. The park is sporadically lit and home to critters and occasionally transients.\u00a0 It's also, due to one of those weird flukes of weather and geography, always several degrees colder than the surrounding areas and sometimes home to spooky-ass ground fog.\u00a0So on this particular fall evening a few years back, my dog and I were walking around the park at about 11:00pm. We approach one of the poorly lit sections of the park exterior, which has high bushes separating the sidewalk from the parking lot and/or park itself.\u00a0 The bushes are right on the edge of the sidewalk and about arm's length in width.\u00a0 All of a sudden my dog starts freaking out.\u00a0 Like full on attack mode with deep barking and snarling.\u00a0 This was completely out of nowhere - no rustling noises or anything else you would expect to evoke that kind of reaction - and totally uncharacteristic for her.\u00a0\n\nTypically when she spotted a raccoon or skunk, she was more curious about the weird animal in front of her than anything else (or she would start loudly crying and embarrassing herself).\u00a0 But she almost never flipped out. \u00a0 I immediately yank her away from the bush and run down the sidewalk, thinking \"oh shit we're about to be skunked!\"\u00a0After 25 yards or so, I turn around, pull out my pocket flashlight (dog still freaking out in the meantime), and shine it back toward the bush, expecting to see a critter saunter away slowly.\u00a0 Instead, we see a man emerge from what I later found out was a hollowed out section of the bush on the other side of the sidewalk.\u00a0 He very casually stood up and looked at us.\u00a0 He looked to be in his late 30s/early 40s and was quite clearly not homeless.\u00a0 He was dressed like a suburban dad (jeans and windbreaker) and appeared to be completely sober.\u00a0 I remember noticing that he was wearing dress shoes and fixating on how out of place it seemed.\n\nA bit of background info: I am a big, big dude - somewhere in the ballpark of 6'8 320lbs -and I spent a number of years moonlighting as a bouncer at a local bar so I can spot a drunk pretty easily.\u00a0 After the initial shock of what I was seeing wore off, I mustered my best scary bouncer voice and shouted \"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING\" while my dog was still going apeshit.\u00a0 The guy took off running at a full sprint toward my neighborhood.\u00a0 I called the police (there's a sheriff's substation at the shopping center less than a mile away) and explained what I had just seen.\u00a0 For the rest of our walk, multiple police cars were patrolling the park and the neighborhood with spotlights shining the entire time.\u00a0  \n\n\nFrom what I understand, they never found the guy.\u00a0 I have no idea what he was doing in the bushes or what would have happened if somebody other than me and my dog had walked by.\u00a0 The bush was uprooted a few years ago but I still think about it every time I walk on that side of the park.",

The owners called us the next day to warn us to be careful after dark because a cougar had been sighted at a neighboring farm. We made sure to get back before dark for the rest of the trip.",

            "It was about 4am on a lonely street next to a public park with a hedge running its length. A deep, protracted scream from my left suddenly distracted me from the audio book I was listening too and I removed my headphones. The scream swelled and was soon accompanied by fast approaching footsteps which quickly overtook me on the other side of the hedge. I stopped just as a bare-chested man erupted out of the foliage about five feet in front of me. His face and neck were covered in what appeared to be white powder from his nose down. For a brief moment we locked eyes - me frozen still, him wide-eyed and still screaming - then he rushed past me; off down the road, into the darkness. I was so stunned I just stood there for a few minutes, listening to his receding footsteps and screams as they faded to nothing, before replacing my headphones and continuing on my way. I still find myself wondering about that guy. Where was he going? Where had he been? How much of that powder had he ingested?",

I was about seven or eight at the time, so I was thrilled to be by myself even if it was for a half hour, but then I got a weird feeling that someone or something was watching me. I shrugged it off for a moment before I got completely terrified and started walking faster. Walking turned into a jog, and before soon I was running down the sidewalk, looking behind me to see if anything was chasing me. The third time I turned around, I saw a small shape about 80 feet away sprinting towards me. Of course, I freaked out and fucking ran as fast I have ever ran. Turning back around, I realized it was a doberman with a collar following me. I think about that time still, and as an elementary kid not knowing what was chasing me, is easily the most scared I have ever been in my life.\n\nTL;DR: Seven yo me being chased by a doberman at near sundown became the most terrifying moment in my life.",

            "Dude one time it was like 4 in the morning at the first place I lived away from my home city, and I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I walked down some streets and pathways I had never been through before until I came to a path that had 12 foot hedges on either side that eventually led to a swamp . It was dark and I left my phone at home so no flashlight. No city lights at this point. I went for it, kept walking and I could hear ducks, I was coming up to the swamp.  It had a trail that ringed around it. There were benches where you could sit and stair at the bog, all the trees in the swamp were dead and it reeked of bird feces. I kept walking when I found someone sitting straight up on one of the benches in a white sheet, covering everything so you couldn\u2019t see their face or body. legs weren\u2019t on the ground, and they were dead still, just sitting there in the white sheet. Normally that wouldn\u2019t be that intimidating but at 4 am in the pitch black and completely alone it felt like the start of a horror movie, at first I couldn\u2019t tell what it was so I go closer until I realized it was someone under a sheet, I turned around immediately and went straight home to bed. Scared the hell out of me",
            "It wasn\u2019t taking a walk at night, but rather closing the store in a mall at night. I was 16, closed up shop, and started to leave. Lights were turning off overhead and anyone milling around were exiting. I make eye contact with a dude and walk past him. Walked only for 10 more seconds before my inner alarm bells were going off. I look behind me and he\u2019s roughly 10 feet away getting closer. I ducked into the closest store still open and as I did I felt a whoosh of air right next to me, as though he tried to reach out to grab me. I\u2019m in the store and I see him standing out there waiting for me to leave. Thankfully, the sales lady asks if I\u2019m okay and I told her that creeper was following me. She got security to escort me to my car. Soon as the asshole saw big ol\u2019 security man, he bounced. Fucking creeper, still gives me chills thinking about what could have happened."

The first thing I would tell each salesman was that we were shopping around for a daily for her to drive. \n\nHonda dealership was stereotypical car salesman \"We can't even let her take a test drive unless she shows intent to buy\" \n\nFord dealership ignored her completely and tried to sell me a mustang.\n\nToyota was like, \"oh you must want to look at our (insert soccer mom vehicle here)\"\n\nBut when we got to Mazda I told the sales guy the same thing that we were looking for her next car, and he immediately nodded, turned to her and asked \"what do you look for in a car?\" And then he just listened to her. He didn't ask me anything for the rest of the time we were there, focused entirely on her and answering her questions.

            "25 years ago my husband and I are looking for our first house. He had just graduated and still had student debt. I had been practicing law and had 20k saved for the downpayment. Real estate agent only spoke to husband, even if I asked the questions. In one house we went to look at the basement and the guy says \"you don't want to go there. It has spiders.\"\nI told my husband I wouldn't ever buy a house from him. Later the guy ran for office and I told everyone the story including a woman that called me randomly to promote his candidacy. Turns out she was his mother.

It was a joint decision on the feel of it, but my decision for the price-point/warranty/etc because I was paying for it. In other words, all the stuff we actually needed the salesperson for. Salesperson was a fine guy, old-fashioned, not overtly rude, but he was definitely talking to my husband more than to me (the one with the money to pay). I noticed but, eh, I'm used to it, I was going to get my info and pay the man. Whatever. \n\nMy husband, bless him, wandered away all floaty, like he'd never seen a furniture store before (weird, but ok). Then he came back and said, \"Hey, can I have some money? I'm going to go check out the (insert dumb little decorative thing in the other part of the store).\" I was weirded out because I have never seen him care about a lamp enough to go examine it on his own and also we don't... we don't do that? But yeah, I said, sure, and handed him some cash.\n\nThe salesman IMMEDIATELY stopped paying attention to my husband. Suddenly, in his mind, I was wearing all the pants. He started asking me what I did for a living, etc and I was able to negotiate for a slightly lower price. \n\nI love my husband so much. He knew exactly what he was doing.",

The landscaper was an older guy, probably around my dad's age, and my husband and I are pretty young to be homeowners, so I could kinda understand this dude's condescending attitude. When he came over the first time to do the estimate he almost exclusively addressed my husband even though I'd made it clear I was the one who was doing the designing and knew what I wanted done. When the work was done and I paid him, he kept looking behind me for my husband and almost didn't give me the aftercare instructions for the new sod, saying he wanted to make sure it was done right so he'd email them to my husband. I finally snapped, \"Give me the damn piece of paper, Bruce! I'm the one who will be home during the day to do the damn thing!\" (I worked nights at the time). He reluctantly handed it over and called my husband the next day to make sure the lawn got watered. My husband told him, \"You'd have to ask her, Bruce. She told you she'd do the damn thing\" and hung up.\n\nI had, indeed, done the damn thing.",

I called their main office shortly after he left and said I wasn't interested in any high-pressure sales tactics, I just wanted a quote, and if they wouldn't give that to me, the one who would be paying for it, then to not bother coming back out.

            "We were buying a car for me. Paying for the whole thing outright, but financing the minimum amount because they ran a deal that got us $1500 off if we financed through them (we paid the whole note the next month), so of course we had to sit in the salesman's office for an inordinately long amount of time answering questions.\n\nThe salesman, who was great in every other way because he was a hands-off, no-pressure guy (we walked from several other places when they attempted to pressure us), would ask my husband the questions. My husband pointed at me and said \"I don't know, it's her car.\" Salesman said \"Of course, but we all know how it goes, right?\" and kept asking him. \n\nSo what ended up happening, because we both wanted to get the paperwork signed and get the hell out of there with the car but we were also on the same wavelength wondering about how far we could go with this, was that the salesman would ask my husband the question. Husband would blatantly turn to me and repeat the question, I would answer him, then he would turn back to the salesman and repeat exactly what I'd said. Dude never got the idea that maybe he could...just ask me the questions.\n\nOn the car we bought for my husband a few years later, since we put both our names on the paperwork we both had to sign.

We recently had a new home built and since then have done a lot in regards to landscaping and adding to the home (finishing the basement, adding on a stand by generator). The thing is, despite my wife usually being the one to reach out to contractors, and despite the fact that she is the one who wants things done in a specific way, and despite the fact that I usually refer them to her, they always try to contact me first, talk primarily to me when we are both present, and reach out to me when they have questions or need to let us know things. It is bizarre. Like, \"I am the dude in pajama pants and a sweatshirt playing the floor is lava with the kids. Does it look like I care what kind of finish is on the cabinets. Talk to the wife. We all know she is in charge.\"\n\nEdit: thanks for all the discussion. I understand all the \"top reply is from a man\" comments and I get it.

Yes, the house I purchased all on my own and is mine. I don't take myself too seriously and I'm not easy to upset or embarrass, so I didn't really care, I was riding high on a wave of winning a bidding war.\n\nEdit: I honestly didn't expect so many reactions, thank you. I think I should say that I often find myself in a similar situations, where the sales person looks at my boyfriend ( yes, still the same guy, 7 years and counting) for approval or answers and my boyfriend always replies along the lines : \"don't look at me, she's the boss / she's a the one making decision / she's the one buying\" and now that I'm thinking about it, I've never really had to tell anyone myself, he was always first to tell them. Maybe that's the reason why I never really thought much about it.",

Second strike was although I clearly said I was treating, they placed the check in front of my boyfriend...on his birthday. \n\nFinally straw was the manager coming over to introduce himself to my boyfriend.

I thought you had one in stock.\" The guy looked at me, in total seriousness, and says in a very condescending tone, \"Oh, honey, you don't want that car, it has a manual transmission. Let me show you these others that would be better for you.\"\n\nUmmmm, wtf? After the initial shock wore off, I looked at him and said, \"Well, first off, my name isn't 'Honey'. I have a name which you'd know if you'd bothered to ask. Second, I know what I want and don't need you to tell me. I think we're done here.\" And, with that, I walked out the door.\n\nI ended up finding the same model, manual transmission, at another dealership about a hour from my house. TOTALLY worth the drive. I did most of the deal over the phone. The salesman DGAF that I was female. We got to a price we could both live with and the deal was done. SO MUCH BETTER.

            "I'm not a woman but I witnessed this scenario. I've posted it on reddit before but here it is again\n\n-----------------------\n\nA little more than a decade ago I (male) was at a party with a few friends and a whole bunch of strangers. I got into a conversation with another guy about our work. He was a programmer and I was a physicist, and at some point we started talking about quantum computing. He asked me a whole bunch of questions to which I gave answers, but my subfield was not quantum information. Fortunately my friend came to the party with me, and she was also a physicist, and specifically a quantum computing specialist. As soon as I saw her cross my field of vision I waved her over thinking she'd both appreciate the conversation and be able to contribute a whole lot more than I could.\n\nY'all. Even after I introduce her as a fellow physicist and quantum computing expert, the guy kept asking *me* questions. And I kept being like, \"I honestly have no clue, [friend], you're the expert, what's going on there.\" And like, I deflected three or four questions that way before I think he got the hint that maybe he's addressing the wrong person.\n\nHe changes his conversation strategy so that instead of asking me about QIS, he starts trying to show off, to her, what he knows about it. Like, in his brain this flipped from an opportunity to learn more about quantum computers to an opportunity to get laid showing off what little he knows about the subject. So he's mansplain-flirting quantum information science to a woman who had literally built and programmed what was, at the time, one of the world's only functioning multi-qubit quantum computers.\n\nI wish I could say I watched her die a little inside, but apparently this was so common a kind of occurrence that she was inured to it, and just laughed and went to get another beer.",
            "I was the guy in the scenario but I was at a comic con with my girlfriend. It was her idea to go to the con as she actively collected comics (I have a pile of graphic novels but usually don't bother with individual issues.) At one booth there was an indie artist trying to hawk his new book. He saw us both looking through a copy and came over to engage. He started talking to me but then she asked him a question about the book. He gave a short answer and then tried to talk to me about the book again. She just got an annoyed look for a second and then moved onto the next booth. I set the book down and cut him off to say \"sorry dude, she's the comic fan, I was just looking at the drawings\" and then moved on too.\n\nAssuming I was the nerdier one was acceptable. Still a somewhat sexist assumption, but if you look at the traditional gender split of a comic con it's a reasonable assumption. But once she tried to engage and he ignored her in favor of a male then that just showed he was an idiot. And seeing it first-hand I really kind of felt bad for nerdy girls who have guys gatekeeping nerdy things or assuming the girls don't have the right to be interested in them.\n\nEDIT: Man it sucks seeing comments from you female nerds who had shit experiences like this. I will gladly talk comics with all of you! (Although you honestly might know more than me - I cherry pick the graphic novels that have my favorite stories or arcs so I never fully know the larger on-going stories and where things fit in certain timelines.)",

They made it clear it was the wife\u2019s car, so I was asking her the questions and getting to know her, but the husband was a controlling bulldozer of a person. He\u2019d interrupt her and talk down to her, and kept trying to bully me on the finances, which I had no control over. He hated it, but I ignored him sooo politely and patiently, waiting for him to shut the fuck up so I could listen to *her* answer. I eventually stopped him and asked her, this is YOUR car, what do YOU think? He got up and left in a huff to harass the management, and I was left alone to do the deal in peace with her, and it was VERY pleasant without him! \n\nI moved on to work as a victim\u2019s advocate for domestic violence; looking back I\u2019m sure this was an abusive relationship, but I\u2019m glad I could offer her the kindness and respect she clearly didn\u2019t get, and although it was for a short time, it was for something big and important. I think about them sometimes (because I got along with her so well, and really disliked him), hoping she\u2019d driven that Accord far away from him.",

He stayed pretty quiet throughout it all, meanwhile I'd ask my list of questions... except every time I asked a question, the salesman would turn to my dad and answer it as if my dad had asked it. Eye contact with him and all. It made both myself and my dad really uncomfortable. I ended up confronting him about it and he just awkwardly looked at his feet and dodged the question about his behavior, only to ask my dad if he had any further questions and then walking away. Needless to say, we purchased elsewhere.",

I was mostly following her because my dad's name was on the request and we have similar names. I assumed he would ask for our names so I went out.\n\nThe septic guy kept telling me things about the tank, where we lived, our toilet habits (the tenant before us flushed a fuckload of condoms, which I don't use). My wife explained to him that they weren't ours, that we just moved in, etc. I listened to him but didn't respond a word (just nods and gestures). \n\nStill, he kept talking to me about how to maintain the tank and I'm not technical. I have no clue what he's saying. My wife kept answering because she had more experience than me at the topic.\n\nEventually, she stepped between him and me and fielded his comments a lot more firmly. \n\nIt was weird.

I'm here to pay cash money on it but only if she's happy with the deal.  I personally hope she doesnt get it.\"\n\nTHEN they started negotiating with me. Got it for a good price and when the title arrived it bore out the cliche - it really did belong to a little old man who rarely drove it: had the death certificate stapled to it.  It was an 8 year old car with less than 40k on it.  And I got it for $4k - this was 16 years ago.\n\nNow WHY a little old man had a purple car with a sunroof, idk.",

Like what kind of engine it has, mileage, ect. She would ask a question the guy would address the answer to me. I was pretty annoyed as I'm not mechanically inclined at all. I said \"Why are you talking to me!\" dealer stopped and looked confused. \"She is the one buying the car not me.

After three attempts to get this misogynistic old man to acknowledge me in the conversation, my friend started laughing and walked away. I continued to stand there, cheerfully answering the questions he barked at my friend, who was actively walking away. I was so entertained at this point; this was war. \n\nWhen my friend was left the aisle, it was like a flip switched in the worker's head. When he was speaking to my friend, he was asking about floor plans and fridges and all the little things that make it a home, but the moment he started talking to ME, he started absolutely questioning my engine, the capacity of my battery bank, and all the things I'm sure he assumed I wouldn't be familiar with. I answered all the questions with ease and even had the chance to mansplain my electrical system, as the worker said something blatantly wrong while speaking with me.\n\nThe moment he realized *I* was explaining something to *him,* he turned beet red, insisted he knew what I was talking about and that I was wrong, and cited his uncle's business as reason to believe he knew what he was talking about. I smiled, suggested he attend some local community college courses to refresh his memory, and wished him a nice day before walking away. \n\nIt was a beautiful moment.

            "Not me, but my mom handling a situation about me.\n\nI was a problem child from birth. My mom had to have several meetings with the school principals about me. One time in headstart I got kicked off the school bus and mom had to attend a meeting for me to be able to ride the bus again. The school neglected to inform her of this until the bus failed to pick me up. Mom, already pissed that she had to take me to school, was not happy at all about the rest of the situation. When she arrived the (male) principal was halfway sitting on his desk. Mom started asking questions about why she wasn't informed of my suspension. The principal gave her half assed answers about how that wasn't his job. When mom pressed the issue the principal, stupidly, suggested that she \"call her husband to come deal with this matter\". Mom lost her shit. Now, my father, as much as I loved him, wasn't the greatest. He was a flaky alcoholic that mom was practically raising alongside my sister and me. He was unreliable and irresponsible. Mom has always been the one to handle everything with my sister and me. So when the principal suggested she bring a man in to handle issues with HER children mom was less than impressed. She went off. She crossed the room rather quickly, informing the principal that SHE was the only person with whom he ever needed to speak about her children. She is the husband, the wife, the caretaker, the breadwinner and whatever else he needed to justify speaking with a mother about her children. By the time mom was done ripping that man a new ass he was cowering behind his desk. She has this special skill when she gets mad. Anyone remember when gandolf went off on bilbo in bilbo's house and gandalf gets impossibly large and intimidating and everything kinda goes dark except for him and it's kinda scary? Yeah my mom can do that and it's terrifying.  I remember standing by the door listening and thinking \"oh no! He's in trouble now.\"",

He ignored me and told my husband that \"she\" should have expected there to be cheese on all of the tacos, so I asked why it didn't say that on the menu. He continued to ignore me and told my husband that \"she\" had no right to send food back, because \"she\" wasn't paying the bill, and he would only talk to the one who was. My husband told him that he needed to talk to me, the one with the problem, so he stormed off to get the owner and called me a bitch on his way off. That was the only thing he said to me.\n\nWe got up and left without paying the second he walked away.\n\n[edit] This was NOT an allergy situation. I just don't like cheese. I'm not in the habit of telling servers every food I don't like when I order food.",
            "I was in a Cabelas trying to check out a new tent to decide if I liked it or not. The salespeople completely ignored me and helped out every guy around me.

            "I had pre-ordered an Xbox One and my husband came with me to collect it as we went for lunch beforehand. During the transaction, the store clerk kept looking over my head to my husband who was standing behind me. He wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye at all, despite me responding to all of his questions (as it was me buying the thing for myself) and eventually just started addressing my husband directly, saying \u201cwould SIR be interested in an extra controller?\u201d and other questions prefixed with the word Sir. At this point my husband clicked as to what was happening and said \u201cdude, my Wife is buying the console, not me!\u201d But the guy still did it, even when I went to pay, he still asked my husband if he was paying by cash or card. This time my husband answered for me and said \u201cmate, I have zero interest in playing video games!(Which is a lie, he\u2019s as big of a gamer as I am) and my WIFE wants to pay for her console!\u201d And he was practically growling at the clerk, so I quickly paid and we left the store. \n\nI did complain, I never got a response and that shop closed 6 months later.",

I returned to that dealership the next day (the had the car I wanted with all the desired options for the best price/mileage) and completed the purchase with another salesperson.

            "Husband here. We live in the deep south, and this is way too common, though in recent years it's stopped happening by quite a bit.  The \"best\" one was after she completed a job interview, they wanted her to bring me in so they could know for certain that she had my permission to work outside the home. Needless to say, they were told to get bent. (And she found a much better job from a company that appreciated her skills, at much better pay, shortly after).   \nI'm a pretty big and scary looking guy (don't know how I got lucky enough to have her) and I'm not worried about being \"impolite\" so I quickly put a stop to it, and they listen when I do.

            "Computer stores. Every fucking time. If I'm with my partner or my dad, they talk to him 100% of the time. If I'm alone, it's worse because they don't want to talk to me at all. The big box stores just make up some bullshit so you'll hopefully go away and stop asking questions. Asked for a gaming monitor with a very fast refresh rate, dude tries to sell me a TV. Asked someone to point me to the compressed air because I wasn't sure where in the store they were keeping it, patronising guy tells me there is no such thing. Asked if they had any internal DVD drives in stock, similarly patronising guy (different guy, just equally patronising) tells me they don't exist either. \n\nSmall stores are slightly better at answering the question but no less patronising in assuming you don't want what you said you want. Asked what mid range GPUs were in stock because the one in my computer just exploded and I needed one right there and then, bored sales guy tells me about the absolute cheapest trash cards Nvidia make without even looking up from his phone. Asked about the specs on a laptop that was on offer, guy reads off the little label that was on it - yes, I can read, thank you, I saw that, it has the price and the size of the hard drive but I would like some pesky details like the CPU and the GPU and the RAM.\n\nThe whole thing makes me mad and I shop online exclusively now, because I can just order parts and have them show up at my house without coming down with a serious case of feminist rage."

            "Apparently,\u00a0[death\u00a0from laughter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_from_laughter) is an incredibly rare but a completely legit cause of death.    \n\nIn the third century BCE, Chrysippus, a Greek Stoic philosopher, died of laughter after he saw a donkey eating his figs.     \n\nAnd Chrysippus' is not the only isolated case. Among the few other cases, a fifth-century BCE Greek painter, Zeuxis, is said to have died laughing at his painting of the goddess Aphrodite for which an old woman (who had commissioned the painting) had insisted on modelling. Also, Cleopatra, the ruler of Egypt in the first century BCE, claimed that her retainer died laughing at her husband's death.\n\nAccording to the linked Wikipedia article, the most recent case is that of Ole Bentzen, a Danish audiologist, who saw a funny scene in a comedy film and laughed so hard that his heart rate rose to a point where he had a fatal heart attack, in 1989.\n\nFrom what I understood from reading up on this topic, it's not the act of laughing itself but rather a fatal repercussion from a fit of laughter, such as cardiac arrest, asphyxiation or aneurysm, which causes death. For instance, Ole Bentzen suffered a heart attack as a consequence of the terrible fit of laughter he had. It's possible that such was the case of Chrysippus (and others) as well.   \n\n(I always thought of 'I'm gonna die laughing!' as a hyperbole, and I myself use it quite liberally. But I guess every hyperbole has a grain of truth to it.)",
            "The Bone Wars! Two rival paleontologists, Othneil Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, were in a race for academic clout, so they both took off to places like the fossil beds of Montana and Utah to try and dig up as many dinosaurs as possible before the other guy. But they didn't stop there, and hired spies and sabateurs to impede the other's work, as well as trying to pass off sloppy or fake skeletons sometimes. The overwhelming majority of iconic dinosaur genre that we know were either first discovered or simply got a lot of new samples to work with, and were made iconic by the amount of publicity they received. This includes Triceratops, Stegosaurus, some remains of Tyrannosaurus, Apatosaurus, and many, many more.\n\nThis is also where the Brontosaurus confusion comes from. One of the scientists (I forget who) had already discovered Apatosaurus. The other then discovered a new skeleton of the same dinosaur, but intentionally put a skull from a different species, Camarosaurus, onto that skeleton and tried to pass it off as a new species entirely, Brontosaurus. The fake was unveiled pretty quickly but the name stuck. More recently, however, we have a lot more tools to distinguish smaller features from bones, and it was found that the skeleton that was originally passed off as Brontosaurus is actually barely different enough to receive its own genus, and the name Brontosaurus was revived.\n\nI've always thought that this could make a fantastic show, especially if it includes dramatized \"flashbacks\" to how the dinosaurs in the skeletons died.\n\nEdit: the Wikipedia page's intro describes it very nicely as well:\n\n>The Bone Wars, also known as the Great Dinosaur Rush, was a period of intense and ruthlessly competitive fossil hunting and discovery during the Gilded Age of American history, marked by a heated rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to outdo the other in the field, resorting to bribery, theft, and the destruction of bones. Each scientist also sought to ruin his rival's reputation and cut off his funding, using attacks in scientific publications.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_Wars\n\nEdit: Its worth noting that the bone wars have had a massive positive legacy on paleontology as a field, but left both scientists financially and socially ruined.

October 25, 1944.\n\nTaffy 3, a group of around a dozen small American escort carriers, destroyers, and escort destroyers, found themselves under attack by the Center Force, around two dozen of the most powerful warships in the Japanese Navy including battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Thanks to the incredible bravery and determination of every ship involved, and incompetence on the part of the Japanese forces, they inflicted heavy casualties on the [vastly superior force](https://i.imgur.com/9ozH66l.jpg) and got them to retreat. \n\nThe Japanese Center Force was comprised of the *Yamato*-class battleship [*Yamato*](https://imgur.com/wQue69c.jpg), *Nagato*-class battleship [*Nagato*](https://imgur.com/UnXZE53.jpg), *Kongo*-class battlecruisers [*Kongo*](https://imgur.com/sO1VFCG.jpg) and [*Haruna*](https://imgur.com/zsluotM.jpg), *Tone*-class heavy cruisers [*Tone*](https://imgur.com/Kd9IKrC.jpg) and [*Chikuma*](https://imgur.com/lb9hkNb.jpg), *Mogami*-class heavy cruisers [*Kumano*](https://imgur.com/ob6BYQY.jpg) and [*Suzuya*](https://imgur.com/jaN2zvO.jpg), *Myoko*-class heavy cruiser [*Haguro*](https://imgur.com/pkbOXz2.jpg), *Takao*-class heavy cruiser [*Chokai*](https://i.imgur.com/A3Zs0RQ.jpg), *Agano*-class light cruisers [*Noshiro*](https://imgur.com/K0MIvEZ.jpg) and [*Yahagi*](https://imgur.com/z6sY1lP.jpg), *Yugumo*-class destroyers [*Kiyoshimo*](https://imgur.com/JUYnkPO.jpg), [*Akishimo*](https://imgur.com/quNYmjr.jpg) (shown here under construction), [*Asashimo*](https://imgur.com/LE5wcCK.jpg), [*Fujinami*](https://imgur.com/68dvVmT.jpg), [*Hamanami*](https://imgur.com/XXxL9wm.jpg), [*Hayashimo*](https://i.imgur.com/IZgBZc5.jpg), [*Kishinami*](https://i.imgur.com/r7fP9s0.jpg) (no photograph exists), [*Okinami*](https://imgur.com/pdx3UEn.jpg) (shown here sunk in a later event), and [*Naganami*](https://imgur.com/8dejnPv.jpg), *Shimakaze*-class destroyer [*Shimakaze*](https://imgur.com/hryGBFx.jpg), and *Kagero*-class destroyers [*Hamakaze*](https://imgur.com/MPvaKO5.jpg), [*Isokaze*](https://imgur.com/llbZtg7.jpg), [*Nowaki*](https://imgur.com/3WfxIi7.jpg), [*Urakaze*](https://i.imgur.com/ygbSEHf.jpg), and the famously lucky [*Yukikaze*](https://imgur.com/kpjf7Jm.jpg); with the American Task Group 77.4.3 (Taffy 3) consisting of just the *Casablanca*-class escort carriers [*Fanshaw Bay*](https://imgur.com/IB1GAqf.jpg), [*St. Lo*](https://imgur.com/ExJhPX5.jpg), [*White Plains*](https://imgur.com/igg7YA7.jpg), [*Kalinin Bay*](https://imgur.com/XVxGT0s.jpg), [*Kitkun Bay*](https://imgur.com/vdbUaW7.jpg), and [*Gambier Bay*](https://imgur.com/S1XawSR.jpg), *Fletcher*-class destroyers [*Johnston*](https://i.imgur.com/cxFB7OO.jpg), [*Hoel*](https://imgur.com/w1S53M1.jpg), and [*Heerman*](https://imgur.com/OqY9fLS.jpg), and *John C.

Roberts*](https://imgur.com/36bD3gu.jpg), [*Raymond*](https://imgur.com/cp1R4JM.jpg), and [*Dennis*](https://imgur.com/8HPCwGD.jpg). \n\n*Yamato* alone displaced slightly more than every ship in Taffy 3 combined, and whereas the Americans had nothing bigger than 5-inch guns the Japanese had up to 18-inch guns. However, though they were outgunned and outmassed, the American forces did have some things working in their favor. To begin with they had much better fire control systems than the Japanese forces, with *Yamato* being the only ship in the Center Force with some kind of automated fire control while the other vessels had to rely on optical rangefinders and radar while using colored dye packs in shells to tell where their shots hit (*Nagato* used bright pink, *Haruna* used a greenish-yellow, and *Kongo* used blood red), significantly diminishing their accuracy; to contrast even the US destroyers had automated fire control. The carriers also still had over a hundred aircraft between them, plus later reinforcements from Taffy 1 and 2, and though they were outfitted for land-based targets and submarines were still used to great effect in causing confusion and chaos among Japanese forces with some even making dry runs at ships and buzzing towers to trick them into evading. The commanding officer of the Center Force, Takeo Kurita, also didn't have charts for escort carriers, and as such believed them to be fleet carriers and that their escorts were, proportionally, cruisers. On top of this he hadn't slept in 3 days and he had no communication from the Southern Force he was meant to join up with. This led to them greatly overestimating the size and strength of the American forces and using the wrong type of ammunition for lightly-armored ships for much of the battle. On top of all that the Japanese forces were incredibly disorganized, with Kurita initially ordering an anti-aircraft circle and suddenly changing to a General Attack with every division attacking independently of each other and restricting how many of their guns could be aimed, leading to decreased output and no unit coordination or communication to speak of, along with at least one catastrophic friendly fire incident which will be covered later. Even with all that though, the sheer difference in firepower alone meant this should've been an easy victory for Japan. And while it was a blowout in a way, probably not the way you'd expect.\n\nSome highlights of the battle (in terms of ship-to-ship combat) include:\n\n-The destroyer *Johnston* charging the entire fleet by herself, scoring first blood by blowing the bow off the heavy cruiser *Kumano* which also put her sister *Suzuya* out of the fight as she went alongside *Kumano* to assist, shooting up the battlecruiser *Haruna* and the heavy cruiser *Tone*, and driving off an entire destroyer squadron by herself. All this time the *Johnston* was under near-constant fire, tanking many battleship and cruiser-grade shells as repair crews were furiously working to keep the ship operational. In her last moments fighting she was exchanging fire with up to four cruisers and several destroyers. *Johnston* fought so valiantly and caused so much damage the Japanese were certain she was a cruiser, and when she was finally sunk, the captain of the destroyer *Yukikaze* was seen saluting her as she went under.\n\n-The destroyer *Heermann* exchanging broadsides with the battleship *Nagato* and heavy cruisers *Haguro* and *Tone*, and later assisting destroyer escort *Samuel B. Roberts* in her pummeling of the heavy cruiser *Chikuma*. *Heermann* would be the only destroyer of Taffy 3 to survive the battle, though only barely remaining afloat.\n\n-The destroyer *Hoel* firing lances of torpedoes that temporarily takes battleship *Yamato* and battlecruisers *Haruna* and *Kongo* out of the fight as they have to evade, and exchanging fire with *Tone* for some time, drawing fire away from the other American ships. Unfortunately *Hoel* didn't share the good fortune of her sisters and was sunk early in the battle, but her bravery and significance cannot be discounted.\n\n-The destroyer escort *Samuel B. Roberts* charging the Japanese force alongside the destroyers of Taffy 3, despite being significantly slower and weaker, striking the cruiser *Chokai* with at least one torpedo. However she is most known for firing her entire ammunition supply (including AA rounds and star shells) into the cruiser *Chikuma*, severely damaging her stern and mauling the ship's superstructure as well as setting her bridge on fire; and one of her guns actually exploded from overuse. *Chikuma* would later be scuttled, partially as a result of the damage *Samuel B. Roberts* dished out, however the destroyer escort herself would not survive the battle, the only ship of her class sunk at Samar. The other DEs, while remaining with the carriers, took damage and fired off their entire ammo supplies as well.\n\n-Multiple escort carriers scoring hits on pursuing Japanese cruisers with their sole stern-mounted 5-inch gun, one of which was thought to be the cause of a massive chain of explosions which crippled the cruiser *Chokai* until further study revealed this was likely a catastrophic case of friendly fire from battlecruiser  *Kongo*.

He received daily lessons to attempt to teach him to pronounce human syllables.\n\nIssues arose, however, when he reached adolescence. Because dolphins may actually have a stronger libido than humans, Peter became very aggressive and non-compliant from sexual frustration. Plans to offer conjugal visits with female dolphins was canceled, as they didn't want exposure to dolphin behavior to interfere with the experiment. Instead, the handler offered to give the dolphin a handjob every so often, which was allowed. This did reduce his aggressive tendencies, and apparently also improved his lessons.\n\nWhen it started to become apparent that the dolphin was incapable of learning English and instead was just imitating the syllable patterns in return for his handlers affection, the people overseeing the experiment took on an extra project to test LSD on the dolphin. For some reason, they also gave LSD to the handler. I guess at this point, the people funding all of this came in for a visit, to find they were funding LSD-fueled interspecies handjobs. It seems it was promptly decided to instead just use human astronauts.\n\nThe experiment ended, Peter was put in a regular dolphin enclosure, though he had developed none of the skills needed to properly communicate with other dolphins.

The invading general saw it and pulled back; Zhuge Liang was **infamous** for his outside-the-box strategy, and he was absolutely convinced that the madman was baiting the incoming army into a trap.

            "I haven't seen this one here yet, and it's pretty important historically speaking, so let's talk about one that I particularly like: the Xi'an Incident.\n\nSo to try and be brief because warlord-era China was one of the most complicated political landscape to have ever existed, a pair of generals named Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng within the nationalist forces in China were ordered to crush the small communist party, which was a relatively minor faction, especially when compared to the Kuomintang (Nationalists). But, when they had started fighting against them, they realized that the communists were actually pretty good fighters and rather disciplined. After they were sufficiently impressed, the communists sent them a peace offer which basically amounted to: \"Hey, let's fight the Japanese instead of each other\", which the two of them liked.\n\nThe leader of the Kuomintang/Republic of China Chiang Kai-Shek did not like that. Not at all, he hated the communists more than the Japanese. So what did Hucheng and Xueliang do? They kidnapped him! They kidnapped the head of state to force him to make peace with a  Imagine, a pair of prominent generals kidnapping the head of state in order to make peace with another faction, in order to fight an invading nation. \n\nAnd this united front led to an alliance which eventually, alongside the Soviets and Americans, would defeat imperial Japan and end WW2. By then, the communists had grown immensely in power (in no small part due to a MASSIVE influx of soviet aid), and the nationalist forces would be exiled to Taiwan. \n\nAnd as a brief sidenote, Zhang Xueliang is also notable for having an affair with a certain Edda Mussolini. Yes, the daughter of THAT Mussolini.",

It felt pretty good so I grabbed a magazine and started to rub one out. The ring slowly moved further back, restricting blood flow and wedging itself tight against my balls and base of my dick. This thing was tight and I suppose it was doing its job until after I came and wanted it to slide off. It wouldn't. It was there, right against my purple dick and balls for 30 minutes before mum came home. I couldn't budge it. I was in pain so I had to call her. The look of utter horror, disbelief, disgust in her eyes will stay with me forever. By this time my dick was the colour #301934 and I was in severe pain. My mum immediately called my dad. He drove from work, about 10 mins, came upstairs, took one look at me, got some vaseline from the bathroom (which I wish I had known about earlier) he got a thin piece of plastic and put vaseline on it and slid it under the ring and kind of levered it a bit. The blood drained and my member subsided. He handed me a towel, ruffled my hair, picked up the ring, shut my bedroom door and went back to work. We never talked about it again.",

I'm straddling a roof peak, all alone, the neighborhood is quiet and I can see there's no one outside. I'm at an angle where I can't be seen from the ground anyway.

But for anyone sorting by new, here goes:  \n  \nI was 16 & my first job was at a wedding venue, working as a server during the receptions and then helping out with clean-up afterward. This was a pretty ritzy place, and we had to have the floors looking like mirrors before we went home. That took HOURS with a buffer/washer, stripping it down to get rid of the dancers' scuff marks and then building it up with layers of wax.\n\nThe handle of the buffer was adjustable, and being a small chick I found it easiest to control if I sort of wedged into the top of my pelvis. That way I could use my ugly little boy hips to move it around. No upper body strength needed.\n\nOne night, the buffer either malfunctioned or worked better than ever before (depending on if you were asking my boss or my lady parts). It vibrated like it was about to fall apart, due to an improperly installed brush head. I didn't mind, though. As soon as I tucked that sucker's handle up onto my pelvis the most wonderful things started happening in the region just a couple of inches below that. I looked around, did a quick adjustment to lower the handlebar just a tad, and then fired that big boy up.\n\nTen minutes of that, and my eyes were permanently rolled back into my head. My entire middle body from my knees to my floating ribs was a throbbing pool of liquid pleasure. Every couple of seconds, the eccentric rotation of the misaligned brush would throw one BIG vibration in, making my hips buck and my breath to freeze in my chest. I vowed to strip wax off of every floor in the Greater Chesterfield Metropolitan Area! I was going to MARRY that buffer. I was going to write \"Mrs. Clarke Buffer\" in my trapper-keeper at school the next Monday. I LOVED that buffer.\n\nAnd then I realized that I had an audience. Half of the rest of the crew was standing at the kitchen door watching me nuke my genitals with the handle of an industrial floor polisher. I instantly pushed the thing away from me, losing control. It spun wildly, wrapping the cord around itself and flipping over onto the floor, spraying wet soapy water all over the place (thankfully all the tables were pushed up against the other side of the room). I was pretty embarrassed, but I soldiered on, unwinding the cord and going back to stripping the floor as if nothing other than a loss of (buffer) control had occurred.\n\nI caught a little ribbing about it, but my boss put an end to it pretty quickly. Which makes sense- you don't let your crew get THAT raunchy around a 16 year old girl. And apparently I was not the first to discover the joys of buffer-induced vibrations. Over the next few weeks, a couple of the other female members of the crew related their stories about how they had found out that a slight adjustment of the pad and handle could make wonderful things happen. They were just a little better about not pulling a \"When Harry Met Sally\" moment while their co-workers watched.\n\ntl;dr: found out that a floor buffer can produce STRONG vibrations that can be transmitted to one's crotch area via the handle. Enjoyed an extended period of bliss while stripping a floor, without realizing that I was putting on a show for my co-workers. Totally worth it.",

The roads were really really shitty and public buses in my country at that time were kind of vibrating metal box. My stop was one of the last one so the bus used to pretty much be vacant. I used to sit at the last corner sit just above rear tire. One day random horniness hit me and I was getting a little hard. And I noticed I can just slide my hands inside my trousers and just hold my bird, the rest is taken care by the bus. It was so random vibration that really felt I don't know different.

            "I used to just drive around country roads when I would feel stressed out or sad as a way to just get away and listen to music. One evening I was driving with my best friend in the car and we're on a gravel road that has a huge hill. We were driving towards the sunset but it was winter and the light was fading fast. As the car started down the hill I had this moment where I thought to myself \"my brights should be on\" and I flicked them on and at the bottom of this super steep hill stood 6 deer on the road. I slammed on the brakes and the car turned sideways and skidded to a stop like 4 feet from the deer. Those stupid deer didn't even move, they just stared into the passenger side of my car and my best friend pointed at them and said \"hey, deer\". The car was fine, we were fine, and Bambi was all good. I don't drive around like that anymore.",

One of the wires had also snapped and hit it exactly where they were standing as well. \n\nThey basically were in a scene of car wreckage and snapped wires and electricity explosions and the pole collapse. Just real insane. If the pole had missed them, the wire would have hit them and if not that then most likely the cars. \n\nThat gut feeling of moving away saved both of them.

            "This is gonna be much more light-hearted than the bulk of these stories. We raised dachshunds when I was growing up. We only had two of them when my mother brought home a stray kitten she couldn't bear to know was gonna go hungry. A few years later we have 5 dachshunds now and kitten is now a very cute healthy cat.\n\nOne day I go outside to feed the dogs. One of them was sitting by the little doghouse, two just sniffing about idly, one was laying in the sun and the other was missing but probably just in the doghouse. I fill their bowls, go back inside....... and then immediately stop in my tracks the moment the door closed.\n\nSomething didn't feel right..\n\nI don't know if it was because specifically the matriarch of these dachshunds was sitting by the doghouse, or if it was because she was sitting directly in front the doghouse entryway like they never do, or if maybe I just unconsciously noticed how attentive this normally scatterbrained dog was being, but I rush outside and make eye contact with her. She moves over and sits facing the entrance and up-nods her head/nose which she's been trained to do when she is pointing to something that needs our attention.\n\nThe cat had kittens! It was surprising because she never had a span of noisy weeks when she was going in heat, we always assumed she was spayed, and she carried three kittens to term without anyone noticing despite her being fed and given the same amount of attention as the dogs got. And the mom of these 4 dogs knew if her children were allowed near them they'd get eaten, so she was keeping guard.\n\nPics:\n\n[https://ibb.co/qyHfhVY](https://ibb.co/qyHfhVY)\n\n[https://ibb.co/mTbf6JT](https://ibb.co/mTbf6JT)\n\nEDIT:\n\nPics of the dogs as requested; the matriarch is the light red/brown cinnamon colored fur:\n\n[https://ibb.co/nzYr7YG](https://ibb.co/nzYr7YG)\n\n[https://ibb.co/VmW8fYj](https://ibb.co/VmW8fYj)\n\n[https://ibb.co/qdCgCpq](https://ibb.co/qdCgCpq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/C82LK3t](https://ibb.co/C82LK3t)",
            "I went to hospital with shortness of breath and my heart racing. They did a chest x-ray, blood test for blood clots, ecg, and a few other tests but all came back normal. After observing me overnight everything still looked good, oxygen saturation was perfect, my heart rate was still a bit elevated but nothing too crazy, and it seemed that it was likely leftover symptoms from a bad virus that I'd had a week or so earlier. \n\nThe ER doctor asks me how I would feel if they sent me home and I just had a bad feeling about it all. I told him as such and that I had no real basis for it except that I just felt off about it. He said fair enough, let's try one more test and if that comes back negative then we'll send you up to General Medicine and see if they can track something down.\n\nThat test was a VQ scan that found despite all other tests showing no results for blood clots, I actually had a whole bunch of them in both lungs. I ended up with a diagnosis of unprovoked bilateral pulmonary embolisms and am on blood thinners for life. \n\nSuper grateful both for the bad feeling and the ER doctor who was willing to listen to it!",
            "When I was about 10 yrs old, I was going to the beach with my older sister, her friends and their parents. They had a van that was open in the back (think white creepy van), no seats. The other friends of my sisters friends took turns sitting on the father's lap when he asked if they wanted to steer the van. He then asked me and my gut said \"no! This man is creepy as fuck.\" The look in his eyes sent shivers down my spine. Once we got to the beach, I forgot all about creepy guy and focused on fun. Fast forward several months later, my sister's friends asked if my sister wanted to sleepover. She refused and my Mom and I were baffled as to why she didn't want to go. We kept encouraging her to. Soon she broke down in tears and told us that one night their father had molested her. The van incident and feelings came flying back to me. I wish I had not forgotten my gut feeling and shared it with my mother and sister before anything happened to my sister. Sometimes I still feel guilty over it. That was over 30 years ago. I don't remember what happened to the guy. I just remember a state vehicle at my house a lot afterwards. No one ever talked about it again and I never asked.",

He was so calm and focused. I look up and see a car spinning in the middle of the freeway ramping up speed and knocking cars off the road. \n\nThis is scandinavia, winter, pretty much on ice. I imagine the driver of that car hoping, just hoping. \n\nSo my dad proceeds to accelerate towards the guy spinning, which didn\u2019t even occur to me was weird. \n\nHe was just so calm, which made me calm. \n\nThe car hits us on my dads side, half a second earlier my dad turned slightly right, which was just enough for the car to push us out of the road and completely safe into a snowhill. \n\nI realized a bit later that a lamppost on that same side we flew off to had crushed the back Right side of our car, just missing the angle that would\u2019ve hit me. \n\n\nYears later I realized the reason my dad sped up the vehicle. Getting hit by that car was a questions of when, not if, and if he had not accelerated, that lamp post would\u2019ve been my death. \n\nAfter that occurence my pulse always drops in pressure situations.",

            "When I was in college, I lived in a sketchy part of Chicago (Humboldt Park/Logan Square before gentrification). \n\nI liked to take late night strolls, even when I was living in that neighborhood as a 20-year-old woman. Yeah, I know. Pretty dumb of me. \n\nOne night, I was feeling stressed out so I embarked on one of my late night strolls. \n\nI was walking along a somewhat busy road. Cars were zooming past me. Pretty normal. I wasn't paying much attention because I was too wrapped up in whatever was stressing me out that night. Suddenly, a chill shot up my spine. Hyperviligance washed over me and I became more alert than I had ever been. Something was wrong. Someone was watching me. \n\nI quickly spotted a car. It was driving in the opposite direction, a little slower than usual. It was too dark for me to see anyone inside the car, and the car was pretty unassuming. But I still knew something was off. They were watching me. I just knew. \n\nThe car drove past me and then made a u-turn. Now it was right behind me, creeping along the curb. \n\nLuckily, there was a Walgreens a few blocks ahead. I started walking faster, and the car eventually sped past me and disappeared into a corner. I somehow knew I wasn't safe yet, so I still sprinted to Walgreens. \n\nI told the security guard what happened, and we both went outside. The car was parked up the street, about 50-100 feet away. The security guard was a big guy who looked intimidating. He marched toward the car, and the car immediately backed up, made a u-turn, and then booked it out of there. The security guard called the cops, and they drove me home. \n\nI never took a late night stroll again.\n\nMy gut made me more alert, but it was really the security guard who saved my life. I'm positive that if he wasn't there that night, something bad would've happened to me. I wish I could find that security guard to thank him.",
            "Last year, December 1st. \n\nI had slept for almost week trying to fight what I thought was the flu. Woke up and that exact gut feeling kept on telling me something\u2019s not right with me. Called the parents to tell them and then cabbed myself to the emergency room. Took blood, the whole 9 yards; was there for 8 hours. Discharged and sent home. Called the next morning asking me to come back because they found something in my blood. Bacteremia and Endocarditis. I was put on penicillin immediately, for 2 months. \n\nMore tests, more things wrong. Went for a specialized test on December 21st, woke up to them telling me I need surgery as soon as possible. They\u2019re trying to find a surgical team, earliest is the 24th. I go in and while they\u2019re operating I have an ascending aortic aneurysm and it caused an aortic dissection. They\u2019re able to fix it. I\u2019ve got a synthetic valve in there now. \n\nHere\u2019s the kicker. I work in a restaurant kitchen, just before the start of the holiday season. Normally most cooks would tough it out and just work. Most think, it happens and it\u2019ll get better soon. Just keep going. There was just something about the way I was feeling this time that made me go to the hospital. I\u2019m told that if I had done that, I more than likely would have died before my birthday and they would have found out about the aneurysm during the autopsy. That still sends fucking chills down my spine. My best friend works as an emergency room nurse at the same hospital that I was operated on and she was freaking out internally but kept it together on the outside for me. She explained just how serious this all was after I was in recovery. \n\nI\u2019ve promised to tell her whenever I get that same feeling again.\n\nTL;DR: gut told me to go to the hospital, if I hadn\u2019t I would have been dead 3 weeks later.\n\nCheers.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve got to get to work now but I\u2019ll try to answer more replies during the day.

            "There's a very fun road that gets you from Niederndorf to Vach (or back) in Germany. You can go 60 or 70 ~~clicks~~ kph along smooth tight turns and little rolling hills. All around it for acres and acres are fields of whatever's in season and no intersections for several kilometers.  It's a very fun road to go too fast on. \n\nThis day, something like wheat was in and it was high. I couldn't see around the corners, but I knew the road well and was staying in my lane. And I was going fast, and smiling.\n\nAbout half way in, I heard a voice in my head as clear as if the speaker were sitting next to me and it said, 'You need to slow down.' It was startling and I braked immediately.\n\nTwo seconds later I come through one of the turns and into the ass end of a combine taking up both lanes and moving slowly. I barely stopped in time\n\nThose extra two seconds of brake time saved a Volvo at least, but I'm pretty sure they saved my life too.\n\n(edit: click clarity)",
            "Once I was at the bank doing business with the ATM. I noticed a black and yellow van parked with a man in the driver's seat. The van was off, and he was just sitting there. Made me uncomfortable, so I didn't want to go home. Instead, I got in my car and moved to the other side of the parking lot near a hardware store and outdoor recycling center (it was broad daylight). I just sat in my car pretending to read, and the van started up and moved down to my side of the parking lot. \n\nAgain, he reversed the van into a parking spot that was facing my car. Now I knew that I shouldn't go home (which was nearby), so instead, I got out and went to visit the two men who were manning the recycling center. I asked if I could sit on their extra chair because the van guy was making me uncomfortable. They said sure, and since business was slow, we got to chatting. \n\nI asked them how they liked the work and how business had been. The van guy finally started up his van and left, after I took a picture of it and texted the info to my husband. After another 10 minutes with the guys, I took a circuitous route home to make sure the van wasn't anywhere around.\n\nThe kicker is this: I asked the guys how long they'd been working at the recycling station, and they said about four months. I'm like, \"Oh, what did you do before this?\", and they both go, \"Oh, we were in prison before.\"\n\nWell, whatevers. They still saved me.",
            "I went out with my best friend on new years last year and were having drinks with her friends when I realized I was out of cigarettes.  I left for a few minutes to walk over and grab a pack and ended up talking to a homeless guy for a while, and when I went over to the entrance of the bar she was outside and said something mean to me for no reason and walked off.   I was confused so I decided it would be good if I took a walk to let her cool off and then figure out what she was upset about.\n\nI was going to walk down the street for a bit but something told me to turn left, walking behind the bar and then turning to the side of the bar when I see a girl laying down on the sidewalk and people walking by her.  As I'm walking over to help I realize its my friend and she's not very conscious.  She was probably drugged while I was getting smokes and who knows what would've happened if I hadn't decided to go that way\n\nScares the shit out of me.",
            "I was with a co-worker. He had lied to me about going to a family party of his. But when I showed up, it was just him and I and we went to a bar. I rolled my eyes and just thought I could clench my teeth through it. \n\nHe knew the owner of the bar. And got me alcoholic drinks (I was only 20). I started pouring out the drinks when the dude was shooting pool because I didn't want to be tipsy/drunk while dealing with him (that decision honestly saved me).\n\nI told him I wanted to go home, but he talked me into taking him home first. So I followed the directions he gave me and I pulled into a hookah bar parking lot instead. He started getting really aggressive and trying to kiss me. I kept pushing him off. I was still trying to be polite but firm and telling him to stop. That's when I noticed the group of guys around my car, talking to my coworker in my car in another language. He then opened my car door, got out, and proceeded to grab me by the hair to try to pull me out of my car, the other guys gathering around. \n\nI had the mind to lock my door when I noticed the other guys. I also had put my car in reverse. So when he grabbed my hair I let off the brake and my car started rolling back so he let go of me.\n \nIt was terrifying. I told our boss the next day and he quit when our boss asked him about it.\n\n*Edit: I even drove away with my passenger door wide open.

I\u2019d have been stuck in a new city with no friends or family nearby, and no job prospects.\n\nEDIT: Wow, my first silver!\n\nThere were a LOT of other details I didn't put in my original response.  I'd already been working within this division for 7 years.  I was offered 2 internal positions at the same time with my employer, one with a huge salary bump out-of-town as a trainer, and one at the same salary in-town doing casework in a completely new department.  It was either change locations or change departments, so I listened to my gut and chose the lower-paying job in a new department and called myself a failure for not taking a risk.  \n\nWithin 4 years of taking the position in-town, I was managing the trainers in my new department.  In the 11 years I've been in my new department, I've almost tripled my salary.  If I'd lost that job in 2008 I'd have lost all the benefits that come with 7 years of employment (vacation time, stock options, performance reviews, 401k hassles, contacts, etc.).  I never could have foreseen this turn of events 11 years ago, and lot of it was the dumb luck of being in the right place at the right time -- and following my gut.",
            "(it didn't save me but i saved someone else) when i was 6 my brother (8 at the time) and i would go to my grandmas house while our mom worked late some nights. anyway one day i was just randomly thinking about fire alarms. i don't know what caused me to think about it but after i started i couldn't stop. i have adhd and this super focus thing so whenever i'm thinking about something as simple as fire alarms it consumes my mind. i asked my grandma and she said she hadn't tested hers in a while. just for kicks she did and sure enough the batters were dead. she replaced the batters and made sure they worked. the VERY next morning her house caught on fire while she was asleep. if she didn't hear the fire alarms she would've been trapped in her room on the second story without a phone or anyway to contact help. she most likely would've died. i always make sure fire detectors/alarms work in my house now.\nedit: batteries*",
            "So, it technically didn\u2019t save me. It would have. \nAnyway, a couple months after my 10th birthday we went on family vacation to visit my dad\u2019s side of the family; they lived a state away. My mom was about 6 months pregnant with my (only) baby brother at the time. We got to our hotel at about 2:00 and by 3:00 we decided we wanted to make the most of the day and go to the aquarium. I got fully dressed and ready to go and suddenly I was hit with this crippling feeling of dread. At that age I\u2019d never experienced anything like it. Pure anxiety. But I knew, I just fucking knew if we waited 5 minutes I would be fine. I tried telling my mom this and she was having none of it. I even tried to just stall her by begging. Nope. Got dragged (not literally lol) out of the hotel and into the car. We pull out of the parking lot and get T-boned so hard we do a 180 into oncoming traffic. As soon as we all realized we were okay I was like, ah, yep, there it is. I\u2019ve never let either of them forget it either lol",
            "I'm afraid of rollercoasters (mostly heights but they go hand in hand). My friends and I went to a theme park and went on one that was in darkness and went underground. I rode it once, sitting in the back, and really enjoyed it surprisingly. \n\nWhen we reached the start again, there was no line (as it was the end of the day) so they asked if we wanted a final go before they shut down. Something in my gut told me not to go on so, despite my friends nagging, I didn't and waited with the bags.\n\nMy friends came back around a few minutes later white as a sheet. About 3/4 of the way through the ride, there's a big drop then it goes fast and just before that, my friend in the back's bar had risen up. Apparently they had to grip onto her for the rest of the ride whilst trying to push the bar back down.",
            "Forgot one; about 10 years ago, working security at a site about 50 miles from home, got off shift at midnight, and didn't bother to change out of uniform because I was only going to stop for gas.  Two stations in the town I was working in were open after midnight, but it slipped my mind as I drove past the first one.  Pulled into the other, (same brand, same gas price, same sort of dump entirely) and just didn't like something about it.  Nobody else around but he clerk that I could see, but I decided to go back to the other one.\n\nTopped off and headed back out of town, I get close to that station again.  Three city cop cars, two deputies and a state trooper are outside blocking the road with guns drawn.  Turns out a city cop walked in on a robbery.  Dude put a bullet in his vest, and the store owner knocked the robber out cold with a bat before the cop could recover enough to get his gun out.  \n\nThat would have been me, in a uniform with a nice shiny badge, but no body armor.",
            "Not me, but my mother, saved my grandfathers life when he had a stroke in his chair in their living room.\n\nWe had all started to walk around the the development, when my mother, after about 50-75 meters from the house said, \"I am going to go back and check on Dad.\"  I went with her, and I nearly witnessed my grandfather die.  He was on the chair, conscious, but unable to move or talk...  Just looking at my mother with bulging eyes.  She called 911 once, then twice when she felt that they were running late.  Ambulance came, got him on the stretcher, but it was too wide to fit out the door.  We ended up tearing the door frame off to get him out.\n\nBecause he was conscious, he actually remembers the ride to the hospital.  He told us later that he heard the driver or someone say, there is not a chance that this guy lives.  That was when I was around 5-6 years old.  He is still alive to this day, more than a decade later.\n\nAt my mothers funeral, part of his speech was about how, without my mothers actions, he would not have been able to spend time with her during her final years of life.  And for that, he is eternally grateful.",
            "I normally go to the club with my husband. He was out of town but I had friends that said they'd be out. My club has always been a very safe club but the area its in has had it's ups and downs, (because drinking and a bunch of clubs in a small area comes with drunks and ne'er do wells of all kinds)  Since I was alone I chose my parking spot carefully. The usual spot was a few blocks off and that was farther than I was comfortable. The paid parking lot was open but they cram so many cars in that getting in and out could be difficult and that just made me uncomfortable for some reason. I chose street parking two blocks down. The block itself was dark but the next block up was  very brightly lit thanks to a big name hotel. Basically I had a semi dark block, a very well lit block (with the paid parking lot and parking lot attendant across from it) and then I was at my club. Straight shot. My car and the club was in eye sight of each other if one stood at the corner and leaned over enough.\n\nThe MOMENT I got into the club I knew something was wrong but I couldn't put my finger on it. None of my friends showed up so I'm alone. Normally this isn't an issue, but the vibe was seriously off. Without going into too long of a story with details, some dude kept trying to buy me a drink that I kept turning down, partly because I don't accept drinks from strangers and partly because this dude didn't seem to be flirting with me and so I couldn't understand why he was so insistent on getting me a drink. I lied and said I was on medication but he kept insisting so I agreed to a water (because it comes in a sealed water bottle). Dude comes back with the type of glass that mixed drinks usually come in. The moment he gives it to me he leaves and I don't see him again for the rest of the night. The \"water\" went straight down the bathroom sink and I started looking for someone to walk me out because my alarm bells are going off.\n\nPartially due to my own impatience to get myself gone and partially because the one person I knew had also disappeared, I ended up just leaving without having someone walk me. Two blocks, straight line, mostly brightly lit... what could happen?\n\n  \nOnce again THE MOMENT I crossed the street and was walking that first block this voice in my head says \"You fucked up! YOU FUCKED UP! Get your keys out and get ready!\" I'm having a full on conversation with this inner instinct/voice/what have you, trying to figure out why I'm freaked out. I thought about heading back to the club and that voice said \"Nope! It's too late. Don't run, or they'll know you know. Just keep your eyes forward and be ready to jump in your car. Don't stop for anything!\" I'm looking to make eye contact with the parking lot attendant but he's not there so I have no witnesses to at least WATCH me get to my  car. Now, I'm suddenly terrified of that half a block of unlit road that I'm parked on. I almost froze at the corner but that voice said \"Go! hurry! NOW!\" Crossing that road into darkness felt like jumping into the unknown. I'm freaking out and I have NO idea why but now I'm picking up my pace and hoping I don't drop my keys because my hands are shaking so badly (and also, I've had nightmares like this before). For no reason! There wasn't a single thing that gave me reason to feel this panicked.....\n\nUntil I get to my car door....\n\nAs soon as I get my door open another car pulls up from behind me and slid into the spot directly behind mine. This is weird because it's street parking, so 1. they parked sloppy with the ass end half in the street, 2. they're parked facing the wrong direction. 3. Holy shit, I don't think they're meaning to actually park. I hit the door locks and start to back up. In my review mirror I I see the torso of some guy jump out and head toward my passenger door. I'm already pulling out of the parking spot but I could see his tensed up arm and closed fist just outside my passenger window.  I was terrified that I hadn't given myself enough room to pull out and would have to reverse again. Had he parked any closer, I wouldn't have had enough room! At that point I was FULLY committed to hitting the car in front of me if I had to because that voice was still screaming \"Don't stop! GO GO GO!!!\" \n\nAnd then I was gone. and that voice was gone. and I'm speeding down the highway in the most deafening silence I've ever experienced as I tried to understand what just happened. It took me a bit to put the pieces together but I THINK Drink Dude was spiking drinks and Car Dude was pick up. The more I think about it the more I get the feeling that it was a trafficking operation. If I had been two seconds slower for any reason, I can only imagine how that night would have ended.",

            "I matched with a guy on Tinder. We exchanged messages, and everything was fine, normal. We decided we would meet up for coffee in a week. A few days after we arranged the coffee date, he messaged me saying his father had passed away in those few days. He couldn\u2019t meet me in public. He could only meet me in private at his apartment. I trusted my gut, sent my condolences, but said I couldn\u2019t meet him somewhere private. He tried to tell me I could trust him because he had a dog. I still declined. He got really aggressive and started messaging me horrible things. He called me every name in the book. I ended up blocking him. I tried to find him later on, and he basically never existed. He could have blocked me on all social media. But I couldn\u2019t find a trace of him anywhere.

            "I was 15 years old and my mom dropped me off at McDonald\u2019s to get breakfast while she went across the street to get Starbucks. It was a shopping mall in suburbia and we were on the way to pick up a new kitten a few hours away. Instead of walking the 100 yards to my mom I sat outside waiting for her to pick me up. Teenagers I guess. As I\u2019m standing there a guy in an old station wagon with two kids in the back starts talking to me. He asks me where I\u2019m going and I say whatever town it was. He says he\u2019s going there too with his kids and asks if I want to come. I tell him no that my mom is across the street and he comes closer. My gut is saying something is off so I see a random woman walk out of Starbucks and I point to her and say that\u2019s my mom right there. He freaked out and left really quick. I still remember those two kids in the backseat. They looked so off. I wonder to this day if they are okay.\n\nEDIT 1: I did not tell my mom and I don\u2019t know why. I think I was scared she would be upset with me and not want to go get a kitten (I was barely 15 and teenagers are selfish buttheads). I finally told her a few years ago and she was super upset about it. I was so freaked out I didn\u2019t even think to get a plate. I grew up in suburbia but the rich kind of suburbia where this kind of stuff was never talked about. I wasn\u2019t into true crime so I had no idea what you\u2019re supposed to do. If I had the knowledge I have now I obviously would have handled it totally differently.",

            "A few years ago, when I was 19 and studying abroad in Europe, and my friend and I decided to go to Turkey. It was our first time really traveling on our own without a group and we decided to walk around the square outside of the Blue Mosque. We felt very safe during the day and decided to see the city at night with the lights. As we were in the square, we were hounded by typical store owner's trying to sell us something. Finally, most went away and as we were going back to our hotel, a younger guy approached us. He said he had a shop on the corner, which he pointed to with lots of souvenirs including carpets. I grew up with a lot of handmade, woven carpets from my parents travels to the middle east and Asia. I decided it would be a nice gift. So we follow him, when we get to what we thought was his shop, we stopped. \n\nWe started to walk in and he said not that one, the one around the corner. We poke our head around and sure enough see a store, only selling carpets. I started to get a slightly strange feeling but nothing overwhelming, so we followed him as we could see the store. When we walked in, about 13-15 other men were in the shop. They were pointing out carpets and showing us around and I started to get really uncomfortable. My friend seemed completely at ease, so we followed the group around the bend to the other part of the store. In Turkey, it is common to be offered tea, so that part is not particularly odd, but the men, who were now circling us, were insistent that we have tea with them in the basement. I kept saying no but they were leading us towards steps, completely surround us. We got to the steps and my friend started walking down, my body began to sweat, my heart went crazy, and I never had such an overwhelming fear. I kept trying to think of how we could overpower these men. \n\nI grabbed my phone, stopped in my tracks, and gasped. \"Friend's name, we need to go right now. My mom just texted me asking why we aren't back at the hotel yet cause the map shows we're at this store. We're supposed to facetime with them in 10 minutes.\"\n\nThe men kind of look around and tell us we can have tea in less than that amount of time. I keep insisting that my parents are freaking out because they can tell were in the carpet store and not the hotel and that they will likely contact the embassy if we don't get going. They continued blocking the staircase. I told them that we would come for tea in the morning as I still really wanted a carpet and that we needed to get out of the store and back to facetime. It took a little persuading but they eventually opened a path for us to go to the door. One of them followed us back to the square insisting that we return/come back and see them. Of course, we didn't.\n\nI have no idea if they were completely harmless or not but I had never had such an overwhelming feeling. They easily could've drugged us, placed us in carpets, and taken us out. My parents didn't actually have our location as my phone was on airplane mode. So who actually knows, on the other hand, I might've been paranoid, but it wasn't a situation I ever wanted to be in again. Once we were back at the hotel, she told me she was really scared too but that she thought I was fine so she went with it.",

            "I was in the Amazon as the end to a 3 month solo trip around Latin America. Wanted to enjoy one last walk through the jungle before leaving so left my jungle lodge around 8am to walk down to a small river nearby. \n\nI stop and close my eyes to listen to the sounds as the jungle is super loud with crickets, birds, insects etc. Almost immediately I got a weird feeling and felt really uncomfortable - which was weird because up until then I'd only felt peaceful and happy. When I opened my eyes, I realised everything had gone completely quiet which was definitely NOT normal and not something I had experienced in other rain forests I'd been to. It was bizarre. I immediately felt that I had to leave and fast. \n\nAfter I dipped and got back to the jungle lodge, i told the tour guide what happened and he said it usually only gets quiet when there is a big predator close by - thanks but no thanks!\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to address a couple of things in the comments.\n\nI was staying with a tour group in a jungle lodge in the Peruvian Amazon. Next to the lodges, there was a path that led down to a river, about a five minute walk, where we were told we could go down to swim. Previously, our guides had given us some free time in between tours to allow us to go down unaccompanied by them so I assumed it was fairly safe. They also said in the years the lodge had been running, they had never seen a big cat around there because they are usually shy and the activity in the lodges generally keeps them away. \n\nI took this walk around 8am on the last day just to listen to the sounds one last time as it was the end of an amazing three month trip and the jungle had been my favourite part. I had only been walking for around 2 minutes before I decided to stop to take in the sounds and say goodbye because we would be leaving shortly after. I definitely wasn't wondering off looking to do my own exploration! I had already spent an incredible (and guided) week there. \n\nIn regards to the comments about why insects would stop for a predator, the answer is that I don't know. I am just describing how it felt at the time. The birds, monkeys and crickets around me definitely stopped to a point of quiet that is alarming considering how loud the jungle usually is. But I'm in no way saying EVERY SINGLE LIVING THING IN THE ENTIRE AMAZON STOOD STILL. And then when I explained to the guide what happened, that's just what he told me \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

I did and a couple seconds later I came up around a bend with the road suddenly being covered in ice. I started to fishtail while sliding directly towards two people standing outside their car. They had wrecked in the same manner that I was about to do and were standing outside their car, with me heading straight for them. I quickly thought of my options and ended up doing a hard right straight into the highway barrier. I slid nearly 100+ feet dragging the front of my car to slow it down. Because I had decided to slow down, I was able to give the two guys enough time to get out of the way before I slammed into their cars. Even though I totaled my car, which was sad, I did not end up killing two people that night.

At one point in the night, she had come back into my room to retreive one of the smaller items and ended up moving the TV right in front of my wall heater, and didn't put it back. I didn't notice and went to sleep a little later. I don't know if it was the smell or a gut instinct but thank god i woke up because that night/early the next morning I woke up to find my room filling with smoke and a nice orange glow coming from the back of the TV box. Luckily no large flames had formed yet and I was able to stop it simply by moving the box out of the way, and of course turned off the heater and evacuated the room. The smoke wasn't super bad so the house didn't get too much and my room eventually stopped smelling of it.\n\nTL:DR mom almost burned the house down on Xmas but I woke up in time to stop it\n\nEdit: To all asking about the TV, it was fine, but thank you for your concern.",
            "I had gone to this bar back home with a few friends and afterwards everyone was supposed to go to this house party. I was game to go from the moment I was invited.

I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that we shouldn\u2019t go, but she talked me into it. When we got in my car to head to the party the guy feeling was worse. I grew up around cars and drive a manual (my best friend is completely clueless when it comes to cars) so I deliberately grinded the gears and jerked the car and made it stall, acting like something was wrong. I pretended to try to fix what wasn\u2019t broken and after about 15-20 minutes of \u201cfixing\u201d my car, cops and fire trucks followed by EMS flew by us.

            "I had a gut feeling I should pull my wallet and phone out of my purse. Not even 20 seconds later, I get mugged. The man dragged me across the sidewalk and stole my purse BUT all he ended up getting was a juice box and my birth control.",
            "I was going to meet up with someone from marketplace to buy a phone and the feeling hit me so I called the woman and a man answered trying to play off the fact he's a man and I passed by where we were meeting at and it was dark and I heard voices in the background on the phone call. I never stopped the car and kept going. Pretty sure I saved myself from at the very least a mugging but learned a good lesson, always meet in a public place.",
            "A guy definitely roofie'd my drink at a bar. \n\nHe was totally mild mannered and not creepy at all. Asked me how to sign up for karaoke and pick a song. Sat beside me and talked casually. Didn't touch me once. \n\nBut then he pointed to something behind my head to distract me. I looked away and looked back at him and he was looking away from me into the crowd of people. Was a very stupid way to distract someone, to point and then act like you didn't do anything as opposed to pretending to have thought you saw something. \n\nThen, I saw him screwing one of those little canisters back shut on his keychain. I asked him what he kept in there to call him out. He was cold and expressionless as he began to slowly twist it back open and said there was nothing in there.\n\nI stopped drinking my drink and he performed his song. Then I sang and he took off immediately after. It was really fucked up and I'm glad he wasn't very smooth or idk what could've happened. \n\nWhat always freaked me out was how normal he seemed (before he became suddenly cold and robotic when I called him out on that canister thing). But it made me realize, of course a rapist would seem normal - that's how they get close enough to you to attack you.\n\n_____________\n\nEDIT: Uhhh... *woah.*\n\nI did not expect this kind of response at all. I wrote my comment shortly before going to bed, and was shocked to have woken up to all this. ..I dont even know what awards actually do, I haven't been on Reddit that long.\n\nI thought if I were to ever blow up on here it'd be for a well-timed reference to The Office! I'm actually pretty bummed that of all things, this subject is such a popular one. I wish this didn't resonate with so many people. For all of you who went through something like this, or worse (after all, I went home safe) - I'm so very sorry, and I am praying for you, and I thank you for your support and kindness.\n\nIf I had bothered to proofread before submitting, I might have been more clear or thorough with information. To answer some of your comments/questions:\n\nFirst of all, I wasn't drugged - my drink was, and I took only 1 or 2 sips after he did it and didn't drink a drop more because I was suspicious, thank God. That's why I can remember what happened.\n\nAnd yeah, you probably have read this story before. This exact situation is unfortunately not too uncommon it seems. (Just take a look at the comments here. I can safely say I've read enough rape/near-rape stories to last a lifetime.) If you think I made it up for virtual points from internet strangers - that speaks to the way your own mind works, not mine.\n\nAs for the fact that I should have reported him immediately: I actually didn't put it together in the moment. At least, I didn't think I did - it was more a doubt in the back of my mind and I didn't fully believe it. I thought maybe I was just being paranoid and I didn't fully trust my own judgment. It was only after replaying the events in my mind and talking it out with someone else in the following days/weeks that I completely put it together and realized that the suspicion I'd felt had been right. I *wasn't* being paranoid or crazy. His intentions were very clear after the fact, but at the time I didn't realize it.\n\nI'm sure I should have gone to the police, but as I said, it took some time to even fully understand/believe what had happened. I did message someone working at the bar (who's friends with my ex's mom); she never replied to me and I didn't take it any further. I also felt ashamed and stupid, though I shouldn't have.\n\nI was not at the bar alone, but I was left alone - I went with my male cousin who is 10 years younger than me and pretty clueless, and he was hanging out at the bar getting hammered and waiting for this girl who worked there who he had a crush on. \n\nI can be pretty naive. I grew up pretty sheltered and I never really went through a \"party phase.\" Thus, I don't have a ton of experience going to bars or parties. So whatever you think I should have or could have done differently - I did the best that I could in that situation. And it's much easier to say that you would have done the perfect thing when you're not in the situation and you're not me.\n\nPS - He was a shitty singer.",
            "When I was young (around 8 or 9 probably), I lived 3 blocks from a convenience store. It was the early 90s. My best friend and I convinced our parents to let us walk to the store alone to get some snacks. Important to add that the two blocks closest to the store are connected but the 3rd block we lived on was it's own unconnected neighborhood. So anyway, as we are walking back from the store, we are coming up to the first street and a truck drives by and stops on the side of the road in between the first and second block on our side if the road. I stopped and told my friend that we should go down the first street and go through the neighborhood, come back out the second street and then head to our 3rd street to avoid the truck. She thought I was being stupid but I refused to keep walking on the main street so she followed me down the first road. We are now in the first neighborhood and about halfway between the first and second street when we see the truck slowly driving down the second street into the neighborhood. The driver sees us and immediately slams on the gas and turns his truck towards us on the street. We ran and hid in some bushes further into the nighborhoodbfor about ten minutes. We heard the truck driving by back and forth for about the first five and then it was quiet so we started making our way out of the neighborhood towards the second street again. Suddenly. Here comes the truck again slowly, sees us and guns it towards us again. We jumped over a fence into a back yard and started pounding on the back door. By the way this is a tuesday. Middle of the day during summer vacation... most people are at work. But miraculously, a man and woman open the door and let us in. The woman had just had a baby like a week before so they were home on leave. They called the cops and my mom and the man went outside. He said the truck drove by and the man saw him standing outside and sped out of the neighborhood. Cops and my mom showed up minutes later and we gave a description and never heard anything about it again. Our parents just drove us to the convenience store from then on. My mom still talks about it to this day and how shocked she was that I had such a strong intuition at that age.",
            "Walking my dog in a park and I saw a teen girl crying by herself behind a building. Decided to trust my gut and went up and asked her if she was okay and she said \"yes\" but I pushed her and she told me she was feeling suicidal.\n\nWon't dive into her reasons but I just sat and chatted with her about my own struggles with suicidal intentions and gave her my number in case she needed a shoulder in the future.\n\nShe's doing much better now it seems and though I've moved away, we still text occasionally. :)",
            "It didn't save me, but saved a friend. \n\nA big group of friends and I were walking home from an event in a town we weren't used to. It was night, and hardly anyone was around--empty streets and all that. We were walking down a sidewalk that had high fences next to it, so when you turned a corner, whatever was around it was out of sight.  One of the girls fell behind (distracted by her phone, I think), and I noticed, so I started drifting behind as well to become a sort of midway point between her in the group. \n\nSoon, we were nearing where we were staying, and our group rounded a corner, then started making their way into the yard where our living quarters were. I saw a car drive past us, then turn the corner down the street the girl was still on. As soon as I saw it, I suddenly got this suspicious, awful feeling, so I stopped, and went back to the corner to keep an eye on the friend.\n\nThe car drove past her, stopped, did a complete u-turn, and slowly started creeping up behind/alongside her. She was still on her phone, and wasn't noticing a thing. I stepped out from behind the corner, and started walking towards her. The car sped off quickly as soon as the driver saw me.\n\nIt scares me that someone could have grabbed her, and none of us would have seen a thing. It would have just been one of those cliche movie moments where you turn around, and realize a member of the group is missing. To compound that potential tragedy, she'd just gotten engaged a few weeks prior. \n\nI think the fact that we had worked with some safe houses in the area that discussed human trafficking probably aided in me being on high alert, and the area we were in was known for that sort of thing.",
            "I went to go sell an expensive smartphone I got as a gift on Craigslist in Philadelphia. I talked with the guy for a while about it and he just would not agree to meet me inside anywhere. I was young and stupid and needed money so eventually I succumbed. \n\nI hit a supermarket nearby and told him where I was, and stayed inside for a few minutes. I then realized how stupid I was for going alone to this sale and not meeting inside in a relatively public place. As I walked out a group of unscrupulous looking fellows asked me if I was selling a smartphone on Craigslist, I decided to just stroll on past and get in my car and leave. \n\nAfter they realized I had ditched the meetup I started getting all sorts of threatening text messages and voicemails from this group of guys. I am pretty positive I would have been mugged if I hadn't walked past them because of my gut.",
            "I was an unpopular kid, and I always wanted to go on sleepovers but it rarely happened. In 6th or 7th grade I get invited to this girls house for a birthday party. I am friendly with her but not close. I go to her house and I feel weird right away. Her mom and stepdad were sitting in the living room smoking, but being perfectly friendly. The whole night, I couldnt shake this feeling of oppressiveness, despair, and danger. I spent the evening keeping my guard up and keeping an eye out for the entire family, without any idea why. At night the girl begs me to spend the night. Even though it hurt to say no when I could tell she was desperate, I lied and told her my parents wouldnt let me, when they said over the phone they would.  A couple of months later, a student told me she had left the school and moved because her stepfather would molest her at night in her bed.  I think of her often, and hope she wasnt hurt that night, and hope shes doing better - but Im glad I got out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*my  apostrophe key isnt working.\n\nEdited to add: No, I didn't understand what was going on.

            "My family was out visiting relatives in California when I was about 12 years old. My brother and I were at a beach attempting to Bodyboard, with my dad keeping a close eye on us from the shore. At one point, every nerve in my body just screamed \"dive!\" so I ducked under the water. When I resurfaced, there was a surfboard floating away in front of me, some guy frantically swimming after it, and my dad waving us to come to shore. Apparently the second after I dove under water, the surfboard went over my head. Probably would have cracked my skull open if I had been there.",
            "I was hanging out with friends at a bar but then going to head to my friend\u2019s to stay the night. We drove separately though. It was in a city with a super high crime rate and in an even rougher part of town. We left the bar at like 3am and the drive wasn\u2019t far, but I was really low on gas and wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to make it. \n\nI\u2019m not normally a person who\u2019s paranoid over city/neighborhood crime rates and I spent like half my time in this city and in the area we were in anyway, so it wasn\u2019t foreign to me by any means. Even so, just to be on the safe side, I picked a gas station that was well lit and at a relatively busy intersection. I was the only car at the gas station and when I pulled up to the pump I luckily took a moment to text my friend that I\u2019d catch up with him in a few minutes.\n\nAs I\u2019m doing that, though, another car pulls up right on the other side of the pump that I was at. I have no idea what made me pause, but I just waited a second to let them get out first. But I had to keep waiting, because they weren\u2019t getting out. At first, I thought that maybe they were taking a moment to get their wallet, text someone, just doing _something_. I couldn\u2019t see through the window tint at all, though, but I also tried to not stare at them or make it super obvious. I\u2019m also not a very intimidating guy. \n\nI waited it out for 5 minutes and then started getting more worried. I texted my friend to tell him exactly where I was. I couldn\u2019t leave because I didn\u2019t have enough gas to get anywhere else and I didn\u2019t want to just drive to my friend\u2019s place in the event that they followed me. \n\nAnother 10 minutes later, the car pulled off. No one ever got out to get gas - including me. I just headed to my friend\u2019s and decided to risk getting there on what I had left in my tank. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what made me that paranoid in that moment, but I\u2019m really fucking glad I hesitated. \n\ntl;dr - Was real close to getting my car jacked at a gas station in the middle of the night, but decided to trust my gut.",
            "My boyfriend and I were visiting friends for a week in Phoenix. We girls were lounging at the pool while the guys were flexing their grilling skills. My boyfriend paused a moment, stood very still then told me to go get dressed, we had to go. Right now. I wanted to fuss but something told me not to. We drove straight through to San Antonio right to his parents very rural house. (before cell phones and they didn\u2019t have a land line within a half mile) Seconds before we arrived his little sister had jumped off of a rain barrel and landed on a metal spike that went straight up through her foot and into her leg. His dad was at work so there was no car available there. She was bleeding like crazy and his mother had just walked out and found her. I don\u2019t know what spoke to him in Phoenix, but it would have been all bad if we had not arrived exactly when we did.\n\nEdit... Adding a bit of history, and apologizing for posting this somewhere else? I\u2019m not a Reddit pro!\n\nCirca 1983\n\nMy boyfriend and I had an apartment together, he worked, I didn\u2019t. Every day I packed a nice lunch for him and made a good dinner. \n\nOne afternoon, nothing out of the ordinary, I was laying out at the complex pool and a older guy walked over to introduce himself. He wasn\u2019t hitting on me, he had just moved into town and was new to the complex. We chatted for three or four minutes when my boyfriend showed up at the pool. Odd, but ok. Introductions then we returned to the apartment for lunch.\n\nOnce behind the door of the apartment he said to me; \u201cStay away from that guy. There is something very bad about him. He feels like the bottom of the deepest ocean.\u201d\n\nIf you read my other post about the long sudden journey you kinda know that he senses things. In fact, the reason he came home during his lunch was that he had a feeling which he had before I was even at the pool. He just sensed something bad and came home.\n\nAfter he returned to work, I was taking the kitchen trash out and the man approached me again. I\u2019m former Army and in pretty good shape and he\u2019s older. No place in his swimsuit for a weapon and I could probably take him, plus it wasn\u2019t in a secluded place. I\u2019m not afraid.\n\nHe asked me if my boyfriend was psychic. \nAs it turns out, this guy is psychic and in fact recently transferred to San Antonio from a sister radio station to do his show there. He told me that when two psychics meet, often times they feel something like cold darkness because they are receptive of vibes instead emitting like most people.\n\nIn the end, he guided my boyfriend to better understand the things he sensed and they became great friends. \n\nHope this helps some!",
            "My dad had to go to court to settle a way overdue payment for the place he worked at. He was going to take me with him so I can be more exposed to the adult world so to speak. However that meant he would have to leave the office back door unlocked so the rest of the staff could clock in. He suddenly didn't feel right about it and decided to have me man the office instead. He got T-boned outside the courthouse on the passenger side of the car that day. The car was totaled and I would have gotten severely hurt if I was there.\n\nEdit1: wow didn't expect people to love this story so much. To help clear some things up we both first traveled together to his office to unlock the door. He got out of the car, unlocked the back door and When he came back to the car that's when he decided to tell me to stay at his office. It literally \"delayed\" him by only the few seconds it took for me to get out of said car.\n\nEdit2: thanks for the award kind stranger.",
            "this isn\u2019t my story, it\u2019s from an old high school teacher of mine. \nhis friends were bar hopping, they were all underage and traveling to a bar about 45 minutes away. it wasn\u2019t like this is the first time they were doing this or anything. all of the sudden, he got a really bad feeling and started panicking. his friends made fun of him and wouldn\u2019t let him out of the car, but it got so bad they had to dump him in this small town in the middle of nowhere. he used a pay phone and called a cab home. the next morning he saw that his friends had been in a car accident, obviously due to drunk driving. most of the friends died, one survived with a severe brain injury. his life was saved all because of a gut feeling. sometimes he has survivors guilt now",

            "One time when my little sister and I wandered off in superstore a strange man was standing behind us in the toy aisle and I was getting super weird vibes about him (keep in mind I was only around 9-10) and he also looked super shady, he had a big hoodie dark sunglasses\u2014- you name it! Just screaming serial killer.  \n\nso obviously my first thought was to just move away from him because we could just look at different toys anyways. Nope, apparently not. He just kept following us but maintaining a small distance at the same time and eventually I whispered to my sister that a man was following and we started walking in circles around different aisles to lose him until we found our dad. I remember how he looked at us one last time before walking away. I was scared of strangers for a while after that even though I was really outgoing as a kid. I was afraid he\u2019d followed us home for some reason.\n\nAnd looking back on it now he could have been trying to snatch us or something but maybe he just wanted to help but I\u2019m pretty sure there was something wrong with him.",
            "Not me, but my dad was driving to a client's office to do some IT work for them.  He left the house without his coffee mug so thought about stopping to get coffee but he said he just had a weird feeling and decided not to.  He gets to the office and goes inside, and 2-3 minutes later there's a massive crash outside.  When he comes back out into the parking lot he sees his car and the 2 parked on either side of it stacked up on top of eachother - his upside down in the middle - like a car sandwich.  Some guy was driving down the street and had a seizure and veered into the parking lot at near highway speeds.  Had he stopped for coffee he likely would've just been getting out of the car at that moment.",

He went to run a 2x4 through the table saw when he noticed I was at his elbow rather than behind him. He stopped and told me to never stand behind a board when it\u2019s going through the saw in case it gets thrown. I thought he was being overly cautious and I didn\u2019t have as good of a view from behind him, but whatever, I got behind him. He flipped on the saw and ran the board through. He only got 1/3 of the way through, though, when the blade hit a knot and flung the 2x4 hard enough to crash against the wall 10 feet behind.

            "I was on a road trip with my dad through mountainous terrain and it started raining. We were stuck in our car because of a traffic jam on a very narrow mountain road. I got a feeling that we should not be here and I told my dad that we should get out of the car just in case. My dad gave me a puzzled look but agreed after I insisted. It probably was only a minute that passed after we took shelter in a nearby tea stall that a thunderous sound startled the bejeezus out of us. Lo and behold our car was nowhere to be found. In its place was a boulder. A boulder the size of a house. From that moment onwards final destination has been my least favourite movie.",

She phoned an ambulance and, you know, I'm still here.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you all for the kind words and concerns.  This happened about 10 years ago and I'm in a much better place now mentally.

Later the girl told my aunt she had a bad feeling about the guy, and my aunt mentioned how she also felt nauseous but thought it was because she was so drunk. \n\nHad she not been stopped, my aunt would\u2019ve been Denise Naslund.

            "Saw a mannequin ominously placed by the trash in a dark alley. Almost walked away, but decided to check it out because something felt really off. Turned out to be a 15 year old girl who had OD\u2019d\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nSince people are asking, the whole story goes like this:\n\nTwo friends and I were filming a music video and got back to our friend\u2019s house around midnight. As we\u2019re walking in his backdoor I see the \u201cmannequin\u201d laying by the trash can. I honestly thought it was a prank at first because the alley was completely dark and the \u201cmannequin\u201d was laying perfectly under the one light in the alley. I decide to check it out and my two friends come with. As we get closer we realize that it\u2019s a girl. We figure she\u2019s mid twenties and probably just passed out drunk cause there\u2019s a bunch of shitty bars in the area. My one friend shakes her, after a few shakes she comes to and has this absolutely wild, animal-like look in her eyes. She hops to her feet, thrashes at us a bit, before taking off down the dark alley. She\u2019s understandably afraid because she just came to in a dark alley with three dudes hovering over her. As she makes her way down the alley, we try to tail her while giving her space because she\u2019s acting wild. I want to call the cops, my one friend wants to help her but not call the cops and get her in trouble and my third friend wants to leave her figuring she\u2019s just drunk and headed home. While arguing about what to do/ keeping our distance so we don\u2019t freak her out, we actually lose track of her but find her phone in the middle of the alley. Its got 100\u2019s of missed calls, it starts ringing so we answer it and it\u2019s an extremely and understandably upset friend who says everyone has been trying to get ahold of her. She says she\u2019s not in the state but says she will call her mom and have her call us in a minute. A minute later, the mom calls and tells us that her daughter is 15 and went missing earlier that night. She is eerily calm and nonchalant about the whole thing and says something to the effect of \u201coh she had her Wisdom teeth out earlier that day and is probably just messed up from the meds\u201d. She says not to worry about the cops, she\u2019ll handle them and her and her boyfriend will be by shortly to grab the phone.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the mom and the boyfriend show up with flashlights, grab the phone and all the info we have, make a few weird jokes and go off down the alley. The whole thing was weird but we figure they\u2019re not worried so we go on about our night feeling uneasy. The next day, my buddy calls me and says the mom showed back up at his house, has a full on break down in his living room, tells him that they found her down the road a few minutes after we met with them. Turns out she had downed almost a whole bottle of vodka and every pill she could find in the house. They had to pump her stomach and the doctors said if we hadn\u2019t found her and she would have been dead before morning. The mother then hugs my friend, gives him and envelope and leaves. The envelope had $1000 dollars in it. Luckily we had exchanged addresses with the mother earlier, so my buddy went and slipped the money back under her door. \n\nI say I don\u2019t know if she made it because even though she got saved that time, if she\u2019s 15 and going through that much, I just don\u2019t know. I think about her a lot and truly hope she\u2019s doing ok.",

The day I was to go and meet him my gut just felt like it was screaming no. The feeling was so strong I cannot describe it. It was unexplainable. I decided to go with my gut and made an excuse and cancelled the meeting by making up some excuse. He flipped when I told him and started threatening me and abusing me. I blocked his number and everything. Fast forward 2 months, saw him on news, he had tried to kidnap some girl from his college campus. So yeah, always listen to your gut I guess.",

Soon after that the building shook like crazy and glass went shooting around the room due to the ira car bombing that happened that day . When she returned to her seat she found a huge piece of glass sticking through her chair which would of definitely killed her. Luckily because of that she\u2019s here today so thanks grandpa\u2764\ufe0f",
            "I had an important meeting in another city. I fly a lot but I had a nagging feeling about the 3 hour flight I needed to take to get to the meeting. 2 Nights in a row before the flight I dreamt that the right engine would flame out causing the plane to crash. In the morning I dawdled enough that I missed flight CP414. \n\nThe plane made it just fine and I got fired. Got a better job 2 weeks later so my gut feeling saved me.",

Dude was having a seizure. His legs were stiff as fuck and his foot was on the gas. We were going downhill towards a busy intersection. We had the red. So I slammed the car in park and pulled the keys out. Car starts rattling making a weird noise but it gained so much momentum it was still rolling down. So I grabbed the steering wheel and veered us off the road into the side of an abandoned building. I opened his door and climbed over him. I was able to get him out and turn him on his side. The police officer that showed up was like \u201cyou couldn\u2019t have done this in a safer fashion?\u201d I just said \u201csorry\u201d but inside I was like \u201cfuck you\u201d.",

I turned my head to see my other cousin (the driver) fast asleep too, and the barrier alongside the shoulder getting closer. I quickly grabbed the steering wheel and jerked the car back into the lane. Gave them quite the rude awakening, and cussed out my cousin for falling asleep. Honestly one of the most horrifying moments of my life was realizing I was the only person awake in the car, but I wasn't in the driver seat.",

Heard a car backfire, turned around, and saw a late-ish model sedan speeding towards us, with more backfire sounds.

I said sure, took their money and order, and as I was walking in, a bald 40-something guy wearing a button down shirt walked out. \n\nI immediately was thinking that guy's a cop. I bought for me and the girls, and asked the clerk straight up if that guy was a cop. Clerk confirmed it for me. \n\nSo I walked out, told the girls to meet me across the street, and walked back to my dorm.\n\nAcross the street I saw the cop creeping behind a building in his unmarked Crown Victoria, and so I walked right back into my dorm without waiting for trap.\n\nThe whole thing was a sting set up outside a dorm to catch college freshman buying cigs for people a year younger than them. Such a waste of time. The girls were in on it, the clerk knew but had no choice, and because of my hunch and his confirmation, I walked right out of it with two free packs of smokes.",

One of the augers was chained to a heavy I beam which was sunk into the ground and the other auger was chained to a large 10 ton forklift in order to pull them apart. The forklift driver was in a bad mood, he was lazy, so instead of pulling the augers slowly apart he decided to reverse back and forward as fast as he could which put a huge amount of sudden shock on the 2 inch chains.

However, the selection of games was lacking, even for a launch day, so we decided to pack them in my trunk and hit the Walmart closer to our home along the way.\n\nSame luck on the game selection there, we decide to call it good enough and go home.  As we're walking up to my car, I saw this other car parked like three spaces down from us, on the other side of the concrete dividers.  You know that sensation when you're driving next to another car in traffic, and that car is perfectly in the middle of their lane, but you just \\*know\\* that they're about to blind merge into you somehow?\n\nIt was like that, but way dialed up as I just saw these two guys leaning against the car.  The guy by the driver's door sized us up, and then dipped down to the side panel of his door and pulled up a revolver.  I'm guessing that since he couldn't have possibly known about the consoles in the trunk, he thought we were dejected buyers arriving too late and likely all had 300 bucks in our wallet.\n\nI can still hear myself saying \"Just get in the car\", somewhat forcefully, and taking the lead to get the keys in the ignition immediately, and was already turning and driving away before all the doors were closed.\n\nI didn't think, I just acted, to the point I don't even really give myself credit for doing it.  All I know is that I doubt I'd have had the resolve if dude had caught me off guard and much closer with that gun.  But thankfully, my brain saw 'the car about to merge into me' for me.",
            "I knew the second I sat down on that bus that the fucker across the aisle was gonna follow me when I got off. Maybe it\u2019s because two weeks ago I\u2019d realized the guy next to me on the bus was gonna grab my ass when I scooted past him to get off the bus - and then he did exactly that. When I got the feeling, I trusted it. Without looking at that guy, I tried to make a plan. I got so nervous about getting off at a brightly lit, busy intersection that ironically enough I got off one stop too early, at a darkly, sparsely trafficked intersection. And you guessed it - the fucko followed me off. \n\nOn high alert, I hunched my shoulders and speed walked as fast as I could. The guy was keeping pace with me, not saying anything, just within my peripheral vision, a few feet back. Suddenly, without warning (except that of my spidey sense) the guy lunged at me and tried to drag me into an alley. Luckily in my twenties I wore a lot of rings, and I wasn\u2019t entirely unprepared. I punched him as hard as I fucking could in the face and ran screaming towards that brightly lit, busy intersection. Everyone stared at me, but nobody bothered me until I made it all the way home.",

We chatted for a couple weeks and I couldn't put my finger on it but something just didn't feel right so I just stopped texting one day. A couple weeks went by and he messaged me to say hi. I ended up looking through the previous messages to try to remember why I stopped texting. I couldn't pinpoint a single reason. He seemed fine. I thought maybe I was just having a bad day. So I asked him out. We went out a couple of nights later. \n\nI didn't really find a connection with him in person. He seemed like a nice guy and all and he was as good looking in person as he is in pictures. But he just jibber-jabbered about topics instead of trying to have a meaningful conversation. Annoying and not my thing but harmless. \n\nSo we get to the end of the date and I decided to get coffee at his place. No future for a relationship, but maybe he's good in bed, y'know? We were making out on the couch a bit and suddenly that feeling hit me again. He was on top of me, but not even pressing down on me that hard, but for some reason it just felt so oppressive and scary. I told him I needed to get home and left. He was definitely annoyed but let me leave without a fight. \n\nI got in the car and as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot, he was texting me. I texted back as much as I could while driving (like at stoplights and shit). I assured him it was me and not him and he's a great guy, blah blah blah. He just kept texting. I started ignoring them because I can't text and fucking drive in the dark in the rain. So he starts Calling me. I answered and he started giving me a lecture about how \"unprofessional\" what I just did was. He started out calm then just kept getting angrier and angrier. I hung up on him. I don't have time for that bullshit. \n\nDude texts and calls all. Night. Long. It was terrifying. He slowed down in the late morning hours. I think he finally got a little sleep. Then started up again and continued on for the better part of a week. I reported him to tinder and was seriously looking up the process for getting a restraining order. He finally just stopped on his own. \n\nAnd this is why I use a fake name on tinder and listen when my gut tells me something!",

My youngest sister and I decided to venture onto the mainland and find a bar to grab a couple of drinks. We ended up going to Beaufort and finding a local bar.  We had a couple rounds and I noticed this one guy, who seemed to be friends with every other patron there, constantly looking in our direction. This gave me a sinking, eerie feeling and I immediately closed the tab. A few minutes later, out of suspicion, I look back into the main part of the bar to see he had amassed a large group of those he was talking to earlier and they were all walking in our direction without this guy breaking eye contact. We casually got up and, once outside of their field of view, ran like hell to our car (I didn\u2019t realize at the time how idiotic drinking and driving was...I most certainly do now).\n\nI still get the heebie-jeebies thinking about it and no, this was not just paranoia.  There was a definitive intent of this group to come directly our way and a few casual dead-eye locks throughout the night told me to watch this guy closely.",

Yeah it was mine.\n\n Want to know what I did next??? I fucking called her. Like standing there. Just thinking please pick up please don't be dead, I'm not moving until she picks up. What the fuck who does that?\n\n She started moving pretty quickly and picked up and said \"hey I got in an accident and my leg is hurting can you come pick me up?\" I walked over and she was laying there teary eyed and said \"damn what the fuck that was quick\" it was definitely the most amount of emotions I've every felt at the same time",

            "A couple years ago I was in the passenger seat while my boyfriend at the time was driving. It was about 1am. At the time I NEVER wore my seat belt while in the passenger seat, even in bad weather (stupid, I know). On this night weather was normal, everything was fine, when all of a sudden I got an extremely intense urge to put my seat belt on. It actually felt like there was someone whispering in my ear: \"put on your seat belt NOW\". I didn't at first because I didn't want him to  notice and ask me why because I wouldn't have been able to explain I guess? Again, stupid, I know. After a minute or two I couldn't withstand the urge anymore so I put it on, as quietly as I could. About 20 seconds after I put my seat belt on a deer ran in front of his car. It was bad. We hit the deer going about 40mph and the car was totalled. He later told me that he noticed me put my seat belt on before the accident and slowed down from about 50mph to about 40mph because he thought that I put it on because I thought he was going too fast, but he chose not to say anything. I think about that accident a lot and I wonder if something different would have happened had I not put my seat belt on.",

The following night and actor/ singer she liked was going to be there and her husband asked if she wanted to go again with him and his brother and she agreed. However, as she puts it, she just didn't feel like going again and didn't know why. So they cancelled those plans and her and her husband went out to dinner and this new sci fi movie called Star Wars. That evening, there was a gigantic fire at the Beverly Hills Supper Club and over 160 people died with 200+ injured. Star Wars likely saved my mom's life.",

            "Growing up we always had horses, my parents often broke and sold them, they were in rodeos and it was just part of our life. We never wore helmets when we went trail riding, stupid I know but everyone was just so relaxed about it. We were supposed go on a ride that day but my mom insisted on going to the store and buying us helmets. That day I was thrown of my horse and the entire back of the helmet was completely destroyed. I had a sever concussion and ended up in the hospital. The doctor told me with out the helmet I would more than likely have suffered a severe brain injury leading to mental deficits. I will always ride with a helmet because of this day.",
            "My husband and I lived in an old farmhouse when we first got married, which had ancient appliances. We were saving up to move in a year or two, so we were trying to limp everything along until we could get a new house and new appliances. I'm SO lazy about laundry, like I'd rather do one load every day than have a set laundry day (well, back before kids, anyway!) But one day when we were backing out of the driveway to head to town I got this urge to start a new load of wash because I knew we wouldn't be back for awhile and it would mean more work later on, even though I had just thrown clothes in the dryer. I wavered but eventually ended up running back in. When I stepped into the kitchen, adjacent to the laundry room, it was filled with smoke. I ran to the laundry room and there was a ball of smoldering lint behind the dryer with flames just starting to singe the wall. If I hadn't run back in when I did, we would have lost EVERYTHING. 30 minutes from town with no neighbors, for sure nobody would have noticed until it was too far gone.\n\nALWAYS CHECK YOUR LINT TRAPS.",
            "Was leaving a friends apartment, guy in the lobby asked me for a ride the next city maybe 45 minutes away, for 200 bucks. I was short on money and almost did it, but I just had a terrible gut feeling to decline and get out of there. Watched the news the next day, the guy was in jail. Apparently he murdered somebody in the other city, evaded police to get to the apartment I saw him at, and was trying to get back to move the body/evidence. He got busted with two kids about 17-18 he convinced to drive him there. I can only imagine if that guy got in my car and told me his plans...I'd have freaked and probably be dead or in jail right now.",

Nothing out of the ordinary. I went to kiss my girlfriend goodbye and something stopped me. It was really strange and i couldn't explain it. I do it anyway, its a normal goodbye, nothing strange at all. I head out the door, get into my car, and try to put it out of my head. About 10 minutes down the road the nagging just doesn't go away. I call 2 hours personal time in at work and head back to the house. I walk up to the door, and open it up to some man I've never seen on the floor playing with my kids. My girlfriend comes around the corner in obvious panic, he looks at her, then me, then back to her, and bolts for the back door. I let him run away cause I wasn't about to pick up a charge for hitting him. She had been cheating on me for 2 months now and he had been coming over almost every day. Angry and violent that she had been caught, she instigates me to hit her over and over. I say goodbye to the kids, grab some clothes and my laptop and leave. Things went way down hill from there but as of the 18th I now have full custody of my children, and I'm in therapy to try and fix the damage this has done.",

We walk back the three blocks to my place and as we\u2019re going inside all these cop cars fly by and appear to stop at the 711. We start thinking to ourselves wow wonder if that guy did something but didn\u2019t really investigate. \n\nNext day, we hear all over campus that two other students were at 711 and the guy who yelled at us pulled a gun on them.

For some reason, before we left, I felt ADAMANT that my brother should keep my dog in his room with him instead of leaving him downstairs in his favorite chair. My excuse was that I was worried about my dog getting too cold, even though that usually wasn't a problem. Finally, after whining about it, my brother agreed to keep him for a couple hours.\n\nHe called after dinner to let us know that the huge clock on the wall downstairs, that we thought was perfectly secure, had fallen off the wall and directly into my dog's chair.

            "TL;DR: intuition and fear made us book it out of a national park that was on fire.... it wasn\u2019t when we entered but it was by the time we left. \n\nAnd EDIT: here\u2019s a link to some photos on imgur, there\u2019s more if you go thru my profile too \n[imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/GdYYsOT) \n\nOh my god okay this is perfect timing. My husband and I are so n our annual Christmas through NYE camping trip (Australia in case you\u2019re wondering why anyone would choose to freeze their asses off at that time of year. It\u2019s 35 Celsius here).\n\nWe planned to stay at this fair remote National Park campground we\u2019d stayed at a few years previous in a place called Wadbilliga National Park. We arrived at about 4pm, set up camp, had a quick swim, made dinner, washed up and went to bed. However we couldn\u2019t sleep. We were both really genuinely afraid. We didn\u2019t know of what... it\u2019s a really isolated area and we had planned not passed 3 other vehicles on what would have been an hour\u2019s worth of 4x4 tracks. We couldn\u2019t put our finger on it. Did we suspect those people in those 3 vehicles of being a danger to us? No, but we were still afraid to go to sleep.\n\nFinally at around 11;30pm after hours of to-and-fro, we packed up everything in the pitch dark and drove 25kms out of the National Park onto private farm land where we took a risk and set up our tent and got a few precious hours of shut eye. \n\nAt 6:15am we were awoken by the farmer whose land we were on, she wanted to know what we were doing there. We apologised profusely and told her how we\u2019d felt under threat in the National Park and had driven out in total fear. Her exact words were \u201cGood thing, too. The whole bloody place is on fire and we\u2019re evacuating now.\u201d\n\nSo yeah turns out a tiny grass fire that we\u2019d passed on our way down to the NP had grown over night by like 2000 hectares and turned into yet another massive and out of Christmas Byron bushfire. When we got out of our text our vehicle tent and other items were totally covered in ash that was rapidly falling from the sky. It was unbelievable and really frightening. Can attach photos if anyone is interested. \n\nBloody wild.",

Usually my mom and I took my car since it was in the city with a narrow parking garage that made it nearly impossible to navigate in my parents truck. Even though we had only gotten a light dusting of snow, something common in MN, we both felt we should take the truck that day.

            "I was returning from a friends place around 2am or so. We stayed up playing an xbox game I rented from redbox. About a mile from my apartment complex I notice a car which seems to be following me but I figured I was being paranoid. Once I get into the complex lot the car is still behind me but the complex housed over 45 apartment buildings so it wasnt unlikely that they lived there too. My apartment was one of the first ones so a find a spot close to my place and turn off the car when I notice that same car is directly behind mine. I wait another 5 seconds or so, could have been 30 for all I know then deliberately reach in my glovebox and leave it open. I continue to sit there appearing to have a weapon(i didn't) for what felt like 5 minutes before they drove off and another few to muster up the courage to get out. I didnt see that car again, im not sure if they were lost or intended to mug me but I was going to do my best to avoid them either way.",
            "Didnt save me but saved my quite a few of my friends. \nThis was a few years ago now. I used to keep my phone on me at all times as it was my safety crutch. I was sat talking to my mum and didnt have my phone on me but something was telling me something was wrong. I didnt have my phone for about 10 minutes, went to check and saw that I'd missed multiple texts and phone calls from my best friend. Instantly knew something was wrong. Rung her phone and ran out of the house. She was sat in the park opposite my house and had overdosed. Took her back to mine and we managed to get her into a hospital. \n\nAnother time I was working and someone had asked if I wanted to stay for drinks (I worked in a bar). Normally I would but something was off and I headed to my friends flat. Luckily I had a key and let myself in. There was a pillow on her floor and I was going to leave it but again, decided to move it and found a bunch of tablet packets. Turns out she had also taken an overdose and I had to ring an ambulance and she also ended up in hospital. \nThere's a few other examples but these are the main ones. \nI seem to have a knack at knowing when people are trying to hurt themselves or are really down. I keep my phone on me at all times now because of it. But if I feel off, I check on my friends to make sure they're okay. Always listen to your gut you could be saving a life.",

Dudes dad gives me three pills and down they go. I don't know why but as soon as I swallowed them I got a weird feeling like I wanted to leave. Basically screamed at my friend until she agreed to go. Halfway home I'm foaming at the mouth going in and out of consciousness. We get back to her house and her mom took me to the ER and turns out I'd been drugged with something definitely not aspirin.",

            "This past summer I was going through some mental health stuff. I was taking an antipsychotic and when I went to get it refilled, doctors would always be like \u201cthat isn\u2019t something to take alone. It\u2019s normally used to help an antidepressant so here\u2019s an antidepressant to help\u201d despite me saying I felt better. Whatever. I took the antidepressant.  \n  \nThings started going wrong really fast. Mental health was declining faster than ever before. Like walking to my university campus at midnight and randomly crying or driving myself to the mall randomly and calling my mom and crying to her for no reason bad. I felt like I was losing control of my mind. All while suicidal thoughts and beyond crazy spending habits were coming out. \n  \nI was walking to class one day and just knew something was wrong as I felt this random crying spell about to come on again. So instead of going to class that day, I went to my campuses mental health clinic and saw a psych nurse and a doctor who were both like \u201cit\u2019s bipolar disorder. We\u2019re gonna send you to the mental health unit at the hospital for further evaluation.\u201d Anyways, learned that treating bipolar disorder with an SSRI is bad and can cause a mixed episode(high and low at the same time) so they tapered me off the SSRI and am getting proper treatment. It was just scary feeling like I was going crazy and couldn\u2019t stop it.",
            "Don\u2019t know for sure if it saved me but here\u2019s a story.\n\nI was walking at night because I live in what\u2019s supposedly a very safe neighborhood when I see this guy walking towards me. Not a big deal, it\u2019s a big place with plenty of other people. But then he starts calling out to me, and moving kind of erratically. I thought he might have been hurt so I took out my headphones and asked if he needed help. Usually I wouldn\u2019t feel threatened by something like this, last time someone called out to me in this neighborhood they just wanted to know if I\u2019d seen their cat anywhere. But something felt very wrong and I just kept thinking \u201cyou need to leave now. Run as fast as you can.\u201d \n\nIt was snowy out so I didn\u2019t want to run, so I just started backing up quickly as this guy came towards me. I ask again if he needs help and he\u2019s way closer than before. All of a sudden he drops whatever act he was trying to pull and starts running towards me. I bolted out of there as fast as I could. He must\u2019ve figured that he wouldn\u2019t be able to run over the ice like I was and gave up running quickly, but still walked at a slow pace. Heck, I don\u2019t even know how I ran over the ice like that, I didn\u2019t own any snow boots so I was wearing rain boots with the soles worn down to having almost no traction at all. \n\nI was running for home when a voice told me \u201cyou need to go the long way around.\u201d I was thinking, are you out of your mind? It\u2019s barely a minute to my house and the long way takes 10. But for some reason I listened and ran the long way round (running for 10 minutes in the cold with bad lungs is a horrible idea by the way, especially after the sudden burst of adrenaline). \n\nWhen I got home however it turned out to be a good thing, as I realized that the guy would have most likely figured out where I lived pretty easily had I gone the short way, as the short way was one street and the long way was a maze of many. Never saw him again, but I did see some random (I\u2019m assuming drunk) dude hiding behind his car staring at me, until I said \u201c...I can see you dude\u201d and he did that exaggerated tiptoe walk back inside his house. \n\n\u201cSafe\u201d sure. I hate this neighborhood.",
            "This happened a long time ago, but one night my mom woke up sort of out of the blue, you could say (she\u2019s a pretty heavy sleeper). When she woke up she had some trouble going back to sleep so she decided to preoccupy herself for a while and check on the baby in the crib. Good thing she did, because when she checked, the baby had their little face planted into the pillow in it. She described the baby\u2019s face was quite literally blue and had obviously been suffocating. She rushed the baby to the bathroom to try anything that would save the baby\u2019s life. Eventually the baby\u2019s face returned to a normal-ish pale colour and saved the baby from certain death.\n\nThis was almost two decades ago, and that baby was me.",

We had gone to a \"city\" for the weekend, and was in a mall with my folks.  Mum was in a shop, Dad needed to go to the toilet so I waited out in the mall.  A man came past and asked me if I could help him get something out his truck in the car park - he had a bad back and couldn't get up into the truck to reach it.  Naive me at first went \"no worries\", and followed this strange man down to the car park.  When we got down there, he opens a small door at the back of the truck and said \"it's just up there, but I can't get in - jump up there and grab that box for me.\"  It took all the way till that time, but gut finally kicked in and I bolted back upstairs.  Still think about how close I came that day."

Then move to an entirely different area and practice these skills. I won't be aging, so I will need to plan in drastic moves, possibly to different countries. But with wide based knowledge, it is not hard to work your way into positions that pay well and interest you. Keep moving every ten or so years, and never aim to be famous. If I ever get bored, go back to bar tending and auditing classes. Bar tending makes you meet all kinds of people, and the new classes would give me new skills to try out.",

Go to gallery openings, mingle and network.

She must age really well) People die and leave rare art to me, or I become highly adept at dealing black market art, and spotting the next big thing, I\u2019m a remarkably well known art critic after all. Amass a great fortune and become an eccentric recluse, everyone thinks I might be a vampire.",

Then, time will strike, and you will die.\n\nAnd I'll still be here. All I have to do, is nothing. Take care of my things. My phone? Two generations behind, worthless. But in three hundred years? The rare earth metals alone will make me comfortably wealthy. The whole phone, as an antique? Priceless. My clothing? My dishes? Furniture?

If my degree is somthing to with space I would go and work for nasa/space x etc if not, with the money I've made from this business I will go to university again.\n \nBefore this however I need to stop the news spreading about my lack of aging.

The plan is to make me be very unnoticeable to my family. I would have probably distanced my self from having friends so it just my close family I have to worry about. I would go about this by slowly but surely making my self seem more busy with my business: excusing myself from family gatherings etc.\n\nSince that's dealt with and I've finished the degree I need I'll go work at NASA. My reasoning behind this is that I would need somthing infinite to keep me busy and the only I can think of that ik interested in is the universe \n\nFrom there on it's pretty simple.

            "Emperor Gaozong of China. This is kind of an obscure story, so let me tell you the whole thing.. It was the 12th century. when people talk about how China used to be the most technologically advanced part of the world, this is the period they're talking about. Some historians that they were on the brink of industrializing. Then Manchuria invaded and conquered northern China. The imperial court retreated to the south and declared Gaozong, the Emperor's brother, as the new Emperor.\n\nChina's top general Yue Fei (who, according to some records, literally had \"patriotism\" tattooed on his back, though that might have been made up by a someone who wanted to emphasis how unfair the rest of this story is) rallied he army and defeated the Manchus, and was raring to chase them out, but he gets orders from Gaozong to back down, because he'd rather negotiate. These negotiations end up signing away the north half of China.\n\nA few years later, the Manchus invade again. Yue Fei beats them again and pushes all the way back to the old capital (Kaifeng). Then he gets the order to retreat. He responds with a letter saying that he's got the Manchus on the ropes, and he can reconquer Northern China in like a month. No, says the emperor, retreat immediately. Eventually, Yue Fei does retreat, but he delays long enough to evacuate the city first, making up some logistical issues as an excuse.\n\nAt this point, you may be wondering why Gaozong was so reluctant to push an advantage. The answer is that his brother was still alive- the king of Manchuria liked to bring him out once in a while and make fun of him. If Yue Fei reconquered China, he might liberate the rightful emperor, and Gaozong would be out of a job. As such, Gaozong was actively trying to throw the war.\n\nAnd he interpreted Yue Fei's delay at the end of this war as meaning that he had reached the point of at least considering going rogue, so as soon as Yue Fei got back, he was arrested, and promptly executed on treason on the ground of of \"err...he might have done something\". Presumably because the optics on the actual charge- \"Almost winning a war we wanted to lose.\" were too bad. People realize that this is bull quickly enough, and there are protests, but Gaozong manages to pin everything on one of his advisors and placated the mob by executing him.\n\nSo how does this effect the long-term progression of Humanity? Well, as I said, China might have been on the brink of industrializing at the time, but didn't have access to enough coal. There are coal deposits in China, but they're all in the north. Second, the Manchus never really got their internal issues sorted out, and 70 years later, were easily conquered by the Mongols, who then recruited a bunch of disaffected Chinese siege engineers. This essentially removed the one weakness of horse-archer hordes- they're not good at taking fortresses- and allowed them to wreck half the world. Had China been united at the time (and had been ruled fairly recently by a guy who had, if you recall, been taken prisoner by invaders from the north, so you can bet the defenses would be fairly well maintained) they probably could not have done this. So had it not been for the malice of this one man, the Mongols would probably never have become the juggernaut they eventually did and the Industrial Revolution might have happened about 500 years head of schedule.",

            "Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty in China ordered the fleet of Zheng He, the greatest trading and exploration fleet of the time, to be burned during his reign in the early 1400\u2019s. This was the beginning of an era of isolation for Chinese kingdoms, which ultimately lead to the collapse of imperial China, and indirectly to the rise of the PRC. Additionally, the wealth of the world overall decreased as a result of reduced trade with China, and if China had continued exploring it is possible that they, not Europeans, would have colonized North America (instead of merely *maybe* discovering it then telling no one as they did in history). \n\nIt may not be a significant alteration of human progress, but it\u2019s one of those events that sets the world in a definitively different direction.\n\nEdit: didn\u2019t say the Chinese *did* discover America, just that they *might have* because it\u2019s been theorized that they did and they had the technology (I mean, the Inuit and Siberians have been crossing the Bering Sea in leather kayaks for thousands of years, so the Chinese definitely could have done it too if they wandered up that far).

But upon arrival they will tell us \"I never said I had chest pain\" Yet we ring and ask for a transcript of the conversation and there it is.\n\n9/10 times we have to take them into hospital to check they're okay just incase there is any heart or lung issues, but people will lie to get things seen quicker through the emergency pathway.

But let me clarify this is a small amount of people but they're definitely there.\n\n\n\nEDIT:  (My personal opinion) For all those saying \"This is why things shouldn't be free\" This is a minority of people who do this, all of my patients are treat with dignity and respect, I've had people who've come off motorbikes, attempted suicide, heart attacks, pulled muscles, chest infections the works.

            "Early days of networked PCs. DOS and NetWare. I worked in a computer lab on campus. There weren\u2019t a lot of management utilities available at the time so I, and a few other /student employees, wrote batch scripts and small programs to automate a few things when a student or professor would log on to the network.  Having that sort of access led to numerous pranks being pulled but most of us were savvy enough to figure it out and undo the prank. \n\nHowever, we had two coworkers who liked to loaf a bit too much for our liking. They were not at all technical and had taken the lab assistant job because they thought it was easy money. They had conspired to be assigned to a remote classroom lab (that rarely had any students in it who would need assistance) for most of their working hours. They would just sit around and play games on the PCs while the rest of us were, you know, working.  Clearly this could not stand. \n\nI rewrote a piece of code that was executed when every single user signed on. If the username was either one of these two AND they were signing in on a PC in that remote classroom AND it was during their working hours it would look at an innocuous file on the network. The file merely had a few bytes in it which noted how long it had been since this prank had last been triggered, insuring that it would run once or twice a week maximum. If it did activate, it would launch a terminate and stay resident program which would wait a random time, between 5-15 minutes and then drop an image of two dudes 69ing on the monitor for a few seconds and reboot the PC. \n\nTested it. Put the compiled program in place and deleted the source.  Much hilarity ensued for the next two semesters.\n\nEDIT: Well, this seems to have struck a chord with more than a few! Here\u2019s an interesting bit that I did not share initially. This was the late 80s early 90s and decent online porn, much less gay porn, didn\u2019t really exist \u2013 think ASCII art. So where did I find this image to use?  One day I, and a few of the other student workers, were playing around with a new disk utility that helped visualize where space was being used; an important thing in the days of 20 MB hard drives. We had meant to use it to see where some of our network storage had gone but the utility scanned all the drives on a PC including the networked ones. At the time, as fate would have it, sitting in the CD ROM drive was a Borland Turbo C installation disc. It popped up in the final report as having a single hidden directory(labeled \u201cxxx\u201d of all things) that contained more data than the entirety of the Turbo C installation combined. It was all porn and in high resolution 640x480 VGA glory to boot. \n\nA hidden folder containing nothing but pornography had somehow managed to be included on Borland\u2019s CDROM that had been purchased by thousands of businesses and educational institutions!",

I had one *immediately* at the opening of the only door into the room with several back up skeletons and skulls just behind at a table together watching on.

My dad pointed me in the direction of the breaker which was in our garage and showed me the lever to pull which would cut all power to the house.

The first thing i heard was from my aunt \" OH MY GOD, IT HIT Y2K HIT!!\" I was only going to leave the power out for 10 seconds or so but the lever was stuck and i couldnt get it back up for about 2 mins, during which the whole time i heard my family freaking out, then eventually they looked outside and started to wonder why our neighbors still had power, haha thinking back i really wish we would have recorded this probably could have won 10,000 dollars.\n\nTL,DR pulled the greatest prank in history on new years eve 1999",

I had all the attention. *The baby* became nothing more than just a pudgy flesh ball strapped to my Mum\u2019s chest. I basked in the attention. I lay on the floor pretending to be really hurt and dazed. I remember someone asking if they should phone an ambulance - my Dad refused and just picked up me and had me in Grandma\u2019s bed the rest of the day whilst everyone bought me lots of ice cream.",

            "I had this one done to me.\n\nBrother and I were on a week long packrafting (single person rafts) trip in Costa Rica. There were 4 of us total in the group. We\u2019d paddle during the day, then pull over on riverbank mid-afternoon and set up camp. Repeat next day.\n\nThere was one section of river that was Class 4/5 which is above our skill level. That day our group would hike up a mountain and down the other side to get back to the river where it calmed down again. We had to hike with packs containing all of our food and supplies and the rafts (they deflate and roll up).\n\nThe company that put on the trip arranged for a local farmer to guide us on the hike. It turns out he had a horse, so we wouldn\u2019t have to carry 50+ pounds each up this mountain! However, we did have to do the first half hour or so of the hike with the packs because the horse couldn\u2019t make it all the way to our camp.\n\nCamp was on one side of the river, and the trail started on the other. In that spot there was a high footbridge that the local village used to cross. We\u2019d scramble up about 50 feet from the riverbank, then cross the bridge and get on the trail.\n\nIn the morning we took down camp and packed everything away. I got my backpack loaded and left it where we\u2019d start scrambling, then went to help with something. \n\nIt was time to go. I put my shoulders through the backpack straps and started pulling. Nothing happened. \u201cWow, that\u2019s heavy!\u201d I thought, worried about how the rest of the day would go (miles and miles, much of it uphill). My brother commiserated with me as he pulled on his own overstuffed bag. I think he even offered to trade backpacks as a show of sympathy.\n\nWe scrambled up the embankment and crossed some fencing to get to the bridge itself. When we were about halfway across the bridge my brother said \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d The next thing I saw was a large dark object fly next to my head and a huge splash in the river, 50 feet below.\n\nThen another, then another. This was accompanied by my brother\u2019s raucous laughter.\n\nIt took me several seconds to put two and two together. The scoundrel had placed several large rocks into my backpack when I turned away! No wonder it was so hard to lift!\n\nBest prank I\u2019ve ever seen, even though I was on the losing end of it. \n\nSadly I wasn\u2019t the only victim. That night when we finished hiking and unpacked everything at the next camp I discovered one last rock. He claims he had forgotten how many he put into the backpack, but doubts exist... The poor horse - already loaded down with 200+ pounds of our group\u2019s gear - had unwittingly carried a useless and heavy rock.\n\nWell played, brother.",
            "Waaaay late to the party and something like this may have been posted already.\n\nUncle got a new truck.  Was really proud of it.  We all go to a lake about 200 miles from home for the 4th of July for a week or two, many of us driving to and from multiple times.\n\nHe shows up and is bragging like all get out.  Get the bright idea to add a bit of fuel to his tank every day, not much, maybe a gallon or two.  Get a guy on the local golf course's staff in on the joke, he agrees to bring us fuel for cash and provide storage for... well more fuel (this makes sense later.)\n\nFind out one of my uncles has been doing the same thing\n\nHe's gotten about half a tank added during the few days he's been there, so even after putting ~100 miles on the truck going on nighttime cruises with his wife, he's got more fuel than when he arrived.\n\nHe heads home and calls us all, \"28 miles to the gallon!  And it's a 6 cylinder!  Can you believe it?\"\n\nHe comes back the next week.\n\nTime to reverse the trend.\n\nSiphon a bit off every day.\n\nHe has to fill up before he leaves.\n\n\"I- I don't understand.  I'm getting like 12 miles to the gallon.  It was so good before...\"\n\nFuck it.\n\nAsk if I can ride home with him and get picked up.\n\nGet back into town and distract him inside his house; other uncle comes by and practically siphons the tank dry before adding a gallon.\n\nNext day he's talking to my grandpa about returning the truck.\n\n\"4 god damned miles to the gallon!!!  It's bullshit.\"\n\nThe look on his face when grandpa started cracking up and revealed the whole thing was priceless.\n\nSorry for it being late and long; I hope someone sees this though and gets a laugh.",
            "This will be rightfully buried because it's so dumb. But it makes me smile.\nAbout 20 years ago I was a teenager and I was touring a brewery with a few of my cousins. We were guided through the various rooms of the brewery and, eventually, came to a large room filled with pipes and huge copper tubs. We gathered in a semicircle around the tour guide.\nThe guide proudly described the brewing process. He discussed the selection of hops, and produced a bag of hops for us to pass around, inviting us to smell and handle it. I just happened to be first in line. I took the bag, sniffed and handled the hops, then passed it to my cousin who, in turn, passed it to the lady next to him. \nThe same happened with malt, barley, yeast, etc. He handed me a sample to sniff, handle, and pass around. \nI had been eating a peach during the tour. I finished the peach while the guide was talking, and I was left holding a wet, lumpy peach-pit. \nI couldn't help myself. I sniffed the pit and handed it to my cousin. He rubbed it, sniffed it, and handed it to the lady next to him. \nI watched with rapt attention as she sniffed it and passed it along. Each time it changed hands I giggled harder. \nFinally, after the peach-pit travelled 80% of the way through the line of people, a woman raised the pit and interrupted the tour guide. \"Sorry, what was this?\" She asked. The guide looked confused, paused, and suggested, \"Um.. looks like a peach pit?\"\nI fell to my knees laughing and have never been happier since.",
            "Not me, but my ex.  \nAt their fire station they have sleeping quarters. One of the guys found a remote controlled door bell. The target was selected because he was short. They placed the door bell over his sleeping quarters, on the other side of the ceiling tile. There were two remotes, so randomly the other guys would ring the doorbell throughout the night. The target would ask everyone if they heard the doorbell during the night and everyone played along that they didn't. This prank played out for several months.  \nI am friends with the target's wife and she confided in me that her husband was having a hard time sleeping at the station. I managed to get more information out of her and then told her the truth. She thought it was the best damn prank and promised not to tell him.\n\nMy ex was getting sick of the guys ringing the bell at all hours, since they rarely got more than  an hour's sleep on a given night. He told the guys they needed to bring the prank to an end. So on one night they rang the bell every five minutes until the target lost it. He woke everyone up (or so he thought) and made them sit and listen for the sound. Finally one of the guys climbed up and pulled the bell down.  The target wasn't made, but relieved that he wasn't losing his mind.",

            "My brother was in a band that toured the country, so he was gone for months at a time. This guy had maximum level charisma. Like, if he attempted lockpicking, he would legitimately die because god had put all of his points in charisma and handsomeness. All of them. He got girls by just sneezing in their general direction. That\u2019s not an exaggeration. Once at a party at ASU he sneezed on a girl and within three hours they were tearing each other apart. It was ridiculous. Anyway so his band mates and I came up with this prank where we would all wait in designated spots with props, when we knew he would be bringing a girl home with him. Tony was in the closet, with a sombrero and an acoustic guitar. Zach was under his bed (he had a raised mattress, like two feet off the ground) and Jacob was behind the largest dresser (he was abnormally thin, and fit with ease.) when my brother went out to go pick this girl up, i hurriedly called all of them and told them \u201cHES GONE TO GO PICK HER UP HURRY UP\u201d and within 9 minutes everyone was at the house. Jake filled up water balloons, and Zach put on a Freddy Krueger mask. I had whip cream. He comes home, they start having sex, and Tony played a single D chord on the guitar. That was the signal. Zach erupted from under the bed screaming, Tony burst out of the closet in whitey righties underwear and a sombrero playing that song from Rango where rango fights the bull, and Jake started pelting them with water balloons. I came in at the finale and covered them both in whip cream.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak to any of us for like three days.",

Afterwards a Localization Project Manager at a bigger Korean company. Worked my way up to maybe, maybe one day be hired by Nintendo. Lost more and more passion for games on the way, heard awful stories about working at Nintendo and slowly realized that this isnt the right job for me after all. Translators are - most of the time - underpaid and the whole thing isn't as romantic as it seems. Decided to do something entirely else, left the gaming and Localization industry and am now a really happy (and well paid) Product Manager for an e commerce company. I will never go back.

            "When I was in college, I wasn't the most enthusiastic student. I barely hung onto my grades and spent most of my time partying. I mostly hung out with a buddy of mine who played drums for a thrash punk band that was on the cusp of being something.

I played like five shows with them and had a hell of a time doing it.

Something I always dreamed about. I was top of the class, constantly won awards for my work. I honestly thought I was going to make it big. Then the final semester started and all the seniors were required to go to a special hiring event where tons of big names would be. I got my portfolio and resume copies ready to go, and spent hours researching the big names and their projects as well as rehearsing lots of practice questions.\n\nIt was devastating. No one would look twice at my stuff. Introduced myself, made some awkward small talk as they were so disinterested, then as I walked away they would immediately put it in the stack with hundreds of other portfolios, and not in the special pile.\n\nI switched up my game. I started introducing myself with a quick mention that I had a background in programming (I did). Thinking that maybe that would give me an edge. Oh boy did it work. Suddenly I was getting personal business cards, phone numbers and emails, my resume was put on the special pile.\n\nIt was at that moment I realized I went into the wrong field. I was just a tiny insignificant drop in a sea of artists, many of whom were much more talented than I could ever be.\n\nFinished up my degree and went back to college for a BS in Computer Science.

            "I made a solid run at becoming a writer. It was always my dream as I\u2019ve been an avid reader my whole life and have always had an active imagination. I studied English in university, read everything I could and spent my 20s living and travelling overseas. I joined writers groups, did an apprenticeship with an established author and worked my ass off for years, both abroad and when I returned home. I even got a few short stories published. And I was miserable. \n\nWriting fiction has to be the worst paying job in the world when you factor in the time you put in (Stephen King references this at the start of On Writing). Writers like King are extreme outliers, and even he had to work a 9-5 while writing Carrie. It is extremely hard to grind out a job all day, then come home and try to write all evening. Or get up at 5am everyday and write before work. Not only is it difficult to conjure up the juice you need to write when you\u2019re working around a \u201cregular\u201d life schedule, but everything else in your life slips. You don\u2019t have time to workout. You miss out on spending time with friends and family. You\u2019re sitting in you desk or chair every night while your partner is watching TV alone. And if you have kids... good luck. \n\nI became overweight, depressed, and miserable. I developed back issues from spending 12+ hours a day in a chair. I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere in life, and while it was nice to get published the odd time, I didn\u2019t find the joy in my own writing the way I do in others. So I let it go. \n\nNow, I have a great job, nice house, and lots of time to spend with my wife and pursue my hobbies. I fixed my back issues and got in great shape (until COVID) And I have grown so much as a person since then. So no regrets. \n\nI do think about it from time to time though. I still read a lot, and I\u2019m sure that itch will come back sometime. It\u2019s not like being an athlete... nothing to say I can\u2019t pick it back up any other time\n\nEdit: wow! Thanks for all the awesome comments. A lot of people asking me how I fixed my back lol, so here it is:\n\nMine started with soreness and the tingling down my leg. I had a couple bad episodes which I now know was the result of a compressed disc. This would eventually devolve into a full blown herniated discs of my L4/L5. Seriously it was awful. One of the worst times of my life. The pain was excruciating and debilitating. I couldn\u2019t drive and I slept on my living room floor for months. Work was awful, even with a stand up desk and I had no quality of life. \n\nWhether you\u2019re trying to heal a disc or prevent it before getting that bad, this is what I recommend:\n\nThe key is in decompressing and strengthening.  You have to focus everything on those two things. \n\nTake pressure off you back by:\n\n- losing weight (I used a ketogenic diet. This also helped mitigate inflammation)\n- get an inversion table. I got a cheap one off Amazon and with a prime membership, the shipping was free. I used mine every day \n- I did decompression therapy with a PT, though once we went too far on the machine and it actually made it far worse for a few weeks. \n-Yoga and other stretching exercises\n\nAnd work on strengthening:\n\n- at my worst, I took a reduced schedule from work and went to the YMCA every day. I worked with a trainer to do very basic strengthening poses and worked my way up. I also got in the hot tub and sauna every day\n- I progressed slowly to doing more body weight, yoga, pilates and low intensity strength training, focusing on the back, butt, glutea and hamstring chain. Seriously, i totally rebuilt this part of my body, going from mushy soft to hard muscle and buns of steel. I remember vividly my wife giving me a butt tap one day and going, \u201coh\u201d. That\u2019s when it sunk in how effective is been at this. \n\nGave it time to heal:\n\nUse all the weapons you can. But go slow. Definitely use CBD and really watch your diet. This is huge to help reduce inflammation. \n\nIt was a lot of hard work but I did it and avoided surgery. (By the time my turn can, I was healed.  Thanks for the delay Canadian health care!) in all, this was an 8 month process \n\nAs for other medical - I was on painkillers at the beginning. I tried to avoid them but I was in an insane amount of daily pain and eventually gave in. I was very careful and controlled though and gave it up as soon as my pain started to subside. Obviously you have to be extremely careful with these or force yourself to avoid them all together if you can. I also never got the cordisal shot. Being in Canada, the wait times are ridiculous, so by the time it was offered, I didn\u2019t need it. But the moral of this story is you can totally fix yourself, even something as severe as a herniated disc, with hard and meticulous work. You have to be motivated by the desire to not become a lifelong victim to your back pain, as I was.",

            "I was a child actor. I was relatively successful - I was on a popular soap and even had my fifteen minutes of fame - I had TV shows and films and commercials on the go. Of course this meant I was bullied at school - if I answered their incessant questions about what it was like on set, they said I was stuck up for talking about myself. If I didn't answer their questions, they said I was stuck up for not engaging with them. I was talked down to, ignored, laughed at - the usual high school stuff. But for most people, that stuff ends in high school. For famous people, it never ends (as we see on the internet daily). \n\nThen I met someone on set who told me what it was really like - that if you're not made for it, the fame part can completely destroy you as a person - if you are private or shy or anxious, as I am, it can tear you apart inside, and it's constant, and for the really famous people, it never, ever goes away. She helped me recognise that what I loved was the process, the on-set family, the job itself. The recognition, the total lack of privacy, and the inevitable bullying just wasn't what I wanted my life to be. She showed me that at this early stage of my career, I could make my choice, I didn't have to just stumble into a lifestyle I wouldn't easily be able to get out of. She showed me the truth - that for most people, by the time they know they hate the lifestyle, it's already too late. \n\nWhen I was 18, I quit my agency, and never looked back. Now, 19 years later, in my office job in finance, I make a fraction of what I could have made, and I don't enjoy my work nearly as much as I enjoyed tv and film sets. But I'm anonymous, and I am happy. The girl I met, these days she can't even go to a grocery store or a petrol station without being mobbed (we're not still in touch, but I follow her career). Me, I can go anywhere and do anything without anyone giving me a second glance. That makes me happy. I hope she is happy too.",
            "Part of me regretted it, part of me knew I had to.\n\nI always wanted to be a doctor. No pushy parents or anything like that. I just wanted to fix problems and medical things seemed like the most interesting problems, things change, get worse/better, add new problems.. My little brother was born and developed seizures and development issues. I decided Pediatrics was for me! The same problems/puzzles but with the added intrigue of the patient being unable to tell me what was wrong.. Sounds a bit sick, but that's what my brain wanted.\n\nI didn't get the grades at school, unfortunately my step dad died and it messed me up a bit being needed at home with my siblings and I shifted my focus. I did go to university, did an access course and a biology degree with the aim of then going on to medicine afterwards. Sadly, I got two rejections for med school (on my birthday no less) and I pissed away the rest of my final year, because...what was the point anymore??\n\nI then met a boy (now husband), and needed to get a job. Any job. Please just give me a job. Countless applications were ignored or rejected. I felt worse than useless. I finally landed a job at a call centre. Hated every minute of it. But bills got paid, a wedding and honeymoon have been paid for, and we bought our house..\n\nBut. In 2019 I knew I was turning thirty soon and knew this wasn't what I wanted, even if it was what I needed.\n\nI enrolled at a local college on an access course and last year I passed with distinction. I applied to a few university courses, and I had two successful interviews. I quit my sucky job on new year's after nearly 6 years of hating it. And in two weeks I start my course to become a nurse.\n\nPlans change, needs must. But I'm hoping its worked out...",
            "Honestly turned out great. I realised my band wasn\u2019t going to get a record deal after a few years and then after playing for other peoples bands for a while it started to become less fun. \n\nI got a \u2018proper\u2019 job, started working on my career and used my new spare time to start playing rugby again. Now I\u2019ve got a really good job in a sector I enjoy working in, married, kids, nice house all that stuff and I still play rugby on Saturdays (pre pandemic) to keep things a little different as well as keeping in shape.\n\nI don\u2019t really see it as giving up on my dream. It was just recognising that it wasn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019m very fond of that period of my life and having spent quite a few years chasing that particular dream I don\u2019t have any regrets or what-if\u2019s about being in a band.",
            "It went extremely well. \n\nInitially trained wanting to be an actor. Got accepted into a company touring around Europe, but then decided it would set me down a path that would most likely not work out. Chose instead to take the more secure route to study physics which I also enjoyed. \n\nI had great ambitions to become a professor, but that dream quickly died part way through my PhD. Worst years of my life of workplace bullying, stress, and eventual depression. I have no regrets about leaving after I passed the defence. \n\nWent on to leave academia to get a job in data science within the financial/insurance sector. It is far from a fulfilling career, but is secure and pays well. It gives me the freedom to live my life comfortably and have recently been able to afford a house as a direct result of my career choice. I am happy now. \n\nI sometimes wonder how my life would have turned out had I chosen a different path, but realistically I don\u2019t think things could have turned out much better than they have now. Maybe I\u2019ll try a new passion once I\u2019m more financially secure, we will see.",
            "At age 15 I started playing guitar in a band. The dream was to become a Rock Star. At age 22, I was playing Gazzari's on the Sunset Strip. A set of original tunes in club where so many famous people started. It was the heyday of the metal scene and that was happening in Los Angeles. By 1984 I realized that it was not just a question of being a great band. Or writing great songs. I had seen a lot of great bands in Los Angeles that had great songs, go absolutely nowhere. Then really crappy bands, I won't mention names to avoid hurting anyone, that did have commercial success. So why was this?\n\nIt turns out being a great band that writes great songs, is just not enough. You also have to be incredibly lucky. More people win the lottery than become famous rock stars. It was time to get real. I was 22 and I wanted things. So I gave up my dreams and became an electrical apprentice.\n\nBy the time I was 24, I was running jobs. At 27 I was accepted in the IBEW as a journeyman electrician, after passing the Journeyman Block Test, accepted in a lot of states. At age 31 I became a Master Electrician and General Foreman in the IBEW. I then became the Superintendent of a large Union shop . And finally at age 33 I started my own Electrical Contracting business. At age 41 I became 100% disabled and was forced to retire. That was almost 20 years ago. I still have my Bray Amp and my Les Paul in my bedroom, always plugged in, so I can pick it up anytime I want. So, I'd say everything turned out ok for me.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI want to thank everyone that replied. I can't possibly answer everyone, but I will answer a few of the most common questions.\n\nFirst, I was not hurt on the job. I have fibromyalgia. It started in 1986 and slowly took over, until 2002 when my doctor tole me I was not returning to work. The major symptoms of Fibromyalgia are chronic pain and chronic fatigue. I thought I was just over worked and needed a break, but it was not to be. Forced retirement was a very difficult thing because I got a lot of my self esteem from my job. I also made a lot of money. Playing guitar definitely was an important part of adjusting to not working.\n\nI don't have any recordings left. Most of them were stolen in a box that contained guitar pedals that was stolen out of my garage in the mid 80's. My brother still has some reel to reel to real 4 track recordings, but doesn't have a 4 track player to play them or mix them down. \n\nAnd also, it was so nice to see how many of you had similar experiences to me. Very uplifting to hear from you all.",
            "This will probably get lost in the comments - but a family member of mine got laid off years ago, so he decided to actually pursue his dream and go to law school. He finished and was practicing law but his family was still flat broke and he was barely getting by. \n\nThen the job that laid him off years ago called him up and asked him to come back - and now he's about 6 months away from retirement. I asked him if he regretted it and he said absolutely not! He loved practicing law, but his job now allows him way more money, lots of benefits he wouldn't have had if he was practicing law, and a hefty retirement package. When he has time off he and his family can actually enjoy themselves. Is it his ideal career? No. But it was worth it to adjust what he wanted to do when he wasn't working.",
            "It's not a fancy dream like most here. But I dreamed of opening a childcare center (daycare) for low income families back where I grew up. Went to school for early childhood education, took specialized courses in childcare administration, worked as a teacher for a while in daycare and private kindergarten. In that time, got pregnant with my daughter and was making so little money due to childcare costs (even with the employee discount) that I left for an office job. Never completed my bachelor's let alone the master's degree that is usually needed to be a daycare director in my state. \n\n Slowly climbed the ladder in office roles, making 1% more than my teacher wages, then 2, then 5, then 100, then 250, then 350, then 400, then more and climbing..... As a friggin recruiter. A boring, non creative, emotionally unfulfilling role that helps candidates but exists to serve the company. I do some training on the corporate level and I get to train in other areas such as my improv comedy team that I'm a part of, so I do have creative outlets. But a part of my heart will always want to be a daycare director.\n\nI still doodle my dream center layout. I browse inventory catalogs and look at current staffing costs. I check out every center that I drive by. \n\n But knowing that I'd be doing a difficult job for less than 1/3 of what I make now, as a center director? Nope. Can't do it. Can't kill myself to help someone else. Did that my entire life. Gotta worry about me now.\n\nEdit: all of the comments you are leaving are really nice and appreciated. I posted here because I thought it might be an interesting perspective to show that somebody can be happy outside of their career despite it not being their dream job.\n\n I absolutely love the company that I work for and I think it would take a miracle (or firing me) to get me to leave that company. It's the first place I've ever worked where they truly entirely love their employees and treat them very very well. While I do miss the optimism of working in the childcare industry, I don't miss the living hand to mouth. Currently the highest paying daycare director job within 50 miles of my home pays $25,000 less than I make now. That's a massive pay cut. \n\nI would need at least four, probably six years of college at a minimum in order to move forward, not to mention capital. I can't imagine going back to school and spending what would be more than 3 years of my salary as a daycare director to get a degree in a field that pays significantly less than I'm currently making without a degree. I can't put my family's financial stability at risk like that. That would set us back literally a decade at a minimum.\n\nSo while it sucks to let go of this dream, doing a job that heartily pays my bills allows me to invest in my hobbies. I'm part of an improv comedy team that has been wildly successful in our area, I'm on two awesome podcasts, and outside of a pandemic I get to teach improv to adults and children. I'm still a teacher. I'm still a facilitator and a director. I'm very happy. And unlike when I worked in childcare, I can actually afford to go on vacations and take days off of work.\n\nSo I say, if you need to, ditch one dream to find a job that funds your other dreams. That's where I'm at and I'm happy.",

            "Worked out well for me! I was a professional poker player in my early 20s (not the cool guys you see on tv, picture a guy in a dark room dispassionately clicking between 4 screens of low limit, looking like he hasn\u2019t showered in 3 days because he hadn\u2019t showered in 3 days). That description sounds sad but it was actually great - made my own hours, was making a very solid, dependable income. Plus, since it made my living situation, income and time very flexible, I moved across the country and lived with a friend (and 7 other people) who were far more social than me and ended up being very social and outgoing for the first time in my life.  It was basically arbitrage, and when the poker boom started to fade, I used similar strategies to supplement my income with sports betting.\n\nI quit for 3 reasons: 1) I didn\u2019t see a future (I am not a risk-taker, and it was obvious to me I would have to move up in risk acceptance to continue making a living, as the online poker boom faded out), 2) it was pretty apparent to me that my job could be done better by a bot or someone with advanced programming/algorithms, so that\u2019s just a matter of time and 3) I met a girl! And the girl (now my wife of 12 years) had no problem with poker, but for the first time in my life, I saw myself as wanting the suburban kids and picket fence life. Poker wasn\u2019t really fun any more, and playing against drunk Brits at 4am my time wasn\u2019t going to work for me for the next 30 years.\n\nI had a business degree, so I just went out and started a boring 9-5 call centre job in a sector that I figured would always mean I had steady work and a middle-class income. My after-tax take-home pay was less than half of what it had been from poker/sports betting.  Decision-wise...so far, so good! 10 years later, I\u2019m solidly in the kind of 9-5 pointless middle management job that many people would absolutely hate, but I am very happy with. Because my new dream is my family and kids, and my job means that we always have a roof and groceries, and I\u2019m there for every recital or soccer game or first new food or chapter book, etc. Sounds like a pointless dream to some, but it\u2019s not one that was forced on me, it\u2019s one I chose. And I\u2019m thankful that I did pursue poker and was able to leave it when I was ready.\n\n\nEdited for grammar, clarity",

            "TLDR: I went from being a pro musician, signed to a label to working IT Security. I make great money but I'm kinda miserable. \n\nI go back and forth. Mostly regret. Covid has given me a strange new perspective on what is and isn't worth pursuing in life. \n\nI was a former professional musician in my late teens to mid twenties. Got the degree, started a band, worked our asses off and got signed to a label that later became notorious for ripping bands off. (Name rhymes with Prick Story Bread Chords)\n\nI toured the country, played in front of thousands of people, recorded a couple of kick ass albums and played gigs several days a week for nearly a decade of my life. \n\nProblem was, that entire time: I didn't make a fucking nickel. I was broke ALL the time. I didn't officially move out of my parents house completely until I was 24. I had apartments and roommate situations, sure, but for many years I had to have my safety net of my Mom and Step Dad, which is embarrassing. \n\nI remember the day I decided to quit the band I was in. We drove 12+ hours to Atlanta for a music festival, only to be told on arrival that we were bumped from the bill. Not only that, but the promoter (aka dickhole) decided to compensate us with a measly $100 for our inconvenience. $100 split among five dudes. It wasn't worth the hard work anymore, living in a van and eating gas station food and military rations to survive. I quit the band not long after. \n\nLong story short, I transitioned into IT. \n\nI make six figures, own a house, have a wife and a top of the line Nissan Armada Platinum in my driveway and frankly, I couldn't be more miserable if I tried. \n\nI constantly get shit shoveled in my face. \n\n\"Chingparr, fix this!\"\n\n\"Chingparr, what's the status on this situation?\"\n\n\"Chingparr, sorry you're on your honeymoon but (dogshit software) just went down and we need your help\"\n\n\"Chingparr, you arent professional enough.

You need to be perfect.\"\n\n\"Chingparr, you did 99% of your job perfectly but didn't send an email fast enough. You're useless.\"\n\nSorry... got lost in the rant but my point stands.

The first time I applied, I got rejected roundly. I worked real hard on my profile and applied again. I got accepted into an MS course, and got rejected for all my PhD applications. I decided I'd do the MS and then look to continue a PhD. I had done a few internships and decided I wanted to be a researcher in the industry. It seemed like the best of both worlds. \n\nThings kinda went according to plan, but my close friend in the program killed himself, and that started this spiral of depression.

Then my parents called, and told me my father was diagnosed with cancer. I couldn't afford the pay cut to be a grad student anymore. My family needed my income.

Lots of them were fresh out of undergrad. \n\nAnd by then, my dream of being an industry researcher had become impossible too - lots of my dream employers had fired their researchers or integrated them into innovation teams where they couldn't just be working on cool stuff that would take years to become a reality, they had to work on short time horizons. A PhD wasn't really going to give me what I wanted. \n\nI found a job with a nice startup which worked on exciting problems, and which paid very well. I have completely ditched the idea of being an academic. Now I just want to save up enough money to take care of my family without having to hold down a stressful job.",

I always dreamt of being on Broadway and spent my childhood up until college taking lessons and performing. I luckily decided to go to a regular college with a great theatre program instead of the full on conservatories I\u2019d considered. After a semester I changed my major and never looked back. I saw people I considered to be way more talented than I struggling to make it and I didn\u2019t want that life. \n\nNow I have a lifestyle where I can support the arts by seeing shows, I sing in a women\u2019s group, and I have a bucket list goal of being in one more community theatre show.

And later a medic. I met a beautiful woman and married her. We had and raised 4 wonderful and highly successful daughters together. And we now enjoy 4 Grandsons. This New Years Eve, we celebrated 35 years together.

            "Not exactly what you're asking, but pretty similar.\n\nI wanted to be an airline pilot since I was around 4 years old, ever since I got a chance to go visit the flight deck during a flight (this was pre-9/11).\n\nThe first thing that went wrong is that I was going through a tough time when I was going my GCSEs, so didn't do great in them. (For anyone unaware, GCSEs are the main final exams you do in school. In most subjects, these exams are what give you your final grade. It's not like the GPA system, where you're constantly graded, only these final exams matter.) But this wasn't a huge issue, I can resit the exams when I'm ready and get better grades. \n\nFast forward a few years, and due to various different things going on in my life, I still haven't retaken my exams. For a little while, I did give up on the dream because I couldn't see any possible way of being able to afford to train to be a pilot (it costs around \u00a380,000-\u00a3120,000). So I starting taking minimum wage jobs to start paying my way. \n\nAnother couple of years later, I heard of a guy from my local pub who's an electrician, and he was looking for an apprentice. It's something that interested me so I took my shot and got the job. I quickly learned that the average pay for an electrician on construction sites was around \u00a31,000 a *week*. \u00a352,000 a year. A few years of training then a few years of working, I could be in the flight deck by the time I'm 25. The dream chasing was back on.\n\nA couple of years into my training, I come across a cable I'd never used before. It was a DALI cable, which is used for lighting control. A normal power cable in the UK will use the colours Brown, Blue and Green & Yellow stripes for the conductors. DALI cables have two more conductors, one red and one black. I couldn't tell the difference between the brown and the red cable. \n\nHere I was at 23 years old, hearing what no aspiring pilot wants to hear for the very first time in my life; that I could be colourblind. I thought it couldn't be true, as I can see colours, and surely it would have been picked up on earlier. I took practically every colourblind test I could find online, and it was unanimous. Red-Green colourblind. To top it off, this meant I couldn't complete my apprenticeship as an electrician.\n\nSo here we are today, I'm now 3 weeks away from being 27. I work for the UK's most wonderful creation, the NHS. The money is by no means great, but it's enough to get by and I absolutely love my job. I could see myself staying here for the rest of my working life. **But** there's not a day goes by that I don't think *what if?* It's often the source of my poor mental health episodes. It's almost as if my purpose has been ripped away from me, and I don't know why I'm actually here now. \n\nIn essence, I can't fathom how one could walk away from their dream, because losing mine crushed me. It wasn't my choice to give up on my dream, but I fucking hate it. I would give anything to be up there.",

            "Well, the funny thing is what would actually happen if Facebook suddenly shut down.\n\nThey can do that - if the business bankrupts. And, if that happens, then all instagram, whatsapp, and such, will probably shut down at the same time.\n\nSo, countless users, who were heavily relying on facebook, will lose contact with their relatives, friends, and such. From the communication's point of view, this will be the equivalent of surviving a ferry crash but getting separated. People will be massively trying their best to find each other.\n\nSome sport clubs, that relied on facebook's group system, will be paralysed. This can lead to the cancellation of major sport events, because half of the team went out of reach.\n\nA lot of users will have their donations to charities just disappear. Imagine collecting money for wheelchair for your child, you collected a lot, then suddenly it all disappears and all that's left is credit card chargers of donors, and your reputation of a scammer.\n\nUsers of the Oculus VR systems will most likely have their hardware bricked - because it relies on the app that requires internet connection. Eventually some hacker figures out how to run SteamVR without the oculus app. Still, it won't be a supported solution, and every now and then SteamVR update will break it, and force the hacker to work on it again.\n\nAll instagram pictures will just disappear without a trace or a backup. Those who heavily relied on it to store their holiday and family memories...\n\nMaybe it will not cause significant changes to the society, but will definitely be a lot of mess. Globally. Maybe except for China.\n\nThis will be another Wall Street crash.",

            "Nothing current but I have a great one from 5 years ago:  \nSo we had a guy who was quite the Libertarian. He owned a gun store in town and pretty much kept to himself. He will be known as LibGuy\n\nThe problem started when he decided to have chickens for his own eggs but he lived within the city proper which had a rule against farm animals within the city (this is a rural farming area I live in). One of the city council members (he shall be known as A-hole) discovered he had chickens a few weeks after he got them and the city sent him a letter telling him he had to get rid of them. Well, he was not going to go down without a fight. So he spent some time looking into things and discovered the A-hole who reported him lived within the city and he also had chickens.  \n\n\nWell, this of course caused a bit of a scandal. The city ended up claiming there was a grandfather clause for anyone who had livestock within the city prior to the rule change 17 years ago. The problem with that was that clause applied to the A-hole's father, not the A-hole who lived at the same address. Needless to say, the war was on!  \n\n\nA couple of weeks go by and the town cops are messing with Libguy over petty shit. Libguy somehow gets a recording of A-hole calling the police and lying to them about what Libguy was doing. Police now want to charge Libguy for some absurd ridiculous recording law that really doesn't apply since it was someone with the police dept who gave him the tape not that he stole it. This gets blown up to the point where the bigger cities news crews are now showing up to city council meetings that are being called to address this issue. These meetings are getting absurdly blown out of proportion and in all honesty somewhat slimy and jicky in how the city is handling it. Libguy subpoenas the city council emails to show there was a concerted effort to fuck with him and cover for A-hole.   \n\n\nWell in the course of getting the Emails it was discovered that there was a sexting issue going on between three of the city council members. LMAO, believe me when I say this did not involve people that would be considered sexy. all three (2 women and 1 male) were married, 200lbs plus, and in their 50's. I mean Emails about double-dildos, pegging, swinging...etc..It was hilarious.  \n\n\nIn the end, the Libguy got the last laugh. he lost his chickens but found a loophole where he could actually own Llamas in the city since they were not considered [livestock. So](https://livestock.So) he put up a fence all around his yard (ugly chicken wire fence) just tall enough so the Llamas could not get out by jumping. People actually would go by walking their dogs and pet the Llamas. The problem though was that Llamas shit like cows and it stinks in such a small enclosure. This went on for about a year until he sold his house and moved (it stunk for at least a block around his property and he lived right behind the town's grocery store). Two of the council members involved got divorced over the sexting issue and the third one sold her bar because of it.\n\nThis was the infamous chicken scandal that plagued my town of 4K for 3 years.",

Well, it is one long street which was, for some reason, divided into little parts when it was named. Definitely not confusing when you're looking for an address and don't know which house belongs to which part, but you get used to it eventually.\nNot only does the street have enough names yet, but they wanted to rename the section in question after a famous person who went to our town when he was a child. On holiday. He didn't live here. He didn't do anything here. He went on holiday during the summers.\nNow, since that is the only really famous person we ever had in town (not counting local celebrities), one party in the city council wanted to commemorate him in some way and make our town more attractive to tourists.

            "I was born to a teen mom, and a single one at that. I definitely had a lot more freedom and less supervision as a child since both of her parents (my grandparents obviously) passed away soon after I was born, so there weren't many options for babysitters. Since she worked two jobs I would often be on my own after school until about 8 or 9 at night, sometimes later. \n\nShe definitely struggled to hold down jobs due to not having an education and the overall grind would eventually get to her. At one point she was walking 11 miles a day to and from work because we didn't have a vehicle. Eventually, we lost our home and we remained in and out of shelters until I was about 12. \n\nI learned ALOT about the world in those days. At the time I hated it and was jealous of other kids having normal lives. Now that I'm older, I wouldn't trade it for the world. It gave me every bit of motivation I have, it gave me better social skills (gotta learn to make friends quick when you move frequently), and most importantly it taught me to be humble and never view less fortunate people as beneath me.she was diagnosed with cancer when I was 13 and died when I was 15 which sucks, cuz IMO I grew up to be a good person and good father. Would love to have her around to see it.",
            "I\u2019ve noticed that I didn\u2019t have the same opportunities as other kids because being a teen mom can lead you down a road of struggle and poverty if you don\u2019t have help from family. \n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to play sports, but she could never afford the equipment needed at school to be apart of it. \nMentally, I\u2019ve had to mature faster at a young age because she was still a kid herself. It\u2019s unnerving to think teachers would tell me I seemed older than my age at 10 years old.",
            "I was born in 1964 when my mother was 16. Grandparents adopted me so I\u2019d have a \u201cname\u201d.  Father\u2019s family paid for the hospital bills and that was it because they didn\u2019t want to ruin his chances to go to VMI. Mother had three other kids from at least two other men and tried to treat me like a little sister although a girl in 3rd grade decided it was her duty to tell me I didn\u2019t really have a daddy. \n\nThree bedroom country farm with four kids, grandparents and mother with her pedo husband was a constant fight complete with fists and screaming almost daily.  At least we could go outside....Lost a brother to a gunshot when stepfather cheated on mother and left gun down while he was leaving, other brother accidentally shot him.  \n\nMother continued to treat me like a sister until she decided she wanted to be a mother. My grandmother was the one who raised me and the one I consider my true mother. When she died, she left me the land with her house on it and my mother tricked me into signing it over to her (I was very naive). She accused my straight-edge goth-y kids (in their 30s now) of being on drugs because they wore black and has held a remark I made about moving away when I was 16 against me to this day.  \n\nMy father sent me $50 when I graduated and $100 when I got married the first time.  And I had no idea he was even my father until I was 23.  \n\nI would have liked to have had a different childhood.\n\n\nEdit:  Y\u2019all are some wonderful people.

            "Mom was 15 when she had me. Honestly, my life sucked. She used to say that she could have given me up for adoption and then decided not to because she realized that I would love her unconditionally- no matter what. Our relationship progressed pretty negatively because of that mindset of hers. Every negative thing I did was against what she thought motherhood would be like. I was something she could pick up and put down and leave behind at her leisure. There were a number of times she\u2019d drop me off at a family member\u2019s house and disappear. Once, I came home from kindergarten and no one was there (dad was in prison). The next morning, my uncle showed up. He had heard my mom left and had a gut feeling he needed to go to my house. \n\nThere was no food and the heat had been turned off by the utility company. I don\u2019t remember much about that time other than the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and the demolition man movie.\n\nShe had she pretty bad trauma and never processed it properly, so when she got angry due to a trauma reminder, she got really angry. \n\nWhen she was good - boy she was golden. She could be the most fun of a person you could ask for, but she wasn\u2019t a mother. She never held and comforted, she expected hugs and comfort. She was a kid, and thought with a kid brain. When we had some spare change, she\u2019d walk me to the ice cream place and she\u2019d buy herself an ice cream and we\u2019d go back home. \n\nAs I got older, our already weird relationship became weirder. She told me she didn\u2019t want people to know she was my mom and I could introduce her as my sister. She would tell people that she had three children (my siblings) and not claim me because people would do the math. She wanted to be friends with my friends. She wanted to hang around when they were there. \n\nWhat I know about having a teenage mom is this: I loved her with the kind of fanatical worship that messed me up for a long time. She could be funny and cruel at the same time. When she gave you attention, your world would be brighter but when she was mad at you, the world would be dark. \n\nShe never grew out of her teenage mindset, and I had to come to grips with that. \n\nI can\u2019t say that every teenage mom is like mine, but mine was rough.\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t have the words to say to express my gratitude for all who have shared similar stories or gave support. Honestly, hearing that my story isn\u2019t unique, as sucky as it is, makes me know that I\u2019m not alone. I can\u2019t give you all a hug, though I wish I could. For all that shared, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much.\n\nEdit 2: people asked how I\u2019m doing now. I just graduated with my masters in social work last week! The long and the short of it is years ago, I ran away from home and ended up at my best friend\u2019s house. Lots of work, and hurt, and healing later - I don\u2019t see my bio-mom anymore. I was adopted by my best friend\u2019s family when I was 29 though. I\u2019ll tell you, that paper may seem insignificant to people who don\u2019t understand but for me, I stop and stare at it sometimes (my adopted mom hung the adoption certificate on the wall). It\u2019s legal proof I have a family who loves me and no one can take that away. \n\nThe best thing I can say to people is - go to therapy. Find a therapist who works for you (I went to five before I found the one that clicked), separate your blood relatives from the people who love you. Found family is as valid or more so than those you share blood with. Your friends can be your family. My closest friends are my sisters and brothers, and I call them that. I tell friends and family that I love them. It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re raised by people who weaponize love, but at the end of it all, love is what makes life worth it, you know? \n\nAlso, forgive yourself. Forgive that sometimes when you get hurt or scared or angry, your parent will come out of your mouth. Acknowledge that you\u2019re breaking the cycle but we were raised in a different world and everyone sounds like their parents sometimes. For those who had parents like my mom, the scariest thing could be hearing yourself echo what they said. Sometimes, I feel the desire to make someone work for my attention, and then I realize - that\u2019s my mom\u2019s influence, that\u2019s not me. \n\nSo, be kind to yourself. My adopted mom says \u201cthe world treats you like you think you should be treated\u201d and our parents raised us to think we should be treated like shit. They were wrong. We should be - and with inner reflection, hard work, therapy and our found families support - we\u2019ll see ourselves as people worthy of being loved. \n\nWe are worthy. I\u2019m worthy. You\u2019re worthy. \n\nFrom one stranger to another, I love you all.",

            "I was primarily raised by my grandparents after age 5 because my mom couldn\u2019t handle the responsibility, and my dad wanted nothing to do with us. She neglected me, literally played world of warcraft and slept all hours of the day. There were times when I\u2019d miss school because she wouldn\u2019t get up, or I would have to eat uncooked frozen waffles because I was so hungry. I had to grow up really quickly because of that. When my grandparents moved us in it was better, but she always acted more like a sibling. When she lived with us she would argue with me and steal my things and go on and on about how everyone thinks she\u2019s my sister and not my mom. She tried to squeeze some more youth into her life when I was young, always partying and drinking and coming home fucked up. She constantly brought me around her trash boyfriends, including: a stalker, a man who is now a white supremacist, and a man who got convicted of sexually assaulting his ex-stepdaughter who was the same age as me during their relationship. By the time I was 10 I was already significantly more mature than her. She resents me for that, as well as my intelligence and academic success and the fact that I\u2019m happy when she never got to be, despite her best efforts to fuck me up psychologically. I get to live my life and she never did. She started doing drugs at some point in there, not sure when, but she stopped and got her life together when she got pregnant with my little brother. Didn\u2019t last long, she\u2019s in rehab now and my little brother is a victim to the same circumstances that I was. She hasn\u2019t grown at all. Having me at a young age must have stunted her growth or something, because she\u2019s the most immature person I know. She tried to make it all up to me when I was 18 by taking me on a trip to Europe, but SHE ended up losing MY passport, and then left without me while I had to figure out how to return to the US all by myself. Goes to show how little changed. \n\nMy whole childhood I felt like an outsider because of her. I\u2019m from a middle class suburb with more nuclear families than not, so everyone treated me like some alien. That, or they\u2019d look at me like I was a heartless bitch if I said I don\u2019t celebrate Mother\u2019s Day or if I couldn\u2019t remember her birthday. I could sense the caution people used around me, like I was covered in cracks and would shatter instantly if someone even looked at me funny. That definitely affected the way I treated myself for a while. In actuality though I was mostly fine. I was insecure and struggled with some abandonment sensitivity, but aside from that I was pretty happy. My grandparents are amazing people, and they always did the best they could to encourage and support me when I was young. I never felt unloved or unwanted, just frustrated I had no chance at a normal life. I never realized how little those things matter once you get past high school though, how unimportant \u201cnormalcy\u201d is. I realize now I\u2019m better off having gone through all that at a young age. I have a good head on my shoulders because, starting from a young age, I had to be mature enough for both my mom and myself. I struggle with anxiety but it\u2019s mostly internal, nothing outside of that ever really phases me. As soon as I got to college I rejected my past and became extremely independent, and I\u2019ve come to realize that doing things on my own is where I thrive. I know I will never be like her, and I know my success will only spite her more, and that serves to motivate me. I love who I am now, and I know I wouldn\u2019t be this way if she hadn\u2019t fumbled so hard.\n\nSorry this turned into more of a rant than an answer. With my mom in rehab right now leaving my little brother to fend for himself like she did to me, I guess I was waiting for an opportunity like this to talk some shit.\n\nEdit: wow, thank you all for the love, support, and shared experiences. I have honestly never received this level of compassion from so many people at once and was shocked to see how many people weighed in and responded to me. I am so eternally grateful for all your kind words and encouragement. My intention was to just get some shit off my chest, and although it\u2019s really sad to see how many people relate to what I\u2019ve gone through, it also feels so good to finally know I\u2019m not alone after having spent so much time feeling isolated and alienated by my experiences. You are all so brave, not only for going through what you have, but also for having the courage to share it. I am truly thankful for all of you. Please don\u2019t hesitate to message me if any of you would like to talk. I know how hard it is learning to care for yourself the way you should have been cared for, having someone to talk to can make all the difference. If you feel like sharing privately or would like any of the resources that have helped me, my PMs are wide open. Lastly, if you were neglected or dealt with addiction in your family please check out ACA and see if there\u2019s a group you can go to. It\u2019s this amazing group therapy program (it\u2019s just like AA, so it\u2019s free) for children of addicts. It\u2019s helped me so much. Even just read the \u201cACA laundry list\u201d if you have the time, all it is is a short list of traits pertaining to children of addicts, but it\u2019s so eye-opening.",

            "My mom and I are really close. She had me at 14. Growing up, I noticed a lot of my friends didn't get along with their moms. I always thought she was really relatable.  We go eat, go shopping, get coffee, gossip, just hang out. She worked a lot, sometimes multiple jobs at once, so I felt like I did less extra curriculur than my friends. But I was pretty happy Growing up. \n\nShe is always concerned with money. I'm starting to notice that shes not very good at saving money, or planning retirement and what not. I once asked a family friend \"now that us kids are grown, how are my parents still living paycheck to paycheck?\"\n\nShe explained that, in her opinion, my mom basically skipped learning how to take care of herself as an adult. Instead of learning how to effectively adult, she focused on taking care of her kids.\n\nI will forever be grateful for my mom and the hard work and sacrifices she endured to raise me and my siblings.",

After spending my youth not being allowed to have emotions, I have no desire to tell her anything that actually means something to me. Being forced to hide any and all feelings is my biggest remaining issue.

I became a teacher and greatly enjoyed being on that side of things. I loved not only educating but I also tried to be a mentor and role model to my students (aged 12-14). \n\nThanks again!\n\nOriginal:\nMy mother resented me. Still does actually, but it's lessened over the years. It was apparently my fault she missed her teen years, so she dropped me off at a relative's in another state when I was a toddler and hitchhiked around the country for a year. As I grew up I was screamed at and beaten for looking like my biological father. She didn't trust me a bit because of it. I had to get permission to step outside to get the mail, couldn't bathe myself until I was a teenager, couldn't do homework with others.

Some of them talk about how she can feel me moving around and what my heartbeat sounded like.

            "My mom was 15 when she got pregnant with me, and my biological father left when she found out she was pregnant. I am 25 years old now, so no longer a kid. Not gonna lie, I had a terrible childhood. My mom married an abusive man when I was 9 months old who I've always known as my dad and they had my brother who is autistic a year later. I remember constantly taking my brother away to play when they would become physical with each other. He would choke my mom, push her through walls, cuss her out, you name it. As I grew older I tried defending her. As I grew even older the abuse turned towards me. They somehow found a common ground of if they deflect a fight they are about to have with something I did \"wrong\" they wouldn't fight. I was the one getting pushed through drywall, my head slammed into the door with my dad yelling in my face enough I could feel his spit hit me. I never really could talk to my mom, and resented her for letting him treat me that way. I never really had a good relationship with her. I felt she resented keeping me, and when I was a teenager I overheard her say she wished she would have aborted me. I also grew up in a very messy household, with roaches that would fall into my food from the ceiling or when I slept onto my face waking me up. I had lice from about age 4 to 13, and I was sexually abused by one of my parents friends from about 5 to 8. He had a son who he would make us do things to one another every time we went over there. One memory I have is getting beat when I was 6 years old because I was playing with barbies and I was motioning them like they were having sex. I just didn't know any better. Once I was old enough to go to sleepovers I realized that none of these things I was going through was normal, and I wanted to be away from home as much as I could. It was my escape. I left home at 17 and never looked back. Now... how much of this is related to my mom being young when she had me? I guess I will never really know. Maybe it would have been the same if she had me 5-10 years later. All I do know is as an adult now... I have many things I need to unlearn and many things I still haven't learned about being in a healthy relationship and a healthy household. I struggle immensely with depression/ abandonment issues/ codependency and anxiety. I have a son who I absolutely love to the end of the world and he is the only person who keeps me going. I take my childhood and relationship with my parents and do the exact opposite because I don't want him growing up the way I did. My parents got a divorce earlier this year. I talk to my mom on occasion, and even sometimes my dad. We never really talk about what happened to me growing up and it is very awkward when I do go to family functions. Sometimes it feels like I can see in my moms eyes when I do talk to her about what I'm up to, how I'm doing, that she is sorry, but she has honestly never said anything to me about it. So... yeah... I'm honestly all over the place and a little messed up but at the end of the day I'm trying. Seeing my friends family and how they interacted when I was young is really all I have to go by. Little things like how they ate dinner I try to mimic. But like I said... my life was very different from my friends in many ways I could never explain. One day I'll find my normal.

Spent my early life living from family house to house until she and my dad was able to afford an apartment. She loves me and my younger brother unconditionally and has said that if she had never had us at such a young age she would have never had children. We went from shopping at swap meets to affording brand names. \n\nBe it, my mom is not saint. My mom was on dialysis when she 21 and was on the waiting list for a kidney when she was told that a compatible donor (bless her, she literally saved me and my brothers lives because of this surgery) available and if she was up for surgery. She said that she SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED not having the surgery because she didn't want to live with all the medication and pain. \"If it weren't for you two I would have had probably stayed on dialysis until my body gave out. I just couldn't imagine leaving [My dad] alone to care for you both.\" \n\nThis I'll be a good time to bring up my dad too. He's a immigrant from Mexico and came to the US with the clothes on his back and not even a grade school education. He'd grown up on a ranch and at 20 has made it off to the US. Without a proper education and papers he's been supporting me, my brother, and my mom by washing cars. Everyday from 5am- 4pm he'd spend on washing cars to be able to feed up and give us nice things. The reason my mom couldn't work was because she had 2 kids to care for and was legally disabled because of the dialysis.\n\nMy mom doesn't let me make mistakes thats she's made, she pushes me to do better. Sure she didn't let me eat ice cream for breakfast and sure she didn't let me play gta on my ds but she didn't do it because she wasn't cool, she did it because she cared.\n\nWelp, sorry for the whole dump. Its nice to get everything out. \n\nTldr: My mom is first to break the curse of our family being abusive, and instead of raising me like her mom did, she raised me with love and understanding. Not getting to stab my hand with a pencil like other kids wasn't because she wasn't cool, it was because she cared, unlike other kids parents.",
            "I wasn't going to post in this thread because I didn't think my mom having me at 19 would be that interesting, but fuck it. We're gonna do bullet points. Buckle up.\n\n- Mom (19) and dad (24) decided to have an abortion 3 months before I was conceived. I was the \"Fuck it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\" child\n\n- They got married shortly thereafter, and split after not too long, and most of my time as a young kid was spent living at my grandparents, often with my mom and also my 2 aunts, all in the same middle class home that was my grandfather's pride and joy (whom I recently learned was very likely a KKK grand wizard)\n\n- Hated my grandfather because he was a huge asshole, but I had a great childhood thanks to him. Most everything we ate was grown in our huge garden, on fruit trees in the yard, or even berry bushes and grape vines. Lots of me helping out and learning things. Notice I don't mention my mother.\n\n- mom had shitty retail jobs, left most of the parenting to my grandparents, and a cavalcade of dudes she was seeing that I'd occasionally expose as pieces of shit. I'm leaving my dad out of this story, because he did his best, but spent his whole life on the struggle bus. But he was 100x the parent she was, and he was an alcoholic\n\n- mom got pregnant when I was 9. Her sisters got pregnant soon after. My grandfather was in an awful accident with a Cox communications van, and years later it led to his death. That's when shit went off the rails.\n\n- grandmother had a stroke soon after and she needed a lot of help. Meanwhile the house keeps deteriorating, and my mom started coming home with animals.\n\n- we got a near 2 million dollar settlement for my grandfather's death when I was a junior in high school. During high school I was often playing father to my little bro (because of course his dad is a POS), in addition to my school life being pure hell because I was an unpopular nerd. I'd get it at school everyday, then I'd come home and have to clean, take care of animals, and take care of my brother, all while my mother yelled at me, and also help my grandmother when I could since she was recovering from her stroke and couldn't do a lot.\n\n- grandma got the bulk of the money, but each of the 3 sisters got fat checks too. Gran fixed up the house and yard, and paid it off. The sisters moved out and did their own shitty things. But my mom? Blow, and a 68 camaro super sport. And a bunch of useless bullshit, none if which I ever asked for. And refused to get me badly needed braces. Before she knew it, she was flat broke again\n\n- The house quickly became a hoarding situation, both animals and bullshit. My mother is absurdly lazy, so nothing got done unless I did it, and I don't even remember if she was working. I just remember non stop yelling. At everything and everyone.\n\nTo cut the rest of this short, I bailed at 18, because she put all the responsibility on me, likely as a way to control and keep me under her thumb. If not for my dad it might have worked longer, but I had somewhere to go.\n\n20 years later, I've been divorced twice, very rarely had any sense of stability, lost most people I've ever cared about either through their death (most of them untimely, some VERY untimely) or falling apart. My mom had two more kids, which are now 17/18, and this family has always hung around my neck like a giant weighted stone, even though I've spent the years moving further and further away.\n\nThey're all varying pieces of shit. The bro I played father to in high school got engaged and had me *convinced* he was turning his life around, and he asked me to co-sign a $3k loan so they could move to her hometown. I agreed, said they should visit for a bit before they move, and they wound up mooching off me for 6 months, blew all the money in drugs, then stiffed me.\n\nBUT at 39 I've crawled my way up to a comfy desk job making nearly $40k, met the absolute love of my life this year, who has two adorable boys that I look forward to treating as my own and being the person for them that I never had. We're very likely moving in together into her newly purchased home at the end of this year once my lease is up. After all the shit my mother has inflicted on me my entire life, and I never stopped pushing. I feel like my life is really beginning, and despite near unending depression and anxiety, I'm hopeful for once.\n\nThe kicker? The girl I'm madly in love with, who I'm more attracted to than any other girl I've ever met...has the same name as my mom \ud83d\ude43",

            "My mom was 17 when she had me. She had to deal with an deadbeat, abusive, drug addict bf (my bio dad) and his family that kept threatening to take custody of me, all while having very little support from her own family. Somehow she got away from deadbeat and made it through all that and is still a generally well balanced person. She met someone new when I was 3 and grinded at 2 jobs to help him get a high paying trade job. Now she\u2019s a stay at home mom and we live on the nice side of town.\n\nMy mom isn\u2019t perfect by a long shot but she did what she had to to make sure I never went without and I never noticed when the going got tough. I only ever realized it was out of the ordinary when kids and teachers at my catholic private school gave me weird looks when they did the math on my moms age. Other than the judgy looks, life wasn\u2019t really much different imo.\n\nSure, it helped that my paternal grandma babysat and paid for my private school, but i gotta band it to my mom. She had abusive/neglectful parents but she made a concerted effort to break that cycle at the tender age of 17. Now I don\u2019t agree completely with the way she chooses to live her life now, but I find a lot of inspiration in how she escaped a very toxic situation and now she\u2019s standing taller than the people who tried to drag her down.",

I was the ring bearer at my own parents\u2019 wedding at age 2. It never felt weird, until during school I realized that my grandparents were younger than a lot of my friends parents. My mom got carded at my 21st birthday party and she said \u201cwell that\u2019s my child, and he just ordered a beer so...\u201d I\u2019ve lived a normal life and my parents are still together, which I think is pretty incredible.",

She knew it was best to put me up for adoption. \n\nI found out years later, I was still young, didn't know how to handle it I guess. Fast forward a couple years after that, and I get a message on MySpace.\n\nIt was from my biological mom. She found me on MySpace of all places.\n\nWe talked (with my parents permission of course) and I learned a lot. Learned where I got my love for Photography from, where I got my love of computers and video games from, learned why I have mental health problems, and learned I had 3 sisters. \n\nShe also told me she wanted to see me, she wanted to see how ive grown. And my oldest sister really, really wanted to meet me. So, my hometown has a yearly celebration of their Dutch heritage, and thats where I met my bio mom and my sisters. Im still very close to them, my sister especially. She and I both have kids of our own now, she was there for my sons birth, my bio mom came to meet her grandson. And she cried so much. I remember giving her a hug and she told me she was so proud of me and where I am. She was happy for the life my parents gave me. I still have the picture of her holding my son in the hospital. She was even there for his first birthday and hugged my mom. \n\nYeah I went on a bit of a tangent, but its a good memory for me. Lol.",
            "My mom had me in her early 20s but growing up she was always much younger than the other moms, for one thing. She was definitely too young though, and it put her in a bad situation until about a year ago. Now she\u2019s finally making friends and living an adult life at 43.",
            "Oh man. Loaded question my mom was a teen mom. And I was her second. Guess times were different way back when. Typical late seventies early eighties stereotype.

            "It was fucking awful. My mom was 17 when she had me and I swear her brain just stopped maturing. She had a lot of help and did all the practical things I needed like food, clothes toys. I was never neglected and was even put in private elementary school. The emotional toll though, I will never get over. Nothing was ever good enough. I was never skinny enough, pretty enough, good enough with anything. I played tennis and was one of the best players in my small town. I would travel for tournaments and I remember a match where I won 6-0, 6-1 and her comment was that I shouldn\u2019t have given up that game. When I was in high school she got liposuction and then taunted me about trying on her new pants. She literally said \u201cI bet you can\u2019t fit into them\u201d. I was an athletic size 6, so not overweight by any means. \n\nShe was always chasing men. A new one would come along and after knowing him 5 minutes, she would put him above everything else. Whatever he says must be correct. When I was 8 she sat me down with her boyfriend and let him tell me that if it wasn\u2019t for me they would be married (Fuck you Greg). Another time she literally met a man on a beach vacation (I wasn\u2019t with her) and moved him into our house a month later. I was only 16 and there was suddenly a stranger living in my house. Thank god he wasn\u2019t abusive. That situation could have been so much worse. He did turn out to be living way beyond his means and broke into the house to steal diamond jewelry after they broke up. Then when I was In college she was engaged to another guy who ended up having a criminal record. So much bad stuff happened with him and we found out he actually had a warrant out for him after they broke up. The US marshals arrested him and there was an article written about him on the front page of our small town newspaper which was highly embarrassing. Fast forward, I\u2019m in my 30s and have no relationship with her at all. She ended up marrying another skeezeball with a criminal record and that was the final straw. She will never get to meet her grandchildren. I don\u2019t want them to experience her stupidity and coldness like I did. I have an amazing step-mom though and I\u2019m close to my dad, so life is good now! I wanted to kill myself living under her roof though.",

Fortunately, my mom met a guy her age who didn't mind that she had an infant. He adopted me and raised me as his own son. Thanks, Dad!",
            "I don't have kids but my sister was 14 when she had her first son. It was wild being 12 and watching your teen sister go through pregnancy. When he was born she tried for 6 months then gave him to his grandmother. Got into the party scene, got addicted to drugs, sold her body, hung out with violent bike gangs then at 19 she got pregnant again and this time she was better she stopped doing drugs almost cold turkey, got jobs where she could, etc however the first year was hard since she was going through withdrawals. 10 years later she's clean, had my niece, got her GED and license, work's really hard to give them a good life. Her first son unfortunately we don't see his grandmother kept him away from our whole family and refuses to let her see him even though she's a totally different person however he's severely autistic so its probably better that he doesn't know her as much as it probably hurts.",
            "I think mine resented me to some extent. She simultaneously tried to live vicariously through me whilst being incredibly strict and controlling.\n\nWhen I pushed back on her control issues she told me she wishes she'd had an abortion when she got pregnant with me at 16 and that she hoped any children I have die because that's what I was to her, dead.\n\nIt's not always fun having a young parent. I'm 30 and I do not see or speak to her.",
            "My mom had me at 16.  Things were hard as a kid, step-father was bipolar and went through bouts of being a good dad and a terrible dad, depending on if he had his medication.  But my mom was smart and cared a lot.  She tried a lot.  She was always on my side first and finally, even when I was being a shithead.  And now, of all my closest friends, I'm the only one who still speaks to my parents at all.  She always tried to raise me better than she was raised herself, as she was an orphan.  \n\nAs I got older and more opinionated, she trusted and listened to me, which is not the experience a lot of my peers have with their parents even now.  I've been able to reason her very easily out of movements like anti-vaccination and other conspiracies, despite her strong catholic roots and history of abuse.  Despite that, she's very emotionally intelligent and taught me firsthand that being likable, charismatic, and capable of learning gets you a lot further than any amount of mild expertise in a single field and a bad attitude.\n\nNow she's finally married to a guy who is good to her and treats her well, and she's doing very well.  I live on the other side of the country for work and we usually chat about video games and how my younger siblings are doing.  She's supportive of anything I do- \nif I told her I was going to quit everything and be a carnival barker, she'd just ask for tickets for my first show and if there were anyways she could help me.  \n\nHell, despite my wife and I making 5x what her and her partner do, she still insists on paying the Netflix that we share- she was in tears one month when she needed to let it lapse to afford upcoming bills and felt so ashamed when we offered to take it on without a second thought.  We then sent her a couple grand for Xmas presents for herself and the little ones.  Even after that show, the next month she told me she'd be taking back over the Netflix payments, haha.\n\nNow, I'm the oldest of 5 from her.  My biological father's child count is too great to know- I think including step-step-siblings I'd be the oldest of about 13?  Catholic families and all that.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nHow was my life different?  She let me play Resident Evil 4 when I was like 12 because she wasn't good at action games and loved the Resident Evil franchise.  She was really into Guns N Roses and got me tickets to see Metallica back in 2009.  She let me grow my hair out super-long, and I can't really imagine myself any other way now.  The difference is that she knew how she was when I was her age, and as long as I was doing better than her, I could do whatever I want.  She'd let me practice guitar and vocals way more loudly than my friend's parents did.  Oh, and she'd throw boxes of condoms at me periodically, so I didn't end up delaying my future as she did.",

            "My parents were 17 years old. I did a lot of stuff with my parents; my dad and me both mountain bike, my mom and me laugh at the same internet memes, and we shared a lot of tastes in movies and stuff. I grew up willfully spending time with them as they were young enough to still be directly interested in the same stuff I was. I am very close to both of them, and count myself lucky to have such involved parents. \n\nMy wife's parents were 38 when they had her. She says that her mom was loving, but she never really shared experiences of similar tastes; the generation gap was too big.\n\nNow we are in our 30s. When my parents visit, we go mountain biking, surfing, and drinking snobby coffee from fancy shops. When my in-laws visit, we sit in the yard drinking Pim's cups and talking about politics. Both are nice experiences, but both are very different.\n\nMy parents put everything into raising a family, it's neat to see them finally as a couple, after 30 years of raising kids. I could never fully understand the challenges they faced as poverty stricken parents, and I am extremely proud of who they are as parents. They gave me a perfect childhood, and I can never repay them.",
            "My mom had me at 17, I'm 23 now and she is 40. My dad was never around, and she never married or had any more children. Financially it was a little rough growing up, but looking back I had a very supportive upbringing because my mom was always young enough to understand my perspective. It was kind of like growing up with a sister mom hybrid. \n\nFor example, when I was 15ish I asked for birth control and my mom did not bat an eye. She just took me to the clinic and took care of it. No fuss, no drama, just \"Ok, I'm glad you're safe\".",

            "Probably going to get buried but my mum had my brother at sixteen and me at 20. I think what my mum was brilliant at was accepting my interests and how I wanted to express myself.\n\nFor example, when I was around 5, my brother and I discovered skateboarding and punk music. She let me wear my baggy clothes (probably just hand me downs from my brother now I think about it lol) and a chain on my jeans. I once mentioned I wanted a punk hair cut and she gave me a full-on mohawk.\n\nAnother time, during a non-uniform day at junior school, where boys had to wear pink and girls had to wear blue, she dyed my hair pink (my request) and gave me a pink fluffy scarf to wear. \n\nWhen we went to weddings, she'd always encourage me to get up and dance and always hyped me up. Turns out I'm not even that good at dancing lol. \n\nWhether it was skateboarding or football or playing guitar or dancing or gaming, she always said yes and was my biggest fan. \n\nShe always encouraged me to express myself and embued whatever I pursued with positivity and support. I had no pressure that I was acting too \"feminine\" or \"gay\", and I was never made to feel ashamed of my passions.  I think all of this played a big role in building my confidence and self-esteem. \n\nWhile I think her personality plays a large part in all this, I think the lack of a big generational barrier definitely helped too.",

I immediately went and lived with my grandparents, her parents, like a few weeks after I was born. She drifted in and out of my life as I grew up so I was never able to really establish that mother/son bond, I look at her more like an older sibling or like a friend/acquaintance. There's no mother/son relationship, I call her by her first name because she was neve there so I don't feel she earned that title. Her mother on the other hand, my grandma stepped up and raised me just like she did her 6 kids before me. She did her best to give me everything in life. If it wasn't for her I would probably be dead or in prison or something crazy. Unfortunately I'm not the only child either...she had 2 more after me. She had my brother in 1990, and my sister was born in 92. None of them ever lived with her and I'm sure both of them feel somewhat like how I feel. They don't call her mom, they call her by her first name like I do. I don't really know what or how my brother and sister feel towards her, I guess its just something that never came up.

Then decided he\u2019d like to add uncooked cherry tomatoes as a topping. We ended up cooking a  slab of dough and throwing some cherry tomatoes on top. He then proceeded to use the pizza crust as a plate for his tomatoes, then threw the crust away after finishing his tomatoes. We had a salad bar with the exact same tomatoes as well.",

Every night, 30 minutes to an hour before close, this large African American man built like an NFL linebacker would come in, and no matter how many or what kinds, would clean out whatever was left of our cookies for the night.  Two Oatmeal Raisins?  A dozen Chocolate Chip?  A smattering of everything?  Didn't matter, he'd purchase every single cookie left and leave.\n\nWe nicknamed him Cookie Monster.",

            "I worked at a Burger King my junior year of high school (Not a sandwich shop, but play along). I was on specialty board (chicken and fish mainly). This order came through for an original chicken with \"HHHH mayo\". \"H\" in the training stood for heavy or extra.  I asked my manager if it was a typo and they said no this guy comes in once a week for that sandwich. I swear, by the time my manager said the sandwich was \"proper\", the mayo was thicker than the chicken patty itself. I felt like I needed to bathe afterwards.",
            "Don't work there any more, but the one order that sticks in my mind above everything else was one time a guy came in on the phone to order two sandwiches and he explained one was for his 7 months pregnant wife so to please make it right, he has a list of exactly what she wants. So I made it exactly how it was written down, then made his and he paid and all was good in the world. \n\nThen maybe ten minutes later the phone rings and I answer it and there is this woman on the phone just screaming at me telling me I made her sandwich wrong and how she wanted ranch instead of mayo and blah blah and that she would send her husband in to get it remade, ya know full Karen minus the \"let me speak to the manager\" bit. So the guy comes back in and I immediately recognize him and he's apologizing profusely explaining that his wife is pregnant and hormones and whatnot, and I assured him I've been yelled at for less it's no big deal I'll remake it at no charge, he has the offending sandwich, I remake it right and throw the old one away, and as I'm ringing up the order(even though it was free it still had to be rung up at $0 for bread count accuracy) the phone rings. \n\nSo I hand the man his sandwich and answer the phone and there is this woman on the phone hysterically crying on the other end and so I ask if she's alright and she informs me that she called earlier and she felt horrible about yelling at me because she realized she wrote it down wrong and it wasn't my fault and the whole time I'm just awkwardly telling her that it's okay, no big deal we got it taken care of, you're okay don't worry about it, It's no big deal. And then she, still sobbing, asks me straight up \"do you forgive me?\" And I said \"it's all good no worries\" and she said \"No. Do you forgive me?\" And I said \"yeah dont worry about it\" and she asked again \"but do you forgive me?\" And I replied \"yes, I forgive you. Have a great night ma'am.\" After which she hung up.\n\n I still remember that even seven years later because it was the only time I've ever had a customer call back not only to apologize, but crying about it as well. Ironically for the question I don't actually remember what the specific sandwich was, I wanna say it was an oven roasted chicken breast but I truly am just taking a shot in the dark.",

I say egg, but really it was more of a frozen circle of egg whites with a yellow piece in the middle (that may or may not be missing depending on luck of the draw). This one guy would come in every shift I had and order just the egg circle, but didn't want us to heat it up. We handed him hard, frozen, disgusting looking, disks that sounded like rocks when banged against the counter, covered in ice flakes.

Just cheese. I never charged her for the extra cheese since I figured the veggies she wasn\u2019t getting offset it. Eventually she started asking for more and more cheese until it was easily 10x what came on it. She must have been bummed when I quit. That cheese sandwich probably would have cost about $10 if someone who gave a shit rang it up.",

            "I worked at a Subway for a couple months after high school. While working there I had a very polite customer, who was pregnant at the time, come in every other week or so and order the same footlong ham sandwich. What made this sandwich so strange was that she would ask for a tonne of black olives. Like MULTIPLE, whole handfuls of black olives. So much, that it was hard to close up and wrap the sandwich without some olives spilling out. \n\nSome of my coworkers would only give her so much before they refused to add more. There were no rules, to my knowledge, stating a limit on the amount of black olives a customer could request, so I always obliged. Knowing this, she would refuse help from my coworkers and wait for me to make her footlong black olive sandwich. She would always comment that it was something she started ordering after becoming pregnant and it was the baby that wanted the olives. \n\nSome time had passed where I didn\u2019t see her come in anymore. Until one day, I see her walk in with a stroller and her brand new baby daughter. She brought her in so I could meet the \u201colive baby\u201d. She thanked me for all the times I made her olive sandwich just the way she liked it and then proceeded to order a ham sandwich. Only this time, she asked for just a few olives. \n\nI quit a short time after but I still think about that sandwich and the olive baby from time to time.",

Anyway, a buss full of special needs folks and their helpers came in one day kind of in between lunch and dinner like about 2:30 ish, they all order food and are having a great time. Italian music blasting delicious homemade bread at the table, everyone\u2019s having a great time. The order comes to me. Nothing to memorable except for this one specific pie. \u201cSmall cheese pizza, no cheese, no sauce.\u201d  I check with the server. Yep that\u2019s what he requested. No oil, no nothing.

Popping all the little bubbles that rise up and push them back down flat. It finishes and I cut it into 6 slices. She brings it to the table. The chef wants me to go out and make sure everyone is enjoying their meal. I go. The gentleman eating that unique pizza is ecstatic tells me and the whole restaurant that this is the best pizza he\u2019s ever had. And I truly believe he ment it. This was about 20 years ago and I think about that table often. I\u2019ve cooked and sold thousands of pizzas and that was my most memorable for sure. I hope that guy is doing well and I hope he is still trying all the pizzas this world has to offer.",

            "Not a worker, but a Grubhub driver.\n\nSomeone ordered a meatball sub from Subway that had nothing on it but meatballs, the sauce, and about four times as much mayonnaise as would go on a regular sandwich. That was it.\n\nHe made two orders for the same thing within two hours, and I delivered them both.\n\nEdit: He wasn't high and it wasn't a mistake. He said his sister tried it and liked it so much that they split it and had to order another one. According to the Subway worker, he would order the same thing two or three times a week.\n\nEdit 2: There's been a pretty good split downthread as to whether this is delicious or disgusting and it's made me curious. I'm about to head out for dinner and there's a Subway nearby. I think I'll get a small 6 inch sub with nothing but meatballs and mayo and report back on how it is.\n\nEdit 3: [Whelp, I did it.](https://imgur.com/a/ByxUJkX)\n\nWent in to Subway and told the lady working there that this was an experiment to satisfy my curiosity, and got a toasted Meatball sub with nothing on it but the meatballs, some marinara, and double mayo.\n\nIt wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that good either. I was surprised a bit that it wasn't instantly abhorrent. The worst part by far was the texture - just slime on slime on slime and the bread fell apart from it almost instantly. \n\nI will say that when the marinara and the mayo were mixed, it created something kind of similar in taste to a Thousand Island dressing but not as tart. Not bad, but then you would get a glop of mayo by itself...and that was a bad time. There was just...way too much of it. I did manage to soldier through the entire thing.\n\nConclusions: If the mayo and marinara were properly mixed together, it would actually be a fairly tasty sauce. Maybe brushing mayo on the bread before toasting it to sear it into the bun would work. But it was good enough to where I think the next time I get a meatball sub (and I do get it with spinach, onions, bell peppers, etc) I might ask them to throw a *light* line of mayonnaise in there.\n\nAs described and pictured though, no. That was not a pleasant experience.\n\nEdit 4: Several hours later and it is not sitting very well.",

After the movie, dude walked out and had a massive butter stain in his dick area on his pants.  I was very proud of myself.  Another time this dude wanted butter in his crunch bits chocolate box. So I put butter in and watched him drink the butter-chocolate mix.",
            "When I was a server I waited on a group that looked like a mom, dad, and 2 adult-age daughters. The mom & dad were fairly in shape, but both of the daughters were extremely obese - trouble walking and all that. The daughters each get chicken sandwiches and like 4 adult-sized orders chicken fingers. After I bring all the food out, the daughters ask for more mayonnaise (I\u2019d given each of them a small ramekin on the side with their sandwiches already) so I bring each of them a good-sized ramekin full of it and they **laughed** and said they\u2019re going to need way more. I was like \u201cokay, how much would you like? Would two more ramekins be enough?\u201d and one of them asked if we had soup bowls. I put the order for a soup bowl full of mayo in and went back to the kitchen to clarify/explain and as soon as I opened the door one of the chefs just said \u201cwhat the fuck did you just order\u201d. So they get their soup bowls filled with like ~2 cups of mayo, and they ate it with their chicken tenders, just scooping as much mayo as possible on each bite. I\u2019m not trying to fat-shame (and I know I definitely indulge in unhealthy food from time to time and enjoy some more unusual food combos), but seeing them consume two soup-bowls worth of plain American mayo made me feel so nauseous.",
            "Ok i got a few.\n\nWeirdest or at least most disgusting one was this guy who would come in regularly and order a Tuna Pizza.  We would literally take the tuna salad and just put a layer of it across the pizza then cover it with cheese and bake it for a few minutes.  Holy shit the smell that would come off of that things was terrible.\n\nAnother was guy that ordered everything on a footlong.  I mean every single kind of meat including like 3 or 4 different types of chicken, steak, meatballs, tuna, all the deli meat, all the cheese toasted, and then adding every single vegetable and condiment we owned.  And we didn't skimp on anything, he got exactly how much of each that should be on a footlong so as you can imagine it was literally impossible to fold so we basically just left it open faced and wrapped it in paper.  Dude walked out after paying like $60 just for that 1 sandwich.  EDIT: [Here is a picture of that sub with just the meat and cheese before toasting](http://i.imgur.com/qEMESVY.jpg)\n\nLast, i had a guy who would basically eat all the black pepper we had in stock.  The first time i saw him and we got towards the end of me making his sandwich he was like \"i want you to add a lot of black pepper, like just keep on going until you think wow there's no way anyone would want this much black pepper on a sandwich, and then double that.  I want you to add so much black pepper to the point that you think its going to be a health concern to actually serve this to me.\"  And well, i'm not one to disappoint so i kept on adding black pepper until he told me to stop and by then end of it i could no longer see any of the meat that he had on his sandwich, like honestly i had probably used like a quarter cup of black pepper by the time i finished.  After he paid and took his sandwich he told me \"you know black pepper is good for your heart?\" And to this day i have never looked that up to see if its true but this dude must be so convinced that im going to just believe him.\n\nThere's probably more i'm forgetting so i'll edit this comment and come back if i remember anything\n\nEDIT: Ok i get it people, Tuna pizza isnt that weird in Europe or whatever, but generally when you eat tuna pizza is it tuna salad that is made of a 50/50 mixture of bagged tuna and mayonnaise? Because thats the unsettling thing to me.  I understand putting tuna, sardines, or anchovies on pizza, that seems normal to me.",
            "Worked at a small-town Subway for 5 years in High School and university. We had this guy come in that we called The Mountain. He was at least 300lbs and probably 6'5\". He always came in wearing full fleece camo outfit. \n\nAnywho, his order would always be the same, which is why I remember it so well. The guy would get a footlong with the BBQ rib patty (the most disgusting thing on the menu) AND the veggie patty (the second most disgusting thing on the menu). He would also get quadruple extra bacon (the same amount as a footlong BLT with double meat). IN ADDITION to all the meat, he would get regular amounts of every cheese. Just to recap, at this point he has enough meat for 4 footlongs, and enough cheese for 4. On one God-damn footlong.\n\nNow, here's where it gets good. This dude wouldn't get any veggies. He would ask for just salt (not salt and pepper, just salt). And the cherry on top, he would say \"Don't bother cutting it in half. Just gonna start at one end and stop at the other.\"\n\nEDIT: The veggie patty isn't really disgusting as most of you have pointed out. Every meat there is processed anyway, so it probably wasn't appropriate for me to labelled it as the \"second most disgusting\". However, the BBQ probably is. The box it is delivered in is labelled: \"Boneless BBQ Rib shaped pork burger\". I don't remember the exact wording, but all of those words were included in the title.\n\nI estimated the cost to the best of my knowledge and ended up in the $26-28 CAD range. This was 8-10 years ago.\n\nEdit 2: All the talk about this guy's one liner reminded me of some other customers. We had a \"family\" dinner special where you buy 3 footlongs for $20 or whatever. A guy comes in and orders 3 footlong chicken teriyakis. Me: \"Would you like them in a bag?\", Him: \"No thanks, they are for here.\", there was no one else with him.\n\nWe have the Cold Cut Combo, which has been identified in the comments below as the most disgusting meat available. One guy came in and ordered a \"Footlong Dirty-meat\". Though I had never heard the term before, I knew exactly what he meant.\n\nAnother funny thing that comes to mind is the funny things people would say when they order Monterey Cheddar bread. \"Montgomery Cheddar\", \"Manta-ray Cheddar\", \"Monetary Cheddar\".",

            "I\u2019ve never worked at subway or a sandwich place, but I was that customer once. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I had a problem with pronouncing words and was delayed when it came to reading. My family thought they could fix this by making me speak pretty much 24/7, which included ordering on my own. \n\nWe went to Subway one time and I wanted a 6 inch, Spicy Italian with white bread and toasted. I didn\u2019t know the name of this sandwich when I was younger, but I knew it had pepperoni and salami on it. The problem was, I couldn\u2019t pronounce salami and my family wouldn\u2019t help me order, so I ended up asking for a 6 inch sandwich with white bread, those \u2018two types of pepperonis\u2019, and heated. \n\nThe guy at the counter stopped what he was doing and stared at me with a blank expression for what felt like forever. He looked so confused and that was probably the moment when he questioned why he was working at Subway to begin with. After that awkward pause, he then made my order. \n\nAfter my family paid and I got my sandwich, it only had \u2018two pepperonis\u2019 on toasted bread. The guy at the counter legit thought that I only wanted two pepperonis on my sandwich. I remember asking them why they let this happen and they pretty much told me that I made my bed, so I had to lie in it now. \n\nI ate two pepperonis and toasted bread for dinner that day, while the worker probably contemplated why he should continue working at Subway.\n\nEDIT: A word.\n\nEDIT2: Guys, it\u2019s alright. It was a sandwich.\n\nEDIT3: It was a freaking sandwich, guys. I\u2019m fine.",

That\u2019s not too strange, people do that sometimes. Then he asked for like 4 different sauces on it, and here\u2019s the kicker: he asked for two chocolate chip cookies crumbled onto it. CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES ON A MEATBALL SUB WITH A LOAD OF VEGGIES AND A DISGUSTING COMBINATION OF SAUCES. So this was my coworker who made it, and my regional manager was also in the store at the time. The manager continued to use him as an example in the regional group chat, as my coworker didn\u2019t question it at all. Which is extremely impressive to me.

He would ask that we place a single cucumber, tomato, and pickle at each end and the very center of his sandwich (as opposed to evenly distributed across the entire thing.) He then asked that a single dollop of mustard, honey mustard, and brown mustard be topped in each stack of veggies before cutting the sandwich in half. Then, as he would eat, he would somehow unlace and remove each tennis show with only his feet. We would always take guesses where he was at with his meal based on the state of his footwear. \n\nThen he just stopped coming one day.",

            "I worked at a Subway during high school. One day, I had a kid come in, probably 11 years old, with a $20 bill and a big smile on his face (which was a nice change, since our Subway was located right next to a PC netcafe, and we usually had very rude kids come in).\n\nAnyway, I greet the smiling young lad as normal, and ask what I can get him. In what sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger straight out of a Terminator flick, he says, \"Get me a footlong pastrami if you want to live... DOUBLE MEAT, NYAAAANGH!\"\n\nI chuckled and started with his order, cooking up the pastrami and putting it on the bread (CHEDDAR JALAPE\u00d1O, NYAAAANGH!). After putting) loading up his bread with the meat, he gets this glimmer in his eye and tilts his head down, staring into my soul like Pennywise, and says \"Mayo...\"\n\nSo, I grab the mayo bottle, and after applying a NORMAL human amount of mayo to the bread, I set down the bottle. He smiles, keeping his Pennywise smile, and says \"MORE mayo...\" So, I obliged, putting again as much mayo on it as I already had. Before I could even set the bottle down as it sputtered out the last bit that was in it, he again demanded, \"MOOOOORE MAYO!\"\n\nNeeding to replenish the mayo at this point, I went to the fridge to grab a large mayo bag and refill the bottle. While I was refilling the bottle, the kid's eyes light up again, watching the half-inch hole in the gallon-size bag of mayo, and I know what he wants even before he says it. \"Can... can you use the bag?\"\n\nNow, about this time I figured the kid was messing with me, so I stopped and asked him if he really intended to eat it, or if this was all just for show. He assured me, with dire seriousness, that he fully intended to eat the sandwich, and that mayo was his favorite thing in the world. With renewed confidence, I proceeded to indulge the little fella.\n\nSirens wailed and strobe lights flashed as the torrent of mayonnaise began to overwhelm the levees, washing over the poor, defenseless citizens of Pastramitown in a tsunami of suffocating creamy horror. As the tides subsided and the tiniest bits of pastrami barely protruded from the colossal mountain of mayonnaise on top. It was finally, at this moment, that the kid nodded in affirmation. The epic flood of biblical proportions on display before him, he was satisfied at last.\n\nAs I closed up the bread and mayonnaise oozed out the sides, making a huge mess inside the wrapping paper, he smiled and clapped his hands in ecstasy, jumping up and down in excitement. He paid for his sandwich (around $14) and tipped the rest of the $20. On his way out, he turned around and smiled at me, saying, \"I'LL BE BACK\".\n\nSure enough, next week, he returned, ordered the exact same thing.",

Why are those there!?\" It's spinach. \"No it's not.\" Okay. \n\nLmao I love my job I love my job I love my job...\n\nEdit to say, I also had a woman come in and order a cold cut trio sub. I put the cold cut meat on. She proceeded to argue and yell at me that trio means three and, I only put one meat on there. I had to stand there like an idiot explaining to a middle aged woman what the fuck bologna is exactly and, that the cold cut, being basically that, is made up of three different kinds of meat within itself.

            "In the Netherlands there is this prison escape room where everyone is a prisoner and you have to escape prison (it is done in an actual ancient prison). There are about 300 participants and 85 actors (mostly prison guards and some prisoners). \n\nThey have over 15 storylines which you can follow and there are other inmates (actors) which will lead those storylines and send you one quests.\n\nComing back to the question, at the beginning they warned everyone that no physical contact is allowed because during the first time people would actually threat each other to get money and guards have been attacked. Also they had to warn people that you weren't supposed to try climbing the 50 feet high prison wall...",
            "Oh god. I have a lot of stories. I worked for various escape rooms for a few years. You would be amazed at the amount of players who want to bring their own tools into the game. Screw drivers, lock picks, etc. You have to nail down everything too or players will absolutely destroy it. The drunker they are when they start, the worse the damage is. We once had a player literally try to TEAR OFF THE DRYWALL because they thought there had to be something behind it. In one of our rooms, we had this big heavy duty picture frame screwed into the wall with 4in. Nails and they still managed to pry it off. Weve had doors taken off hinges, kids trying to crawl inside vents, the list goes on. I dont know if it counts as absurd but one of the most unique experiences ive had there was a wedding proposal. The guy worked it out with us ahead of time, we put the ring and a note he wrote professing his love behind some bars in the last puzzle you unlock before getting out of the room. His girlfriend actually ended up fitting her hands between the bars and got the note way early, but the guy was still running around trying to solve stuff because he didnt notice and she was sitting there reading it starting to bawl. She said yes btw.",
            "I feel kinda bad about the time our group unscrewed half the pictures on the wall using a paper clip, since none of us had the sense to think that maybe the pictures being screwed down was a sign we weren\u2019t supposed to look behind them.\n\nEdit: To elaborate, we managed to crack the combination lock to a drawer which had a jar of paper clips in it, to which our reaction was \u201cdo we have to pick a lock?\u201d at first, and then \u201chey, I think these fit perfectly into the screws but on the walls!\u201d Turns out, the actual purpose of the paper clips was to make a chain to dangle into a tube to pick up a key (can\u2019t remember if we had a magnet or a hook to help) which we discovered after looking behind the one picture in the room not screwed down and finding the code to the combination lock on the drawer below the first one.",

And i though so too, until I found out that Escape Rooms aren\u2019t just something they both love that makes the proposal unique, it was the first room ever! Never played an Escape Game ever! Weird choice of scenery to propose. Even weirder when you consider that they took two friends with them. But it doesn\u2019t end there. They barely managed to get out and the ring was hidden in the very last cue so if they hadn\u2019t managed, shit would have become very awkward. It did anyway, because when he proposed, neither of their friends really reacted to it, just stood their blankly. Which was made even worse by the fact that the guy was supposed to film the whole thing - which he didn\u2019t - and the other girl didn\u2019t even know he was proposing so the surprise at least should have coerced a smile out of her. Nothing! The proposal speech was also delivered with as much passion as a paper bag and as it turned out the dude told everyone at the reception that he didn\u2019t really want to marry her (at least not for the time being) but she got pregnant so now it kind of pushed him into it. She said yes but holy shit all of us watching were hoping she wouldn\u2019t...now imagine proposing or even worse being proposed to in an Escape Room, knowing you are being watched and listened to through cameras...what an absurd choice to make",

Well, everyone was trying to get into that aforementioned vault, I was aitting there with my empty money bag and decided to loot the \"dead bodies\", including the actor - either for more clues or valuables (we WERE pretending to he robbers, after all). Sadly, all of the bodies had nothing on them.\n\nAfter all is over and done with, we took the money bags abd manage to bolt, we sit there and talk about the room, pretty thrilled. That was when the GM (?) comes, laughing his ass off, in tow with the actor, who looks pretty bewildered. What they told us was that during the 3 years (at the time) this Escape Room was created, nobody had tried to frisk the bodies, not to mention so thorougly (I checked every pocket, even took the shoes off the dummies, didn't go that far with the actor, though). I felt really bad, I didn't realise the actor wasn't a dummy (he was laying on his face during the 'heist') and I didn't take his shoes out, because I noticed the paper with the code on a shelf close to the body. I was mortified - I had checked even his back pockets... My group was fucking laughing their asses off.

So for the remaining fifteen minutes or so, we scramble frantically looking for more clues to figure out how to open this damn door, but failed. When we asked about it afterwards, the guy was confused because the last puzzle we solved was the one that should have opened the door.

They probably actually deserved it and she knew every solution to every room already. I still cringe.",

Everything one cell did gave the other cell a new hint or puzzle to solve. One involved helping the other side use a strong magnet to guide a ball through a puzzle in the mirror to open the door. Note the word \u201cstrong\u201d.\n\n2 rooms later, we\u2019re on the final puzzle in a library. We knew the actual puzzle was arrange a set of chess pieces on a board to make the key fall off a hook inside a glass case on the wall. After 20 minutes of debate, and only 5 minutes left to finish, I got the brilliant idea of trying to use that strong magnet to pull the key off the hook. As you can imagine, it worked, we got the door, and the worker didn\u2019t know what to do because we were apparently the first ones to ever do that.",

            "Had a group finish  in 20 minutes by skipping the 2 other rooms. The final door code was gps coordinates which you could find in the 3rd room, turns out in the very first room one of the decorations was a world map (old one like leathery-from-30-years-back), one of the participants knew geography and how to read gps coordinates from a map. They noticed the door code length and he just went straight at the map found the approximate city coordinates. When they got out he said the clues weren't really good because \"he couldn't be 100% sure of the coordinates and had to adjust a bit which he shouldn't had to have to\".\n\nI showed 'the photo we took at the end to all my coworkers and no one remembered anyone, it was most likely their first time. They were a bit disappointed after seeing that they missed almost everything so we offered them a free game in one of our other rooms.\n\n\nWe also had a group of 3 students stuck on an equation written on a glass. In theory you had to erase the equation with a tissue and only a portion of it would not erase thus revealing a code. One of them looked at the equation, said it was unsolvable so they all considered it was part of the decoration. The 3 of them went to check it out at some point and they all thought it was decoration, I had to lead them into trying to erase it (it was the sole help they received from me). The very same group, in the final room found our skeletons dismembered and proceeded to rebuild them from sractch because they found some numbers on a few bones we never noticed, well lo and behold we now have one complete skeleton all fixed up. Turns out they were bioinformatics students (I think, not sure, it was a fe years back). Also, they did the whole stuff without turning the lights on (the theme was an abandoned metro station with the front of a carriage which had a flashing light so they went back to the flashing light to read every clue (it wasn't complete darkness, so you could see pretty well except for reading some papers), I thought of telling them to turn it on but since they were on time and didn't seemed bothered I never did. After all of this they still managed to get out in time. Moral of the story: They thought too much and searched too far.",

These stories are more about odd behavior rather than crazy things people had done to solve rooms. \n\nA family was playing a room one time and some of their kids were teenagers. I guess one of the teens got tired and instead of laying down on the bed in the room, she decided to push all of their work and clues they had gathered so far off of a table, onto the floor, lay on the table, and fall asleep. The rest of them continues as if nothing had happened. \n\nAnother time a preteen group was playing and one of their them showed up late. When we let her into the room late everyone said their usual hellos, but then one of the girls walked up to her and just licked her face. Like from the chin to the top of the cheek, not a small, quick one. I definitely had to watch that one again to make sure I\u2019d seen what happened correctly. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve seen so many groups do stupid things to try to solve the room that I can\u2019t easily remember what was the most absurd.",

I like to look at the AP, Reuters, the BBC, Wikipedia, MediaBiasFactCheck.com, and depending on the story - sometimes Reddit and Twitter. \n\nWikipedia has an army of devoted fact checkers behind it that meticulously watch its content and the pages nearly always have a warning if they are not sourced, have been recently edited, or have disputed/unverified sources. Also, you have a list of all the references at the bottom. That makes verification quite easy. \n\nAllSides.com can show you how things get spun different ways.

Everything fell apart. I was distraught. We continued dating for a while but it was long distance - other side of the world. When I visited it would be super awkward. Eventually he dad kicked me out.

            "We were dating for a little over a year but I was so sure she was the one. I drove 2 hours to see her at her college and went on a beautiful winter night walk and proposed. She looks me right in the eyes and said, \u201cOh you thought this was serious? Well um I don\u2019t know how to say this other than I have been saying other people. Well actually I have been seeing other women.\u201d I was stunned I got up put the ring in my pocket and walked to my car got in and drove away never looking back crying the whole time. Haven\u2019t seen or spoken with her in 7 years even though she has tried countless times to reach out. Now it\u2019s a story I tell friends who are nervous about asking their significant others to marry them. Reminding them that even if they say no it could be worse",
            "About two years later I met my wife of 22 years--we are happily married.  The one who said \"no\" got married, for the first time, last year, and seems happy.  My wife is way into me in ways that the former girlfriend never was, and I see my life as far happier with my wife than I ever was with the one who said no.  She's not a bad person; I was just young and in love with someone who wasn't in love with me.  It worked out for the best.  I'm glad she said no.",
            "Not sure if this count but I proposed, she said yes, but 1 month before the wedding she took it back. This is what happened immediately with my life.\n\n* I personally lost about $3,000 worth of deposits. My parents and her parents lost about $4000 each on deposits. Me and my parents are working class so it took years for us to financially recovered from this.\n* I spent $2,200 on a ring I didn't want. **My biggest regret and will say this anyone who listens.** The engagement ring chain I bought it from wouldn't take it back. I took it to pawn shops and they'd only offer a few hundred. This engagement ring store, bank on customers who wants the whole ring (stone, band, setting). If you're going to buy a ring **JUST BUY THE STONE** a gold band, setting you can get a better deal from a local jewelry store. Apparently my gem I bought was shit. Most of the cost of the ring was BS.\n* Most of my family was from out of state and a lot of people were pissed because they canceled their flight.\n* I had to go to the ER. So I didn't leave my room, I couldn't take any calls because everyone was pissed and I didn't want to hear it. I was depressed and just stayed in bed. One day my roommate grabbed me and took me to the ER where the doctor treated me for severe dehydration and an infection.\n\nWhat happened when I got over it? I became stronger for it. I didn't propose to anyone until a decade later - honestly there wasn't anyone that I didn't love deeply enough to be in a committed relationship. But when I proposed I was in my thirties our relationship was more mature than my first time I proposed. We're now married for 13 years. SHe's my best friend. When I have good news she the first person I want to tell it too... when I have bad news she's the first person I want to tell it too. I financially recovered as well.\n\nI learned my lesson about the engagement ring. Only paid $300 for it. She LOVED it and treasures it. After our 10 year miles stone we were doing so well, I told her to pick a wedding ring of any cost. She refused. She still wears that cheap $300 ring and loves it.",

He started drinking, found a new \"passion\" in gambling and gambled all his savings away. He ended up living on money of the state, works a garbage picker job now and almost set his house on fire at least 4 times that i know of by making food and falling asleep drunk. He was an... Interesting guy, friendly to some but the state hes in is just sad. Hope at some point he picks up his life again. Havent heard of him in years though so no idea where he is now",
            "Well she said yes but no. Met her online and we really hit it off. She was just amazing. We only knew each other for a month before she moved in with me and it was just magical. Proposed just after a year together. She had a genetic disorder and it made her heart swollen. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy and it was pretty bad. You could see her heart pushing out in between her ribs. She didn't want to get married because then we wouldn't be able to afford her checkups and medication. She was constantly quite weak but still full of life. She took naps very often and one day she just didn't wake up. I cried for days and was heartbroken for a couple years. I still think of her quite often and visit her grave whenever I visit home since it is 1000 miles away now. I know I filled the end of her life with happiness as she told me very often. Just feel guilty sometimes.",
            "I was the person who said no.\n\nWe had only known each other for 3 months and he was smitten, I was more cautious. I said no, I like you but it's way too soon. He asked when would be enough time, I said maybe a year. \n\nHe proposed again at midnight, one year after we first met, I said yes and we have been together 8 years now.\n\nEdit: I know a year was still not a long time, but we had a long engagement and didn't get married for another 2.5 years",

            "She was in trauma from a past relationship, and at that time I wanted to help her move on, and in that act I realised that I've fallen in love with her, as she's the one who despite being in depression, helped me out of my social anxiety. I just couldn't see her suffer\n\nSo I proposed to her, and got rejected, as she wasn't ready to be in another relationship and since I confessed about love, she got more anxious and out friendship was temporarily over. We didn't talk or have contact for months. Later on, I somehow contacted her, we had a bit of talk, and asked how she was doing, and learnt that she has been shutting herself in her room minimising contact with people. I still had romantic feelings for her, but I wanted to be with her and help her move on so I insisted being friends again. We spent our time like that, and honestly she's the only friend I had.\n\nTime passed, and when I saw she's getting back to her normal life, I proposed her again, and she accepted. It was a long way to that day. I've never been happier in my life. It's been 4 years since then, though we have arguements due to different views, but we always come up with a solution to resolve things. And I can say this with certainty that nobody can love me the way she does. I feel lucky to have her in my life.",

He was lazy, never went to class, didn\u2019t stand up for himself, and was codependent. \n\nI said no. \n\nHe then proceeded to literally stalk me. We lived in the same apartment complex, but different units. He would knock on my door all hours of the day. I never answered. He would call and text constantly. This was before you could block numbers on an iPhone.\n\nHe attempted to break in to my roommates window and was successful because she had left it unlocked. I wasn\u2019t at the apartment and he told her, \u201cI was just trying to get some stuff\u201d.\n\nThe very rare occasions I would open the door (very shortly after our break up), he would force his way in or stick his boot in between the door so I couldn\u2019t close it. \n\nI called the cops numerous times but they never did anything. \n\nHe would follow me if I left places. \n\nAt one point, he somehow knew information that I knew he COULDNT have known and found out he had somehow installed a program onto my computer to track all my passwords and keystrokes and activity. \n\nThat was when I decided to change my phone number. \n\nHe would leave stuff on our balcony. Letters, gifts, random shit. \n\nHe did not stop and would threaten me often by saying he would find out my new phone number. \n\nEventually, it did get less and less, however TO THIS DAY, I still hear from him. \n\nI\u2019m married now (for almost 4 years) and I\u2019ve heard that he is also married and has a kid on the way.\n\nBut a few months ago, he found my extremely obscure Facebook (it\u2019s not even my full name. It\u2019s half my first name and only my middle name. I have maybe 11 \u201cfriends\u201d on there that he has no connection with. I really only use this fb to be in groups to discuss true crime) and asked me to meet up with him for lunch for closure. I blocked him, but I know I\u2019ll hear from him again somehow in a few months. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous, honestly. I regret ever dating the guy.",
            "Very first girlfriend ever. Started dating at 17. After six years of dating I proposed. She said \"No, I'm sorry.\" I asked why. She said, \"I've been thinking about this for a while but didn't talk to you about it. I found someone else.\" Then she broke up with me right then and there. I asked if she cheated and she said no. \"We're just friends right now. But he makes me happy when I'm with him and you just... *don't.* You used to. But not anymore.\" I tried sabotaging their relationship when I found him begging her for nudes, tattled to her ultra-christian parents that he was twice her age (which he is), and did everything I could to be the insane one. Finally realized what I was doing, apologized, promised to never talk to her or her family ever again. I sold the ring and used the money to buy a guitar and a boatload of weed and spiraled out of control for three years. Flunked all my classes, got a dead-end job at a construction gig, slowly descended into borderline alcoholism. Couldn't leave the house or go to work or do my job without being high. Gained a ton of weight, let myself go. Finally contemplated suicide, planned it out with a 20-page instruction manual on how to make it painless, not screw it up, and not hurt anyone in the process. Never went through with it because I kept getting scared and spending my suicide fund on weed and alcohol. Finally broke down and told my parents all of this. Asked for help. Spent another year in a rehab program with a therapist. Got out and have been clean for three years by this September and still wake up at 3am feeling sick every couple of months for the way I treated her after having spent six years telling her that I loved her. But that's all over, now, and all I can do is learn from it, promise to be better, and keep going.\n\nSo now I'm turning 29 in a week, still living at home with parents, and constantly battling self-loathing and anxiety while working a job for $9.25 an hour. But I pay my parents $300/month to stay with them and I'm going back to school. Taking the minimum number of credit hours per semester since I'm paying for it out of pocket and I work full time (and overtime when I can get it), but slowly dragged my GPA from a 1.28 to a 2.64 and can start getting help next semester instead of paying for *all* of it out of pocket, now. I also lost a ton of weight during the pandemic and weigh just 189, now, (in rehab I dropped to 220, but I was closer to 245-250 before that). Safe to say I won't be worth dating for a long time, but maybe when I get my degree under my belt and finish growing and learning I can get a self-sustaining job I can move out and truly start over.\n\n**EDIT:** Hey guys I'm getting a swath of PMs asking what the number one thing was that helped me through that time and I'm saying without a single doubt that punk rock did it, and going to punk concerts. [This song by my all-time favorite band The Flatliners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut4qQbwZDVU) was my wake-up song and [Best Bud's song Girlfriend](https://bestbud.bandcamp.com/track/girlfriend-2) helped me realize that if I wanted to try and make my own music it can be short and punchy as long as its from the heart.",
            "Dated my wife in highschool. I was all wrong for her at the time, and it was going way too fast so we broke up on good terms. One of the last times we talked, I aksed her if she would marry me one day, she laughed it off and said no way, and said I was definetly not the marrying type.  Fast Forward to college, I was working full time and she was a law student, and she walked in to the liquor store I was the manager of. We talked for an hour, and it continued in the parking lot, just talking and catching up. At the end of the conversation as she was leaving, jokingly I asked her to marry me again. She laughed, I laughed.. and she said \"we'll see\".\n\nMarried 16 years in October.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit; a word",
            "It was absolutely horrible at first. I legit thought my life was ending as shortly after that she wanted to \"take a break\". Pretty much she wanted to date her co-worker at Baker's square, and had a really weird cult-ish relationship with all her co-workers. At first I was confused/upset, all of the above. But weirdly enough one of her friends/acquaintance for me contacted me since she knew I was in a rough patch, completely innocently, and we hung out, and she even knew that I wanted to get back together with her at some point, so it wasn't anything immediate. Eventually, the girl I proposed to found out her co-worker boy toy was a douche and wanted to get back together with me, and obviously I had been fretting about it for like 3 months so I instantly said yes even though unknowingly I started forming a bond with her friend/my acquaintance. Slowly, things just started deteriorating as I started getting honestly kind of suspicious that she wanted to get together with one of her other co-workers, and surprisingly I was actually right. She ending up breaking up with me again, and I thought I was gonna go through it all again, but this time the shock only lasted a few days since this time I kind of had closure. Meanwhile, somehow I think the friend/my acquaintance/current girlfriend of 4 years knew that this was gonna happen, and was there for me when I needed it. Like both times for me it was super rough, couldn't even function. Got together, and honestly I can't even understand how I thought I was happy with my old girlfriend who I proposed to. I even look back, and I'm realizing that even her family was fucked up. Her Mom was extremely controlling, and even (disgustingly) bragged about how she dated a boy in high school for a few years and broke up with him and hurt his feelings so bad that he moved for mental health reasons. Like, I guess the apple didn't fall far from the tree? To be quite honest though, I miss her dad A LOT. Like honestly, he messages me every once and awhile (I doubt his daughter knows) and basically I can just hear it in his voice that he would rather her date me then her new boyfriend since I had a pretty good bond with him. Even so, I still don't like to message back with anything too much since I'd somehow weirdly feel like it's cheating on my current girlfriend who has the most chill parents I've ever met, and are super easy going. I honestly think my life would've been hell if I chose to marry my past girlfriend with a mom-in law problem. Anyways that's my story. Thanks for reading!",

In an instant all that came crashing down around me.\n\nWhat followed after was the single most devastating time of my life. I couldn't work, they were there. I tried but got pulled off the job (never happens on the railroad, they will literally work you to death) by another supervisor and sent to get checked at the hospital. They took me off on stress leave. Within a month I had stopped eating, stopped sleeping, stopped doing literally anything.... didn't answer the phone... just laid there on the couch with Netflix endlessly streaming. I don't even know what.\n\nEventually some friends who hadn't seen or heard from me in some time came to check on me... I must have been in rough shape, half the house was destroy, my hands were just a bleeding mess from smashing things.. I think there were still bits of that lovely Ikea particle board stuck in my knuckles here and there. They took me to a hospital.\n\nIntake upgraded me to critical care, that was full so I had to stay the night in a secure waiting room. The next day a doctor met with me, asked me some questions. He said \"In the 13 years I've worked hear you're the most suicidal person I've ever met. I'm honestly surprised you're alive.\" Will never forget that. I'd never even thought of myself as a suicidal person before. I couldn't help but think dying would be easier than living through what I was feeling. They put me in a psych ward for 3 months... no outside privileges, a merry-go-round of different medications to try and help change my mood. I had no contact with the outside, I wanted it that way. I shut down social media and shut off the phone. I didn't want the friends and family who were so proud of me to see what I had become, a miserable, hollow, shadow of my former self. The only person I called was her, I asked her to come get me. She never came.\n\nIt's hard to say what happened next, eventually the friends who had taken me to the hospital were allowed to see me and visited from time to time.\n\nI don't remember moving out of my house, I don't remember what happened to all of my belongings. I don't remember being 28 years old. I have a picture of a birthday somewhere... but no recollection of it. I spent the next year on a lot of prescription drugs that destroyed my memory. Eventually one day I woke up in a bed, in a strange room, in a strange house. I walked out the door to a dining room where there were no less than 7 bibles on the table. It scared me. I had no idea where I was. There were keys to a truck parked outside on the table in my bedroom next to what was certainly, my computer.\n\nA woman stopped by, nursing student, beautiful, talented, caring. She was there to see me, and to my surprise we were dating, had been for a time it would seem. But that was strange for me... I had known her before all of this, but never in this context and the relationship felt weird and unnatural. The medication had run out and I was coming out of it, starting to be more present again. Apparently the friend who brought me to the hospital was there when I was discharged and took me with him to his Church. I had no place to live and they set me up with one of their members and had paid 2 months rent for me to stay there. I've never been religious like that in my adult life and this was strange to me, but at least I wasn't homeless.\n\nI just woke up one day with a new life and had to accept that that was the case. And so like, Mario, I started the game over again.\n\nI would go on to help the same friend who took me to the hospital through his divorce and to buy a house that we both lived in. The girl and I amicably parted ways a few months later. I started volunteering and went back to school. Officially resigned from the railroad. Some of the people I left behind when I cut all ties with that relationship I still haven't spoken to again since that day.\n\nNow I'm sitting here, 6 years later, attempting to create podcasts where people have a safe space in their lives to talk about their struggles and reduce the stigma surrounding them, and launching a facebook group and YouTube channel aimed at helping people achieve holistic wellness and self-discovery.\n\nThat's the whole story... and probably the first time I've shared it.  \n\n\nEDIT: This got way more attention than I was expecting. I'm going to attempt to answer the questions below... I've never received so many so I'll do my best. Thank you for your support and the Silver and Hugs, but most importantly for listening. Sometimes it's very strange to think you've gone through something so unbelievable in your life...",
            "After about a year I proposed to a beautiful woman with a beautiful 4 yo daughter. (Her brother and I were firefighters together and he set me up.) She quickly said yes. I then asked her daughter if I could be her step dad and she said yes. I should have realized something was off when she wanted to wait and tell her family. We waited for 2 months and then she broke it off. Her brother knew about the proposal and couldn't figure it out either. Come to find out she was secretly see another guy. Her family and her daughter were upset with her. Saw the daughter about 6 years later with her uncle and she said that her mom made a big mistake leaving me. She wished I was her stepdad.",
            "I was in a relationship with her for 5 years, living together for 1. She had an infant daughter from a previous relationship with a drug addict who popped up ocasionally. We moved together because her mother stole her rent money for months. I was feeling depressed and lost my job ( I was diagnosed with Clinical depression later when I sought help). I told her I wanted to move back to my parents house as I was going mad. She said If I did, It would be all over between us.\nI moved and a week later, I tried to reach her and she had started a relationship with a biker she met while we were together.\nI went to her house and proposed, got rejected. She had a hickey.\nIts been 5 years, she now has 2 more children. I started treatment for my depression (3 more months to complete), moved to another city and had a substantial boost on my salary.\nI'm feeling better than in the last 15 years.",
            "\nIt was the second grade and the girl\u2019s name was Christina and she was in my class. \n\nI asked her if she would marry me and she said no. I did the only reasonable thing, I told the teacher on her.",
            "I'm a lady, but proposed ( and got rejected) by my ex of 5 years. \nWe started dating at 16-17 y/o, and dates for 5 years. I decided i was ready to take our relationship to the next step, and since we discussed marriage possibilities a lot beforehand, i knew he wanted for me to propose and that he wanted to get married with me. \nSo i planned the perfect way to ask him to marry me. Bought the rings, planned and payed for a 2 days kayak and camping trip, so that the 2 of us would be alone. We rented some camping gear and went on our merry way. After setting our tent and having dinner at the end of the first day, i decided to pop the question in front of the campfire. \nThe first thing he asked me is if I was joking. I said no. He asked if i was for real. I said yes. Then said that he wasn't ready for this kind of things. That he was \"just a kid\". I cried a lot. He didn't even want to see the rings i chose for us. We had an awkward end of our trip, then went back home.\nWe were together for a year after that, but things were different. The fact that he rejected me made me more aware that he was, in fact, still a kid. And i didn't want that at this stage of my life. So i ended the relationship.\nI've been single for almost a year now, and i honestly feel better. I grew so much as a person in that year, and i'm happy he found someone else who is more to his pace.",
            "Yes finally one of these that i can relate to!\n\nWe met through family and I asked her to marry me, ( made a romantic video and asked ) she said she would think about it, ignored me for 2 weeks and then said she thought about it and that she just didn't feel ready but wanted to be friends afterwards. \n\nNow here is the crazy part! for the longest part she was the one driving me crazy with marriage! SOOO happy we never got married!!!",
            "I proposed to my husband several times before he did.  (I know this question was specifically targeting hetero males, but this applies).  He stated he wanted to marry me, but not right away.  We were together almost five years before he said yes.  I wasn't going to give up on this man.",
            "We had been dating about 6 weeks. I knew. I just knew she was the one. She said, \"You're a great guy and I love you, but I'm not ready to get married.\"\n\nWe continued dating. I asked again a week or so later. Similar response. \n\nLather, rinse, repeat. I asked 4 more times over the next few weeks. Finally we were at a Chinese restaurant. Fortune cookies come. Mine says, \"Your wish is within reach. Ask once more.\" Hers says, \"Get your hope chest ready.\" No bullshit. No setup. Totally random cookies from the restaurant. I reached across the table, took her hand and asked for the 7th time. She didn't really say, \"Yes.\" More like a sigh and a resigned \"Okay.\"\n\nFirst date: Dec 12, 1981\nMarried: Apr 3, 1982\n\nStill together. One son, 2 granddaughters, 2 great granddaughters. Still giddily in love.\n\nNever give up! Never surrender!\n\nEdit: thanks for the silver, mysterious benefactor!",
            "My husband propsed to me 5 times before I said yes. \n\nThe first time I thought he was joking so I brushed it off with a pffft. \n\nThe second time was after sex so I thought it was like a, woah moment.\n\nThe third time we were driving to a graduation party with his grandma and I was playing a game, not really paying attention and thought he was messing around again.\n\nThe fourth time was on our two year anniversary, and I told him I wanted to wait as we werent living together yet (I was taking care of my grandfather at the time).\n\nThe time I said yes was when I knew he was the one. I was a mess, and stressed, and crying in my car when he asked. I told him that I was ugly right now, and wanted to be pretty when he asked. He told me I was the most beautiful thing to him (melt). I said yes of course. We just celebrated a year of being married, and 6 years of being together \u2764",
            "This is like a delayed no, I proposed, she said yes, we set a date, 6 months before that we were talking and she suggested we postpone the wedding, I took that as a break up and moved out. (Not the best at communicating) a few months later after us continuing to see each other I suggested we get get back together. She said, well we might as well get married then. We got married 2 weeks later, that was over 13 years ago. So much for textbook.",

            "I was with my girlfriend for five years, I planned a scavenger hunt in a park, at the end was a perfect spot to pop the question, a single bench next to the water right at sunset. The entire hunt should only take 15 min. But after about 5 min and 2:5 locations found she said \"This is stupid.\" I said no worries we don't have to do this if it dumb... \n\nTurned out she had plans that night that she did not want to be late for. That night she was with someone else. I found out immediately by a accidental butt dial while their getting down and dirty in a car somewhere. \n\n I loved her very much and it crushed me. When she came home in the morning I told her that I felt like there was nothing between us anymore, an that I wanted to break up.\n\n She cried and carried on how bad a person I was, her parents who were very religious told me how disappointed they were in me and that I was just leading her on.  I ate that crow tail and all, a pride and ego swallowing siege. If I said she cheated her parents would probably have disowned her so it was my best interest not to say anything so at least she have a home to go-to. \n\nI never told her I found out she was cheating, spent the next ten years of my life surfing the east coast and living off couches in exchange for cleaning their homes or being homeless. \n\nI did contract remote work making ~120k a year just shoving it in the bank, while spending maybe $300 bucks a month or necessities, my hair unkempt, my clothing dirty, torn and tattered. \n\nNice laptop, nice surfboard and a duffle bag half full of my only possessions.  It has been wonderful, never been so happy.\n\nI know she asked about me one time through her brother, her parents told them I'm a deadbeat homeless man.\n\nI met a girl, she was poor, lived in low income housing. But she is a hard worker, two jobs waiting tables, went to night classes, and had two kids from a previous marriage. I asked her how could she love me, I had nothing, just look at me. She did not care, she cleaned me up, cut my hair, offered to buy me some new clothing.\n\nShe asked me to marry her and I did. I bought her a house, and a new Toyota van for the kids, and she's not had to work a day after. Next year will be our ten year anniversary.",
            "Not exactly the same thing, but I told my now wife the second day we were talking that I was going to marry her. Her response was, \u201cI\u2019ll NEVER get married again.\u201d We dated six months-ish then she dumped me seemingly out of nowhere. We were broken up nearly six months before I unblocked her number and unblocked her on social media. When we met up again in person I gave her the biggest hug and kiss and just couldn\u2019t believe she was back. After tons of long talks and building our relationship back and WAY stronger we got engaged. I married the fuck out of her, and now we\u2019re happier and stronger than ever. I\u2019m so glad it worked out this way. I love her more than I thought possible. I\u2019m a lucky dude.",

            "We talked about getting married and agreed that so long as the proposal was a surprise it would be fine. So I got help from some of her friends to make it special. Dinner at her favorite restaurant with our families in attendance and the ring on a piece of chocolate cake delivered by the waiter. The act was \"we just all happened to show up at the same place on the same day at the same time\". Sure, a child could see that it was a setup, but that wasn't the point.\n\nEvening goes great, cake comes out, ring is discovered, I get down on one knee...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...and she says no in front of everyone.\n\nMy family is shocked.

            "I didn't get to hear her say no, here's the story,\n\nI was with my ex girlfriend for about six years, we had a lot of ups and downs but ultimately we were always able to talk and work things out. Our relationship was not bad to say the least and I felt like the more time passed the better it was getting. We had sort of similar mindsets but we did disagreed on certain things, however, we did connect a lot in many hobbies, ideas and I felt like we were both in the same frequency for the most part. By November of last year I really felt like our relationship was really good and there were no problems. There came a point where she had an opportunity to go work in Japan like she once did at a certain point in our relationship, however she said that she does not want to go live alone again and would rather go if I can go live with her because the first time she did it, I could not live with her since we were not married and that caused her to have a lot of depression and loneliness. For me to live with her in Japan even if I don't work for her company, I would have to be married to her or else the Japanese government basically says \"no you can't live here\". I started thinking a lot about marriage and how we've been dating for so long and she always bothered me about how I have to propose to her since she asked me out when we started dating. So I did what I thought was best and I decided to ask her hand in marriage (or at least attempt) since we were dating for so long and I really thought I was going to be with her for the rest of my life. I asked multiple family and friends about rings, where to buy, who can make custom rings, what materials, everything. \n\nAt this point it was December and we were approaching Christmas day so I planned on proposing to her on Christmas day because both of our favorite holiday was Christmas because of how much joy it brings and how it makes people come together. I asked for her ring size discreetly because I never really had that information. I went on ahead and looked for someone that made custom rings, I went and asked the man to make me a replica of the ring that howl wears from the Ghibli movie howls moving castle because her favorite movie of all time was howls moving castle and I wanted to show her how much thought I put into the ring and I knew that she would wear it for as long as she can. I got the ring, it was perfect, made out of pure silver, she wasn't one to want very fancy things so she didn't care much about price value but more about the thought that goes into it and also I didn't have much money but the ring was stunning none the less.\n\n3 days before Christmas we had an event at a friends house where it was a mini Christmas get together with the friend group. We went to the event, had a good time but it was time to go home. We decided to stop by a Wendy's since we were both hungry and something came up where we essentially had a sort of argument and disagreement, it was a big disagreement that affected the relationship and our current status so at the end of the argument (mind you I was not sober) I essentially said \"if this is what you want then I think it's best if you find someone else\". She replied with \"is that what you really think?\" to which I sort of let out a big sigh and was about to explain to her my thoughts but ultimately she essentially said \"OK\". she started talking about how she's been watching my actions and how I treat her and what everyone has been telling her on how I treat her and that the past few months I haven't given her respect she needed. How for every good thing I did, it would be overshadowed by the bad things I would do right after. She didn't want to pretend like things were okay anymore and proceeded to tell me how unhappy she was for the past few months and how she had a sudden \"waking up\" moment the past few days that she deserves better. She apologized for the \"bad timing\" of her sudden realization and told me how her choice was influenced with the fact that she felt like I was going to propose and proceeded to say that if I was going to she will feel really bad because she just ended the relationship, which I just simply replied with \"well, you didn't know so its not your fault\". We were both crying at that point but it was time for me to get out of the car because we were at my house and you can only talk about it so much for one night on something that was not going to change. \n\nI was living in complete ignorance for the past few months, I thought everything was fine but obviously it wasn't. I wasn't aware of my actions towards her or even towards all my friends. I was not being mindful of a lot of things when I should of been. Overall that whole experience was a big lesson for me. It was a lesson that taught me to be more mindful about my actions, to listen to my emotions more and to be more self aware of How I am acting towards others, especially towards the person that I declared my partner. I loved her immensely, if I didn't I wouldn't of gone through the lengths I did to even find a guy that was willing to do my request for the ring, or for everything else I have done for her over the years, she loved me a lot too but one person can only tolerate so much after a while. I brought her down many times when I should encouraged her, in a way I was her biggest hater when I should of been her #1 fan. She grew a lot over the years while I stayed behind without changing for the better. I'm glad she had that sudden realization, I'm glad things ended because it helped me grow as a person for these past 7 months. It was very hard at first but I'm doing better then I did before. \n\nTo be honest our relationship should of ended 3 years earlier but we kept fighting for it. When I look back at it I realize how we were not as compatible and how we had many arguments and disagreements. I held her back in many places just like she held me back in others. we don't hate each other, we actually care for each other very much but it was obvious that it was better if we were just friends. Again I'm very glad this happened, I've been able to grow and focus on myself to be a better person and she as well has been able to grow even more. \n\nThe moral of the story is stay true to yourself, focus on what makes you happy without the need of someone else, be mindful about your actions and listen to your emotions and if you really care about the other person, sometimes it's necessary to make the tough decision but know that in the end its best for both parties. \n\nIt will get better.\n\nEdit: Wow!

We (his kids) all really like her and are happy that he\u2019s not alone and has companionship.

            "Dated a woman for 4 years and really wasn't going well. But I felt bad because I felt guilty for leading her on at the start and she wanted to get married (that was her priority). I was 21 and she was 28. The first time I proposed (25M and 32F) she said no. So I asked again a few months later and she still said no. So I decided to break up with her and move on with my life. Was pretty happy and it coincided with my job moving me to a new city. I was starting to look at the relationship objectively and realised it was for the best. This girl had ruined a lot of close relationships I had and was an emotional bully, she also used to spend most of my money (I gave her my credit card details once and she took that to mean that she had unlimited use), she used to threaten my job security (she knew the CEO's daughter and would threaten to tell everyone I raped her if I broke up with her) and she would threaten my families lives (said she'd hurt my sister really badly if I broke up).\n\nAfter not being together for 6 months she decides to show up at my house in the new city and ring the bell incessantly (I wasn't home), she then calls me and cries asking if I was with a girl (I was) then begs to meet up with me while she's in town. I agree we go out to breakfast, she's on her best behaviour and even pays (bearing in mind that she owes me thousands of dollars from all the shit she bought with my card and all the fake money emergencies she had). She begs to get back together and said we should get married.

Everything went perfectly... untill the part where I got down on one knee and presented the ring. Long story short she told me she couldn't cus she was cheating on me on and off for a year and told me I deserved better we broke up and we dont talk anymore",
            "Semi related my mom wanted to marry my dad for a long time, but my dad wasn\u2019t ready, so then eventually when my dad asked her, my mom thought he was joking so she started laughing. Now 24 years later and still happily married, my mom still laughs when telling that story. My dad still doesn\u2019t.",
            "Met in college. Liked her a lot. Things were going great, but in retrospect there were sooo many reasons it was not ever going to work out. At some point (4-6 months?) she said if we were still together after a year that I should ask her to get married. I don't think I said OK, I think it was much more lets see and lets get there first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlash forward and we break up at 10 or 11 months (probably took a good month to break up). At 12 months it was well over, but she still half-jokingly brought up that I \"promised\" to ask her to marry me at 12 months. I said that I would ask her to marry me if she promised to say no. She said OK, so I asked and she said no. Kind of weird, but strangely cathartic. I met my wife about 8 months later, and we have been together for over 30 years and married for 25.",

He was at a dance but had broken his ankle wrestling with his friends, cuz he was twenty five and did that for fun. So he goes to a dance, where he meats my great grandma. He asks her to dance, and she later wrote his he only said yes because she thought he was a wounded vet, which was technically true. The next day he asks her to marry him, she says she\u2019ll think about it and a week later they get married.",
            "I was 16 and met this 21 year old when I was on the college campus. We hung out and I was very cautious *still a virgin* and I didn\u2019t know his age. We were inseparable and he told me his age but I thought of him like a big brother. When I graduated and I was 18 we went on dates a lot. We went on a cruise for my 19th birthday and Christmas of that year he proposed. I said yes and he said he asked for my moms approval which was BIG to me. I later found out he didn\u2019t, I talked to my mom and she said absolutely not. She said when I was 16 he was basically preying on me because he was much older. At that point It was very very hard to pick. I listened to my mom and said no, we continued to date off and on until I graduated college. When I moved out of state for a job we broke it off. I was very sad but I saw it coming. We didn\u2019t talk after I moved but I heard he was drinking and relapsing on drugs. Fast forward 4 years I went to lunch with him and the spark wasn\u2019t there, we are friends but they constant abuse as a teenager just turned me off. He is married now though, his parents reached out to me and asked me to help because apparently his new wife is a hardcore druggie and influenced his relapse.",
            "That should\u2019ve been the reddest flag amongst them all. 4 months later I discovered she had been cheating on me for 8 months. I walked away and spent a few years figuring out who I was and what I really wanted out of a relationship. About a year later I met my now wife and we\u2019re celebrating 13 years together this year and she\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to me.",

            "People who **surprise** their partners with engagements: why do you think it's okay to force someone to make a major,  life changing legal decision on an emotionally stressful snap decision?\n\nNo proposal should be a surprise. You discuss marriage, as a couple, and eventually both agree that you want it. Then, one day, one of you *then* surprises the other with a proposal. You KNOW it will be a yes, because you spoke about it like adults",

I wanted to travel, work, get life experience and the thought of marriage felt suffocating for me. He was not happy ofcourse and we stuck around for a year or so and then I broke it off. We were very different in character, wants and needs. So in hindsight it was bound for failure one way or the other.",
            "Didn't propose but was proposed to by a girl, relationship was on the rocks and think it was an attempt to save things on her part.\n\nA few weeks later we broke up and two days later I met my future wife."

First half of our marriage we always slept in the same bed (of course there was the occasional crying kid who wanted mommy to sleep with them, or falling asleep on the couch or somewhere else).  About ten years ago I spent a year working a midnight shift so I started sleep on our spare bed in the basement.  We both realized we had much better sleep separate in our own beds.  After I went back to a day shift we went back to sleeping in the same bed and soon realized sleeping apart was more restful.  Over time we bought two full size beds and put them in our bedroom (like the old TV shows).  It's been great.\n\nedit: so a lot of comments about intimacy.  Yeah we have sex, I'd say every bit as much as we ever did in the past.  We've been married over half our life so we are really good at knowing when fun time is going to happen.  Sometimes we sleep in the same bed, there is no rules we have to sleep separately all the time.  Our beds are about a foot apart and sometimes we slide them together, especially when the kids were younger and they'd end up in our room, along with the dog.  \n\n\nedit 2: Yes we got married at 18.

This went on for a couple decades. Mom never got a proper bed of her own, just invested in high-quality couches for our living room and chose to sleep there every night.\n\nThen one day, years after I'd grown and moved out of the house, my parents announced a divorce. Which shocked me because I had never known any discontent between them. I asked my mother what happened and she said that she fell out of love with my dad after my sister was born, but she didn't want the two of us kids growing up in a broken home, so they agreed to live together until we had both moved out of the house. My parents were still the best of friends, just not lovers. So it was awkward for them to be sharing a bed together.\n\nMy mother now lives on the opposite side of the country from the rest of us, on land she inherited from her mother. She built a cabin in the woods and is now happily living on her own. She has friends where she lives, but claims she doesn't need a relationship anymore.",

And in that vein, it\u2019s the end of the day, you\u2019re tired, just want to get to bed, to have somebody else there literally every single night who has different agendas and time schedules just sucks.

Are there any to which you don't personally adhere?\"\n\n\"What is the most allegedly unacceptable perspective that you hold?\"\n\n------\n\nNow, granted, the answers to questions of that nature are very often things that shouldn't be voiced in public, so you'll want to be tactful about where and when you ask them... but at the same time, if the date seems to be going well, you can use the prospect of more-intimate discussion as an excuse to go somewhere more private. In either case, the best conversation-starters are those which reveal important details about both parties; those which help determine whether or not the two of you will be compatible in the long term.\n\nIn other words, you should absolutely discuss R.A.P.E. on a first date if you're looking for a permanent partner.\n\n**TL;DR: The best conversation-starters are those which would normally be conversation-enders.**",

The amount of money flowing through the industry is huge beyond comprehension, but in the end it ends up in just a few pockets. \n\nCompanies behind large tube sites are earning the bulk of the money, taking revenue from advertisements, memberships, and producing studio's who pay tube sites so said tube sites feature their films on the homepage. In the meanwhile those producers suffer heavily from the terabytes of pirated content which is uploaded daily. Tube sites often refuse to take responsibility for illegal content (said pirated content, but also child porn, human trafficing, rape etc.) Nu stating that they are only a platform and that they cannot be held accountable for what individual users upload. \nLately there was quite some uproar about the Girls-do-porn videos. A number of girls appearing in those video's Stated that they were drugged and then forced to do things that they would have never agreed on. While this case was in court, some tube sites refused to take those video's offline while users still uploaded those.",

            "No Healthcare.\n\nA big problem is that Porn Scenes are shot in a way to be visually stimulating, but not actually safe. Think of scenes where an actress is made to go Full Nelson. There's nothing pleasurable about this position, but it lets you see the girl's entire body, and the guy's dick, all in one shot. Lots of scenes these days also having choking. So basically you're going to be forced to do painful and potentially dangerous things because they look good on Camera; so what happens when you inevitably get hurt? Well, any injuries are considered your fault; you don't get paid any healthcare, and the studio won't take responsibility for hurting you, even tho' they forced you to over-use your body.\n\nA sad side-effect is the amount of guys copying these positions. They don't feel good for the guy or girl, and you'll just hurt your partner. Regular missionary is legitemately one of the most pleasurable positions, yet is avoided for being too boring.",

The people that were popular 25 years ago, wouldn't get far today because they were only primarily only interested in getting paid upfront for shooting scenes. \"If I'm going to do this, I want $300.\" - those types. So, those people could go out and get paid $600 per film, which was great money back in 2001. Many people busted their asses to make as much content as they could but there was no residual income after that. So that's why in the late 90's and early 2000's, there were simply so many films. Now, the women are tracking their income on the back end with things like snapchat and onlyfans. It's not a \"cleaner\" industry by any means.",

Children, women, and even men are bought and sold as property for the purposes of being a sex slave, forced labor, or even organ harvesting. It is so repulsive and yet so hidden and unknown. The sad thing is, many children get caught up in this after natural disasters or other tragic situations.

Turns out the guy was mentally ill and to this day neither myself or the police know how he got in.",
            "I moved into our house a month before my husband did and I was painting our guest room with the windows wide open. I was busy painting, listening to music when I realized it had gotten dark outside. I heard the leaves crunching outside but didn\u2019t think anything of it because we have a lot of neighbors who walk their dogs. When I went to close the windows I saw a man standing in my backyard under the tree maybe 5 feet from our back door staring up at me. I fell to the floor and realized the back glass door was probably open and nothing but the screen which he could have easily just walked into my house. Crawled to my phone and called my husband who then called 911 while rushing home to me. We have a 6 ft tall fence around our yard, this person hopped it to watch me. I couldn\u2019t sleep right at night for months.",
            "One day while I was working afternoons a couple years back I woke up at around 10am and started to watch American Dad before getting up. Next thing you know I hear my back door open. A normal thing in our home since we only use the back door. But no one was supposed to be home yet. I assumed it was my mom and didn\u2019t think anything of it. Then I heard footsteps coming up the stairs as my bedroom was on the second floor. I call out to my mom and get no response. Then my door cracks open and a head pops in. It\u2019s a 30ish year old man with a blonde beard and a big mane of greasy hair who looks shocked to see me. At the time I was about 260lbs 6\u20193 and 20 years old (m). I was also sitting in only my boxers. Before I was able to realize what was happening he asked \u201cis this the ____ residence\u201d to which I reply \u201cno?\u201d . He makes a swift exit and before I can recollect my thoughts he\u2019s not even in my driveway.  Talked to a family friend who is a veteran police officer turns out a man has been pulling this kind of stunt to rob people in nearby towns.",
            "I was babysitting a kid who had a video monitor and was told that she wouldn\u2019t wake up while the parents were out and if she did to call them right away. I was watching tv with the monitor set off to the side to keep an eye on her and right around 11, the cameras view shifted a few inches. It then began to slightly jiggle like someone was messing with it. I was squinting at it trying to decide what I was actually seeing, and I kid you not, the whole screen burst to static for a few seconds, and the kid started WALING.  She stood up and was screaming in her crib just like one of the kids from the sims. When she didn\u2019t fall back asleep after a few minutes I called mom and she said \u201cokay were on our way home anyway. We think she has nightmares sometimes it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nNever again.",

            "I was about 21 or 22 and living by myself at the time, and I left my window open on a pleasant night. It was low enough to the ground that you could get in if you really tried, but the screen wasn\u2019t easy to take off and I lived in a fairly safe neighborhood so I didn\u2019t even think twice about it. Woke up in the middle of the night because I smelled smoke, and I reached out to turn on my lamp and my hand hit what was very obviously a person. My brain fully woke up at that point, and I realized there was a shirtless man in my bedroom, smoking a cigarette and staring at me. I remember yelling for him to get out, and I must\u2019ve spooked him just as badly as he spooked me because he leapt out my window and took off. I slammed it shut and moved a bookcase in front of it, and when I went out the next morning in the daylight found the screen sitting against the house. Didn\u2019t sleep the rest of the night, and I haven\u2019t slept with a window more than cracked ever since. I also absolutely refuse to live on the ground floor of a building. I don\u2019t know if he was planning to rob me or rape me or both, but it was absolutely terrifying and makes me wonder how many times it happened and I didn\u2019t wake up.",
            "I was home from university for the summer and didn't have a job so was home alone whilst everyone was at work. I live in a small village on a quiet street so was completely normal to have all the windows and doors open during the day. \nLate on in the afternoon I get a call from my Dad, \"I'm around the corner but struggling to get into the street. I'll explain when I'm home but lock all the doors, close the windows and go upstairs.\" This was obviously strange, we don't live in a bad area and my dad's sense of humour isn't that mean but the tone in his voice made me do it without hesitation. Everything closed and locked and upstairs I go.\nA few minutes later I get a second call from my Dad, \"some police are going to be going through the side gate into the back garden to check the shed. I'll be home soon.\" Again, I was terrified but knew to just ask later. Stayed upstairs but did see armed police checking the back garden.\nWhen my Dad finally got home I obviously asked what had happened. Turns out some 16 year old kid on our street had taken some legal highs, stabbed a neighbour then did a runner. Absolutely terrifying but a sad part is they found him at night time because he is scared of the dark and came out of hiding.",
            "When I was 19 in my first apartment I had someone knock at the door. I looked through the peep hole and saw this burley, heavy set man who abruptly started screaming to let him in. He was screaming things like he was going to beat my ass, and kick the door down if I didn\u2019t open. I called the cops and as soon as someone got on the phone he started body slamming my door to break in. \nI was freaking out and crying as they quickly had 5 cops show up within 5+ minutes. As soon as he heard the sirens he quickly walked away and they met him at the bottom of the stairs. \nApparently he was after the previous renter but was extremely intoxicated. They arrested him and thankfully he never came back. I ended up breaking my lease and moving out 3 months later. \n\nIt was in a very nice neighborhood but it quickly made me wish I was back home with family instead of being on the other side of the United States.",
            "This happened to me a couple of years ago. I have also lived on my own a long time so do not get sacred easily!\n\nI had just finished reading in bed and I turned my lamp off and settled down to go to sleep and hugged my cat up close to me.  This would be about 1:30 in the morning. I closed my eyes and I head a voice say \"Meow\" like imitating a cat!  My window was open so I though it was just someone being weird outside.\n\nI opened my eyes and in the middle of my bedroom was a small boy wearing a red jumper waving his arm above his head.  I leapt up like a god damn ninja and put the light on. and my heart was going mad.  Now, nothing paranormal has happened in this house, ever in the entire time I have lived here.  I spent the whole night totally freaked out, only getting a bit of sleep when it started to get light outside.\n\nMy friends thought this was hilarious when I told them.  I was saying there is no way I am living in a haunted house and started googling cleansing, excorsists and whatnot!  The next few nights other weird stuff started happening.  I started sleeping with the t.v on and as soon as I tried to get any sleep, I would hear freaky voices coming from it, or I would notice shadows dip by the side of my bed.  It was dreadful!  I actually resorted to saying out loud \" I'm really tired, so if you could not haunt me for one night I would be really grateful!\".  I had never really believed in any of this sort of stuff before, so it was like an entire paradigm shift for me.  Anyway, I was going on about this to my friends at work, and one of them asked if I was  on drugs.  Well, funnily enough I had just started taking this new tablet Montelukast for my asthma.  When I got home, read the side effects, a rare one being hallucinations!  Stopped taking them, no more hauntings!\n\nTl;dr Drugs made me see ghosts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:  Thanks everyone for all your replies, I woke up to so many notifications on my phone!  I did some research myself after I realised what was happening and I found out that it was prescribed mainly to children and to those who struggle with taking an inhaler, here in the UK at least.  My asthma was going through a bad patch so they tried a few different meds on me.  I remember thinking,  if you were a little kid and started seeing stuff like that every night and had no idea that it was the tablets causing it... The thought doesnt bear thinking about!  Also, nothing has ever happened in my house since then.  Everything is completely normal and I now can sleep with the lights off like a proper adult!",
            "I have been pretty fortunate based on these comments but I was home alone one night while my wife and son were visiting my MIL.  I walked back to our bedroom to see someone rummaging through my sons room on the video baby monitor.  Immediately grabbed my firearm and yelled to the otherside of the house \"I AM ARMED.  COME OUT SLOWLY!\" Over and over while slowly making my way back to his room.  Got there flipped on the light and ... nothing.  Searched the whole house pumped full of adrenaline.  Finally satisfied I was alone I went back to my room and THE GUY WAS BACK in the room.  I took a closer look and I am ashamed to say I was looking at myself.  The camera is a live feed on our wi fi and it was steaming on a huge delay.  I have never known it to do that and it has not done it since.\n\nTl;dr went looking for myself and came back empty handed.",
            "My bf worked away from home a lot and I always struggled to sleep on the first night he was away. On this occasion I was woken by the sound of a man shouting and then someone banging on wood or a front door. I jumped up and looked out my bedroom window..... just in time to see a man dressed all in black walking through our garden towards the house. I ran to the front of the house to look out of the front window and make sure he kept going. He did, but he met up with another man dressed in black walking towards my house. I was terrified and called the police, they arrived in a matter of minutes and checked out the back garden but they were gone. Turned out a neighbour had caught them both trying to steal his car and one had escaped through the gardens while the other had run through the roads and they had met up outside my house. I didn\u2019t sleep at all that night and my brother came to stay the next night. I\u2019m so glad I live in an apartment now, much more security.",

Some drunk woman literally launched a hammer through my kitchen window. Was so loud and glass was everywhere. I followed her down the street whilst calling the police. Pretty strange.\n\n(Edit for everyone asking why I followed) - So the reason I actually followed her was because you could see really clearly through the smashed window as it was now wide open. She looked like a very fragile little old crackhead lady that could barely walk or see straight and she started stumbling away mumbling some shit once she had done it. Plus I didn\u2019t really know how the fuck I was gunna explain this shit to my parents if I didn\u2019t have a solid answer haha. But yes, it was a very distressed walk whilst following her.

They told me they were Hell's Angels, and they were pissed because my bf was selling too much drugs, cutting into their profits. They kept calling me by my nextdoor neighbor's name. We had suspected they were selling drugs. All of the people stopping by for less than 5min made it pretty obvious. I just kept telling them I wasn't her. One of them searched the house, while the other kept me pinned to the couch. \n\nThey started to realize they were in the wrong house, because they couldn't find anything where they were told it was. My neighbor's house is a single floor, with a basement. My house is a 4 level, back split. Then I showed them my mail, because it showed my name, and they knew they fucked up.\n\nThey started telling me that they were after my neighbor's bf, because he raped their cousin.

In that split second, I could have sworn I had seen a man stood at the bottom of my bed. I laid still. Awake with my eyes closed. Trying not to act like I was awake and trying to listen for any sound in the room of someone breathing or moving. Couldn't hear anything. I was too scared to open my eyes and look, consoled myself that there wasn't any way someone could have gotten in without me hearing a window smash and fell back asleep. When I got up in the morning though the front door was open. They didn't take anything and left no signs of being there.

On that level, the windows look out to the backyard and as I got up to go to the kitchen, something caught my attention. What looks like a pale left arm is being subtly illuminated outside in the far right window - maybe 6 inches away from the window. It it angled straight down as if to steadying itself. My heart sunk. Then I could feel my heartbeat in my neck. \n\nI ran up the few stairs to the main floor and grabbed my phone and returned to see if it was still there. Nope. Nothing. I've never been remotely shaken like I was then. Called the non-emergency police and when they arrived, walked to the backyard with the officers but didn't find anything. They were great and kept saying calling them was the right thing to do, it's what were are hear for, etc. \n\nDon't know what it was, but the image is seared into my memory.",

After completing the task I just sat on the toilet trying to figure out how to tell everyone I know that I literally shit myself blind by sneezing while shitting. After about 2 minutes of complete darkness and dread and panic lightning struck outside and lit up my hallway. Best damn feeling ever\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone for the awards and comments.

            "A few years ago I was home alone in my basement playing video games when I hear the door that connects my kitchen to the garage creek open and slam shut, but I never heard the actual mechanical garage door open. Then I heard heavy footsteps of someone wearing boots walk the length of my kitchen directly above me. I originally thought, \"oh my brother must have forgotten something\" as he had left about 5 minutes before that for work so I was about to yell up to him to make fun of him but something in the back of my mind was telling me, \"hold on, somethings not right here\". So I muted my tv to both hear better and to stay quiet. Then I heard the footsteps turn around and walk back to the door, and again I hear it creak open and slam shut. But again I never heard the actual mechanical garage door open or close. So I slowly walk upstairs thinking maybe my brother just forgot to close the garage door, I slowly open the door to my garage and see that the garage door has been closed the entire time. \nThe only two explanations I can come up with are either something paranormal happened, or someone broke into my house, walked through my kitchen and left without taking anything, while also not letting me hear them open my garage door. \nIn my opinion, both are equally terrifying to me.",

            "One night I was watching The Conjuring at home with my little sister when we heard someone putting a key into our front door and opening it. We were sitting in the living room next to a sliding door that was very close to the front door so we both heard it very clearly. Now this didn't alarm us since we knew our dad had recently gone out to get some stuff, so we just assumed he had returned. \n\n\u201cDad, you\u2019re back already?\u201d I casually asked. \n\nThere was no response. \n\n\u201cDad?\u201d I asked again, thinking that he had not heard me the first time. \n\nAgain, silence. \n\nAt this point I get the feeling that something isn\u2019t quite right and I could tell by the look on my sister\u2019s face that she was quite nervous as well (I\u2019ll note that up to this point she had spent the evening rolling her eyes at horror movie clich\u00e9s and she very rarely gets scared). We looked at each other for a moment wondering what we should do before we started hearing a few more scattering sounds from right outside the sliding door. I was frozen in fear by this stage. \n\nI tried one more time in a louder, but shakier voice: \u201cDad...is that you?\u201d \n\n*'Please respond, please respond...'* repeated in my head. But the silence continued. \n\nNow at this point I\u2019m freaking out and I literally jumped off the couch. My sister also abruptly gets up and starts rapidly walking towards the other end of the room which leads to the kitchen area (she later revealed to me that she was planning on grabbing a knife). She had this horrified look on her face that I hadn\u2019t seen before. We looked at each other in nervous silence; I didn't really know what to do and I didn't want to make any further sounds. \n\nI finally decided to walk up to the sliding door and began opening it as slowly as possible, peering into the darkness (I know, I literally became the idiot who investigates the unknown, creepy noise without anything to protect myself with). When the door was finally open wide enough, I poked my head out and scanned the corridor, preparing for the worst. To my surprise, there was no one there. But what was more strange was that the front door was still completely shut (we never heard the door close). My sister and I were obviously both extremely relieved as we were almost certain that there was an intruder in the house.\n\nAfter this, I immediately went to go ask my mum (who was situated in her bedroom at the other end of our house) if it was her or whether she had noticed anything. She told me that she thought my dad had come home as well as she also heard someone opening the front door...\n\nAround half an hour later, which felt like an eternity at the time as we still quite shaken from the incident, my dad finally arrived home and confirmed that he had not come home earlier.

            "Growing up I lived out in the country with only a few houses near us and both my parents worked full time jobs in town. Because of this I spent a lot of my summer days at home by myself. When I was 14 years old I had just got out of the shower and was getting ready in the bathroom mirror when I heard someone in the living room. The majority of our house was hardwood and there was a very distinct sound when someone walked through the living room. I didn't think much of it because even though I was home alone my parents often drove home during lunch to eat. After the person walked around the living room for a couple minutes I finally called out \"Mom? Dad?\", but no response. Instead the walking just stopped. I had my cellphone in the bathroom so I called my mom and asked if she was home. She told me no and that my dad was not either. I told her someone was in the house and she told me to get out. luckily the bathroom I was using was only a few feet away from the front door so I opened the bathroom door and ran out the front door into the yard. Later my mom came and picked me up and my dad walked through the house but no one was there.  \n\n\nThis wouldn't have been too crazy if it wasn't for what happened in the following days. My neighbor's wife who lived across the street was taking a nap a couple days later. She woke up to a sound in her house. When she opened her eyes there was a man in her hallway. She called out to him and he ran out the front door. When she went outside her garage door was opened where he can manually forced it open to get inside. My neighbors wife's underwear drawer was open and the man had taken all of her panties while she was sleeping. So naturally I assume that the sound in my house the day before where this man as well.",

            "My dad dropped me off at home after bringing my sister to a party and I walked in to a CD blaring super loud on our big old fashioned speakers. The CD was super hot when I took it out so it had to have been playing for a long time, but I hadn\u2019t heard it going when we left. Turns out my sister had left the CD in and then while we were gone there was a tiny power outage that made the music start again. Kinda silly, but all that was going through my head was, \u201cMy favorite band is really gonna be the soundtrack to my death? Nice\u201d",

By the time I got to the window they were carrying him away.  It was really, really sad, and just hearing such a guttural scream of grief from someone in the middle of the night was terrifying in itself and still haunts me.  Poor family and dog :(.",

Our house is quite secluded, with a church and graveyard next door and closest neighbours up the street but quite a bit away. I had all the doors locked and was settling down to watch a movie when the doorbell starts to ring so I go to answer it, no one there. Then the back doorbell rings, no one there again. This keeps happening over and over and it is pitch black outside. Then whoever it was began banging on windows and yelling at this point I\u2019m freaking out so I begin to call the police and yell at the people outside that I\u2019ve called them when it turns out it was a couple of fellas from uni playing a prank on me. I was terrified and reduced to tears at this point but they thought it was hilarious. They did a few more things like that to me over the 2-3 years I was at uni with them, and I always thought they were my friends. I\u2019m older and wiser now to know that they were just cunts.",

            "My mum once shouted my name when I was home alone.\n\n\nShe was in another country, it was midnight, and I live in a 7-bedroomed house.",
            "When I was 9, I was staying home alone. It was early morning. I had just gotten out of the shower and brushed my teeth. I put on my favorite outfit, set up a little area in the living room with my drink and a snack and turned on the tv to watch. The phone rang. I went across the house to answer.\n\nThe voice on the other end was familiar and very comforting. He asked about my day so far and made small talk. After a minute or so he said \u201cI like your outfit. Is pink your favorite color?\u201d I replied \u201cOh, thank you. No, it isn\u2019t...\u201d \u201cWhat were you planning on watching on tv...\u201d\n\nIt took me a few seconds to understand what was happening, as I was only 9 and very naive. The voice on the other end of the phone changed. It became deep and raspy and horrific. The voice then proceeded to describe my rape and murder in graphic detail. I went numb, my skin felt as if it were on fire, my heart was racing. I had never been more terrified in my entire life.\n\nI slammed the phone down and called my mom at work. I tried to explain what had happened, and I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t making much sense. She got onto me for answering the phone and told me to go back about my day. I remember trying to explain that he was watching me, he told me what I had been doing, he told me what I was wearing. I mentioned that I was going to call 911 because I needed help. \u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019m not coming home. Just don\u2019t answer the phone and go watch tv.\u201d I hung up. \n\nI was confused. I was scared. I could feel eyes on me. I pulled the curtains closed, I raced around the house and was torn between doing what I felt was right and doing what I had been told by my mother. This whole time the phone was ringing. The second it would stop, it would start again. The sound of the phone ringing would pulse through my tiny body like electricity and practically paralyze me. I was frozen and on fire at the same time. I waited for a pause in ringing and called 911.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m home by myself and I\u2019m 9 and someone is watching me and he is going to kill me!!!\u201d She tried to keep me calm, she told me she would send help. I remember standing there, listening to this kind voice trying to help me, but I could feel every horror movie scenario playing out behind me. Was he creeping up behind me with a knife? Was he going to shoot me through a window? Was he going to throw a rock through the glass and open the door?\n\nI couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t feel my body but I was also overly aware of my skin. In a moment of panic I set off the alarm to the house and ran outside. \n\nI remember this sense of relief, but also this overwhelming feeling of having a separation in my reality. The house felt small and dark and dangerous and cold. Outside felt open, safe and warm. I could hear lawnmowers, birds chirping. It was a beautiful break from the bone chilling feeling of the phone. It was like I was watching a movie and I could see myself experiencing both of these environments at the same time. A neighbor was pushing his child in a swing. He was concerned. He let me stand next to him and he protected me.\n\nI could hear the sirens. The blaring sound getting louder as they grew closer. It felt like it took an eternity, but the police arrived. He walked over to me and asked me what happened. I did my best to explain, but so many of the words the voice on the phone used were embarrassing. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say such adult words to a police officer. His other words were bone chilling. I couldn\u2019t say those either. I can still hear my young voice repeating \u201cHe was watching me. He said he\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d\n\nNot long after, my moms car pulled into the driveway. She, for some reason, decided to come home. She didn\u2019t look for me or come speak to me. She calmly got out and walked over the a police officer. I was standing in the doorway from the house to the garage, facing the driveway... I could see my mom, the police officer... I was watching, trying to understand, trying to figure out what was happening... And then I saw it. Her laughter. She was laughing. My face was swollen from tears. My heart was still racing. My skin was on fire. And my mom was laughing? I slowly crept closer and overheard \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this. She just got scared being home alone and overreacted.\u201d\n\nWhat is happening? What did I do wrong? Did I imagine this? Was this a dream? Should I not have called 911? Did I overreact?\n\nMy memory of what happened after that is hazy. I remember refusing to stay home alone, the sound of the phone ringing rippling through my body. It wasn\u2019t something I liked discussing. I refused to repeat what had been said to me by the voice on the phone. My mom decided she knew who did it. She didn\u2019t even know the details. There was no investigation. No one was questioned. She told me it was a boy my age who lived across the street. I knew it was impossible. And no matter how much I protested, I was always told it was him. \n\nMany years later, after I was an adult with children, we were at Christmas. Everyone was in the living room and I had gone into a back bedroom to change a diaper. As I was walking out of the room and back into the living room. I could hear my mom laughing, her voice as if she had been telling a joke. The faces of everyone in the room told a different story. Discomfort. Anguish. Shock. Fear. Yet, she was still laughing. It felt as if I was walking in slow motion.\n\nOne of my older children stopped me from entering the living room and sort of pushed me back into the room I had just come out of. \u201cShe just told the story of you being home alone and the man threatening to kill you... She told it like it was a joke. Like a funny story from your childhood.\u201d\n\nI never learned who it had really been. I deal with my fear of ringing phones and phone conversations on a daily basis.\n\nTL;DR While staying home alone as a child someone was watching me and threatening to rape and kill me. My mom, to this day, thinks it\u2019s a funny story to tell.",
            "My ex boyfriend showed up in front of my apartment and texted me he was there because he wanted to talk. I told him I wasn't home(thankfully it was during the day so I had no lights on) and he called me a liar. He stayed outside for nearly an hour until he gave up and drove off. I stayed in my bathroom the entire time while on the phone with my best friend. Looking back I should have called the cops but I was a scared 17 year old.",

She was covered in blood and told me her husband was trapped in the truck he flipped. She kept trying to get me to help her pull him out of the truck and I said \"Lady, I know this is an emergency but I ain't no EMT\" The worst part was I live in the woods with know cell service, but luckily I was able to get to my landlords attention so he could call 911 from the landline.

            "I woke up to someone pounding on my door at 3 a.m. My boyfriend worked overnight at the time, so he was gone. I reached for my phone and it wasnt where I left it, so obviously my first thought was that someone was in my apartment and took my phone \"The Strangers\" style. I quickly snapped out of it, as the person continued constantly pounding on the door, and realized that my phone just fell off my bed. I grabbed it and called the police to let them know about the disturbance and that I was afraid to open the door and they sent someone out. I stupidly didn't even get out of bed to go look through the peep hole because I was too freaked. I then called my boyfriend and was informed that he accidentally ordered food to our house instead of his work. \ud83e\udd26",

            "Hey, an opportunity to drop one of my weird stories.\n\nWhen I was in college at Georgia Tech I stayed at a building known as the GLC. It was on the far north side of campus away from most of the colleges so not too many people stayed at it. I liked it because it was quiet and very easy to rebook my same room due to the lack of demand. When I say it was quiet, I mean we barely ever heard our neighbors, if we even had them. Really, only ever hearing other people when they slammed the heavy outer doors. \n\nThis event happened during Thanksgiving break. I always stayed on campus during Thanksgiving, to get work done and chill in peace. My three roommates were gone however, so the quiet GLC was even more silent. I was cleaning my room at the time and I had gotten out a bottle of Febreeze. Now this is important because one of my roommates HATED Febreeze and would complain even if I sprayed it in my room because the AC would spread it around the apt; so I took the opportunity to spray some and get the college boy musk gone. As soon as I sprayed it I heard one of my roommate's doors fly open and slam closed and angry heavy foot steps stop into and around the living room. I thought I had fucked up and reall pissed off my roommate, but I did find it odd how quickly and aggressively he was reacting to it. I come into the living room to apologize. I even was saying something along the lines of \u201cSorry man, I didn\u2019t know you were here\u201d, but as soon as I came into the room the sound stopped and no one was there. I was so convinced I had heard someone that I even knocked on my roommates doors but they were gone. I texted them and confirmed that they were gone, and I was all alone. I never heard the footsteps again (or honestly footsteps that loud) and still don\u2019t have an explanation.",

He had stayed with us a few months ago, but my grandpa kicked him out after discovering that Marvin was shitting on the floor even though the toilet was right next to his room. \n\nAfter Marvin left, he had tried to break in, but Grandpa had stuck wood in the window so it couldn't open. Grandpa also knew that his brother was too scared to break a window, even if he was drunk. \n\nMarvin started calling for someone to answer the door. \n\nMe, being scared that he would somehow get in and potentially kill me, started crying and turned the tv off. I grabbed my phone and dragged my crying ass to the backdoor where I softly called for my dogs, who were in the backyard.

My dogs licked me to try and calm me down. \n\nEventually, the banging stopped and Grandma called me and said that Paul had chased Marvin away. \n\nGrandma and Grandpa came home ten minutes later and I felt better. \n\nI'm 18 now and I haven't heard one word about Marvin.

The cops thought it was funny but made me call my parents to verify that they knew the friend. I wouldn't stop apologizing but he was a good sport about it and said he's glad that I did that cause he knew I knew what to do in an emergency.",

            "This will get buried but oh well. Around 2011 I was living in Nova Scotia on my own, sort of just took off after high school to have an adventure. Anyways, I had this wood frame bed that was awesome to sleep on. Always slept like a rock on that thing. Well one night I wake up, it\u2019s the middle of the night, and I feel a sort of pressure sitting on my chest like a cat or a book or something (I didn\u2019t own a cat). In my sleepy slumber I couldn\u2019t have cared less what was on me, I just wanted it off. So I grab it and try to throw it aside on the ground, but It immediately comes back and hits me right in the chest. Well, I fucking. Freaked. My initial freak out was so intense, that I basically levitated off my bed only to come crashing back down and break two of the wooden frames that supported the mattress.\n\nSo I\u2019m freaking, constantly grabbing this thing and throwing it aside and it just KEEPS COMING BACK AND HITTING ME!! After a very very long 10 seconds, I realize that what I\u2019m throwing is my own fucking arm. I must have been sleeping on it or it was elevated too high, but my entire arm was frozen and asleep. I couldn\u2019t move it or feel it at all. I often think how funny that must have looked to an outsider, seeing some idiot waking up and throwing his own arm around while throwing a total tantrum and freaking the fuck out, only to come to the slow realization that what he\u2019s trying to frantically detach from his body is one of his own limbs.\n\nIn any case, it was horrifying at the time.",

Suddenly I heard high pitch screaming, and I thought for sure someone had just been murdered outside. I called 911 and my parents from a closet, unsure of how id defend my siblings if there really was a murderer outside.  everyone came to check it out. It was a bunch of coyotes in the field by my house.",

I thought I was going to die only 60 seconds before... That's about the closest I've ever come to believing in a devil.",

He's an alcoholic, long story short, i didn't know what to do, so i let him in, he was carrying two massive bags, both filled with vomited on, digustingly unwashed clothes.\nHave you ever gone a few days without showering and thought to yourself \"i'm disgusting.\" Yeah, my dad made it look worse. Hardened vomit all down his shirts, a terrible smell, his socks were beyond crusty, with pieces of skin that had fallen off into his socks. He absolutely stank. We talked for a while, i offered him something to eat since for all i knew, he was homeless, we hugged it out for a bit, i can remember how his beard felt against my face, prickly, sharp, ungroomed. Absolutely horrible. He even cried as we hugged. Pathetic. He came looking for sympathy, when i had just gotten over my daddy issues. Anyways, we still talked, and he said to me, \"Nneb, i'm going to call your mum, if i can't stay here, i will die.\" \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. \n\nHe said that to my face, a 15 year old at the time, i can remember just feeling my heart stop. I gave him some privacy to talk to my mum, went upstairs, and just started sobbing. My sister called, she said she was on her way home. He called me down, i went downstairs, he was using mouthwash, hopefully to get rid of the stench of beer. He then decided to try to teach me how to fight, how strange. A 15 year old fighting a alcoholic father. Once he had taught me how to kick someones kneecap in, and how to cause brain damage, he went outside to smoke. My sister came home, hugged me, and took me to her house, while my mum and dad talked things out. I'm 16 now, and it still haunts me sometimes, i still blame myself for what had happened with him, wondering if i could have done something different. \n\nJohn, you pathetic piece of manipulating shit. I hate you for what you did to me and Mum. Fuck you.",

            "My parents were on vacation, so I was home alone for a weekend, when I was 15. I was watching TV late at night and saw movement in the corner of my eye through the window. I looked outside and saw what I think was a bear standing on its hind legs, looking startled at me. The thing is, a bear on its hind legs still looks like, you know, a bear. This was more of a human with the head of a bear and bear fur. I was kinda frozen in fear so I just stood there, but also because I was trying to discern what I was actually looking at. This stand-off lasted 8 seconds until it causally strolled (still on it's hind legs) to the neighbour's backyard. I was so terrified I went upstairs and blocked the stairwell with an armchair while I called my parents. They didn't believe me at first, but because my parents can see when I'm bullshitting and when I'm not, they thought it might've been an escaped bear (I live in the Netherlands, wild bears don't live here). They came home early (it was a sleepless night) and they made the police come over. I filed the police report, and I kept stressing it wasn't just a normal bear, but they didn't really heed much thought to that. They told they'd get back to us when they found something, but we never heard back. It took about 2 months for me to sleep well again, without medication. everyone, including my parents, tell me I saw an escaped bear. I don't know what it was, it might've been some crazy motherfucker in a bear suit. Anyways, it still terrifies me to this day. I haven't heard of any similar situations either.\n\nEdit: typo's, and also:\nI'm mostly baffled by the fact there are no other sightings. The Netherlands is extremely densely populated, and basically every living creature here is documented. There is no way an animal of that size to hide somewhere here. I've also never heard of anything similar, which is strange, because the few wolves we have for example are sighted constantly. So I doubt it was a Sasquatch.\n\nAdditionally, I'm more confident that it was some kind of skinny bear, because it was really big, I think like 2 heads taller than me (I think I was about 182cm at the time). In the time I stared I could also see bear claws rather than hands. \nOn the other hand, it had long legs like a human and it's front legs (or arms) went up until it's hips, unlike [this image](https://www.google.com/search?q=black+bear+on+hind+legs&client=ms-android-samsung-ga-rev1&source=android-browser&prmd=ivn&sxsrf=ALeKk010SC-sLEXKOrbS8HjtoXOom4RJvQ:1594907689709&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5pa2S9tHqAhUI3KQKHYtsC7AQ_AUoAXoECAsQAQ&biw=360&bih=620#imgrc=tMypgvjsDt7qfM), which is a black bear.",

Then with the confidence of a person doing them a favour you turn on your heel and stride away. \n\nThis has the effect of making them think you are the one wanting to avoid wasting their time. If they figure it out they can't call you out on it because to do so would be to admit (at least to themselves) that they are wasting **your** time. In fact most people never allow themselves to think it might be them who is holding you up so they accept the \"offer\" of your leaving in order for them to get on with their important work. \n\nIn general if someone says \"I'll let you go\" to me (rare but it has happened), I smile and say bye and end the conversation. It is a social convention and I abide by it. They want out. No ego. Let them go and the best of luck to them. People appreciate that I imagine.",

When traffic started moving again after a few hours I could barely stay awake. I remember the first time I showered after the fire. There was soot running down the drain and I just cried. Since then I started telling people I loved them, I decided to live for myself, I came out, I worked towards a future. I even sat at my first bonfire this year. It was horrible.",

            "Funny (for lack of a better word) story:\n\nWhen I was 10, my family went to Florida on vacation with some other extended family. There was a plan where my parents went back home (MA) a few days before my brother and I so we could stay longer with my aunt and cousins. \n\nIt was my first time traveling with just my older brother and my second time on a plane, the first being the trip there. \n\nComing into Logan airport, our airplane started to fall out of the sky. Quite literally. Apparently it only happened for about 3 to 5 seconds, but the pressure made the oxygen masks fall from the ceiling. I\u2019d seen enough movies at that point to know that basically meant we were going to die. \n\nI was for sure crying and freaking out like everyone else on the aircraft, for sure the most frightening experience experience of my life, bar none...

My vision started fading and I couldn\u2019t hear and the only thing I could think about was that I was going to ruin my parent\u2019s sibling\u2019s, friend\u2019s, and girlfriend\u2019s lives by dying so young and sudden. I didn\u2019t want to cause that kind of emotional pain to my loved ones. I thought I wasn\u2019t going to be able to say goodbye. \n\nI was so dehydrated that my organs were starting to shut down. Had I waited another day to go to the ER I would have died from total organ failure. My body was making so many white blood cells that my counts were higher than some of the nurses and doctors had ever seen in their professional career. \n\nI was administered three separate \u201csacks\u201d you could call it? Of fluids. They were keeping me alive at the time. They gave me a HUGE amount of prednisone. (Over 200mg doses) I was high as a kite for a week. I don\u2019t remember much from that week but somehow I got home with my parents, lived on smoothies and slept A LOT. I even managed to play apex and win matches and I don\u2019t even remember doing it. They forced me to drink 2-3 liters of water a day. I discharged A LOT of phlegm. The week passed and the prednisone wiped out my flu and helped my body fight off my mono symptoms. \n\nBut steroids can make bacterial infections like strep, ear infections, and pink eye feel worse. I couldn\u2019t speak for 2 weeks. After the steroids I was put on an extremely powerful antibiotic and had to stay home for another 3-4 days because it completely wiped out the good bacteria in my body. \n\nAfter 3 weeks from visiting the ER, I went back to college. 5 weeks later I finished the semester with a 3.4.

I remember her introducing herself politely because I had just made a big sale and my \"friend\" got his cut and was going to share it with lady friend. I remember thinking \"I'll join you!\" And cooked up a shot as well even though like 10 mins prior I'd had snorted some of my benzos. \n\nThe last thing I remember after that my \"friend\" and his gal friend laughing and offering me chocolate and me being like \"fuck yeah I love Hershey's with almonds\". Those were my last thoughts. \n\n*Fuck yeah, I love Hershey's with almonds*\n\n\"Friend\" and gal ended up ditching me in the back of my car when I became unresponsive but I happened to in a part of town where an actual friend noticed my car and found me, saved my life. I was basically dead, covered in chocolate, half naked in the back of my own car. I can only, to this day, hope the \"half naked\" part was just me being high as a kite in skimpy clothes and not adjusting them while rolling around in the bed that was my back seat....",
            "The closest to death I came was earlier this year, I had abnormal uterine bleeding that was so severe I couldn't keep unconscious, I fainted four times in less than 12 hours. Threw up while I was unconscious twice (luckily I was sitting up when I woke back up so I didn't choke).\n\nThe one time I felt like I was dreaming, but it wasn't a \"flashing before your eyes\" kind of dream, it was just like I was dreaming of a normal mundane event. I was so unconscious I hit REM mode I suppose. As  the day went on I eventually got to the point where I couldn't get up off the bathroom floor, I couldn't even sit up or I would have passed out again.\n\nAn ambulance was called and I was taken out on a stretcher, I only had a vague awareness of what was going on around me. I had a very strong urge to sleep but I knew that I shouldn't, but I just kept wanting to close my eyes...my best friend (who was there at the time) kept nudging me so that I didn't before the ambulance arrived. I was so out of it I no longer felt fear or much awareness, just that I felt like sleeping but it didn't feel like something good would happen if I did sleep.\n\nOnce I got to the ER I was told that my hemglobin count was 4.6  and was dropping,fast. One of the nurses told me point blank if I hadn't come in I would have most likely died. I had to be given multiple blood transfusions to be even stabilized. Uterine Fibroids are no joke.",
            "\"Just keep talking and maybe he won't shoot it.\"\n\nGun was pointed at my face. I kept talking, and he finally put it down.\n\nThat was 40 years ago, and I still remember the terror to this day.\n\nEdit: context... high school buddy picked me and a friend up to go to a party, on the drive over it turns out he's suicidal or homicidal (wasn't quite sure which) and had grabbed his dad's gun. He parked the car, pulled the gun out and pointed it at me, demanded to know why he should not kill all of us. I thought fast and started giving him reasons, and asking him questions. He had that gun on me for what seemed like an eternity, finally lowered it and said, \"OK\". Took us back to my place & dropped us off, drove away. I never did find out what happened but he never went back to school (I suspect he was hospitalized).",

            "It ended up being a false alarm!\n\nBut I was at a movie theater about 30 mins into  Magic Mike with my mom and god mother. First theater to the right of the movie house. Suddenly a young woman comes in shouting \u201cthey\u2019re shooting they\u2019re shooting\u201d! \n\nEveryone in my party hits the deck. We\u2019re closest in our row to the isle. Meaning if a shooter were to come in and walk up we\u2019re right there. \n\nIn that moment I actively thought what would be best for my family. Mainly my literal brother who was just into middle school. I subtly placed myself over my mom. Positioned myself in a way that wasn\u2019t obvious to her but if someone came in the theater I\u2019d easily be able to cover her. It was terrifying but I distracted myself from the fear by thinking logically about my loved ones. Even after when everyone got up and positioned themselves by the exit/behind the projection screen I wasn\u2019t even scared anymore. More focused on my goal if things went south which was to protect my mother.",

I remember being very glad I at least got to experience the beautiful sunrises and amazing sense of community we\u2019d had along the way, but sad since I had so much left I wanted to do in life.",
            "\"I'm so fat why are these people trying to force me to eat I don't NEED food to live food is obsolete all it does is make me more fat\"\n\nI had had bulimic anorexia for 5 years at that point and was too underweight to really walk, I would faint regularly and my cognitive skills were very poor, I later found a Christmas card I had made and the letters weren't even then right way round. I was in the hospital and all I did was sit in the warm shower because I \nwas so cold all the time. They told me I had a couple months to live, I refused to eat.\n\nnow four years later I'm pretty ok. it took a specialized hospital and three months of expensive care to save me, and while an eating disorder never really goes away completely from the mind, I'm much better now.

            "I'm a traveling ICU nurse who has worked in a Corona-unit since Feburary/March. I didn't get covid until August. I'll describe my disease course. Feel free to skip to the after effects if you aren't interested. For the record: I'm 28, I run 5 miles 4 days a week around (6-6:30 min pace) and weightlift 7 days a week. I'm also vegan (150-200g of protein a day, since people will ask). I consider myself in extremely good shape. I thought covid would just blow over me. Take that into account as you read.\n     Disease course - One day I woke up and just felt, \"off.\" I had a mild temp of 99.0 and so I kinda blew it off. The next day the second I woke up I knew. I went to the urgent care and was covid positive (they thought I may have strep as well but didn't bother testing me for it). Over the course of the next 16(ish) days I thought I was dying. Oxygen saturation got down to 90%, my activity tolerance was zero so that getting out of bed and walking to the toilet ~25ft~ had me on my hands and knees with my vision going red. My back and sides ached so bad that by day 3 I couldn't lay down and spent most of my days sitting, leaning over a desk on the tripod position. My fever was 102.9 and if I wasn't wearing multiple pieces of clothing I was shaking so bad my whole body hurt. I tried taking acetaminophen but then I sweat so bad I drenched my clothes, my bed, everything I touched it was impossible to stay dry, also resulting in full body shivering (I only attempted to take it twice, even then my temp only fell to 101\u00b0F). I also had \"sinus headaches\" which kept me from moving my head or eyes too quickly from side to side or attempting to prone myself as the blood would move towards my skull making it unbearably painful. I felt so bad and made no recovery for about 14 days that I often thought of taking my life instead of slowly dying and being a burden to those around me. I also had mild hallucinations. A lot of them recovlved around death and me dying. Lots of dark thoughts kept circling my mind. It was like a movie reel going a thousand images per minute that I couldnt shut off or slow down. Around day 15 I actually started to recover, slowly.\n     After effects - it's been about 2 months since I recovered now. I'm back to running and lifting just as I was before. I get short of breath every now and then but it's kinda random, never when I would expect, like when running. I would say I have 10% of my taste and smell back. I'm also back to working in the ICU. The biggest thing I'm trying to overcome still is the lethargy and malaise. On days I don't work I'm only awake for around 10-11 hours then I'm out. I HAVE to sleep 9-10 hours in order to even function. I've heard of people say \"covid fog\" or \"covid brain\" and it's extremely real. I have trouble focusing, I can't remember something I said earlier in the day. Trying to recall something a few days ago is impossible. I forget what I ate for breakfast at dinner. My memory is just gone. (It does NOT impede work, If it did I would not go back). Also, my sex drive is non existent either, which wasn't ever a issue before.\n\nMy memory, sex drive and lethargy has put a LOT of strain on all the relationships around me. People have been somewhat understanding but after 2-3 months of this they are obviously worn thin by it and some have commented \"I can't blame covid forever\" I really don't know what to do or how to convey to them how much it hurts me that I feel powerless to the after effects. I'm active, eat right and do everything I can to try and overcome/fully recover, but it's just not quick enough.\n\nIf anyone has questions or need to talk, please feel free to ask.\n\nEdit: added some symptoms I forgot. Ironic.",
            "I caught it from a patron who visited the bar I worked at in March. He was laughing about coming back to the UK from Italy, which had the worst rate of infection at the time.\n\nI was really ill and couldn\u2019t really breathe for a long time and ended up with pneumonia and cracked ribs from coughing. No doctors wanted to see me and I couldn\u2019t get a test because it was so early on, so I had to manage by myself from home. I was exhausted all the time and worried that I wouldn\u2019t wake up because I was too tired to breathe by myself. I recovered after about three weeks and managed okay from then until it came back again in July. \n\nIt was so much worse the second time. I have spoken to about 15 different doctors and they all say it\u2019s more likely to have been reactivation rather than catching it for a second time, but I ended up in hospital with oxygen saturation of 88%. I was unconscious in the ambulance and had to go to A&E but myself as my boyfriend wasn\u2019t allowed with me. It was incredibly scary. They let me go with some oxygen canisters and serious monitoring for the next four weeks. \n\nSince then I have stopped coughing but the fatigue is unreal and I am experiencing what I would call \u201cCovid brain\u201d . I still have scarring on my lungs, and I\u2019m not sure that I will ever be as well as I was before again. Occasionally my cough will come back but most of the time now it\u2019s the not being able to work or move all that much. Everything is exhausting. \n\nAll of this because someone decided they\u2019d rather have a pint of beer than save lives. I nearly died at the hospital. He doesn\u2019t know me or the effect he\u2019s had on my life, But I hope a tiny part of him feels guilty. I\u2019m desperately sad and angry.",
            "At the end of February my partner and I were sat in a hospital waiting room at a routine appointment. I was sat next to a woman who had the worst cough I've ever heard. We didn't think anything of it.\nAt the start of March, before any talk of lockdown or social distancing, I finished my second day in a new role at work and had a sore throat. I don't really remember the next week apart from being in bed as the Corona symptoms kicked in. I don't get ill usually. The cough was the worst I'd ever felt by a mile and the constant feeling of smoke in my lungs meant taking a full breath was impossible. The first half of the week was largely sleepless with fever dreams and shivering. My sense of taste and smell disappeared all of a sudden and everything tasted slightly bitter and nothing more. The second half of the week I could barely move from excruciating back pain and found it difficult to swallow from the sore throat. The cough slowly dissipated after a week but the damage to my lungs will take a while to heal. I can still feel it a month later if I cough/sneeze. It was the worst week of my life.\n\nFive days after I recovered the worst case scenario happened. My partner got a sore throat. This progressed into the same fever, shortness of breath and sleepless nights that I experienced apart from she had a constant sickness where no food or drink would stay down for more than a few seconds. Underlying conditions (autoimmune) meant this could easily get REALLY bad. After a few days we called 111 (UK non-emergency line) who asked us to monitor it. The next day the sickness and breathing seemed to get worse so we called again and an ambulance arrived 15 minutes later. Imagine putting your partner or a member of your family into the back of an ambulance to be taken into a locked down hospital where visitors aren't allowed. Not knowing if the last you'll see of them is when the paramedics close that ambulance door. Calling the ward they are on every day asking for an update from nurses that are so unbelievably busy, stressed and scared themselves that you feel bad for interrupting them. The Coronavirus test result came back positive.\n\nAfter 10 days of constant sickness, and with a nurse stationed outside her door as they thought she only had hours to live, the sickness died down and the smallest bit of liquid stayed down.\n\nWe waited a week to hear some good news. We got lucky. I picked her up to carry on recovering at home after the re-test for the virus came back negative. The stories she tells me from the Coronavirus ward in the hospital are terrifying.\nAn elderly couple being brought in together and getting rooms across the corridor so they could see each other. The man improved and was sent home without his wife who hadn't and asked for a minute to stand at her window \"in case she doesn't come back\".\nThe patient in their final hours that had a crying nurse holding their phone to their ear so they could whisper their final goodbyes to their loved ones.\nHearing people's last cries and gasps before the virus made them drown from fluid in their lungs.\nThe worry of the nurses who don't have correct PPE or are being told to use a mask for a week and then take it home to wash it. We have nothing but gratitude to all of the hospital workers who are risking their own lives to help us. They are heroes who are doing an impossible task in a dangerous, under-funded and under-staffed situation. We owe you everything.\n\nSix months later and we are both affected by fatigue. By 4pm we are both wiped out. My partner still has the smokey feeling in her chest at night which we are told is lung damage. It is currently thought that antibodies only last 3 months so we are susceptible again and are self-isolating at home permanently. I've not been to a out the house (apart from short dog walks) since the world changed. We haven't seen family or friends.\nWe have both had similar symptoms and been for two tests each - both negative.\n\nWhen the Coronavirus news started on the news my household became a constant stream of antibacterial wiping. Each surface, handle, tap, chair arm, bathroom and implement was wiped down at least a few times a day and we were washing our hands until the skin was red and raw. We were careful. Overly careful. It still got us.\nWhen I see people ignoring the two meter distancing when on their daily exercise or kids meeting up in parks I just want to shake them and shout \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING??\". You meeting your friend for a chat could kill them. Or their family. Or their other friends. Or they could pass it on to a person they get a little bit too close to in a non-essential shopping trip. How many people have I inadvertently infected in the five days before I had any symptoms? My family. Office colleagues. Hotel and shop staff. The friend that popped in as they were passing. When dropping the dog off for daycare. The postman who needed you to sign a parcel. Any one of them could have caught it and died on a ventilator in a hospital or alone in their own home.",
            "I got it at the end of July and had mild symptoms for three weeks, lost my sense of smell, no appetite, lost weight and could barely walk in the beginning of it. Im young and have no underlying health issues. As of now, I still get extremely fatigued (when I was nearing the end of my other symptoms, I couldn\u2019t stay awake at all) and my smell comes and goes also. I\u2019m just now getting a negative test back and it\u2019s almost October! So I was testing positive for two months even when I started to feel better. Some inspo for anyone frightened and having anxiety over this virus, both of my parents have compromised immune systems (cancer and lupus) and they overcame covid too. So there is hope for anyone who gets it but that isn\u2019t always the case. So please take it serious guys. It\u2019s isn\u2019t fun at all and it did not feel like the flu symptoms to me lol it wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d ever felt before.",

            "I had it quite badly back in March. I was unable to get out of bed for two weeks solid. I lost 16lbs in that time, could barely breathe in the second week (turns out I had an autoimmune response), was very feverish and exhausted all the time. I slept maybe 22 hours a day. I narrowly avoided a hospital admission (UK here).\n\nSince March it has taken a long time to get back to normal. It took about 4 months to get my fitness back, but for the first couple of months I struggled to climb the stairs without being breathless. I had strange aches and pains in my muscles. I also struggled with insomnia, nightmares and an urgent and frequent need to pee. Then at 12 weeks post-illness my hair started falling out badly (woman here not that it matters but it really bothered me). Thankfully it has stopped and has started growing back.\n\nMy mental health really suffered immediately afterwards, a doctor told me it was a mild trauma response. I found therapy and walking outside for an hour a day very, very helpful.\n\nNow 6 months on, I'm feeling like me again. I think I'm very lucky.\n\nEDIT: wow this blew up while I was sleeping, thank you all so much!\n\nEDIT 2: sorry I didn't explain age etc. I'm 36, healthy BMI (not sharing my exact weight), no risk factors or co-morbidities, active and in my view healthy. Up to this I hadn't had so much as a cold for three years.",

            "I tested positive for COVID earlier this month.\n\nI almost never leave my house, and when I do I wear a face mask. \n\nIt started as any other flu. On the third day I lost my sense of smell. Completely. I couldn't even smell vinegar, nor have a physical reaction towards such a strong smell. I decided to take the test and it ended up being positive.\n\nSince I live with my parents and my brother I was super worried I might have spread the virus to them. Luckily, no one presented symptoms even though, before the test was positive, we were together for extended periods without using facemasks.\n\nFor about 10 days I felt as if I had gone to out to a very heavy night of drinking and dancing until 6am, and as if somebody had beaten the shit out of me. I felt hungover, extremely tired, and everything hurt, specially my muscles and joints.\n\nLuckily I never had fever, or respiratory problems.\n\nNow, I feel pretty much as if I never got it. My smell is returning slowly but surely and that makes me very happy since food is probably my favourite thing ever.",
            "Covid changed the trajectory of my life. I feel so lost. My family lives in Florida, where the infection rate is incredibly high. I came down from NY to help my parents by doing the grocery shopping, etc... so they wouldn't need to leave home. It spread through my family like wildfire. \n\nFirst, my 28yr sister got it and ended up in the hospital for over a week on oxygen. She is now fully recovered. (She works with the public, and though she wore a mask, Florida *never* mandated wearing masks in most businesses). \n\nThen, my sister-in-law got it. She then gave it to my 2yr old niece (she tested positive but never showed symptoms), 7yr niece, and my brother. My sister-in-law was hospitalized for about a week, and 3 months later, continues to have lung capacity issues and a persistent cough. My brother and nieces recovered without hospitalization. \n\nI caught it, possibly from caring for my nieces while my brother and sister-in-law were in the hospital (although I was as careful as possible... but keeping a face shield/mask on a two year old is impossible). I was incredibly ill for about a month. It was difficult to get out of bed, and there were days when the exertion from getting out of bed left me breathless for 30min. I couldn't talk without losing my breath, my whole body ached. It felt like I had been hit by a car. I wasn't able to resume any kind of normal functioning for a month. Today my lung capacity isn't quite where it was before, but it has continued to increase over time. \n\nMy aunt caught it. She died in the hospital 3 weeks ago. \n\nMy mom caught it. From the home health-care nurse we hired to decrease her exposure, who decided to go to the beach with her family for a weekend, even though she promised us that she would stay in quarantine. My mom fought for weeks, struggling for every breath. She's on a ventilator now, on 100% oxygen. Her doctors met with us via a phone conference last week to inform us that we should start preparing for her death. We've decided to let her go in three days. She's 68 years old. I haven't been able to hug her in 6 months. I haven't heard her voice in a month. She's going to die alone in a hospital, without ever regaining consciousness, as her children grieve alone, in separate housing, just a few miles away.\n\nThe sheriff in our county banned all masks in the police departments and banned all officers from wearing them. Our schools don't follow basic safety measures, most local businesses don't wear masks (even when preparing food) and don't require masks. \n\nMy family continuously wore masks to protect our community, but we weren't shown the same human decency.\n\nI'm 24. My mom won't help me put on my wedding dress. She won't call me on my birthday. She'll never know her future grandchildren. I'll never be able to call her again for recipes, advice, or when I need comfort. I feel so lost. \n\nI told my boyfriend last night that I can't bear the thought of celebrating Thanksgiving or Christmas this year. We're planning on going to the family cabin for the next several months to grieve and hold each other. It feels like my mother was murdered... by grown-ass adults who couldn't be bothered to wear a fucking mask.",

            "I had corona for 4 weeks... constantly coughing so hard I would throw up and sometimes cough up blood. No doctors would see me and just sent in prescriptions for me over the phone, that my husband went and picked up for me. We have a spare room in hour house where I stayed alone for 4 weeks as to not get my son or husband sick. I had a tv, and a bathroom to myself. My o2 saturation got down to 83% at one point so I went to the hospital. They gave me another test even though I already knew I had it, and told me 83% isn\u2019t bad, just don\u2019t lay down flat cause you could pass out and not get enough oxygen leading to organ and brain damage. They sent me home with no prescriptions, just they advice to sleep sitting up.\n\nSo I slept sitting up from there on out. Afraid that if I laid down I would die. \n\nIn total my prescriptions and recommended medications were \n\nNebulizer \nAlbuterol solution\nAlbuterol inhailer told you use it every 3 hours\nI got a rx for cough medicine that was a steroid... I forget the name unfortunately.\nAnd my dr also recommended I use the cough syrup delsym.\n\nWith all of that advice and medications I still felt like I was dying. I couldn\u2019t breathe. My throat was so sore from coughing that I could hardly eat. I was terrified to sleep, fearing I wouldn\u2019t wake up.\n\nBut after the 4 weeks of isolation and sickness I felt better and came out of my room. \n\nNow it\u2019s been 5 months since then.

            "My wife passed away due to complications of the coronavirus. She fought for a month. 1 week at home because hospitals would not take in a pregnant woman with mild symptoms and no swab test results confirming that she had Covid.  Then 3 very difficult weeks in the hospital. \n\nShe was 8 months pregnant at that time, having low-grade fever and no other signs of the infection. When she was finally admitted to a hospital, her oxygen saturation was already dropping and her x-ray results showed pneumonia. She was intubated and had an emergency c-section to deliver the baby while she still had the strength to undergo an operation. She suffered so much and fought so much. On separate occasions, bought her lungs collapsed. She had post-partum depression and ICU psychosis. She was in constant pain from all the medicine, medical equipment attached to her body and all the procedures done to her. And yet, there was never a time that she flinched and gave up. She wanted to live, for me, her baby boy and girl. \n\nExcept her, not one of us got infected. I was admitted to the hospital for a time, and our firstborn and newborn baby were also put in isolation - all of us tested negative.\n\nSeven weeks from her death, not much has changed. I still cry every day. Everything I see reminds me of her and it hurts knowing that there were so many things I could have done better.

There was no warning it happened in seconds. I called my manager and explained to him what was happening. I self isolated in an empty exam room and waited for the infectious disease team to take me to the ER. My husband was notified but wasn\u2019t able to be with because of the contraction rate. Once arriving to the ER I was unable to be with the public so I was taken into a \u201cCOVID-19 tent\u201d where I waited and waited and waited. After 7 hours of testing and pre-caution training from the health department I was able to go home. It was the longest 16 days of my life. The pain and the constant feeling of suffocation was the worst. I couldn\u2019t even walk to the bathroom without being out of breath and my legs hurting like I was hit by a truck.

I couldnt taste or smell some foods and it sucked. I got coughing fits and my mom decided that we should wear masks in the house so we did. Everyone took time off from work. As my brother and I were quarenteened in our rooms we only got worse. I was having shorter breaths and worse coughing fits. then mom got sick which led to my sisters getting sick. Mom, my brother, and I got it the worst. We were soon hospitalized after we could only breath one second breaths. By the second week in the hospital I lost a lot of muscle.

They tested negative after a few weeks but my mom, brother, and I were still in the hospital. I then went on oxygen and it was easier to breath. My nurse had me do some breathing exercises on the days I was feeling good. As a month went on we broke the first barrier. They sat me up and I tried walking for the first time in forever. It was hard. Like really hard and after just standing up I had to stop. Another week went by and I could take a few steps with help. We were getting better by the day and I knew that I'd get out of the hospital.\n\nAfter two months I was the first to go back. I still stayed in bed but I could sit up on my own. I tested negative. I was so happy. I did it! I beat covid.\n\nSide effects after: A lot of things have changed. I can't run very far and I have trouble walking long distances. I can't get enough air to my lungs and it feels like there is a weird pain right in the middle of my lower chest area. I'm not on oxygen anymore and neither is my mom and brother.

            "I had Covid in early July after visiting a friend out of state. My symptoms got to be pretty bad, ran up to a 102 fever, night chills, sore throat and just general fatigue were the worst of it. I was down and out for about 5 days with the middle 3 being pretty rough, then a l had a lingering sore throat for about a week after. (far from the worst I've heard of, but not the best experience either).\n\nSo onto the question, I would say my daily life now is back to completely normal and has been for about 1.5 months. however between the end of my symptoms and total recovery there was general drop in my physical abilities. I'm an avid weight lifter and have pretty decent cardiovascular abilities... welp those both took a nose dive, I could barely run a mile and my lifts dropped to about 75% of what they were. \n\nLooking at it now it just seems like one big set back, luckily I work from home so that side of my life was not greatly effected.",

So it's been a huge difference. I'm only 30 and sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get my life back. The more you go to the Dr, the more your realize there aren't any answers and in most cases I know more about lingering covid then most I've seen. For months I had to fight with drs to even acknowledge that something was going on, they love to say it's \"stress and anxiety\" and all in your head. So it's shitty but you just have to pick yourself up on the bad days, and try to enjoy the good ones you have. Take the best care of yourself you can. You never know what tomorrow might bring.\n\nMARCH Presumed positive back in March. While I was sick severe GI issues, horrible headaches nothing would ease, lung pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness, extreme fatigue, feeling of malaise. Never got a fever, only coughed a tiny bit. After about 2 1/2 weeks most of it subsided and I was just left the fatigue, brain fog and weakness from april-june\n\nJULY I had a relapse (or reinfection? Both are possible) I got sick again for about two weeks, same symptoms as before however this time I had weird pain in my extremities, like something was wrong with my blood vessels. I also developed a rash all over my stomach. I slowly recovered but the headache this time did not totally go away. Id get 2-3 every week, plus still having fatigue and brain fog. \n\nAUGUST I tried working out at the begining of the month to help get my strength back. This was a bad idea. I got a headache for 3 weeks straight and was having slightly high blood pressure off and on, ended up in the ER twice in 2 days, they gave more morphine, didn't help, the second day they gave me oxygen and it did. I carry hikers oxygen with me now to keep the headaches In check, so far it's been working. The week after the ER I was covered in the rash even worse then before, had gi issues flair up, and severe fatigue (the fatigue and brain fog doesn't ever leave it just ebbs and flows) \n\nSEPTEMBER The first part of the month I thought I was making progress, more sorta functioning days then miserable ones, then all of a sudden one day I woke up and my heart was pounding, I felt faint and like I was going to puke, tryed to get my heart rate under control but ended up spending all day in the ER for them to tell me I had a bladder infection which I do not. My heart rate was/is 100-120ish. That was a couple days ago and have had issues since that day. Blood pressure issues on and off as well.\n\nCurrently waiting to see a neurologist next week, and waiting on a call from a cardiologist to set up an appointment.

I just recently got my taste and smell back ~a month ago.\n\nMy wife had it way worse.\n\nShe started off with bad flu symptoms. Horrible cough, extreme muscle aches she described as 'being hit by a truck', headaches, major fatigue. Just all really bad. I took her to the ER a couple days in, they tested her, gave her a lung x-ray and said \"everything looks OK, COVID or not you should be able to recover at home\" Great news!\n\nThe next day the hospital calls back notifying us of the positive result. They gave the quarantine speech and said just stay home etc.\n\n~5 days later she started feeling a lot better overall, but then suddenly started having shortness of breath. It was getting harder and harder for her to breathe over 24 hours so we went to the ER again. They took her in and I was no longer allowed to be with her.\n\nShe had developed COVID pneumonia and her oxygen levels kept trending lower. They would combat it with increased dosages of oxygen. 1 1/2 days later she was on the maximum amount of oxygen they could give her and her oxygen levels were still trending lower.\n\nThey decided she needed to go on a ventilator.\n\nThis was terrifying, especially since I couldn't be there for her. I could only call her via Facebook Video and it was hard to understand her through all the oxygen. The doctors told me theres a good chance she will survive, but made sure to let me know that she could very well die, or end up with damaged organs.\n\nShe was put to sleep and put on the ventilator. The Doctor asked if they could give her remdesivir. After much research into the study done, I agreed.\n\nShe was asleep and on the ventilator for 4 1/2 days.\n\nFinally I get a call that she is breathing on her own and is recovering. I was ecstatic to say the least.\n\nFast forward to today - she still has a cough that tends to act up at night. She has mostly recovered her energy, and has begun working out again. She definitely gets tired easier though. The longest lasting effect is probably the trauma caused from such an extreme battle, exacerbated by the fact that so many people still don't take it seriously. Now there are 3 confirmed cases of reinfection, along with flu season coming up, we are terrified and I'm now known to have mild anxiety attacks when stores like WalMart are too crowded or I feel people are getting too close to me.\n\nCOVIDs very real and very scary.",
            "I had got it back in June. i didn't have any of the normal symptoms though the biggest issue i had at first was a very upset stomach. like i didn't want to eat because of the way it made me feel. that kept getting worse then i started to notice that i was getting out of breath walking to the restroom like extremely out of breath. i have asthma and this was not anything like that. finally got tested came back positive and my insurance had people calling me to check on me daily while i was self isolating. as soon as i told the nurse that called i was getting out of breath walking to the restroom she told me to go to the emergency room. i was there for a couple days on oxygen but then they started me on  Remdesivir  and that seemed to really help my recovery. total time in the hospital was one week. \n\nsince recovery the lasting affects i have are like others have stated i get tired and winded a lot quicker now than i used to. i cant eat a lot of food at a time anymore, to clarify that with numbers to give you an idea before i could get a 20pc mcnuggets and be fine now i can only do 10pc or i feel sick. one of the biggest things that changed is i  can no longer eat really spicy foods. i used to always get the hottest level of wings or the hottest salsa's and chilis but i cant anymore they make me very sick now. \n\nIn all i feel like the case i had was a mid level case and not near as bad as some people get. its crazy how it affect different people in different ways. i may have stomach issues for who knows how long but i am happy that i am still alive.",
            "I had it for about two weeks and ended up getting pneumonia. Life after has been filled with anxiety, I get anxious if I see people without masks or in large groups . It was the worst experience in my life and I really do not want to catch it again. I also lost my smell for over a month so that in itself was a weird experience.",
            "I'm young, in my early 20s. Got it back in late March. I was sick as a dog for about 3 weeks. I ended up pulling a muscle in my back and chest from coughing, which has made it hard to take a fully deep breath since then (although it's begun to heal in the last month or so). I lost my job while sick because I couldn't keep up remote performance while sick and don't have the kind of job that has any sick days.\n\nWhen I got sick, I was legitimately in peak physical condition. Working out 5 times per week, muscular, healthy diet, healthy BMI, no underlying conditions like asthma. Since recovering, I've gained 20 lbs, mostly because I haven't been able to work out (partly due to quarantine, partly to difficulty breathing) and depression/self-blame from losing my job. \n\nThe difficulty breathing thing is also long-lasting - I feel like now I can breathe *in general* easily enough, but I can never get a full, deep breath, if that makes any sense. I yawn all the time because it helps me breathe more deeply, which is annoying and a side effect that I hope doesn't stick around. I struggle to do things that require heavy breathing like running, and I end up mouth-breathing when I get winded (although luckily masks have made this acceptable). I don't wish to complain, since other people have had it much worse: the difficulty breathing is not the worst thing in the world, but it does suck. \n\nTo all the young people who think \"If I get it, I'll be fine\" and go out and gather: fuck y'all. This virus fucked my whole season up and I'm still getting over the physical effects.",
            "SO and I both got it a few weeks ago. Our symptoms only lasted 2-3 weeks, but I still have some lung pain.",
            "May be the wrong place to ask but people who have had it that it wasn\u2019t an overwhelming sickness what were small symptoms that showed? I myself have had a discomforting chest pain, occasional cough, and a sore throat. However I don\u2019t feel sick at all like I mentioned it\u2019s just a bit of discomfort.",
            "I was sick from February to April. I have an autoimmune disease and I was misdiagnosed with a lower respiratory infection in March. I can't breathe deeply without chest pains. I can't walk up our stairs without gasping for breath. I can't slouch without chest pains. I get chest pains for no reason. I have absolutely no energy whatsoever. And I cut contact with most of my family, my husband's family, and we are having marriage issues because some people believe the virus is fake, some are not social distancing, some believe in Corona but don't believe I had it, and my husband thinks I am just using it as an excuse not to clean the house. I feel like it messed up every aspect of my life.",
            "I\u2019m from Ecuador and my experience with that f*ing thing was the one of the worst of my life not only for my case but also for my relatives \n\nAt principle we were skeptical because we didn\u2019t believe that we could get the virus above was in the first months of the pandemic so, we didn\u2019t go out from our home but after a week that we starting having the \u201clittle flu\u201d things became worse we tried million things to heal each one but we didn\u2019t see results and hospital were saturated by the other COVID cases. There were no tests for the covid in my country so we had to assume it \n\nWas hard to accept that just were infected by the virus we felt miserable 3 of my relatives passed away in a week we couldn\u2019t do anything so the bodies stayed at home in a room until the mortuary comes. March-27 April-1 April-5 and my dad almost was the next one, thank God things calm down though a month afterward",
            "Pulmonary embolisms - big ones, in both lungs. I was sick in March with what I thought was a bad cold, which never really got better. A lingering cough turned into shortness of breath that got progressively worse. In May, Urgent care said I had an upper respiratory and my Covid test came back negative (which makes sense since I was infected months earlier). A week later I could not go up my stairs without stopping and resting - like sitting down for 5 minutes resting.\n\nEnded up going to the ED to be told I had blood clots in both lungs, and was inpatient for a bit. Three weeks later, I was readmitted with a pulmonary infarction (I guess where part of your lung doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen, it\u2019s VERY painful). I had supplemental oxygen for a few months afterwards and am told that I have scarring in the lungs. \n\nI\u2019m not old, I wasn\u2019t aware of any underlying conditions but they\u2019ve done a lot of tests and think that I have an autoimmune issue (don\u2019t know what yet) that made me susceptible to developing clots. It\u2019s not a joke - 2 hospitalizations and dozens and dozens of doc visits have cost thousands and I will likely have reducing lung capacity permanently. \n\nI feel mostly good now - never lost taste/smell but I still struggle with any type of cardio.",
            "I have asthma and I use my rescue inhaler more frequently now and often feel tightness in my chest similar to having an asthma attack.",
            "2 out of my 3 coworkers at my radiology imaging clinic have both caught it, both in their 20s one M and one F.\n\nThe M is completely fine now back to work no lasting effects, it\u2019s been about a month.\n\nThe F has been negative for about a week now and still has very limited lung capacity, can\u2019t catch breath when walking down the hall or switching out coils (MRI).\n\nWe work in extremely close proximity, I was shocked nobody here contracted it here from one another.\n\n*the spread of covid and varying symptoms between the sick is very mysterious*",
            "It hit me like bricks. annoyingly low fever that lasted weeks. Literally. Got it at work (healthcare) in February. They fired me officially in July right after telling disability I quit (I did not) so I have not had income since then. (Currently appealing). \n\nI\u2019ve always been a go get em type and this wiped me out. For months. I\u2019m still not recovered and have seen more doctors in the last 7 months than I have in my entire middle aged life. \n\nI lost 30 lbs and can not stop losing. 172 in February 2020 down to 120 now. High risk for clots so bloodwork every 6 weeks. My thyroid is off. I am in pain all the time and can not sleep. I have a regular cardiologist and pulmonologist as well as a GI team. I have been in a COVID study since March. \n\nIt has taken many of my peers as well. 3 adults 35-48. Just dead in their beds and found by their spouses. \n\nI love that every one is home though. We have more time together. My neighbors walk all the time whereas before we rushed past each other. I missed my family and was at the point where I was considering a career change. Covid forced that change and I am ok with that. I will not go back to healthcare. It was lucrative but not healthy for my family. Now, I have options.",
            "It has honestly wrecked my life. I got it back in late February. I checked all of the boxes. Went through 3 tests and all were negative. Still, the  long term began. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to read the whole thing a quick TL;DR - Fatigue, bad headaches, chest pain, fast heart rate, vocal cord issues, and so much more. \n\nI went into the ER 4 times for chest pains and shortness of breath. Went through all of the blood tests and X-rays and they came back negative. They also checked for blood clots in the last visit because they started to see strokes. The d-dimer test was negative. \n\nBy their definition, I was perfectly healthy and immediately, they started with anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. With a touch of pericarditis. That was way off base but decided that is where they landed. \n\nAfter numerous doctor visits the chest pains were chalked up to costochondritis. I\u2019m stealing dealing with that today. Not as bad as I was but it flares up usually once a week for a bit. That was just the beginning. \n\nI developed some of the worst headaches you can imagine. Easily 8-10/10 on the pain scale. Nothing would work. My doctor alone was no help so I asked for a neurologist referral. Once I was able to see her, she determined that based on my symptoms I have paroxysmal hemicrania and I needed a period of indomethacin 50mg 3 times a day. Eventually I\u2019ve weaned off as of last week. We will see if they come back or not. \n\nShe also investigated tingling I had in my hands and feet. Turns out I also was dealing with neuropathy. That has since gone away for the most part. Maybe 5% of what it was. The twitching I\u2019ve had in my muscles is a wait and see for now. \n\nI\u2019ve also had issues with a paralyzed vocal cord as well that is currently in a wait and watch to see if it heals up at all on its own. I\u2019ve going through vocal therapy right now to deal with the hoarseness and discomfort by basically learning how to speak overall. The doctor I saw for my vocal cords says that the nerves can be affected by a viral infection. The also says that based on my neuropathy going away she is hoping that my nerves will regain their abilities and my vocal cord will heal itself or I\u2019ll need bulk injections. \n\nAs many others have mentioned, the fatigue is absolutely terrible. Some days you\u2019ll feel great. Other days you aren\u2019t getting out of bed to do anything other than to go pee and maybe eat. It has gotten a bit better but you still get hit pretty hard. \n\nMy heart rate has also increased quite a bit like others have said. I used to sit at a resting pace of 65-70. Now I\u2019m at 75-80. If I get up to go to the bathroom, I jump to 100. It sucks. \n\nThere is no timeline to get better. It is the worst experience of my life. I can\u2019t even begin to explain the depression that comes along with it. \n\nSo there\u2019s my experience so far. I don\u2019t know where it goes from here. It either gets better or it doesn\u2019t. If anything I\u2019d rather it stayed the same instead of getting worse. \n\nThanks for asking this question and others for reading my experience.",
            "It took about 2 months for my side effects to subside. I had heart palpitations, shortness of breath, head aches, and no smell.\n\nMy wife, mother in law, father in law, sister in law, brother in law, other brother in law, brother in law\u2019s girlfriend, and nephew all had it and had experienced some post covid issues.\n\nThe older people had it worse than others.\n\nOh I guess this counts too. My work decided that covid doesn\u2019t qualify for sick pay. I was told I would be paid for my time off. Then my work said I should have filed for unemployment. I was back at work and had been for four weeks. So that sucked.",
            "I had a slight cough two days before I got tested and the day after also had a runny nose. On the day I got tested, I lost my taste and sense of smell but my cough and runny nose went away. I had no other symptoms for the 14 day quarantine. It took about 3 weeks for my taste and smell to fully return but I have had no other lasting effects. For me at least, the worst symptom was boredom while quarantining.",
            "Picked it up in early September.\n\nI'm almost back to normal, but for a couple of weeks after I had fatigue and would get out of breath just doing normal every day things like walking the dog.  The only remaining symptom now is my smell hasn't fully returned, but it's getting a little better every day - some interesting goo still coming out of my nose.\n\nMy wife ended up contracting bronchitis right afterwards and so she's on an inhaler until her lungs fully heal.  She lost taste and smell but both are almost back to normal.",
            "Hi! I caught covid on the first week of June. I was having trouble breathing for a week and on the 8th day it got so bad that I could barely breath. I remember walking into the hospital, being told I have an pneumonia, and being admitted. After that I don't remember a thing, I woke up in a completely different hospital hallucinating out of my mind. Little did I know that I was on a ventilator for a month battling covid. My doctors had already decided that I was not going to make it but here I am. \n\nWhen I was finally taken out of ICU I realized that I barely had any function in my left hand and right leg. It was almost completely paralyzed. Any type of movement I made, my heart rate would shoot up to 140+bpm. I believe I got out of the hospital the first week of July. I was able to finally get in and out of bed by myself but it took a tremendous amount of energy to do it. Now in September, I have managed to become somewhat normal. I regained function in my leg but I am still having issues with my hand. My breathing hasn't normalized at all, I still struggling to breath on the daily bases, I constantly have a weird sensation on the right side of my head which I think is severe nerve damage. I also have PTSD, anxiety, and depression. I live in constant fear it's going to happen to me again.",

            "I was bed ridden for awhile,  I lost a LOT of muscle mass (which I was since able to put back on).  Coughing was really bad,   I broke two of my ribs on one side hacking away that was constantly irritated and had to heal after the fact.   Also huge dry mouth,  wound up getting a cavity and having weird spots on my tongue,  mouth tasted like death and food / water tasted bad too.  Between the rona and just normal dry mouth nastiness\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring corona was boring,  it was scary and it was miserable,  I couldn't do anything because I wasn't able to move too much,  I would fall down here and there too,  because of being feeble,  weak,  getting water,  cleaning up wasn't always too easy and there were times I made compromises or got stuck in weird spots.    Couldn't do much with a screen either because it hurt my eyes to look at one,  be it TV or phone or whatever.   Also horrible dreams but that was prob just stress.  My pets were scared of me because I made such scary noises,  they would try to be around and eventually get so distressed they went up to leave and try again later.  Spouse had to take care of me,  hospitals were horrible here,  and we decided against trying anything like that,  I was really screwed up.\n\nAlso huge dry mouth,  wound up getting a cavity and having weird spots on my tongue,  mouth tasted like death and food / water tasted bad too.  Between the rona and just normal dry mouth nastiness\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPost Rona,  I wasn't great but it was exciting to get back  to things.

            "For me it was just a stronger flu, i couldn't stop coughing for like a week but it was relatively fine",
            "I started having a 101.4 degree fever around 6pm on a Thursday. By 11pm it was over 103.1. By 2am it was over 104. It fluctuated from 102-103 for a few days. The body aches started around day 1 and got worse and worse. Over the course of 2 weeks I went thru about every symptom you could have. Went to the hospital after 5 days for trouble breathing but bc my oxygen levels were only at 88%, they sent me home. My doctor told me unfortunately there was nothing they could do about any symptoms I was going thru and to be careful taking tylenol. Also come back if my oxygen got to 85 (we had bought an oximeter). \n\nWorst 2.5 weeks of my life for sure. I couldn't sleep bc I felt like I was choking so I started having panic attacks while trying to sleep. Couldn't sit upright bc my neck and shoulders ached so badly. It was awful. \n\nAfter the symptoms go away, the only thing left was the fatigue, and let me tell you, that wasn't a joke. The fatigue was rough. My legs would be sore after walking around at work for 10-15 minutes. My neck and shoulders felt like I had sandbags draped over them. I felt winded constantly. I was always just so tired.\n\nIt's been about 9 weeks since I first had symptoms. The fatigue is still kinda here in my legs. It's gotten better and continues to, but its 100% still there. I've been lucky none of the trouble breathing stayed around. But that fatigue is like a scar at this point.",
            "Just to speak on the more emotional aspect of it, Corona has taken a lot from my family. I had an aunt and uncle get it, they were in the hospital for about a month. My aunt made a decent enough recovery, but my uncle had a harder time and was in ICU for most of that month. He ended up committing suicide after being moved to a rehab facility. I know it wasn\u2019t a directly related death as he was no longer positive, but I absolutely attribute his death to the virus. I\u2019ve read about suicide rates increasing because of quarantine and social distancing, but it never really occurred to me how the virus could affect your mind and emotional well being. Our family is broken, and I know that it will get easier over time, but it just sucks knowing the pandemic didn\u2019t have to be this bad.",
            "I was sick for more than 3 weeks, slept 14-15 hours a day, my lungs hurt as fuck and I was not able to do anything. I ate like every 48 hours and was dizzy all day. My smell and taste senses remained, but 2 weeks have passed and I still cough, and that hurts my lungs. I still get tired very easily. Still operating at ~60%. Funny thing is that I did not receive a free test with all these symptoms and it was very expensive here, in Hungary. The government lowered the price to 50% but still expensive. So I don't have any evidence of me having corona, but I'm 95% sure... The remaining 5 percent should be the test. Oh, and my sis went through exactly these, but faster. My mom luckily only had only dizziness, but for 4+ weeks.",

I couldn't say a whole sentence, I couldn't walk up the stairs without resting.

Started out very suddenly with GI symptoms, lots of diarrhea and vomiting, then hit a high fever that ended up staying with me for over a month. Then the lung pain and shortness of breath came, and I had to go to the hospital for a few days. I developed bilateral bacterial pneumonia as a secondary infection and lost my sense of taste and smell for a while. \n\nI tripped over my dog early on because my pulse ox was in the low 80s and tore a ligament in my ankle which still needs surgery (don't have any PTO left right now).

It wasn\u2019t until I had lunch that Very same day that knew something was wrong and that was because my taste buds and sense of smell were completely gone. I immediately told my job that I plan to get tested so I got that done in 24 hours and got my positive results back in less than 48 hours of testing.

The owners were a lovely couple that took care of their employees and would bend over backwards for their customers. They were very active in the community and highly respected. They had a few core employees and would hire on temp staff during the summer and holidays. The temps were mostly highschoolers and college kids that were home on break. They would bring back the same people as long as they could and the kids would try to stay as long as they could. The pay was well above market for those positions, we could shop the and get a 75% discount, after six months you got two weeks paid vacation, and the owners would close the store a couple days a year and host a party for all of the employees. It was the best job any highschooler in the area could get. I lived right next to the store and my parents were friends with the owners so I was given a job there. All my friends were jealous.\n\nAfter working there for a few years, the couple decided they wanted to retire to spend time with their daughter and her children in another state. Many tears were shed and they had a huge retirement party where they introduced their son to everyone and told us he was taking over. They gushed about his prestigious business education and background.\n\nAs soon as they were gone, the son decided he was going to remake the store in his image. He fired basically all the staff, most of whom that had been there for 10 to 15+ years. He then staffed the whole place with homeschool kids and junkies. He cut the discounts and vacations. He hired some old highschool friends to manage the place so he could take the profits to go party and get coked out.\n\nThe shop went from having the same staff for years to having to retrain an entirely new staff every other month.

            " For years I worked in a high stress, high turnover, low paying job doing caregiving for adults with developmental disabilities. These issues are typical in this field, and my company, like many, exploited salaried employees by expecting them to work 50-60 hours regularly and often more. I went months at a time working 70, 80, 90 hour weeks. I stayed through a lot of bullshit because I loved the folks I served. \n\nLast year, corporate required all managers to attend a mandatory training about Caregiver Fatigue. \n\nIt made it worse for me to have language to describe the fatigue and burnout I\u2019d been experiencing for years. \n\nWithin the meeting, corporate acknowledged that they didn\u2019t pay us enough and that many employees we supervised were literally homeless, food insecure, or on the verge of it. But, \u201cincreased pay is not on the table right now so let\u2019s talk about other things we can do.\u201d\n\nThey crowdsourced this exhausted group of salaried workers, who suggested things like starting a company food pantry, a company clothing drive, and compiling lists of shelters in the area. \n\nThat meeting was so blood-boilingly infuriating to sit through that I made the decision that day it was time to finally get out. I worked my last day for that employer this summer. \n\nI\u2019m still looking for a full time job, and I\u2019m trying to hold out for a company that values my work enough to pay me fairly. In an ideal world, this new company doesn\u2019t add insult to injury by mandating training about how to recognize tell-tale signs of being ready to snap. \n\nHopefully, when I\u2019ve had some time to recover, I\u2019ll be able to come up with some lasting ways to change things in the caregiving industry.

Goals were met.

I can understand the need for promotion to fill positions from vacancies, etc, I can understand the need to have a pay freeze (beats, layoffs right?), but doing the prior two right after each other and then saying, yeah, and no more casual Friday's just seemed really vindictive and malicious.  If anything, they should have softened the blow of the pay freeze by saying casual Friday is now everyday, and people would have left the meeting at least neutral if not slightly hopeful.",

We can't even read a fucking book at the desk AT THE LIBRARY!  It made me realize that she takes this shit way too seriously, and that has made me care even less.",

And he was a top tier coder could whip out solutions in hours that other developers would languish for weeks on.  I also found out that nearly every department used his tool and services to automate their processes.  \n\nAt some point halfway through my project, they fired him and got rid of his tool.  Almost immediately all the company metrics tanked, in most cases 30-50%.  After a few weeks the company was desperate and asked for him to come back.  He told them to fuck off as he interviewed for their biggest competitor and they offered him 2x his original salary there.  They ended up hiring another person who wasn't nearly as good to replace him, then another person and then another.  When I left and the department had around 10 people and they still hadn't gotten their metrics to back to before they let the original guy go.  And almost all their departments they were losing staff left and right as people were stressed out trying to do more work that was previously automated.",

            "do i have to pick one thing?\n\nwe got a new warehouse manager. for a while, it was *every day* that there'd be some new change that killed morale. people dread coming to work now, because who knows what it will be today. here's a list of grievances in no particular order:\n\n* he thinks we're amazon. he came from amazon, and wants to make us amazon. amazon is the worst place in the world to work. he doesn't seem to understand that we make things, not just ship things.\n* track all the things. manually, because fuck you. he wants to know how many units we're producing, by the hour, whether it counts as direct or indirect labor. he wants managers to plan for the day, a task which given the nature of our business may as well be planning on the weather. that means that i had to report my numbers twice -- once at the end of the day from my actual machine logs, once so my manager to could make her plan. with a ton of micromanaging in the middle about which orders i have or have not fulfilled. we could have proper warehouse tracking and automation software, but fuck it. synced excel spreadsheets, and people hand writing shit on paper.\n* more middle management. we had too much already, but now we have a ton of new useless people trying to justify their jobs by making us do busy work for them. training videos that don't apply to us, emailing people to do the jobs we were already doing, and endless meetings. you can never find our actual middle-management, the people you need to get tasks done, because they're always in meetings. or taking the day off because no one wants to work here anymore.\n* tracking labor and productivity? we started having to juggle staff around, for no particular reason, to make the numbers work on paper. they permanently took away two of my staff -- the two i was training to do be able to do my job. somehow they're still expected to fill my extremely technical position when i'm not there, without me being able to teach them anything. cool, right? the rest of the time they're floating around other departments, doing a task just long enough for someone to train them on it before floating somewhere else.\n* moved my department across the warehouse. my physical location can't move; it would cost a whole lot to move my machines. but now everyone i work with is on the other end of the warehouse for no particular reason.\n* lots of changes to attendance policies. one of them lasted exactly a day: you get 24 paid personal hours per year on top of regular PTO, and if you're late, you have to use them in one-hour blocks. so if you're 6 minutes late, go get a coffee or something. when you run out of personal time, you're fired. half the staff was still working for a temp agency, and didn't get paid personal time at all. meaning they'd be fired if they were late once. thankfully, everyone raised this issue to their managers, and we got it retracted the next day.\n* a general attitude of \"blame the employees.\" for instance, one of those middle management positions we have is a safety and facility inspector. but he's not ever here, so instead we have a committee of know-nothing people with other actual jobs who go around and write up reports and complain at you to fix things that aren't really your responsibility to fix. i've started kicking things back to middle-management maintenance person whenever they complain -- oh, we're waiting on the maintenance guy. get with him. he's not here now? hm. not my problem then. \n* all problem, no fix. like the above, we'll get directives about things not in our power to fix. for instance, \"all cart wheels must lock.\" great, not a single cart in the building has locking wheels. are you replacing them? or are you just going to yell at me that my cart wheels don't lock? do you expect me to go out to home depot and buy locking wheels and/or carts with locking wheels? have you allocated a budget for this? are you giving me the company card? no?\n* we already had morning meetings, but they instituted a \"chant\" requirement them. the new rumor is that we're going to be required to say the pledge of allegiance now.\n* the snowballing effect of old-timers quitting and being fired. all of the old leadership is disappearing, and people are being asked to jobs above their paygrade, and nobody in charge knows anything anymore. which leads to more people quitting.\n\nthe rumor is, my warehouse is closing in less than a year. there's a bunch of petty shit i didn't even mention here. i think they're trying to drive as many people out as they can, so they don't have to pay unemployment. suffice to say, i've been applying for jobs and going on interviews. one of the last ones i went on, they said they already had a half dozen applicants from my warehouse, and thought we were going under.",

            "When I was in 5th grade I fell out of a tree and bonked my head pretty well.  I woke up 3? days later in the hospital.  For me, the experience is easily summarized in three parts:\n\n1) When I fell, I blacked out before I hit the ground... or at least that is where memory fades.  And \"fades\" is really the best word.  It was as if my consciousness was drained away and then blackness and nothingness.  It was as if my body knew how badly it was going to hurt and so it shut down.\n\n2) I have very, very, very, vague memories while in the coma of hearing my Dad reading a book, or my Mom telling me that she knew I would pull through, or of a tube in my nose.  But these were always super fuzzy moments and I never was conscious during them, it was more like a half second of being aware of one particular thing--the way the tube felt being taped against my arm and wishing I could reach out and move it--and then back into the nothingness.  I think that I was somewhat aware of the fact that I was a little more aware each time that this happened but honestly I am not certain of even that much. \n\n3) Waking up was sudden.  So, so sudden.  I was in blackness.  Had a moment of awareness, like \"my neck hurts\" and then the pain was magnitudes higher.  No longer a distant perception but something that I was actively conscious of.  Waking up was the most painful moment of my life and I just started crying and then couldn't even cry it hurt so bad.  I think that had more to do with injuries sustained to my neck and head than the coma, but that is what it was like.  After an hour my body was used to the pain and I was totally normal, albeit very weak, hungry, and thirsty. \n\nI survived and am fine now without any lasting issues.",

Whacky dreams about fighting corrupt hospital officials, so my brain new where I was. \n\nThey didn't think I'd ever talk or walk again, but in the hospital bed I laughed at an episode of That 70s Show and inclined every day after.

I later on had a sort of fever dream, which ended up to be true, about my parents driving me to tge ER saying 'it's ok' over and over again. I couldn't move or talk, so it seemed more like a dream than something that was actually happening. I saw the lights of the ER parking lot which made me close my eyes and after that it was like taking a nap.

            "I was in a medically induced coma for 3 days during my cancer treatment. My identical twin brother died around a year prior (also to cancer) and the entire time I was in the coma, I was with him. We were in a large green field with lots of sun and my conversations with him felt real. \n\nOther than that, I didn\u2019t hear any of my family talking to me while I was asleep. It was just like I had gone to bed for 3 days, and I woke up feeling very tired. \n\nI do wonder whether my interactions with my twin brother were real, or if it was just the drugs I was given causing them",
            "10 days I don't remember anything about.  Not sure if it is a blessing or a curse.  Hit by a drunk driver.  My wife and I lived, our daughter didn't.   \n\nTo me that stuff on tv where the pt wakes up and everything goes back to normal is bullshit.  When I woke up I was in a conversation with another pt.  Air Force had sick bays, not individual rooms.  I can only compare it to a computer, I had been hung in an update and then, flicker, new screen.\n\nI had \"woken up\" several days earlier, but nothing stayed with me.  My wife says I was paranoid that they were \"putting acid in my I.V.\" because I was tripping.  I was hostile and aggressive.  I read the medical records, they kept me restrained for a couple of days after I hit an nurse.  I started acting normal so they moved me from ICU to the sick bay.\n\nThe blessing is forgetting 10 days of some pretty intense pain.  I was broken in a lot of places and bruised in all the rest.  Never knew you could bruise some of them.  That freaked me out.  \n\nThe curse was I wasn't there when my wife needed me most.  There is that tinge of guilt that she faced that grief alone for 10 days.  I know, couldn't be helped. not my fault, but live through it and tell me how it feels.",

            "There was a kid named Martin Pistorius who fell into a coma for 12 years but his mind \u201cwoke up\u201d 2 years into it, however he was unable to speak or move, and everyone believed he was a vegetable at best. This wasn\u2019t the case, his mind was fully there. \n\nFor over a decade he was mistreated in facilities that played Barney repeats every single day for years without him being able to look away, true mental torture. He was also physically and sexually abused on top of that. At one point he couldn\u2019t stop throwing up so the nurses tube fed him his own vomit. \n\nHis parents were unaware of all this and tried adapting the best they could. In some of the lowest moments he remembers his mother telling him she wishes he would just die, yet all he could feel was compassion for how she felt.\n\nEventually someone who cared enough realized he was responsive enough and got him the help he needed and now he has a wife & kids, talks like Stephen Hawking, and is a computer programmer!\n\nReally shows how you can still emerge from the deepest, darkest places of life.\n\nIf anyone is wondering, it happened to him due to Cryptococcal Meningitis. Fungus covered his brain and spinal cord... the disease comes from soil with infected bird droppings being inhaled. One day he was just an innocent 12 year old playing outside, only for his life to be changed because of simply breathing in some kicked up dirt.

            "I got in a dirt bike accident during the summer between grade 8 and 9. I don\u2019t remember much about the day or two before...just kind of flashbacks like a dream. I woke up in the hospital a day or so later. To me it was like sleeping all of a sudden I woke up. I did have some memory loss though which lasted for a couple of hours.  This memory loss was different then just not remembering the day or so before. I woke up and although I knew my parents and everything I didn\u2019t remember the previous few years of school (like graduating from grade 8). It was a full on panic attack. I though I was going to have to repeat a couple grades and then essentially I was mentally handicapped (this was in the 80\u2019s, so I didn\u2019t use that exact term). Everything did come back...but that hour after waking up still haunts me.",
            "Not me, but my dad\u2014he was in a coma for about a week after riding his bike head first into a telephone pole. He says that he remembers the accident itself, followed by an out of body experience. He remembers flying high above the scene of the accident and looking down at his body laying there lifeless. He remembers seeing a woman from the neighborhood rushing over to see what happened and other neighbors brought out a flat beach chair to put him on while waiting for the ambulance. \n\nAfter he woke up from the coma and immediately broke down crying as the influx of stimulation and confusion poured in. His brain was stuck about 5 or 6 years in the past. He remembered his phone number, address, etc. but from years ago and he couldn\u2019t remember the current info. It took about two weeks after coming to for his brain to catch back up to current day. \n\nThe spookiest part? He went to the house of the woman who he had seen first from \u201cabove\u201d and asked if she had been the first to get there and other info about what he saw from outside his body and.... she confirmed all of it. \n\nPretty wild!",

            "A kid I went to middle school with spent 5 months in a medically induced coma waiting for a new heart. He said that in dream-time it was equivalent to several years during which he could fly and was stronger, but also had to fight clowns with chainsaws. He was aware that he was in a coma but couldn't really do anything about it (obviously.)\n\nInterestingly enough, there was a point in this dream where he was tasked with doing something that was literally impossible and he was somehow able to do it. In the real world, I believe medical professionals at one point said it was literally impossible for him to recover (I'm not sure what health complications were happening during this time, or if this was pre or post-transplant.)",
            "I was put in a medically induced coma after a car accident in which the driver fell asleep at the wheel, swerved off the road, and my car flipped over three times. I suffered a brain bleed and traumatic brain injury, and was operated on, with the doctors removing a piece of my skull to relieve the pressure. I was put under for three weeks, and I remember distinctly having a two week long dream. I don\u2019t really know how I knew it was two weeks long, but I had a variety of really weird dreams.\n\nThe dreams included scenarios like: 1) I was a box of ginger ale, and I was in a race against a box of Dr. Pepper in a supermarket. We both had a shopping cart we were on, and I barely won against the Dr. Pepper. After that I wanted ginger ale for weeks. 2) something involving a bunch of ninjas and a boat and an assassination that was going to occur. 3) I was a fish stuck in some kind of enclosure that I had to escape. 4) I was in some kind of turf war with my fraternity (they were just my friends) against a rival fraternity, and we both had battleships. Gravy and mash potatoes were involved somehow. 5) I was trying to escape this hospital I was at but I was too weak to walk and could not figure out how to get out of my bed for the life of me. \n\nWhen I woke up three weeks later, I was a little confused and had to piece together what happened from bits and pieces the doctors had told me. I would laugh very easily, like just from random phrases my friends who would visit me were saying to me. I had to undergo rehab for three months afterwards, learning how to walk and talk again. The doctors told me that my recovery was pretty fast. I still suffer from impaired concentration and energy levels, and I managed to get prescribed adderall for that issue. One positive out of that, I guess.",
            "I was hit by a direct bolt of lightning when I was 12. Playing catch with my best friend in a light drizzle, next thing I know I'm in an ambulance, then next thing after that it's been six days. Apparently you can have a lot of little heart attacks/stoppages when you've been hit by a bolt like that, even hours or days later, until your heart muscles all re-synchronize, and a defibrillator isn't guaranteed to fix it. \n\nI remember absolutely nothing, including the sensation of falling (or being) asleep. It was like that episode of Futurama with the Harlem Globetrotters and the time-skips; playing catch with Steven, *vwip* and I'm in the ambulance with a huge black guy looming over me, *vwip* and I'm sitting up in a strange bed with lots of plastic on me.\n\nFun fact, I was hit indirectly (under a tree) by another bolt some years later, and though I never lost consciousness, I spent a week as a nervous wreck convinced my heart was going to randomly quit.",
            "I was in coma because I fell 15metre and broke nearly all of my the bones in my back and it was horrible. When I woke up I thought the nurses were torturing me and that I need to escape. I started hallucinating a lot and couldn't even understand that I am in hospital. The biggest problem were my dreams. I thought I was a time travelor or some kind of God. I thought I was shot by the police and other shit. I still have flashbacks to this day and it is no fun. But I am getting therapy to deal with it. And I could watch porn in my dreams so yeah. It was confusing and horrible at the same time. 0/10 would not do again",
            "Not my story but on a previous post asking this question there was a guy who talked about having a whole second life while in his coma. He talked about vivid memories of his family and friends. He met a woman and they had kids together, then one day he was sitting in his lounge and started staring at this lamp. There was something off about it but he couldn't tell what. He stared at it. And kept staring all throughout the night... Then he realised the lamp wasn't real. Suddenly he started recalling his real life and woke up from his coma. He said that to this day he still grieves the loss of his family from the coma. I believe he said he sometimes sees his coma children in his dreams.\n\nIt was really interesting and depressing. If anyone can find that comment, let me know\n\nEDIT: I'm grateful that redditors seem to have the uncanny ability to dig up comments that are over 8 years old. Turns out in this instance, it wasn't a coma, and the guy was just out cold for however many minutes. Still a crazy story. To all you reading the story for the first time, I apologise for your collective existential crises",
            "Very peaceful, like a long nap but with occasional hallucinations (they used some meds to keep me in the coma for healing purposes). It didn\u2019t get bad until they weaned the sedation. I didn\u2019t know where I was and I had the WORST, most vivid hallucinations. I hallucinated that my mother was trying to remove me from the ventilator, that I was being chased by a murderer, that the room was on fire, that the nurse was trying to kill me and my personal favorite- a robot that floated around like a drone dispensing free weed to all. I was extremely vocal (yelling after my breathing tube was removed) about what I called Weed Bot and was yelling about how great it smelled. (Turns out it was actually a lamp that bends like the lamp at the dentist).  I have no memory at all of the day before I ended up in a coma, which freaks me out as I had a good memory. You don\u2019t wake up and return to normal. It takes intense work and I\u2019m still not 100%. Relearning to stand was incredibly painful, as was learning to walk again. There was a loss of dignity which was embarrassing to me at the time. I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months after this event. Sounds like the beeping of machines in medical shows put my mind right back in the ICU. Going through occasional procedures terrify me, since during my time in ICU so many people touched my body without explanation or my consent (I understand they had to do their job and I can\u2019t consent while I\u2019m comatose), but this happened even when I was awake. I experienced a decline in memory, my hair fell out for months afterwards. On July 4th it will be 3 years (went into a coma on the 5th anniversary of my grandmother\u2019s death in 2017). Sorry this is so long. I have never had the chance to speak about my experience, family doesn\u2019t talk about it. But we are able to joke about the Weed Bot hallucinations, lol!\n\nETA:  The most interesting, quirky thing that I nearly forgot was that although I was too sedated to open my eyes and comprehend what nurses/doctors were saying (combo of sedation & auditory hallucinations) I could hear their words, machines beeping etc. It\u2019s hard to imagine but it\u2019s a deep nap where you can hear everything in your environment. Due to paralytic meds I couldn\u2019t move or open my eyes when they touched me. Imagine being stripped and given a sponge bath when you can\u2019t speak, move or see. Felt violating, although that\u2019s their job. When they weaned the sedation considerably, I was able to open my eyes, but they had a really hard time weaning sedation because I had the breathing tube in and kept trying to talk. Nobody could understand my words with the tube in my throat, so I began to scream the words as loud as I can with the tube in my throat. The nurses really don\u2019t want you doing that because when you\u2019re on a ventilator, you\u2019re already at risk for vocal cord damage due to the breathing tube in your throat. A nice lady brought in a piece of paper with the alphabet on it, so I could point to each letter to spell out what I wanted to say. I remember I was so thirsty, I begged for water even with a tube stuck in my throat. Also after hearing them mention an MRI, I was frantically trying to spell \u201cno contrast\u201d because they didn\u2019t know about my allergy. I wasn\u2019t allowed to have any kind of drink even after the tube was removed as they were afraid of aspiration. When I got to drink my first drink (a teeny bit of Coke, same size cup as the plastic ones on the airplane but filled half way), I was so excited my heart rate shot up so much a team of nurses came in! \ud83d\ude06\n\nWow that was long, sorry guys. I wanted to give a detailed comment to help others understand. \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48",
            "I know this will get buried but I\u2019ll post my experience anyway. I went to the hospital with renal failure and a pulse ox reading of 32. I remember the nurse saying my pee looked like root beer and when she stabbed my arm to give me an IV all she said was \u201cUh oh...\u201d My arm got really warm and my dad moved my head so I wouldn\u2019t see how much blood was coming out. Next thing I know I\u2019m in a hospital bed, tearing through the desert at 60+ MPH. Nothing but me and a hospital bed. No motor, nothing. Just cruising through the desert. I\u2019d see all sorts of weird things, most specifically was Ronald McDonald. I saw him all the time. Then my hospital bed would come to a screeching halt and I\u2019d be in the living room of someone I knew. Gramdma, good friends, former coaches... basically any living room I had spent time in with someone I cared about. The weird thing was the living rooms were always three walled.  One wall was missing and beyond that wall was a barren desert. We would talk for awhile about god knows what, then I\u2019d be pulled back into the desert cruising at 60 mph again. It happened over and over again. Sometimes the same living rooms would reappear, but almost all of them were unique. When I came out of the coma everyone kept commenting how good my hair looked. I couldn\u2019t figure out why they kept saying that so I finally asked my mom how long I had been asleep. She said 13 days. And I had cards and flowers from all these people who\u2019s living rooms I\u2019d been visiting in my coma. It was surreal and I definitely can\u2019t explain it. Especially since most of the cards came from people who weren\u2019t allowed to visit me in intensive care and were sending well wishes in writing, not in person.",
            "I work as an RN in the ICU (mostly medical these days but I also work in trauma/surgical/neuro and occasionally cardiac) and most of my patients (especially now with Covid) are under deep IV sedation. We use everything from IV opiates to benzos, sometimes ketamine or dexmetatomidine. The ones that always seem to be kinda there are the ones on ketamine. I can't imagine the confusion of having someone touching you, cleaning you, the bright lights... all while in a fucking k-hole. ICU delirium is a real problem and there are many people that come out of their experience with intense PTSD. \n\nWhenever I do anything to/for a sedated patient, i always try to remember to tell them where they are, what day/time it is, and why they're in the hospital. Even if i just told them a half hour ago. Idk if it helps but it's what I would want for myself for sure.\n\nWear a mask please, unless you are ok with the possibility of having a machine breathing for you in a weird dream-like waking nightmare where you have a tube in your urethra and your butt and someone has to come poke your wrist artery multiple times a day. We try to make it as comfortable and atraumatic as possible but shit, dude... the ICU is a horrifying place.",
            "I had a TBI while I was in my early 20's.\n\nI hit my head on some concrete and was knocked out cold... at least that's what I thought. \n\nI was surrounded by friends who called an ambulance and while it was on its way they said I got up and asked what the deal was. They told me I needed to sit down but I told them something along the lines of, \"I'm fine. I'm walking home.\" to which I took two steps, got really confused, say down and puked. I didn't move till the ambulance got there and took me in. \n\nThe actual next thing I remember was getting stitched up in the ER and I **swore** I saw my boss there and asked him what happened. Then, right back out. \n\nI \"woke up\" two days later in the hospital in recovery from a massive concussion. \n\nBUT it turns out I had been awake and talking to everyone visiting me in the hospital. There were even pictures of me with people there. Very strange. \n\nI didn't remember anything within the time around the accident, minus what I just stated.",
            "My daughter was in a medically induced coma for two days from a drowning accident. She made a full recovery, but the things she told us about freaked me out but my wife kind of knew and accepted it. \n\nImagine having your three year old tell you about playing mermaid tea party with your dead parents. Then describing how she was denied being able to come into the gates of Heaven because St. Patrick told her it wasn\u2019t time yet. (I know it\u2019s supposed to be St. Peter, but I wore a shirt that reads St. Patrick is my homeboy and she exclaimed excitedly that she met him). \n\nThe after effects have been extremely weird. Mentally she is ok, physically and emotionally okay, but she sees ghosts. I could write a whole r/nosleep series on what she sees and the things she has said. The most recent one was a few months ago after her uncle/my brother in law passed suddenly.",
            "I've been in 2 medically induced comas. Both times it was like being in a dreamless sleep. I was unaware of time passing, which was weird waking up and then being told it was Thursday when last I remembered it was Monday. I don't remember anyone talking to me, but my mum said she spoke to me every day and the only time I would react was when she mentioned a certain name. She said whenever she said his name my eyes would flutter, other than that there was no response at all. It's also very confusing the first 30 mins at least as the drugs are still wearing off, you're intubated, have a naso-gastric tube for feeding, a central line for drugs and a catheter for urine. All of this is usually removed which isn't pleasant and you're still trying to wake up and make sense of your situation. I would say not one of the top 10 experiences to have before you die.",
            "I was in a medically induced coma for about a week. I was metabolizing the propofol (sp?) Very quickly,  I can remember coming to, my hands strapped to the bed and a ventilator tube in my throat. I would panic and try to communicate with my hands to the voices I heard in the room. My entire family was in the room during one of those times waking up, I was so frustrated that I couldn't communicate I ended flipping them all off with both hands as the nurse administered more medication and I passed out again. My family was relieved that I was still in there and laughed. \n\nWhen I finally came out of the coma it took me a few days to learn to use my legs again, I had the craziest most vivid hallucinations and my sense of what is real and what was a hallucination is still kind of fuzzy. \nI know the totem pole of people smoking a cigar and blowing all of their collective smoke through the hole in the roof wasn't real, that's so crazy it's obvious. But I don't know if all the nurses, conversations with family members are real. I still question my memories to this day and it's been about 8 years. \n\nOpiates are are a fucking dangerous drug kids, be careful and do your research on harm reduction. I wouldn't wish an overdose on anyone.",
            "My best friend was in a medically induced coma for 2 weeks and he truly believes he fought the devil in the depths of hell and then had a talk with God on a mountain about it.

            "in July of 2018 i was in a severe car accident, my spine & hip were fractured in 11 places along with some damage to my spleen which has healed. Before surgery I wasn\u2019t worried, I was told the surgery would last 6-7 hours, the neurosurgeon tried to go in with an incision through my ribs, she sawed a rib in half & when she reaches my spine she saw that the damage was far worst than she could see on the x-rays & that she now could not go through my ribs, so she had to sew me up & re-prepare the OR. She then made an incision on my back that\u2019s about a foot long & the surgery from that & the ortho surgeon fixed my hip, so in all I believe it all took around 14 hours. Being under anesthesia for so long, along with some pretty severe swelling they had to keep me under for about 5 days. I remember absolutely nothing from the month prior to my accident asides from the accident itself, waking up in the ICU I remember the breathing tube being pulled out (probably because it was so traumatic) & waking up to holding my dads hand. my dad told me that apparently when you\u2019re on life support your body can look swelled up or something like that?? I think it was also just incredibly swelled up from surgery so yeah. my family wasn\u2019t allowed all in to see me the first day, they were only allowed in the room one by one in case I coded & they had to clear the room quickly. They all said one by one they went in for 30 minutes, held my hand, and all cried. I remember being asked questions like \u201cwhat day is it?\u201d and being confused as FUCK when I say \u201cJuly 7th\u201d and the doctor said \u201cclose enough\u201d, The doctor giggling as I groaned over the question of who the current US President is. waking up I have no memory asides from it just being an extremely loopy, exhausted state. Due to having a breathing tube in for days, my tongue was numb completely, had red sores covering it and was pretty painful. The week following waking up was confusing, I would open my eyes & close them for what felt like a minute but was actually two days. During the coma it\u2019s just a total feeling of...nothing, I was told I would hold on to my fathers hand or even look up at my family and smile, which apparently is possible when you\u2019re in a coma?????? The week following waking up I would still have these moments of complete confusion, which is common after waking up from a coma, basically I would just feel confused & cry for a nurse & she would calm me down. It took about two weeks to get any feeling in my tongue, it\u2019s probably from the surgery but I also had NO feeling in my chest or arms, I could move my hands but not really feel anything. I regained most of the feeling back but I actually never regained feeling in my arm pits for some reason, which lol no big reason because according to the neurologist it\u2019s a god damn miracle i\u2019m alive & can walk.",

            "When I was 17 I fell into a natural coma for 4 days with a sudden case of viral encephalitis. Spent 2 nights in the ICU with a ventilator and feeding tube. The weirdest thing is how the bits and pieces come back to you after a while:\n\nI remember the morning it happened. Waking up and knowing something was wrong, stumbling into my parents room, and trying to scream but slowly becoming paralyzed. My vision was the first to go, then my balance, then I couldn\u2019t make coherent words, and then lost consciousness like I had been given a slow dose of anaesthetic. \n\nI remember waking up briefly one night with just my dad in the room and start losing my shit - I start frantically pulling off all my wires and tubes like I\u2019m fuckin Neo in the Matrix. They had to hold me down (which was easy since I was down to about 120 lbs.) and sedate me (ironic). When I woke up for good a few days later I didn\u2019t remember any of it. I\u2019ve recovered fully since but the experience still scars my dad/family, more than it ever effected me tbh. \n\nWhen I finally got back to school, it was my birthday a few weeks later and this one girl I hardly know goes \u201chappy birthday, didn\u2019t think you would make it to this one\u201d.

Apparently I stuck like a lawn dart for a few seconds, but as I opened my eyes to see my grandfather running at me, but he is upside down. Things go black again as I feel my body falling over. I woke up looking down on grandfather at my side. \n\nThey throw me in the car, this is 1980, and haul ass to the ER. Looking down on my body in the backseat the whole way. Get to the ER, x-rays negative (no CT/MRI back then), get sent to ICU. \n\nI spent the next 2 days watching from above the whole time, up in the corner of the ICU room looking down. I hear everything from everyone, mom/dad/grandparents/nurses/doctors. I hear the doctors say \"Swelling on the brain from impact. Don't know what prognosis will be\". \n\nAround the 2 day mark I notice things starting to fade to black. Next thing I know I'm awake and mom and dad are at the bedside crying over me. Nurse and doctor come in start checking me over. I feel fine. I told them I was there the whole time looking down from the corner. Nobody believed me. So, I started quoting what was said word for word things that had been said. Everybody was shocked. \n\nI stayed for 2 more days in a regular room for observation. Discharged home with no issues. I had a CT and MRI in 2001 for a neck muscle tear and shoulder separation. I was told they could see old compression fractures of the  C4, C5 and C6 cervical vertebrae.

Thank goodness for the flexibility of my young skeleton and more importantly a shit-ton of luck!\n\nDuring the whole event I was never in any pain. I was never scared. I didn't feel alone. There was no \"tunnel with bright light at the end\". I remember a presence with me the whole time. I didn't see anyone with me, but I know someone was there. There was no words spoken, yet I felt calm and at peace.",
            "Im a bit late, but here goes.\n\nBack in October, i was diagnosed with stage 4 ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) burkitts. I had a complication during a surgery on my spine where the line giving me sedatives collapsed, meaning I wasn't getting enough sedatives. I remember thinking to myself that they shouldnt be operating on me while I was awake, so I tried to get the nurses attention. I remember lifting my head off the pillow, looking over at the anesthesiologist, who had the most horrifying look of \"oh shit\" on her face, and then I guess I panicked, and they knocked me out the hard way. \n\nI was told I was in a medically induced coma for 6 days. I was also told that it took 12 doctors and nurses to hold me down whe I fought them, which is impressive, since I had about 50% lung function and 70% bone marrow function at the time, which basically meant it was a miracle i could walk around, let alone fight like a bull moose. \n\nThat surgery was about 3 weeks into my stay at the hospital. I only remember the ambulance ride from the hospital that diagnosed me to the hospital that would treat me. I lost 3 weeks that are just random fragments. \n\nI remember having lucid dreams that were super psychedelic and terrifying, because a part of me knew this wasn't real and was desperate to wake up. When I finally did, I had crazy hallucinations. I was convinced I rode a blimp, had butterflies land in my eyes, and that a team of hitmen were trying to steal my meds. I hallucinated children playing in the room next to mine, when there wasn't a room next to mine. It was a window, and police lights would trick me. I was convinced that there was a drop panel behind my bed leading to the sewer system, and thats how the hitmen were stealing my meds. I was also convinced that the doctors had special devices that made me fly. Yeah,, mushrooms aint got shit on comas..\n\nIt took two weeks to figure out how to walk again, where I was a fall hazard the whole time. My brain basically reverted to a 5 year old in a 23 year old man's body. It was a solid 6 weeks until I finally returned to normal cognitively, I think, but the process was gradual. \n\nSo what was being in a coma like? The most unforgettable experience that I can barely remember. I would not recommend doing it yourself.",

            "I was in a medically induced coma last year after a cardiac arrest. I remember nothing from the day it happened to when I woke up. It just feels like I existed, then suddenly I didn't, and then I did again. It's the craziest feeling going from sitting at my desk in my office to waking up in a hospital bed and learning over a week of your life has passed. I wish I could say I remembered anything my loved ones said to me while I was \"asleep,\" but I don't. All I remember is opening my eyes and hearing my mom say, \"Cinnamonbun, you're in the hospital, your heart stopped but you're okay now.\"",
            "I remember very weird dreams and hearing movies and shows and they would intermingle with what was going on around me and would turn into weird altered reality dreams/nightmares and then a lot of nothingness.   After hitting that semi head on at 60 mph and busting up most of my body, nothingness was much better than the pain upon waking.  It was the most excruciating I have ever experienced and still have PTSD from it.  I was awake after the accident for the hour it took to cut me out just screaming.  Flight medic arrived and gave me Versed and all I remember after that was being asked if I wanted to be put in a medically-induced coma and I just kept screaming/crying \u201cmake the pain stop!  I don\u2019t care, just make it stop!\u201d And they asked my husband.   I remember him asking me and I repeated the same.   I heard him say \u201cdo it\u201d and sweet, sweet blackness and the weird/nightmarish dreams for a week.  \n\nThe injuries were: \n- fractured femur in half (rod and 4 screws to fix)\n- fractured clavicle in half and separated 6 inches (plate and 7 screws to fix) \n- fractured most bones of left hand and tore most of ligaments and tendons with resulting damage still present 9 years later.  They brought in a hand specialist as it is my dominant hand and took multiple hours to repair and still have 2 screws remaining and 2 removed.  Can not straighten pinky fully and a bone fragment on back of hand sticking out.  \n- nearly amputated right foot at ankle with severe open compound fracture with significant nerve and vessel damage.  Most hospitals in state stated amputation only option as injury too severe.  One surgeon stated he would try 12 hrs after accident and with very poor blood flow requiring frequent traction to repeatability pulses (severely painful).  Still have 4 screws and worsening nerve pain, but have my foot....thank you Dr Hakeos.  \n- pulmonary and cardiac contusions \n- lacerated liver in multiple spots requiring several transfusions \n- concussion\n- pressure wound back of head from prolonged C-collar use \n\nTook a year to get back to work.   Took longer to emotionally and psychologically recover.  Had an 20% chance of surviving.

            "I got injured in Iraq in 2010. I was in a medically induced coma for about a week. I flat lined 4 times. I wasn't to aware of the outside world. Pain, definitely. I am highly resistant to pain meds, sedatives, and stimulants by a genetic mutation. So, me getting 1000mcg of fentanyl for an hour operation is completely normal. Not including Ketamine and hydromorphone. Ketamine being in a pain pump going in my spinal cord.\n\n\nI was in a completely other reality for that week. I heard conversations, felt certain things, occasionally opened my eyes. Because the propathol (I can't remember how it's spelled) and whatever other drugs that are meant to keep you asleep were mostly affective. But, I would wake up and start fighting the nurses in Walter Reed and BAMC.\n\n\nI have some trouble separating my comatose mind from reality. Especially for the first 3 months after my injuries. Since I was on so much meds. Still kinda am. But nowhere near what I was while in the hospital.",
            "WARNING: BLOODY LONG POST\n\nI was in an induced coma for about 10 days after a very serious car accident. Amazingly I didn't have a head injury (well a 90mph almost instant stop could cause a small brain injury that wasn't initially picked up, my mother seems to think so anyway!) but my internal injuries and 4 hour emergency surgery meant it was better I didn't breath and my lungs and diaphragm didn't move.\n\nWe were in a car in torrential rain and the driving was easily going 50 in a 30 area, I was telling him to slow down and we aquaplaned (after going over a small bump) into the oncoming car, who was drunk and speeding too. The car had spun to the passenger side so I was hit first. This was th late 90s before the European standard safety standards were introduced. Our car was a biscuit tin, his was a tank. Took over an hour to cut me out of the wreckage. \n\nI also smashed my pelvis (broke in 4 places, usually surgically corrected but other injuries etc.) I broke my left superior and inferior pubic ramus, which malunited and means I cannot hold anything between my legs and have a weak pubic syphysis post dislocation (and the fact it's only really attached via new bone that grew), the left acetabum and left sacral ala. Now one leg is about 2 inches longer than the other.\n\nI also broke multiple ribs on the left side including a flail section, had a haemopneumothorax on the left (punctured lung, lung space filled with blood preventing lung from expanding. I also had a 5 inch perforation in my diaphragm through which part of my small, large intestine and stomach had herniated.\n\nThe journey from the car to hospital was bizarre and I remember all of the accident, all of the being in the car vomiting blood and barely being able to breath. The force had also pushed my side of the car underneath the driver's seat, with him still in it so waiting for him to be hoisted off first wasn't fun. I remember telling the paramedics my home telephone number, address, my mum's mobile number, my dad's mobile number, my National Insurance number (?!?). I think the drugs had started to work, although I was still in astonishing pain. The paramedics seemed confused as to why I was struggling to breath on oxygen, even with a punctured lung I should have been better. Using my stomach muscles instead of my redundant diaphragm to breath was why but because I was talking they thought I'd just punctured a lung and broken both legs (I could feel pain but not move them, for weeks).\n\nAt the hospital, they gave me a (now standard for any RTC) CT scan 3 hours after I got there to assess the internal damage AFTER giving me an emergency ultrasound and wondering why they couldn't make much out (gas blocks the ultrasound, it relies mainly on fluid. The gas from my bowel being in my chest was the clue). So 3 hours after reinflating my lung, I crashed on the CT scanner and went for emergency surgery. Funnily enough I later met the guy who was on call that night to race to the blood Bank to get me more blood, I'd lost over a body's worth.\n\nThey told my parents I had roughly a 20% chance of surviving the surgery. After the surgery they told my parents that it was much worse than anyone had initially realised (NEVER try to be the tough guy and pretend you're alright when seeking medical advice, it almost cost me my life) and that I had roughly a 20% chance of surviving. They like their 20%!\n\nBecause of the internal damage, flail rib etc. they put me on a ventilator. Now I remember having a drain in my chest but still feeling fucking awful, I remember being sedated and a dude sticking his finger in my arse to see if I'd had any spinal damage. I remember being on the CT scanner and joking that \"is this the one that people on TV are scared of?\". It wasn't, that's an MRI which is a very enclosed tube compared to a CT which is like a completely open bed going in and out of a giant polo mint.\n\nI remember coming around afte the op, when I should have been fully sedated (in hospitals, despite saying 'sedated and on ventilation', you are not given sedative drugs like Fentanyl, Remifantanyl and Morphine ALONE... all would be classed as sedation when sedation is the strongest form on anaesthetic, but when sedated in an induced coma, it's actually the drugs they use to out you to sleep during operations. The drugs in the UK such as Rocuronium, Atracurium, Cisatracurium etc. So it's not like I'd taken some Valium and was pretty out of it, I should have been sparko for the first few days and then brought out of it (or attempted to) after that.\n\nI always jokes with friends that I would take the longest to 'come up' if we had anything illicit and I felt like I definitely wasn't given enough of the drugs. I played a lot of rugby/sprinted and was largely muscle. Right after surgery I could feel what felt like a zip on my chest/stomach (was 36 external staples, post laparotomy). What also wasn't standard at the time but now is, was that my eyes were taped shut. This is because when very tired or drunk I have a habit of sleeping with my eyes open. Not fully open but if you imagine someone lying on a sofa lengthways reading a book that they are leaning on their lap. That's how wide my eyes are when I sleep drunk (or heavily sedated) so they tapes them shut to stop them drying out. Worst of all, I had a pipe in my throat which in my stupor I had convinced myself was turned off. In the movies and TV when people are ventilated, you see their chest move up and down. With broken ribs and a torn diaphragm, this wouldn't be ideal. Instead I was ventilated so that there was a constant circulation of oxygen in my lungs but if anyone of you have held your breath for a long time, your body tries to breath. My muscles were relaxed enough that I wasn't gagging but being unable to take a breath in started to panic me. I could hear nurses and I remember tapping the rail to get their attention to do a sort of hand charades game whereby I got across the message that I cannot breath and after all the good they'd done me so far (I already felt a shit tonne better than pre op and was in a morphine high) they'd screwed up and left the machine off. When they kept saying \"It's alright\" (worst thing to say without explaining to someone WHY it's alright) and trying to hold my hand away from the ventator. I used to arm wrestle a lot and was a very strong 18 year old, so I grabbed the thing and remember hearing the sort of cacophony you'd expect at a riot as they tried to hold my right arm down. I then remember thinking that finally I was fucked... I'd put up with a hell of a lot in the last 9 or so hours since the crash and I thought of how ridiculous it was that I'd survived everything so far but this would be the point of failure. In the back of my mind I remember thinking (I don't even know if this is true or not btw but at the time I fully believed it was) that Harry Houdini had the world record the longest time a human could hold their breath without oxygen and it was something like 6 minutes. I know, what kind of idiot would think of that at that time, I'm kinda high functioning autistic also, so there's that. I decided I'd count to 300 and if I was still alive then maybe they do know what they're doing. I probably counted around 10 times but at the time it seemed like a very slow count. I reached 300 and at that point was incredibly tired and confused and so accepted that either I could now rest up and heal or die but there was nothing more I could do. The fight was over.\n\nI pulled out my NG tube and was fairly combative apparently during the rest of my time on Intensive Care. After what seemed like an eternity of confusion and battle, they finally pulled out my intubation tube and was happy that my puke looked like green pesto and not blood. There had been a lot of vomiting blood.\n\nI was asked what year thought it was, I said I'd no idea, and they told me to have a think of the most recent year I could think of. I said 1991 or 92 and they told me bluntly it was 1996. I was very confused until my parents came to see me and explained everything. The drugs have an amnesic property so I regained memory of everything that had happened over the next couple of days but being told the year by the nurse bluntly was actually very good at kick starting my brain.\n\nAfter all that I out on a lot of weight, never skateboarded again, never played rugby again and can't have my pelvis fixed because it's require extensive reconstructive surgery which has a good risk of making me impotent. Amazingly I was allowed home after 6 weeks barely able to walk with a zimmerframe but as my mum was a housewife, she was there to look after me. The first night home despite a lot of pain, my girlfriend and I bumped uglies and I found that my junk worked perfectly as it had before. There's no way I'm going to risk that with reconstructive surgery. I can walk fine and can run if I need to, walking is mostly without pain but I bailed on physio as I really badly popped my rib cartilage on the left where I'd been using the monkey bars on the bed to sit myself up (the broken ribs were painful but having some movement was more important, in hindsight I shouldn't have been allowed them) so I still walk a little bit funny. No lasting issues with internal organs or lungs (yet, 42 now).\n\nTL:DL Big smash, big op, big fight, big recovery, painful sex.\n\nEdit: Added warning on length",
            "I was in a medically induced coma for a month, and in multiple organ failure during it too. I really love horror movies and books and unfortunately I think I gave my brain too much material for hallucinations. I spent the whole time thinking I was being vivisected and tortured in a government lab in New York.",
            "It's all absolutely black. Now coming out of it was interesting.\n\nEDIT: adding what it was like coming out of coma\n\nSo, my coma was a result of a huge car accident and a little different. I had no clue I had been in an ICU for a little over three weeks nor in my mom's house for almost a year. When my mom decided to take me out of the ICU, she was frustrated with the doctors telling her they had no clue how I was managing some functions but not present at the same time. She left with the prognosis that I would be mentally handicap for life (14 CT scans and 15 MRIs later and my brain was still 80% plus black... a.k.a. no visible activity). \n\nSo, I don't have the slightest recollection of any of the cognitive and physical therapy I was constantly going through. If I had to guess, I would say around the 9 month mark is when my brain first fully clicked on and I had one of my first memories. For the briefest of seconds, I woke up in the middle of cognitive therapy tracing lines at a second grade level. All I remember is seeing the paper, pencil, then saying \"What the f***?!\". From there, I have no clue how long it took my brain to click fully on (time was not a concept I could apprehend given I spent most of it in darkness).\n\nHowever, as time progressed, I had longer and longer stints out of the blackness. It was no longer just a snapshot, I would be aware for minutes. Given my brain seemed to alternate between absolute blackness and full functioning (mentally... I wasn't allowed to walk due to the various broken things and full abdominal surgery), I found myself constantly questioning why I was getting talked to like a child (I was 22-23 years old at the time) every time I was in a conversation (beyond struggling to comprehend, I also lost my filter completely which had led to some funny stories). I mostly remembered who I was and what I had been doing, but the last year was completely gone (I'm still learning about things that happened (37yo now). I struggled a lot with that later. \n\nBut, in the moment, when I started remembering day to day what had and was happening, my drive to get back to what I was doing was almost uncontrollable even though I was just progressing my way out of a wheel chair, I just wanted to be me again. Meanwhile, every cognitive therapist I saw was looking at me absolutely complexed and wanted me to take my time. Everyone feared the moment my brain would click off again; rightfully so. There was definitely hope, but so much doubt at the same time. \n\nThe only thing I've ever been able to compare it to... Watching my grandfather progress through Alzheimer's. In the early stages, he was always in and out of knowing where he was it who people were. I watched him as people would talk to him like a child not knowing whether he was fully there or not. The anger and confusion he displayed was something I kind of always felt, but wasn't sure if I was truly conveying that emotion or not. It was so weird, angering, confusing to know who you are, but be talked to like a toddler.\n\nI'm sure I could add more, so feel free to ask questions",

Man what a ride!\n\nSome points from my recollection:\n\n\\- I believed I was on a first class flight to SE Asia, with my mother by my side (she was physically by me). The propped-up wide hospital bed, dimmed lights and constant beeping and whirring from machines created such a strong memory.\n\n\\- Upon 'landing' at the destination, I was in a make shift hospital on a steep hill slum. I felt separated from my family and what I knew as healthcare and was endlessly worried of the care I was receiving.\n\nComing through the other side of the coma:\n\n\\- The curtains in ICU had a recurring pattern on them, as many curtains do. Anytime my eyes caught these, they started circling and shifting, often ending in scary faces such as the dark lord, aka the big fella downstairs, satan.\n\n\\- My family often listened to Peter Skellern, and anytime I shut my eyes, I was transported to a crazy animated world with his music playing and guiding the animation. Everything was a dancing / smiling / moving figure. Blades of grass, fence posts, individual leaves - all of them with big cartoon eyes and a wide-smile dancing to Peter Skellern.\n\nI remember these four elements so very clearly, and having written them down it has given me goosebumps.\n\nI wrote a short-story that was shared with the ICU team, and I later heard that is resulted in them changing the curtains to a plain fabric, so there's a bonus! \n\nFor context, this was 20 years ago and in a town in New Zealand called Hastings.\n\nThis is my first ever reddit post, I haven't had an actual account until I came across this question.",

            "ICU nurse here. I work at a metro hospital and we put a lot of people into medically induced comas. It is really interesting talking to people after we wake them up as there is such a range of reactions. Some people snap right out of it and don't remember anything. Some people have fuzzy memories of certain events usually towards the end when we are weaning down sedation. And some people suffer from delirium which is what most of the people commenting here are describing. Waking nightmares, confusion, hallucinations, sometimes they become extremely paranoid. I've had people think they are being held prisoner, some people who are convinced they have died. There is a whole bundle of things we do as care providers to prevent icu delirium but in the end the longer you are in a coma, the more likely you will become delirious. It has been especially difficult with COVID. People are on ventilators for a LONG time and they require a LOT of sedation. Your brain doesn't go into sleep cycles when we put you into medicated comas. Think about not sleeping for 3 weeks. That is why your brain is so messed up. There can even be long term complications from this. It's called PICS or post intensive care syndrome. Look it up. Some people are never the same, some people describe dementia like symptoms or forever feeling \"foggy.\" There is a ton of research being done on this and unfortunately covid is going to be providing a lot more opportunities to study this."

The fact that they've done as well as they have, with some of the best economic growth and health outcomes in South Asia, is basically only a testament to the incredible strength of Bangladeshi people in general. The last thing they need is American concern trolling along the lines of Venezuela, Russia, Iraq, etc. Start by reading a book about the country, meeting Bangladeshis, or even just reading the Wikipedia entry for the country.

            "Do nothing. Redditors from west know not a lot about the situation and who is right or wrong. There is too much propaganda here. It's a fight between hardcore islamists supported by the jailed ex PM Khaleda Zia,his runaway son and the current PM Sheikh Hasina.\n\nThe islamists student body supported by ex pm Khaleda zia is creating havoc and government is trying to control the situation.\n\nE: Added what I wrote in some other thread for perspective.\n\nTwo students died in a bus race that had nothing to do with the government. The government can make regulations (which is certainly lacking) but abiding to it is on drivers. Both drivers were arrested. The roads are bad because ex PM Khaleda Zia and her son siphoned off trillions of Taka. During her 5 year tenure in 01-06 Bangladesh was number 1 in whole world in corruption for 5 straight years.\n\nThe agitation was made violent as soon as Bangladesh Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal the student wing of Khaleda Zia's BNP joined. JCD has a history of violence and murder not only amongst its faction but is generally a radical Islam supporter and supported the many killings of secular bloggers and vloggers in Bangladesh. BNP itself is a rabid anti secular party and very very religious. Khaleda follows the footsteps of her dictator husband. Don't forget Jamaat-e-islami a nefarious hardcore Islamic political party who does not believe in secularism. It's student wing is known for bomb attacks and machete killings. It has also committed war crimes during Bangladesh independence fight of 1971. It's leader once boasted of killing 1000 Biharis by himself in a single day. It's student wing Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir supports shariat and supports only madrassa education. In February 2014, US-based defense think tank IHS Jane's published a report titled \"IHS Jane's 2013 Global Terrorism & Insurgency Attack Index\", where Shibir(Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir) ranked third in a list of most active non-state armed groups in 2013.\n\nEvery minister has urged students to either go back to classes or be in home. Do accidents not happen in any other part of the world? Bangladesh has a good judicial system. Grievances could have been directed there. It's not like bangladesh is a rich country with surplus budget.\n\nThis agitation is nothing more than a ploy by opposition to sway the democratic election which are to be held later this year. It's politics on dead bodies(Laash pe rajneeti karna). The BNP and Jamaat both supported terrorist and militancy in India supporting the ULFA, NSCN (I-M), PLA and other Manipuri outfits found a safe haven in Bangladesh not only morally but financing and giving them living quarters after attack on India.\n\nAccording to the Saudi authorities, Khaleda Zia and her sons had an investment of around $12 billion in malls and other infrastructural projects in Saudi Arabia with the money amassed through bribery and extortion. As investigations are underway, more facts have surfaced about huge investments by the BNP chief's late son Arafat alias Koko, who died in January 2015. Koko allegedly made enormous investments in Saudi Arabia - all from ill-gotten wealth. He was also wanted in Bangladesh for multiple charges of corruption. Similarly, his brother Tareq Rahman, now in hiding in England, invested several millions of dollars in many foreign destinations with a large chunk of sum in Saudi Arabia and other West Asian countries. Earlier, there were allegations, many supported by evidence, that Tareq had nefarious dealings, including money-laundering and large investments, with the underworld dons, detrimental to Indian security interests.\n\n",

For instance, he was in his mid-twenties, living in NYC, and had somehow avoided ever paying a nickle in rent. Like not once in his life. I personally witnessed him not only refuse to pay his landlord for six months, but also walk away with $3,000 compensation when the matter went to court. From there he ended up in a free pad provided by a real estate broker who hired him on the spot while he was looking for an appartment. Seriously. I've never seen anyone so consistently fall ass first into a basket of rose petals as this dude.\n\nBut that's about the time I lost contact with him because he went full time into real estate brokerage. Which was just as well because he wasn't really a very good employee. He wasn't dangerously incompetent or anything, just kind of slow and lacking any sense of hustle. I kept him on just because he was so entertaining and had this ability to keep everyone else's morale up. We called him \"the Jam Burner\" because he would fixate on certain bands, and play these really badass tunes, but play them so frequently that everyone would be completely burned out by the time his focus shifted. \n\nAnyway, he would go around asking these asinine questions of everyone, as though he was conducting a Heathers poll.

            "\"Whats the most obscure fact you know that would make you win on Jeopardy?\"",
            "Not a question, but more of an icebreaker game. \n\nIt's called Make It Or Break It. So basically, picture your perfect match. This person is personally perfect for you in every way possible. Like you would marry them on the spot. So they're perfect for you in every way EXCEPT I name one thing about them that makes them NOT perfect for you, and you have to say whether that would be a deal breaker. (Does it make it or break it?) So here's a few examples:\n\nMake it or break it, they're perfect for you in every way EXCEPT they always wear the color green. They will never not wear the color green. Different shades of green are fine, but every single piece of clothing they will ever wear for the rest of their lives will be at least 95% green. Even at like funerals.\n\nMake it or break it, they only eat pizza ever.\n\nMake it or break it they will never drink.\n\nMake it or break it, for one day once a month, every month on the exact same day, they leave town for the whole day. But they never tell you where they're going or what they're doing, and they never will. If you ask them about it, they say \"you just have to trust me.\" If you try to sneak and find out what they do every month, bam relationship over, you're dead to them.\n\nMake it or break it whatever they eat, they drown the whole thing in ketchup, and they always will. Even ice cream. They carry around a little travel ketchup bottle just in case they eat at a place without ketchup. They'll never change.\n\nMake it or break it they hate animals.\n\nNSFW: Make it or break it they've sucked 500 dicks.\n\nMake it or break it they want an open relationship.\n\nMake it or break it, whatever thing you're most passionate about, no matter how hard you practice at it, they will always naturally be better than you (bonus: and they don't really even care about the thing they're good at, it's just kinda meh to them).\n\nThese are examples I've come up with collectively over time while playing with people. They can be serious or goofy scenarios and you can play with anyone. It's a super fun game that you can pull out any time it starts to get awkward, and eventually you and the person are going back and forth coming up with new Make It Or Break It scenarios. A nice bonus is that if you're flirting with someone, you can gauge what they're looking for in a relationship and sort of test your chemistry/compatibility.",

He and I already had a date scheduled, so before we went, I cleaned my room and the entire house from top to bottom, created a chill playlist on my computer to listen to, shaved/waxed every necessary inch of my body from the forehead down, put on sexy underwear, and waited for him to pick me up. We went out to the movies, and when he dropped me off at home, I invited him in--with the added context and in a leading, flirty tone of voice--that we would be all alone and had all the time in the world to do whatever he wanted. \n\n\nHe said, \"That's alright, I'm sure you want to enjoy this time you get without your parents to be alone.\" \n\n\nHe was sure, and he was wrong. \n\n\nI just stared at him for like ten solid seconds in silence before I nodded, said \"Yeah that's true\", and got out of the car. The walk from my driveway to the front door was the real walk of shame, and I hadn't even gotten any good sex out of it. After that, I sat in my very clean house in my sexy underwear, eating pizza and wondering how that could have gone differently. It was my first time trying to seduce a guy into sex and it failed miserably. I laughed about it though, and I still laugh about it now. I just figured it wasn't in the cards for me yet. \n\n\nEnded up losing my virginity a few more years later to the guy I'm currently engaged to, so it worked out wonderfully; he's pretty good at picking up what I'm throwing down.

I slugged down the last of my drink, slammed the glass on the bar, looked him dead in the eye, and said, \u201cReally? Is that a genetic trait?\u201d\n\nAnd...whoosh. \n\nHe kept right on talking.

            "Back when the Assassins Creed games were in their heyday I cosplayed as one of the assassins with a few of my friends who were also assassins (for example one of us was Connor, one was Ezio, another was Edward, etc). I spent a lot of time on those costumes and the props so I have no problem saying they looked GOOD. We got a lot of attention, including getting stopped for literal hours at the playstation booth for pictures because a few other assassins joined and we had the whole fam-damily.\n\nThe problem: I am a girl, and a short one at that. My friends who cosplayed with me are tall boys. So at the risk of looking like a POP vinyl next to them I had to wear boots with a significant heel on them to help give me some height. It was BRUTAL. We only got tickets for the one day and it was hours spent on our feet in poses and we had to stop every few feet for pictures. Dont get me wrong, the pictures were awesome, it made all the time and effort worth it. But I was in absolute agony. At one point when we all took a bathroom break I took off my boots and put my throbbing feet on the cold tile floor (judge me all you want, it felt amazing). Thankfully some people who wanted to take pictures with me noticed I was in pain and out of costume and just chatted with me and waited to take pictures until after I got the boots back on. \n\nI had to call it quits early on and missed out on looking around as much as I would have liked. Even trying to leave the huge convention center was slow because I kept getting stopped. \n\nWhen I finally got back to the hotel and took my boots off I had huge blisters on the top of my feet, on my heels, everywhere. It ruined the rest of the weekend for me.\n\nA couple of years later I went as Lara Croft from the newer games and got to wear flat, grippy boots with a nice gel insert. It was heaven.",

            "Master chief. Every Halloween at school I would wear an over the top costume and for my senior year I wanted to go above and beyond. So I worked overtime to buy halo 4 master chief armor. Only problem was that the armor pieces were made of plastic so I couldn\u2019t sit completely down without breaking the thigh pieces. So I had to go through every class squatting over my seat instead of actually sitting in it. My legs were killing me at the end of the day. Also my costume was very loud.

Not neckbeards who want to quiz you on your Harley knowledge. Not OTHER HARLEY COSPLAYERS who have an issue with what version of Harley you picked or how accurate your cosplay is.\n\nEvery Harley I\u2019ve met has been given hell for their cosplay for one reason or another. I only did LEGO Harley twice and got minimal shit for it but I\u2019ve met multiple suicide squad Harleys who were literally suicide baited online and pushed around at cons by people who hated the character. \n\nNever again.\n\nEdit: Instead of just posting a cheesy \u201cthanks for the silv\u201d, how about I expand on my experiences as a Harley cosplayer?\n\nI did two events as Harley, a convention as an attendee and \u201cHarley Quinn Day\u201d at a comic book shop as a paid performer. My cosplay was handmade, safe for the wig, and lacking in LEGO Harley\u2019s pads, but the colors were spot on and the wig was on point.\n\nAt the con, not a whole lot of problems. I had a creepy Joker latch onto me all con, repeatedly getting up on my face and wrapping an arm around me, but at no point was I genuinely fearful due to the fact we were still in a crowd. I had a handful of people ask me which Harley I was, or go out of their way to critique my \u201coriginal\u201d design for her before I went on to explain that I was Harley from the LEGO movie. At no point did I feel like I should shelf Harley, it wasn\u2019t *that* bad, I had a worse time that weekend when I cosplayed a podcast character that nobody was able to identify correctly.\n\nWorking the event is what caused me to shelf the cosplay. I was working alongside two other Harley\u2019s, meeting and greeting people coming in for Harley Quinn merch and taking pictures. We were promised $20 each for three hours of our time, wasn\u2019t godawful, most cosplay performers do what they do for fun and will do certain events for free if they like the gig. In the email it said we could choose store credit OR cash up front. Remember that.\n\nI got to talk to the other two Harleys between photo ops, and they started telling me horror stories. One mentioned she had been posted on cringe pages, which lead to people hunting her down to harass her and suicide bait her, all because she cosplayed Suicide Squad Harley and people are quick to call Suicide Squad Harley\u2019s fake fans or say they\u2019re not REAL cosplayers. The other mentioned that she was touching up her makeup in the bathroom at con and someone cosplaying the original Harley grilled her, saying she\u2019d never do Suicide Squad Harley because it\u2019s \u201ctrashy\u201d\n\nBy the end of the event, the owner of the comic shop stiffed us. He gave us each three $5 coupons to the shop. I had to pull up the email to prove he\u2019d offered us cash. After all of that? I was done with Harley.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame, I splurged on the wig.",

Thank you all so much for your concern and support.\n\nTo those asking, no, I didn't press charges. I didn't have the time or money to invest in it, and I was so shaken up from injuring another person that I just wanted to forget it.\n\nI won't deny that I sometimes do regret not pursuing it, but it's really hard to think rationally after something like that. The guy was bleeding. I was pretty certain I broke my hand and his face. In the moment, I was scared that I'd be charged with assault (irrational, I know) and that opening a claim against him would result in me facing the repercussions. I can't really distill down all the emotions and fears I experienced in the moment, but I do know that was my biggest concern (next to cost).\n\n**Edit 2:**  Apparently this got featured on a Reddit post compilation video. I guess that's a new type of internet fame? (But seriously, please don't throw people's comments into a video without consent.

            "I did a version of Doug Rattmann from Portal. This included a large companion cube with straps on it to be worn on my back. The cube was made of wood, and fairly heavy.\n\nSomeone saw me, saw the cube, and jumped on it to give it a hug with no warning. Wrenched my back really badly and didn't let go when i initially shouted. I had to explain they were hurting me very badly before they let go. Came very close to giving me a serious injury. Plus, I had to keep a close eye on it whenever I turned around in public. This cube was roughly to scale with what you see in the game, and solid. Pretty sure I nearly hit a few people with it. So... No more big props for me, especially not ones people will want to dive onto and hug.\n\nAlbum with the pictures and the story:  https://imgur.com/gallery/gI48kSn",

Ended up taking the mask off and leaving it hanging around my neck when we got to artist alley, because honestly what's the point of going there if you can't see all the cool posters/prints people are selling? If I can figure out how to solve the fogging issue I might wear it again, but I'm probably just going to make a cosplay I can actually see out of next time.\n\nEdit: here's a picture of the suit in question https://imgur.com/a/vhcy8Vz",

But after a while keeping up the energy was hard - when I'm cosplaying I try to stay in the character - and so was walking. Big heels hurt after several hours.

            "I used to work at Bumble, although this was about 4-5 years ago. Globally, about 90% of the users are men, so there is a huge male to female disparity, although it's not that bad on a per country basis (for some countries).\n\nThe most depressing stat though was the histogram of word count in messages. Something like 91% of opening messages were just one word \"hey\", and ~85% of conversations were just one exchange long (\"hey\" -> no reply ever).\n\nLooking at human, digital mating habits splayed out in data science form was really depressing.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Yikes, this thread really exploded. Some people have asked me a lot of the same questions so am providing answers here:\n\n1) When I worked there, we were NOT allowed to read the content of chats, only gather metadata about them (word count, number of exchanges), but we could not build models which analysed the content of chats (this chat was about food, this one was about holidays, this one was sexual). This was due to stringent GDPR draft rules/TOS/privacy rules at the time, and Bumble took user privacy very seriously, so chats were never read or analysed for content, not even by automated models. However this was 4-5 years ago, and they may have amended their TOS since then to allow it, or they might be analysing content for non-GDPR countries (USA). Therefore, as others have pointed out, we don't know for sure that the word used most often was actually \"hey\", it could have been \"hello\" or \"howdy\". In the office, we always assumed it was \"hey\" due to our own experiences on the app. But we did know with certainty that ~91% of first messages used only a single word, so we guessed it was \"hey\".\n\n2) The countries which had better male-female ratios (which I can remember) were the Nordic ones, Sweden and Norway were close to 50/50, and for a time, one of them even had more women on the app than men. Not sure how it is now.\n\n3) The GDPR rules were released in 2016 (even earlier draft rules for some industries such as banking/finance and telecoms), but were not actually enforced until 2018. This grace period of two years was so that firms could implement all of the massive legal and technical protocols for GDPR, and many compliance/tech departments in London did nothing but a mad dash sprint for 2-3 years straight to get GDPR compliant before the 2018 deadline. As such, Bumble was already GDPR compliant (at least in terms of user chats, don't know about other aspects) well before 2018 (as I said, they took user privacy seriously, even before GDPR). We weren't allowed to read chat messages due to a combination of user privacy TOS (specific to Bumble) and GDPR draft rules. I just wrote GDPR as a catch-all term for all of the various privacy rules in effect then (including TOS), but yes, I agree, the rules were not enforced yet. I apologise that I wasn't specific, I wrote my reply quickly this morning not thinking it would explode like this, and so just blurted out GDPR without getting pedantic about which rules in which years. Apologies for any confusion.\n\n4) All these numbers are pulled from my memory of what I saw 4-5 years ago, and thus are not canon law or academic paper worthy.\n\n\nUPDATE 2: Thank you most kindly for all of the awards kind strangers! I very much appreciate it!",
            "I ran operations for an online dating company (notably not affiliated with Match). From database analytics I can tell you a few things. Men initiate contact around 80% of the time in straight matchmaking, and if you are a woman looking to date other women and you simply initiate contact with another woman you have a good chance of success simply because it's very very very common for women to match but then neither initiates contact. IIRC we were able to determine that it takes on average about 3 dates before sex happens (I don't recall how we worked that out, I'm not a data analyst, but presumably it was some keyword based algorithm looking at chat messages).\n\nWe got so many requests for information from the police that we had an informal system with them, to save them from wasting time getting warrants for information about people who we didn't have data on, they would ask about a particular name/email/whatever other identifier and we would just say yes we have data about them or no we don't, and if we did they'd then go get the warrant to get a copy of it.\n\nThe other thing I can tell you from our analytics, that really shouldn't be at all surprising, is to **get some decent profile photos.** Go get your talented friend or just hire a photographer to take some really nicely-lit well-composed photos of yourself and watch your match rate  soar.",

Will you bring them fun places? Will you make them laugh? \n\n3) Get good photos. If you have to, get a friend with a good camera to take photos of you multiple times over a day with several changes of clothes.\n\n4) be brutally honest. Do you need to go to the dentist because your teeth are gray? Go. Do you need to get a haircut? Go somewhere that charges $50 a haircut and tell them to do what they want (if male). Do your clothes fit? Ask a fashionable friend. Remember: people are judging you on your appearance as much as you are judging them. They can't see you're kind of funny or interesting. They can see if you're well groomed and making an effort.\n\nAny more advice and I charge $50 USD an hour ;)",

            "Finally an ask reddit question I can answer! Throwaway because much of this information is not necessarily positive.\n\nI worked for a dating app for a few years in a role that was pretty high up where I was privy to almost all of the inner workings of the app. I won't say which one, but I think my experience probably is applicable to other apps as well.\n\n1. We had a murder on our platform. The top of the company got interviewed as witnesses. TBH there wasn't really anything we did our could have done about it, but it is crazy to think about.\n2. One of our members got scammed out of six figures, and there was nothing we could do about it either. She was older, and lonely, and the person used an attractive picture and kind words to play off of that. If you let them, people will find any way to scam and abuse those who are lonely. Some of our systems for detecting and removing scammers and spammers were far more advanced than our systems for actually creating matches. Also we found older women were actually the most likely to be scammed. You can make your own conclusions from that.\n3. To that point, the algorithms are less sophisticated than you think. They mostly consist of educated guesses, and then trial and error to see what creates the most engagement. This engagement could be anything from returning to the app, to sending messages. The main goal of the algorithm is always to get you to pay, never to actually ensure you meet somebody in real life, as much as we tried to lie to ourselves that it was.\n4. No dating professionals or psychological professionals were ever consulted when we were building our software, software that basically plays cupid and changes the courses of peoples live. I kept thinking it would be a good idea to have experts and scientists tell us what determines attraction and sets up a relationship for success, but nobody was ever interested in hearing that. Instead we made our own choices about how to build this thing.\n5. I met hundreds of our users in person, and they were all pretty great people. Many of them were willing to come in and talk because they were struggling with actually finding people and matches on our app. It was sad that our software was failing them, some of the best, most lovely people, really struggled to find a partner.\n6. Almost every dating app has a significantly larger percentage of men than women.\n7. We toyed with doing a test of \"blind dating\" where you couldn't see a users profile picture until after a match, but that failed really quickly. People truly are superficial.\n8. Contrary to many users on this thread, we were a large dating app and we didn't actually create any fake accounts. We were certainly proud of that. That being said, there are some that do it, and it's relatively obvious when they do. The profile is usually a very attractive person, somebody who.... probably has no need for dating apps, and it's usually shown very early in the queue, and the photos tend to be of \"instagram influencer\" level quality. That's the biggest giveaway. \n\nI can likely answer questions too provided they are general enough.",

            "This is my favorite bit from my time working at PeopleMedia, which is part of Match several years back as a software engineer.\n\nOne day while deep in the depths of code related to our spam filters (I forget what I was in there for) I stumbled across a curious code statement. It was like \n\n\"if (userId == xxxxx) return;\"\n\nWhich is a very curious thing to see. It basically said that if the user was a certain person, don't filter them as a spam profile.\n\nImmediately I laughed and was like \"uh... What in the actual &@$# is this?\"\n\nA few veterans explained that there was a guy who sent out messages at such high volume that he would constantly trigger the spam filters (which if you've ever been on a dating site is actually a kind of hard thing to do). And that he'd called up to complain multiple times, and they'd investigated his messaging and that not only was he messaging this many people, but that he wasn't even copy/pasting his messages. Dude just really liked to reach out to women. Nothing inappropriate, just a true volume shooter. \n\nSo eventually someone just broke down and added a back door for him specifically to the spam filter.\n\nIt blew my mind that a single user had their own piece of code specifically to make their profile work in our code. Think millions of users across multiple sites, and this guy specifically had a little piece of it all to his own. That an engineer had taken time to write, and QA to test, and Devops to deploy. That alone had to easily offset any amount of money he'd paid over the years. But there it was.",

We did whatever we could to make it more appealing to women, still the difference in male to female messages - vs. the other way around - was just mind-blowing. Like 1:1000 or so.\n\nI was actually active as a user on that platform too. If I ever received a message from a woman, I basically went and deleted that user. It was always a sex worker. Always.\n\nOh and I should add, the partner matching algorithm was completely honest and real. (I know it cause I coded it.) There was absolutely zero trickery on that site.

Oh and one serious relationship, so there's that.\n\nBy contrast, a female friend of mine is currently on one app. She has many dates alright, but they tend to turn out creeps or uninteresting.

Thank FUCK my Facebook profile photo was a very lovey-dovey couples pic of the two of us so that was what Tinder used - my partner knew me well and that I detested cheaters so he trusted me fully. He also knew I wasn't stupid enough to use a couples photo of us as my only Tinder pic, and that I would never have an empty bio. I also never put my job info on my Facebook so thankfully Tinder had left that blank. So when my then-partner tipped me off about this fucked up thing Tinder had done I was proper horrified because it turned out all my work clients and friends and whoever else that had been on Tinder must have come across that profile and assumed I was some shameless cheater.\n\nI wanted to make sure it wasn't a fake profile someone else was controlling so I redownloaded Tinder in front of my partner and logged in - to discover I was logging in to the exact almost-empty profile his friend had described.\n\nIt turns out Tinder does that to anyone who forgot to restrict third party app access on Facebook. At the time that was a very buried Facebook setting you needed to be on desktop to deactivate.\n\nI went online and tried to post in a few places to warn people (I'm really big on online privacy) but I just got called a cheater who was trying to cover her tracks. No one believed me at all. I just got heaps of shit for it even though my partner was 100% on my side and I just wanted to try and help.\n\nI ended up deleting those posts because nobody believed me and I deeply regret that - can you imagine if someone in an abusive relationship had that happen to them?? I should have left the posts up so that could have googled and found it. My partner (we broke up years later but we remain friends) was a good man and he knew me inside out and that I would never cheat nor do it in such a ridiculous and counterproductive way. But if I'd been trapped in a relationship with someone controlling and abusive... No fucking way would they have ever believed this story because let's be honest it sounds pretty far fetched. Tinder automatically creating an account and making it public without ever warning the user... No one would believe them. This all took place back in 2015 and at the time I found two other forum posts discussing other people's trouble with it happening to them so I'm not sure if it's been changed in the last five years or not but still....\n\nRESTRICT THIRD PARTY ACCESS IN YOUR FACEBOOK SETTINGS, PEOPLE.\n\nEdit: I'm really fucking over the messages I've been getting from incels accusing me of lying or making up fake information about Tinder deactivating any profile that isn't active for a week. First, that's complete bullshit because I've had times where I hadn't logged in for over a month but everything was still the same. Second, I have no reason to lie about something this old using such a crazy sounding tale. Third, there's plenty of other Redditors responding with their own stories of it happening to them. Fuck off and stop being so nasty over someone who is just trying to help others and spread the word of yet ANOTHER app that is violating your privacy without many people knowing.",

            "I haven't worked in a dating company but I do run a secret geek dating group, and here are a few \"fun\" things I learned:\n\n1. Men create much more dating posts, about 7-8 to 1 women, but women may get up to 10 times the amount of engagement (men get 20 likes at best, while women get between 50 to 250 likes)\n\n2. Geek men would usually stick to one, odd tactic time after time, because it worked once or twice (I.E. they will keep mentioning their weird collection or trait, and try to boast an odd, or boastful detail).\n\n3. Geek women are more open to polyamorous relationships and open relationships (1 out of 5 women).\n\n4. Most guys would define themselves as Gamers, Movie-fanatics, Anime-fans or Tabletop lovers, while Women would usually talk of their love of litrature, movies, and sometimes, yet much less often, video games, manga, anime and comics.\n\n5. Bans occur maybe twice in a span of 3 months, and the ratio is 4 guys to 1 woman, usually due to creepy comments, harassment and/or just plain being an assholes/dick to admins and or group members.",
            "I worked for Successful Singles in 2001. It was a dating agency. We cold called customers to get them to spend $3000 to be \u201cprofessionally matched\u201d. We would get some $$ if they showed up; we got more if they spent $ on the service. They claimed to have a \u201chighly technological matching computer \u201c. This was actually two high school girls in a room with two filing cabinets, one labeled male, one female. All leads came from a fake profile on match that said \u201csend me your phone number so we can talk\u201d. \n\nI personally shut the place down after I was fired unlawfully. Called Fox 25 news undercover and Mike Bodet came out with a camera in a purse. Place closed two days after the report.",
            "I worked as a software engineer for a dating site in the mid-2000s. Literally every single female profile was fake, they were \u201cgenerated\u201d profiles using arbitrary data and paid-for lewd photos from various sources.\n\nThe sites we ran targeted guys paying for the site. Meanwhile if you signed up as a female, the site would be free \u2014 simply because the ratio guys to real-girls was so huge.\n\nThe fake female profiles would also message newly signed-up guys profiles almost straight away, giving the guys a confidence boost. They\u2019d often message straight back, then after a few messages (which purposely got more \u201cheated\u201d, over a few different profiles), the guys\u2019 account would get a notification saying to pay to send more messages.\n\nIf the guys\u2019 profile didn\u2019t pay, the site would continue to send messages from different fake profiles, all of which were behind a pay-wall in order to see more photos or reply at all.\n\nThe refund policy was super short, so if & by the time the guys\u2019 profile realised he was just chatting to AI profiles, he\u2019d request a refund, but often denied due to refund policy being short that he \u201cagreed to\u201d at sign-up.\n\nBy the time a given \u201csite\u201d was commonly known as being a scam, we\u2019d spin up another site, different name, logo & design and repeat the process. This went on for months/years with 100\u2019s of sites under various names.\n\nTL;DR it was toxic as hell, hated it. Glad I quit.",
            "As I\u2019m reading through these comments, I\u2019m interested to see the statistics / trends on LGBTQA geared dating apps where the specific  \u201cmale / female\u201d dynamics aren\u2019t always applicable to the situation.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of social culture that goes into \u201cgay dating\u201d as well, depending on what and who you identify with or are interested in",

            "I did a study on how dating app usage affects someone\u2019s narcissistic tendencies (whether adaptive or maladaptive). I found out that someone with a more pathological form of narcissism (maladaptive) is more socially and emotionally impaired when they aren\u2019t getting the results they desire. Since narcissism runs on a continuum from grandiose to vulnerable this shows how damaging this can be for anyone expressing these tendencies. \n\nMost people know about grandiose narcissism but many don\u2019t know about the other side of narcissism which is the vulnerable side. The best was I can describe these people are these are the ones who look for someone to idolize and will do ANYTHING for that person. Since they are looking to fulfill a sense of self they are missing they look to others for that purpose (hence the idolizing). Dating app usage is extremely dangerous for these people because they spend hours searching for someone and when they don\u2019t match with them it causes a narcissistic injury.",
            "I read a blog by a guy who used to work for OK Cupid. \n\nHe said the creepiest thing about it is every move you make on the site, every photo you click on, every message you send is logged.\n\nAlso, they keep track of of the accounts that receive the most attention, and use their images in their advertising and around the site. \n\nAll of this in an effort to commercialize and commodify our need for intimacy and human contact, and perpetuate and reinforce culturally imposed standards of beauty. \n\nIf that isn't creepy I don't know what is."

            "Him and a kid I\u2019ve known since about 1st grade drove about 8-9 hours to visit a friend who had moved away at the time and was feeling depressed. They were going to surprise him and he called saying he found a way to get a plane ticket back to them (where they all three were friends originally) while they were already 14hours deep in a road trip. So they turned around and when they were about 45 minutes from home, they got into a bad accident and he died on the scene. The kid I knew from 1st grade watched his best friend bleed out next to him upside down in his car. He had long hair and the paramedics thought he was a female upon arrival and 1st grade friend said he was desperately trying to tell them he was a boy and his name and to call his family to tell them what happened. He was pronounced dead before the ambulance even took off.\n\n1st grade friend came back to school after a little under 2 months with a 16 inch long and about one inch wide scar all the way up the back of his arm. They were in a band together and played in the schools band. Hallways were bleak for months, probably the rest of the year honestly. He sat with us at lunch and tried to be normal but we all knew he wasn\u2019t the same. They were good people, and even though only one of them died, it was like they both left that day because he was never the same. I don\u2019t even think he makes music anymore. I knew them both for almost 10 years when it happened and it was the first time somebody I knew that was my age had died and it was very sobering. You know nobodies immortal but you don\u2019t expect somebody to be ripped from existence so quickly.",

            "The captain of the football team underwent surgery his senior year. I was 13 on the middle school team. His younger brother and I were very close so I was around him a lot, I looked up to him like an older brother. He drove me to early practices, was very smart, dated a pretty cheerleader, not a mean bone in his body, he had it all. For a 13 year old, he was my hero.\n\nAfter his surgery he got hooked on painkillers. He went from painkillers to heroin. He was arrested multiple times for theft and drug possession. This went on for years, I would always ask my friend from middle school how he was doing. It never got better, he died last year. Drugs suck. I miss my hero.\n\nEdit: Typo. Also thank you for all your support on this comment. If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction to anything, please ask for help from someone. My PMs are always open as well.",

            "I don't know that his life really fell apart, because it turns out his home life was terrible all along, but it definitely shifted how people looked at him. And I went to a small school, so there weren't too many divisions between people (when you only have forty something kids in a grade, \"popular\" is kind of relative...)\n\nBut, a kid's mom decided to leave her husband, the kid's stepdad. The stepdad, who was known to faculty and was considered a \"good guy\", stopped by the school to deliver something to his stepson. Cool, cool, the secretary gave him a pass to drop it off at the stepson's class, rather than call him down to the office. The stepdad actually had a gun and had no idea where the stepson was during that period, so was roaming the halls. Luckily, a friend of the stepson (who knew what an abusive, dangerous guy the stepdad was) happened to be in the office and alerted everyone. We all went on lockdown, the police came, we were stuck for a couple of hours as they swept the school after arresting the guy. Then, it came out that the kid had been abused for the entire time his mom had been married to the guy, and she only was leaving him after he started hitting her...It was a whole thing, and while everyone had pretty much always liked the kid, he suddenly just had everyone feeling sorry for him. Teachers let him go back and redo assignments to boost his grade. People gave him stuff to \"start over.\" He just kind of got really closed off and stopped joking around and only hung out with like three people after that. He was known as \"the abused kid with a stepdad who was going to shoot up a school\" and that's hard to get over.",
            "He was an only child, and his dad had died when he was 2. Was really happy go lucky, and he was popular because he was outgoing, supportive, warm and kind to *everybody* without fail, and although he was friends with the kind of kids who bullied people, he was the first person to tell them to knock that shit off if he saw it.\n\nWhen we were 16, his mum, who was one of the nicest ladies I ever met in our small town, was crushed to death by a semi-trailer that drifted into her lane.\n\nHe dropped out of school, he stopped talking to anybody, and he refused to let anyone visit him. I have no idea what became of him. Sorry Jay. I hope your life got better.",

Anyways turned out one day his mom came home to him laying in the basement with a bullet wound in his head, I was told he used a shot gun to kill him self but loaded it bird shot, because of this he didnt die. I now see him walking around town and he cant speak anymore and walks as if he had a stroke, one side of his body doesn't work properly.\n\nReally sad and that's all I can think about anytime I drive around and see him walking. You never know what people actually feel inside, you might wish you could be someone else because everything seems so perfect but rarely is that ever the case.",

He was pretty athletic and was generally well liked. I didnt talk to him but the guy seemed decent. \n\nI guess he liked driving like an idiot, the year after he graduated he wrapped his car around a pole. They had to use the jaws of life to pull him out of his car but it was too late, hed died on impact. \n\nThere had been multiple reports that night of people calling the cops to complain about his reckless driving around town.  \n\nI just remember that chubby little boy I used to spend recess with everyday.",

            "Im not sure I would call him the popular kid, but in some circles he was.  He was a bit of an arrogant ass in my opinion but had money and liked to spread it around. His dad was a wealth manager.  Lots of friends/family/community members were clients.  A few years after high school it came out that dad had embezzled millions.  Their entire wealth was stolen from friends and family.  This rocked him hard.  Dad went to jail and he changed his name and totally became a different person.  I saw him after that and barely recognized him.  His personality and even his posture was different.  I felt really bad for him.  I ended up having a really good talk with him and I can only imagine what he has gone through.\n\nEdit: wow, lots of people have asked for details on location and was it so-and-so.

Everyone was freaked up but we had assumed they moved the assembly from the auditorium to the gym and wanted to be careful because the speaker was a high public figure in the area.\n\nAfter he spoke the principle told us we couldn't leave the gym and everyone was confused but didnt look too much into it. After an hour or so lunch had came and went and people started getting roudy so the principle told us we were going to be escorted to the elementary, intermediate, and middle school for lunch. This is when we started to panic and ask what was going on but no one would answer. Grade by grade we were escorted by at least a dozen officers across the school lots to each other school (all 4 schools were on the same property) given 20 mins to eat then promptly escorted back.\n\nAnother few hours had gone by and everyone was on edge but still no one would tell us what was going on. The principal had asked to see a handful of students then left us there again. We couldn't do anything but sit there, we couldn't leave the bleachers, if we had to use the bathroom we were escorted by an officer, we couldn't leave for the day, and no one was allowed on the property so we couldn't even leave with out parents.\n\nWell it was time for school to be over and they still wouldn't let us leave, at this point students were mad and upset. People had jobs to get to and siblings to pick up. A few students tried to leave but was immediately returned to the bleachers. One guy had to be escorted out and arrested because he tired to fight an officer for not letting him leave.\n\nFinally after seeing the students get riled up the principal told us what was going on. A student had left a bomb threat in the girls bathroom and there was a swat team and bomb squad searching every inch of the school building and we couldn't leave until it had been cleared and they found out who did it.\n\nThis sent the whole gym completely silent and everyone sat that way for a few moments. We were all terrified and just looking around. After about another hour the principal called a student down and took her out side where she was arrested. It was one of the \"popular\" girls and everyone was shocked. But they let us go home so we knew it was her. \n\nThe next morning we found out what happened, she had disliked the district attorney because he handled her family's case poorly. She had made a very poorly build explosive device with clay and bullets and hid it in her pack back and was going to set it off during the assembly. She was arrested and banned from all alabama public schools, from what I heard she is still in prison and will be for a long time.\n\nLook up Chilton county high school bomb threat and you can find some of the news articles. \n\nEdit: for everyone pointing out the two local news articles, no they are not accurate which can be seen since both are very very contradictory, as the police nor the school made a statement. We did not return to class that day but we did the next day, there was a \"bomb\" found but it was so poorly made they couldn't actually call it that considering it was basically clay and a few shot gun shells. It was handled very very badly by everyone especially the media.",

            "When I was in fifth grade, back in the 1960s, there was a kid in our class named Lawrence. He was the best student in our class (always finished math tests way before anyone else), and the best athlete (so, picked first for every team sport). One day, during class, a lady from the principal's office came in, whispered something to our teacher, and then the two of them escorted Lawrence out into the hallway. A few minutes later, our teacher returned and told us that Lawrence's father had been killed in Viet Nam when the helicopter he was in was shot down. Lawrence never returned our school.\n\nMy older brother was in Nam at that time (he made it back safe). That was the day the full reality of the war really hit me.",
            "Actually a little after high school. This kid was one of the most well-liked kids in school. Literally everyone loved him.

He took the next semester off from school to care for his dad. This kid also lost one of his best friends to addiction and a close family friend. Life just started to kick the shit out of him. He\u2019s still a great guy, but after experiencing something serious like that, it wears on a person. He\u2019s more quiet than he used to be, but still the same great guy.",

All the friends I had around me drifted away, I acted like a mess and everyone slowly distanced themselves from me. Dropped out of school, became known as the \"troubled drug kid\", didnt look towards college, got a job that gave me an excuse to live at home and have more drugs. Eventually I ended up having a heart attack in a Walgreens parking lot at 7am when I was 19. My entire family enabled me, or maybe I was just an amazing actor, idk.\n\nI started skating parking garages as my outlet. Dropped the drugs, got a helmet and some gloves, started entering races and events, and grew a new support group through time. Before I knew it I had real friends, not actors. I moved from the city a few years ago and now live in a tiny mountain town. The parking garages got upgraded to mountains, The air got cleaner, and most importantly I stopped smoking cigarettes 9 months ago.",

            "6'3 football player, drug dealer and general shit bag got arrested 2 weeks before going to college. His family was really poor, but he had a full ride, in spite of his obvious drug habits, selling to middle schoolers, and various other shitty extracurriculars. Somehow his record gets swept under the rug in time to still go, much like his highschool GPA. Half way through the first semester he gets shot in the gut at a drug deal that went wrong. He survived and last I heard he got picked up by another college. I've no idea how he graduated highschool, let alone how he got away with the rest of it. I guess in the south being good at football takes you most anywhere. Far as I know he hasn't fallen apart yet, but it seems to be only a matter of time.",

            "Went to a small school so we didn't really have \"popular\" cliques but there were a few who were well to do an involved in various aspects of the school. \n\nI remember being a very depressed and gothy sophomore and this one junior gal from aforementioned group tried her darndest to cheer me up, to the point of making it her goal to make me smile.\nShe seemed to have a lot set for her, getting good grades, being in a lot of sports and clubs, and TA'ing for teachers. \n\nAnd she trusted her boyfriend too much.\n\nThis was around the time cellphones were transitioning from foldables to being smart. The novelty of taking pictures with phones was taken for granted. The ability to send pictures to others even more so.\n\nYoung love being what it is leads teens to do stupid things. Like sending nude pictures. She did to her boyfriend.\n\nAnd the male teen brain on testosterone does even more stupid stuff. Like spreading around said picture to his buddies.\n\nAnd pretty soon the whole school knew what she did.\n\nShe basically had to drop out and and finish the rest of her high school experience from her house.\nDon't know what happened to her after that.",
            "It was actually me. My dad got arrested and everything went downhill. I would burst into tears in class, have anxiety attacks, etc. My 'popular' friends basically told me to fuck off because of it. Not a fun time.",
            "A girl I knew in 3rd grade became very, VERY popular over one summer. She was always \"goth\" (or \"punk\" in her younger days). \n\nShe was a teacher's daughter, and pretty well-known for her rebellious nature. She hung out with kids much older than her, maybe into their later teens or early twenties.\n\nOne night (we were in 5th grade at that point), her friends and her got drunk at a pier. They decided to rob this one house (maybe house boat? It's been so long). The older kids ended up realizing they were leaving too much evidence, and decided to torch the place. Only issue was, there was an elderly woman in the home who didn't hear anyone. They didn't know she was there until they lit her room on fire.\n\nThat girl stayed to help, and when authorities arrived she was the only person besides the victim to stay behind. She took all responsibility and gave nobody's name. She was given house arrest and probation, the woman in the fire ended up surviving for a little while, but died shortly after (iirc). Every family heirloom had been either destroyed in the fire, or was stolen beforehand. Her daughters came into the media shortly after to announce that over 200 years of memorabilia had been lost forever, as the elderly woman was the matriarch of the household.\n\nHer parents weren't necessarily rich, they went into a depression as a household (due to lawyers fees, disgrace from the community, etc) and didnt seem as though they would recover. Even in lawyers fees alone, I'm pretty sure they went bankrupt.\n\nThe dad mentioned (months later) they should go do something as a family. Hunting season was only a couple weeks away, so why not? He went to the local gun outlet and left the older sister and her alone.\n\nWhen they came back, they found that she had shot herself. The circumstances were so odd, she had used a shotgun she couldn't reach the trigger of (yet they didn't find the powdered residue you would find if the barrel tip were pressed to the impact point), and it was propped up against the door as though to prevent someone coming in. Her bedroom window was open, no note, and there was music playing on repeat from her stereo that she \"wouldnt be caught dead\" listening to. The sister thought she heard frustrated yelling from the room, but assumed her little sis was just venting out like she usually did.\n\nThe older sis had to be removed from the viewing room from what I heard. She sat beside her sister and meticulously repainted her nails, because \"******* did every week, but she cant now. I should help her\".",
            "Not me-but my niece. Sex-trafficing...\n\nPopularity usually comes from beauty and she was and still is no exception. Head cheerleader, gymnast, singer, song-writer, and social media star.\n\nMy sister- who is also stunning- had a troubled life. She ended up pregnant at 13 and by the time she was 23 had 4 kids, one abusive husband, and a healthy drug addiction, which landed her in jail for 5 years.\n\nWhile in jail the kids were living with their father who was also a pill head/drunk.\n\nHis dealer started living with them when my neice was around 13. A gorgeous girl and two grown men who obviously can't make good decisions don't go well together. \n\nShe was raped repeatedly for the next 3 years. She did not get to choose her first time and her only means of coping with all this were drinking heavily and running around town with the wrong people. During a binge she only remembers the parts where young girls and women were coming over odd hours through the night and constantly being moved around. She did not understand this at all nor what was really happening. Well the dealer turned out to be a bigger ass-hat and decided to dip his toe into sex-trafficing.\n\nAss-hat eventually decided my niece needed to be moved so she could start \"working\". And her dad decided she would be one less mouth to feed. She started to get swept up into it and was supposed to be sent Ohio that weekend. Overhearing their conversation- she ended up telling a teacher at school. They went to the authorities they blew the case apart- arrested both dad and ass-hat. \n\nNeedless to say- my niece is beyond scarred. After testifying in open court, she turned to alcohol once more. Now she is a functioning alcoholic and has alienated thousands of friends and followers and has avoided all contact from her family. I miss her terribly and wish I knew where she was. \n\nI was raised with a different father than my sister and got married after college to a US Marine. So I no idea this was going on. Knowing I could have stopped all of this literally makes me sick and keeps me up at night.",

            "The pretty cheerleader and good looking quarterback were a couple and super popular.  Before the end of the junior year, cheerleader finds out she is pregnant.  Rumors and all sorts of things went around.  I know both had their sights set on big colleges but last I saw they didn't really leave the county.  The rumors were just that.  They decided to settle down and raise the kid while taking community college courses.\n\nApparently, Mr. Quarterback would go on party trips every now and then and maybe have gotten some random chick pregnant.  Their marriage fell apart after the guy was found passed out drunk on someone's lawn.  The mom and kids (they had more) moved out of state.  Last I heard, he spent time in jail and is on marriage #4.\n\nAnother one was a smart popular guy.  He joked a lot, teachers liked him, and basically got along well with everyone.  He also had an older brother who was popular and good looking.  After we returned for our senior year, we hear his older brother was stabbed and sent to jail for possession.  He starts showing up to.school wearing gang colors, cursing, questioning everything, and tanking his honors classes.  Needless to say, almost everyone was put off by him.  I saw him working at a Home Depot about 10 years ago but he didn't recognize me.",

            "When she was killed on the school bus by another girl with a box cutter. \n\nETA: Denise was a lovely girl. Smart, funny. Sat next to her in English for 2 years. The girl who killed her was 2 years younger and thought Denise was \u201cafter her man\u201d. Denise bled out from a slashed throat in a matter of minutes, about a mile from my house. I heard the sirens that day. A few years later, I saw her mother out in town. When I told her I had known her daughter, and how highly I thought of her, she fell weeping into my arms. Such a waste. Still makes me angry.",
            "Worked in student housing at my university, lots of popular kids, especially girls who were popular for nothing more than being attractive in their tinny pond, usually had a hard time the first couple of weeks as they realized that they weren't all that special.

One day dude got pressured into drinking alcohol and was caught by his family. Following day he shot himself in his room out of guilt, as said in his suicide note. I had a friend who attended the same church as that kid and supposedly the church used his death as an example of what happens when you sin, and that there was no other option than the guy deserving to die. A bunch of my friends refused to go to church after that. The Mormon church is wacky.",

            "Oh boy this is actually pretty sad. In college there was a girl in my dorm building who was pretty, popular, rich, etc. but also pretty mean to me and some other people. She actually called me ugly to my face for telling her to pick up a mess she made from spilling a drink in MY dorm. Anyways. She went on spring break in Minnesota and was behind a speed boat when the driver turned on the boat!! She got caught in the propeller and her legs were chopped off. She dropped out of college and deleted all social media. No one ever heard from her or about her again. I believe she recovered from articles I found online. But still can\u2019t imagine how much her life flipped upside down from that.",
            "She was not the bitchy popular girl. Rather, she was nice, talented, and quirky. I think that's why people liked her and she became popular. But, since last year, she started dating this fuckboy and her attitude changed so much and a lot of people lost respect in her.",

Then they ended up having to be life flighted to the hospital.\n\nWe kind of assumed he'd get kicked out and she wouldn't. (Private school) But to our surprise, they both got kicked out.

Apparently he smoke a joint laced with PCP and it fried his brain.\n\nI met him a few years later when I was working the night shift at a suburban Bay Area 7-Eleven.  He was the guy that would be standing out in front of the store at 2:00 in the morning talking to himself.  I later heard he had fallen off an overpass.",
            "He didn't own a phone but he was popular with people. I guess he wanted to fit in even more, so he took his moms phone and she came in during the middle of class and called him out.

I have no place being super close friends with the captain of our football team and the dude like every girl in our school wants to bang, but I just am.  \n  \nSophomore year his father just walked out.

His sister is incredibly emotionally abusive and his mother, though she is kind, does not understand him at all and keeps pushing him to play football even though he doesn\u2019t want to. He signed to play football at Trinity and immediately afterwards told me it was the worst mistake of his life.  \n  \nI think I\u2019m the only person he knows who actually pays attention to what he says. I helped him out of an incredibly toxic relationship which he thought was normal, as in he\u2019d tell me things like \u201cyeah I\u2019ve tried breaking up with her twice but she won\u2019t let me\u201d like that was just how relationships worked. He had a total emotional breakdown one night when these middle schoolers were making Instagram posts about him, basically cyberbullying him because to them he\u2019s some monolithic high school Chad.  \n  \nHe told me he wanted to kill himself that night, and I obviously freaked out over it which I don\u2019t think he understood. He didn\u2019t understand why anybody would be worried that he\u2019d want to kill himself. He\u2019s told me multiple times now that he feels like a stranger wherever he is.  \n  \nI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do without me. I know that sounds conceited but... he\u2019s going away, he hates football, he hates the college he\u2019s going to, he hates his family, and he hates his major.

            "A guy in my fraternity in college (which was the least fratty frat in a non-fratty school, we didn\u2019t even have frat houses) was the frattiest guy in the frat. Such a douchebag. When I was a pledge we had to get every brother\u2019s signature to get in. Some just gave them out, some wanted to at least sit down and get to know you before giving you their stamp of approval, and some made you earn it by showing you cared and were responsible, etc. This guy was the only one who would only give his signature if you got him a drink or a joint. I didn\u2019t drink or do drugs and I\u2019m not a drug and alcohol delivery service so I refused and never got his signature. During the initiation ceremony he poured bong water in my mouth when I was blindfolded. I still got in and found out later they needed at least a 10% vote to blackball a pledge and he was the only holdout but he was just such a douche. \n\nSo after college he goes to medical school and becomes a doctor. Turns out he was selling fentanyl. Some guy OD\u2019d and they caught him on security cameras selling it to him. He also texted the guy\u2019s girlfriend to apologize and explain that he wasn\u2019t supposed to do it all at once. That was enough to lock him up in federal prison for a long time. Fuckin douche."

Looked like Django. It went from students laughing to complete silence and then crying.",
            "I once had a student show up late every day for class in 1st period. I asked him after class that his tardiness is becoming as issue. He said he is doing the best he can, he has to help raise his younger siblings. He says his dad was an alcoholic and his mom lives in another state. \n\nHe said he has to help his 3 younger siblings go to school and drop them off because his father is usually passed out drunk.",
            "One of my best students in one class showed up late after I had a slew of students rolling in late and I had said there would be consequences for the next ones. \n\nI walked over to talk to him and he almost started crying, so we stepped outside and I angled him away from the class and asked what was up.\n\nTurns out he had been kicked out of the house, living in his car, his phone had died and that was his alarm. And he felt terrible about being late. I told him that I was so proud of him for making it into class, and I was going to make angry faces and make it look like I was mad so the class didn\u2019t think I was going back on my word, but that he was awesome and could take a few minutes to collect himself and join us when he was ready. I think I even waved my arms in the air a bit to ham it up. \n\nThat dude aced my class. He was amazing.",
            "I had a student not come to school for 2 weeks- when he finally showed he was limping and his foot was wrapped up in a large dirty ace bandage. I called him to my office after school that day to check in on him.\n\nHe told me that he had been in the river fishing for his dinner 2 weeks ago and slipped on a rock. He cut his foot so badly that he couldn\u2019t walk until today to make it to school. I asked about going to the doctor but he hadn\u2019t seen his parents in so long that he didn\u2019t know how to get to them for help getting to the hospital.\nI Called CPS, got him help (as much as they could offer). We found out he was living in a tent bc the house had been foreclosed on when his parents disappeared. \n\nA bunch of teachers chipped in and got him groceries, clothes and started driving him places after that. Today (over 2 years later) he\u2019s working a job and one of our teachers still clothes and feeds him. The student is too prideful to live with anyone and kind of couch hops now.

Turns out, the day before he went home and his foster parents had decided they no longer want him so he went into the care of social services. Everything about this child went downhill from there. \n\nI was also in an interview with a mother and her son and she straight up tells us  that she\u2019s not too concerned about her son as he\u2019s not her favourite child.

Unfortunately due to the disease, her eyesight was now deteriorating, and she knew she would eventually go blind.\n\nShe cried in my office that she would miss her books, and didn't want to be alone in the dark.   I couldn't help crying with her.   She transitioned to audio books on her iPod (this was roughly 14 years ago, a time when middle schoolers didn't have smartphones).\n\nA year later she passed away.  My hope is she's at peace, reading all the books she wants, with other friends she's met.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the awards and comments.

His mother had a lot of problems and all his siblings were in the same situation, so everyday the most important thing for him was to eat (obviously).\n\nThe teenager apparently had food, but there was a history of violence in his family and he had already committed crimes and he probably felt empowered by it, because he apparently felt bad and stupid in other activities. \n\nI wasn't the regular teacher, I was part of a NGO that offered specific attention to students that were behind the others, so everyday I would go to their regular class and pick 6-10 of them to have special classes, so at the beginning they felt really bad and other students were calling them stupid.\n\nAt the end of the program many students wanted to join us and our students felt much more confident in general, so it was great, but obviously we didn't solve the hunger problem and this teenager wasn't convinced that he had a future out of crime...",

            "Taught summer workshops for teens for a few years, these workshops were based on electives and were rather pricey for students to attend. In complete honesty it was really just bougie summer daycare and I always felt bad for the teens because admin were super neurotic about the \"education\" so the curriculum was boring as fuck. They're kids, they want to spend their summers having fun, but rich helicopter parents expect differently.\n\nOne year I had this absolute monster of a kid - he was 13, rowdy, inappropriate, didn't do any work, constantly throwing things around, etc. Admin tried to boot him but his grandma had *begged* us to keep him on board. Since they were paying good money, admin agreed under the terms that we just \"leave him alone\". I didn't agree with that at all, no kid should just be ignored, so I didn't. \n\nI would always try to encourage the kid's weird jokes and interests and would take him on a walk around the school grounds every day. I always gave back as good as I got with the sass, and he got a kick out of it. We explored weird classrooms and kicked around rocks and joked about whatever YouTube videos he was into. We got to talking and he started to trust me and he told me about his life.\n\nHis parents both worked in the airline industry and as a result they were filthy rich with homes all over North America, but they were never home. During the school year he was mostly alone with them popping in here and there, and in the summers they would fly him to his grandma who lives in our dinky city, and she would care for him for the summers before he would get flown out to wherever-the-fuck his parents were staying for a couple days to pretend they were a loving family. Then the cycle would repeat.\n\nHe was so aggressively lonely, didn't believe anyone cared about him, and was constantly acting out. He would skateboard all over the surrounding cities - for a couple of summers I would run into him in the most weird places and weird times. Think outside shitty bars on late Saturday nights, randomly in the huge metro city in the middle of the week, driving by him skateboarding on the side of the highway, etc. He had no one looking after him and no concern for his own wellbeing and safety.\n\nThe absolute lack of care or concern for him was heartbreaking, and I tried to do what I could, but ultimately his parents didn't actually break any laws based on his home state rules and regulations and his parents are, again, filthy rich. He was \"well provided for\" and how nice was it that they sent him to this expensive summer workshop! I still think about him now and then, even though it's been years. I hope he's okay.",
            "My mom taught in a very low income school and every year would go to the dollar store and pick up Christmas presents for all of her students. She knew that many of them didn't get any other gifts for the holiday.\n\nShe also had stories about how they needed to be careful when constructing standardized tests because there were students who might answer a question like \"what do you do when you're hungry\" with \"go to bed\" or similar things.",
            "I had a 10 year old crying and wishing she was dead. Her older brothers at home were being awful to her, bullying and hitting her. She was saying I should just let her go so she could kill herself and then she wouldn't be a bother to us or her brothers anymore. \n\nSat her down with the teacher, a cup of tea, some cookies and talked with her throughout the afternoon. Not much we could do about the brothers, but she left with a smile and came back at school the next day with a smile as well. \nNow I'm just keeping my eye on her in case things go bad again, but so far so good. Apparently talking to us encouraged her to tell her mother about everything that happened, so at least someone at home also kept an eye out for her.",

Have another student (who also has a brother in another class in the same situation) who comes to school with pants so tight its like the old Victorian era women needing their maids to put a boot in their back to get their corset closed.\n\nFirst day we comment to mom.. but eventually we\u2019re like \u201cok they broke af were just going to leave the button undone and it\u2019s not too bad.\n\nWell one day brother eats poop. Literally reaches into his pull-up (they are 8 & 10 btw) and grabs some and chomps down while walking at recess. Happened too fast for us to grab him. So we are pretty alarmed and call mom. Response? \u201cI told y\u2019all to keep his pants buttoned\u201d\n\nThis woman puts pants on them so small that some of the paras physically do not have the strength to button them instead of taking the time to teach her kids a damn thing (they also don\u2019t know how to feed themselves.. to be clear one of them is doing math.. they aren\u2019t low functioning enough for these skills to not exist)\n\nNeither of them are capable of responding to a verbal question in any way either. Like the one brother can point to an answer or point to what he wants.. but neither of them can speak and neither of the mmmm know how to shake their head, thumbs up/down, ANYTHING.\n\nThe sad truth in this demographic is that their disability is rarely what holds them back. It\u2019s the parents.\n\nBoth sets of brothers I spoke about here would likely be in resource classrooms if their parents were worth a damn.

In reality, sometimes she was too high to hold a pen and could barely scratch her name for me. \n\nAnyway, by the end of the school year it was very obvious to all my teachers that my mother had a drug problem.

Anyways, one day, a student brings in her favorite doll. This leads all the girls to start talking about their favorite dolls. One student, privately tells me that she never had a doll before. This made sense because the child was homeless, wore the same dirty outfit nearly every day, often stole from teachers and classmates because she became adapted to survival of the fittest mode, and her parents were out of the picture. \n\nThat night I went to Toys R Us right after school. The next week I made sure this girl won a prize and stocked my treasure chest with a brand new Teacher and student Barbie set. Well, this child picked the Barbie right away. The most touching part about this story was when she asked if she could \u201cShow and Tell\u201d her new Barbie. I said \u201csure.\u201d  At the beginning of her \u201cShow and Tell\u201d she introduced the student Barbie as her name and the teacher Barbie as being my name. I was so touched.",

He basically told the class that there\u2019s atleast 5 kids in our class living in poverty and probably more dealing with some kind of awful circumstance. He said that each of our lives is more important then anything he needs to teach from the social studies textbook and doesn\u2019t want to see any more kids flunk classes because \u201cyour too busy watching your mom making sure she doesn\u2019t overdose or going to work after school because your family can\u2019t pay the bills\u201d.

Most do 3-4 hours of homework a night and have classes Saturday and Sunday.\n\nOne boy is 11 years old. When I ask what he does for fun, his only response is homework. He doesn't play video games or watch TV or movies. His parents force him to study and read all day, every day. \n\nThe only time he plays with other children is when they eat lunch or have PE class. I have some other students like this, but they live at home.\n\nSome of my kids are taught that the cinema is a waste of time, video games and cartoons are bad and they need to study all weekend to get into a good university.\n\nThe children can be like zombies.

            "I had a girl miss several lessons last term. I was concerned about her progress in class and followed up on the absences. Next time I saw her, we had a wee chat and she said she was really struggling with home stuff. The following day, she appeared very early with a letter and asked me to read it after she left. \n\nThe letter stated that she was unable to tell her story out loud but she wanted me to know. Her story detailed a difficult home situation. I have redacted the details out of respect for the pupil as I had no idea this would become so popular and well-read.\n\nIt completely floored me. I had lessons starting in 15 minutes, but I couldn\u2019t stop crying. It felt awful that this strong, silent young girl could brave coming to class with the weight of this on her shoulders. \n\nSo we worked out how to make school feel safer for her. She struggles to be around lots of people and near doorways without a trusted adult nearby. She\u2019s terrified that he appears in school to take her. \n\nSo we spend our break and lunch in my class, playing games and watching silly videos on YouTube. If she has a bad day, I\u2019ll walk her to her bus. I make sure she\u2019s seated away from the door and nearby a friend or my desk. It\u2019s not much but every little bit helps her feel safer.\n\nEDIT: \nThank you so much for your kinds words! A few commenters were concerned regarding her safety. To clarify, safeguarding pupils is a massive part of my job. The correct agencies were informed and she is currently getting counselling sessions to work through her situation. The police are informed and the entire school is doing the best it can to protect her. \nHope you all have a lovely Halloween!",

They ask for candy. I always carry caramels in my purse because these are safe candies and the kids love them and know I have them.

            "I had a student who would not acknowledge my presence at all. He was absolutely silent, so I guess what depressed me was his lack of engagement\u2014until I found out why.\n\nI had a boy in my English 10 Honors (sophomore level) class several years ago. He was quiet and chose to sit with his back to me every single day. I tried to get him to talk to me a few times, but he was so shy and withdrawn I stopped because I didn\u2019t want to make him feel more awkward and uncomfortable than he obviously already did. He was a middle-of-the-road student: when he turned in homework it was often half done. His classwork was sloppy and I usually sensed he wasn\u2019t paying attention at all. That year, I had a rough group of classes: student fights breaking out, a girl was beaten up by her boyfriend and almost killed, a very tall male student threatened me\u2014and my admin wasn\u2019t very supportive\u2014so I was hanging on by the skin of my teeth. I allowed the young man to sit quietly in the back of the class because he wasn\u2019t causing any problems.\n\nWhen we got to the essay unit, I was completely gobsmacked by his paper. It was the most well-written and analytical essay I had seen in a long time. I wrote him some sort of encouraging comment and started to pay closer attention to him in a very low-key way. Well, fast-forward his junior year, I asked if he would join the school newspaper (I was the advisor). He did and over the course of the next two years, I watched him change and develop into a leader in the class: he came out of his shell and got really involved in the paper\u2014learning how to program and do layouts, etc. When he graduated, he wrote in my yearbook how when he was a sophomore he was being jumped into a gang and it was my encouragement that gave him the courage to get out of that lifestyle. He joined the Navy and is currently in the Ph.D. program at Duke University. I still talk to him once in a while and he's doing amazing: married and happy.",

When were they born? Do you have any pets? When did they join your family? Have you ever moved house?'\n\nAll very valid questions if you ask me, and at the end I would ask kids if they'd like to share anything from their timeline to which I would make a jokey comment to make things fun!\n\n'Yes Laibah? _\"I broke my leg when I was 4\"_ Oh really??

He asked if I had any problems at home, so I told him how messed up my life was. \n\nI told him that my dad is an alcoholic, that he beats the shit out of me once in awhile and screams all day and tells me stuff like \"you'll never be good enough\" or \"your life will always be useless and a waste of my time and money\". He also used to hit my mom and my little sister and he's a pretty narcissistic person.\n\nLuckily I didn't talk to my dad for the last two years and we pretty much ignore eachother.\n\nMy teacher helped me a lot back then, he insisted to talk to me every week just to check if I'm okay. He helped me to get the youth welfare office (?) and the police involved so someone could keep an eye on my dad. \n\nSince then, he didn't hit me and my mom once, he doesn't talk to me at all, and I also started therapy which really helps coping with his bs.

One, this was twenty years ago, and I feel bad about it, that's why I wrote about it. I learned from it and was hoping to share. Two, I shouldn't have said \"gave her a hard time\" because I think that gave people the impression that I was mean. I wasn't.

His mum was drinking herself in to a comba to cope and the kid had turned to selling drugs to afford food. But hadnt done well that week so and Jo money for food. Luckily CPS got involved to help the poor kid.  \n  \nEdit: To add aomeore context now I have a little time. The kid doing this was a good kid, wanted to be a doctor. He got involved with selling drugs as on his estate there were always some \"lads\" hanging around. They knew that his dad had left and that his mum was drinking herself to an early grave. He said they \"took pity on my and bought me food\". Unfortunately, he didn't know this is a tactic gangs use to get you in. About a week or so after it started they started asking favours for the food \"take this parcel here\" \"hold this parcel for us, don't let anyone know about it\" etc. Until eventually he was stood on the street corner selling drugs.  \n  \nEdit 2: I didn't expect this many people to see this, most my posts get buried so I wanted to ask this of people. If you live in an area and you see any signs of a kid being abused/ neglected (scruffy uniform, bruises, flinching if people move near to them or witness it first hand) please report it to the school. Even if you don't know their name, give a description, as best as you can. We may not see it in the school, they may be hiding it too well. If you help report it, we can help protect the kids.

I\u2019d love to take this moment to add a little more: this child is one of unfortunately MANY who have shared similar traumas and experiences. My children(students) have been raped, molested, sold for sex, beaten, neglected, sold for drugs and more. I choose to work in high needs/low income schools because those kids need us the most. And they need your vote. When you vote, please look at the education views of each candidate. Our children are suffering in this country, and our educational system is very poor. Leaking ceilings, rats, chairs that break when you sit in them, etc. and standardized testing is the worst. Schools that do well get funds. Schools that don\u2019t get closed down. But when schools are trying to teach children with that type of trauma and coming from homes that are hurting, there\u2019s no way to catch up. \n\nThese kids who suffer so much deserve so much more. And I am one of many teachers who are there for them. We listen. We take on the weight of their pain. We truly love them. We are the teachers you wish you would have had, but most of us leave the profession before you\u2019d get that chance. \n\nSo please vote with your heart and with good knowledge on each candidate. There\u2019s many votes you\u2019ll be casting, and a straight ticket might eliminate a really good candidate for your local schools. \n\nAnd if you can, consider volunteering at your local school (post-covid). Kids need people who care. They need adults who can show them the world isn\u2019t as dark as it looks to them. Or donate some supplies at any time during the year. They\u2019re sorely needed. It\u2019s true about us paying out of pocket. And it\u2019s true that we don\u2019t make nearly enough money to justify doing that. \n\nThe world is kinda dark, but the kids I\u2019ve had the honor of teaching are the light. They truly are better than all of us.",

He had an aunt that was trying to figure out if she wanted to take him after grandpa passed, or if he was going into foster care with a stranger.

The kid didn\u2019t sleep after that.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think this would blow up. But I wanted to clarify, the parents didn\u2019t qualify for food stamps or any help because they made too much money. At least it looked like they did on paper but really they didn\u2019t. I lived in the Bay Area  at the time and even though they made a lot, most the money went to rent it living expenses. They also generally seemed to make bad choices, not judging them but it seemed kids came last often.\nI think one thing that came from the pandemic that is good is the free food that many schools are handing out. It\u2019s wonderful to see. In the past our district would still offer meals in the summer to any kid under 18 who showed up to summer school even if not attending.\n\nContinued: someone mentioned these parents should be judged. I agree they sound horrible. But one thing I keep in mind when working with kids is trauma is multi generational. We don\u2019t know what impacted these  parents to behave this way. \nPersonally, my mother grew up very poor and in abusive home. Her parents had gone through the Holocaust and it really impacted them. They didn\u2019t know how to be parents and struggled with mental health issues in a time that didn\u2019t  really provide support/ had negative stigma of mental health. So this trauma was passed on to my mom. My mom was a good mom but wasn\u2019t always there for us emotionally because of her own attachment style she developed from her parents. So the trauma was passed on to us. \nNow that I am a parent I have to work super hard not to pass on the negative things I learned from my parents but changing behavior can be hard. \nI am not making an excuse for this kids parents. Something I learned while studying psychology ( my BA is psychology) is trauma passes through generations. \nI had a teacher once say something I always keep in mind when working with students: kids can impact and change parents behavior. Parents behavior and personality can change because of the child as well. Not saying this kid lead the parents to drink but rather having a kid who has special needs, doesn\u2019t bond with you the way you wanted  or doesn\u2019t behave how you expected them to can really impact you as a person.\n\nEdit 2: yes I reported these parents. I called cps on them several times. I reported this to school admin, I talked to the school psych about this, I gently talked to the parents about this as well. Judging a parent isn\u2019t helpful, but helping and educating a parent is what is needed. If the system fails we can only do so much. So if it takes spending $6 bucks on a bag of pancake mix every month I can do that. Sometimes we have to have short term goals to meet before we can fix the long term ones. So if just giving the kid food when hungry helps I will do it while we work on fixing the bigger issue. \nWhen I started to feed the kids breakfast I partly did it with this one kid in mind but I realized it wasn\u2019t just this kid who came to school hungry. Teens have sleeping issues and sometimes they don\u2019t get up early enough for breakfast. Some people can\u2019t sleep till 3 am, some kids have horrible anxiety and they are up all night and can\u2019t sleep, heck I bet a lot of those kids I worked with where simply not morning people and getting up to go to school sucked for them. I saw kids who came from good homes come to school hungry because something other than neglect caused it (though in this case it was neglect don\u2019t get me wrong). \nAll I am saying is we can\u2019t judge a parent, we sometimes have to find a fast solution while fixing the bigger picture.",

Given their lives though, school was the least of their worries and their one safe place. \n\nIt's been 20 years since I left that job. \nI have looked up a few kids on social media and am AMAZED at how resilient they have been. \n\nSo many were in awful situations and now have degrees and are excelling in life. \n\nIt makes me so happy. \n\nThere is one little girl, a 4th grader, who I adored.

            "There's a kid in my class who has told me that when he goes home he's straight on his x-box all night till he goes to bed. He doesn't have any idea about what his family get up to while he's on it. He doesn't care. He gets his dinner brought to him. This kid is a normal child but he's one of the lowest attainers in the class because he does no reading or maths or even talking when he gets home. He also really struggles with his friendships in class (no he's not on the spectrum). All he does is Fortnite. He seems happy enough but I find the closed-off-ness of his young world so depressing and I can't imagine it's going to help him later in life. It is not how I want to parent my children as they grow older.",

They\u2019re 4 and 5 year olds) \n\nEvery day the kids get sent home with their book bag and a reading diary. I\u2019m a governor at the school and I know that reading is a priority as there are a lot of low income families and reading isn\u2019t where it should be.\n\nOne day my wife was dropping off in the morning and still hanging up bags and coats outside when she heard a parent shouting aggressively. She turned to see a mother crouched with a reading book shoved at her daughter who is crying her eyes out. The mother is barking at the girl to read the book before she goes in because she can\u2019t be bothered to have the teacher lecture her about it again. \n\nWe have very strict safeguarding rules so I know this would have been reported and I know this family will be on the school\u2019s radar, but I just felt so bad for that girl after hearing that from my wife. When I think of the fun and joy that I\u2019ve had reading with my son and how much he had started exploring the world through reading as he\u2019s about to turn 6.

I also called the police and CPS for her on multiple occasions but nothing happened. \n\nShe was 16. I think about her often and hope that she is okay.

This kid was essentially raising his brother and they would have to hide at night when he came home because his dad would beat them if he found them. Wild shit.",
            "This was my most horrible incident and almost made me stop teaching. I still won't go into a detail, but I worked as a special education teacher, I was just a substitute and 20 years old. Too young. I live in Finland and we have saunas like in every house, it's not really a luxury thing anymore. Even if you are renting in a poor neighbourhood, you can easily have a sauna. In sauna you have this sauna stove and I have no idea how familiar you are with those, but they get really really hot and can burn your skin easily. I guess you already know where this is going by now. My student came to school, her arms covered in burns. Her parents didn't even care enough to try and hide it. I called CPS and I don't exactly remember what happened, but a TA took the kid to a hospital. I remember being so calm and supportive and loving, while I'm dying inside and freaking out and feeling like I'm just too young and I will stop now and walk out of this school and I will never start studying teaching in the university. I would love to say she was okay after this, but she was only 8 and never mentally recovered. I got praised by the principal how well I handled it, like that made any difference to me. I was feeling like the shock was coming and I just sat there with the principal while she thanked me for being so calm, while I just wanted to cry and throw up. And I still had to teach for the rest of the day. I cried for like an hour in my parked car after work. Well, at least I learned I'm good in a crisis and can keep the shock away and some people deserve the burn in hell forever and should be punished with something worse than jail. I still see the girl from time to time, she's 13 now and already in her first rehab and dating a really bad guy. So yeah, life's going great for her. I remember how I, or her \"real\" teacher, were never worried about her future before that. She was very smart and socially skilled child. I'm still in touch with that teacher",
            "I was the kid. Early in high school here so I was maybe 13-14 I was asked to write a memory from my childhood. I didn\u2019t have the happiest childhood. Physically and mentally abused and the only memory I have is being slammed into a brick wall. So I wrote that down and the teacher pulled me aside after class and got the school councillor and to be honest I cried I was scared I was in trouble.

Kid has missed nearly every day of class, except one day in person and like a week online.

            "I work with young adults with severe disabilities, and often times these individuals are susceptible to abuse. I had a new guy enter the program very abruptly. Theres usually a lengthy process, but my boss placed him in my program while they worked out the logistics. Theres usually these very, very thick binders-im talking the 6 inch ones-that we have for every person in the program just filled with information about them-their past, medical history, legal guardians, literally everything. Theres usually 4-5 binders a person. I wasnt given any of this. So the first day, I was working with him alone. I'm the program manager, I wanted him to get to know me, trust me. He was non verbal, and he had a full 360 helmet that strapped around his neck, to avoid biting behaviors. It was only allowed to come off to eat, take meds, sleep and do ADL's and there had to be two staff there to make sure it got back on quickly if needed. Anyways, lunch time rolls around and we take it off so he could eat. He was pretty uncoordinated and had poor mechanics and had a very rough time eating, but we promote independence as much as possible, so I encouraged him to eat without me physically feeding him. It was possible, he just made a little mess. So when he was done eating, the other staff and I led him to the washroom so he could wash up, it was about 5 steps away and in the same room. Everything was fine, he was washing his hands, I soaped up a towel for him and he began to wash his face, cleaned up. He turned to leave the room and his eyes caught the mirror and he immediately grabbed the sides of the mirror and smashed his face into it. We had to go to the emergency room and I still had no information on him except his name and age. My manager was able to contact his legal guardian after 8 hours, who came down with a thin sheet of allergies,  then left.\n\nA week or so later, his information finally arrived. I found out he experienced severe abuse his whole life, and his parents used to make him stand in front of a mirror and beat him. It about damn near broke my heart. I see a lot of trauma in my work, but this poor mans story was horrific. And after he opened up to us, he was so light hearted and funny. I know this isnt the exact story you asked for, but he passed away from head trauma about a year ago and I want people to  know about him. He was a perfect person.",
            "I'm half surprised I haven't seen my high school health teacher in this thread; guess I'll have to tell it. I was in like... 10th or 11th grade. One of the hall monitor ladies noticed me collapsing in the hallway at school. I remember little of it, but they had to basically hold me down while a teacher got a wheelchair from the office because I kept getting up, taking 2 steps, and collapsing again. I'd insisted on getting back to class because my mother would kick my ass if I missed classes. Ended up going home early and sleeping it off. Fast forward to senior year, and I'm retaking health class. My teacher became someone I could really confide in, and I ended up telling her about the incident-- I'd taken all of my pills. All I'd had left, anyway. I'd thought if I tried to kill myself at school, I'd either die and everyone would finally know how terrible my home life was and my narcissistic sociopath of a mother would lose her reputation, or she wouldn't be able to hide this attempt and I could finally get help. Obviously that failed. Turns out, she was the teacher who had gotten the wheelchair, who wheeled me to the office and called my mother. First and only time I'd seen a teacher cry. I miss her.",

One time she had retention because she hadn\u2019t done her homework for a few days in a row, and didn\u2019t give any reason or excuse. I had a pretty good connection with her and asked her why, so she told me that she was so busy last month to look after her mother who had severe depression, and her little sister. This took so much time that she was unable to figure out a way to make a bit of money to pay the internet bill. The internet company cut off the internet and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t do the research for her homework. She turned just 14, and we live in one of the richest countries in the EU.",
            "Not the worst thing in this thread by a long shot, but depressing to have heard all the same.  During my training year (I did on-the-job training) I had a very difficult student.  She always seemed a bit dishevelled and could be quite the troublemaker.  One day when she was kicking off about not being able to do the task I\u2019d set, I asked her to step outside the classroom, where I then asked her why she was avoiding the work.\n\nStudent:  I don\u2019t get it.  I can\u2019t do it.  Why should I try?\n\nMe:  This won\u2019t work, [name], you\u2019re trying to play dumb here but you\u2019re far more intelligent than you want to admit; you CAN do this stuff, you\u2019re just choosing not to.\n\n(At this point, she suddenly looked as if she was about to cry, which I\u2019d never seen from her - a loud, confrontational student - before).\n\nStudent:  No I can\u2019t!  I\u2019m stupid!\n\nMe:  You aren\u2019t.  What makes you think that?\n\nStudent:  I AM STUPID!  MY MUM TELLS ME ALL THE TIME THAT I AM, SO I MUST BE!\n\nThat was depressing as hell to hear, and all of her confrontational and diversionary behaviour suddenly made sense.  I replied something to the effect of \u201cWell your mum is flat-out wrong, I promise you.  And if we need to explain to her at parents\u2019 evening just how bright you are, I\u2019ll be more than happy to do that, just as long as you can show me you\u2019re trying hard.\u201d\n\nThat was the first time I saw her smile that year and I wonder if it was the first time anyone had taken her side.  Her behaviour and attitude towards me changed overnight and, although she could still be awkward at times (there were other hints that arose later on that her home life was quite chaotic), she was generally a great student for the rest of the year.  I didn\u2019t teach her again after that year but I saw her at the gym the other week (it\u2019s been a few years, she\u2019s left school now) and it was great to see her much happier and more upbeat than she was back then.\n\nI think for most teachers (and it\u2019s certainly been the case for me), it\u2019s students like this who we \u201cwin over\u201d in the course of our time teaching them and for whom we can really see the difference we\u2019ve made, that make the shittier parts of the job more than worthwhile.",
            "Not a teacher but I helped put on a Christmas party for an elementary class. So my work at the time did a lot of charitable events and when they got word of a lower income elementary school who could only afford class Christmas parties for only K-2nd grade, we didn\u2019t want the 3rd-6th graders to be left out so my company sponsored the parties. Each group of like 5 people got one class to plan a party for. We bought gifts and food and party supplies and planned this whole thing. Logistically speaking, it was easiest to just buy the same gift for each student in the class (every class was a different gift) we decided upon a book they could read in class and a box of crayons. The day of the party we show up, hand out these wrapped presents and have a fun class party! Most of the kids tore open their presents and they all loved it, but they also were quick to realize it was the same thing...this one kid did not open their present and instead set it aside on their desk. One of my coworkers ask them if they were going to open their present and they said no because \u201cthey wanted to have something to open on Christmas morning.\u201d\n\nFucking hell, 15 years later and I\u2019m still tearing up at that. I remember after the event they asked us our take on the event and I wrote this letter and unbeknownst to me they wanted to read it at our next meeting of like 100 people. The lady that read it straight up ugly cried when she got to that part. We were definitely a privileged group of employees and I think that broke down a lot of our expectations of the world.",

            "Not a teacher, but Teachers Aide\n\nElementary school here.  Had a child and siblings whose dad was out of pic, and mom died in car crash. Said child was passed back and forth between relatives.  She was in 3rd grade....sweet and almost begging for attention from adults and other students. The other kids didn\u2019t want to play with her. Cause she was so needy.  I always gave her special attention.  One time she came up to my desk, hugged me and reached in her pocket and with her filthy lil hands pulled out three unwrapped M&Ms she saved for me all weekend.  I wanted to cry.  But that\u2019s just a side note.  For a few weeks, we kept finding feces smeared on the bathroom stall walls.  So teachers were told to send kids one by one and we would monitor hallway traffic on the camera and try to determine who the culprit was.  It slowed down for a few days, but one little girl came running up to me and said, you need to come see the bathroom.  I sent the little girl back to class.  I went to look in bathroom stall....and in big letters, smeared in feces it said \u201cHELP\u201d.  We checked the cameras and determined it was the little girl who gave me M&M\u2019s. Reported to school counseling/CPS etc.  Turns out, on top of  neglect, child was being sexually used.  Fucking horrific.\n\nAnother student,  very poor, two younger sisters all at same school.  They all came to school filthy and deprived.  His nails were always filthy and you could tell he was embarrassed. I bought him a nail grooming kit and took him to nurses office where he kept it and she showed him how to properly use it. He went on regular basis after that.  Christmas time came and all the kids were bringing in gifts and handing me.  All kids wanted to gather around and watch me open.  Not this boy, he pretended to be busy at his desk.  On a Monday (memory brings tears to my eyes) he was having a tough time. His mother was in intensive care because his dad beat her to a pulp...again.  But this time it was really bad and he witnessed whole thing.  He was very worried about protecting his younger siblings.  Anyway, he comes running up to me and said \u201cI have something for you\u201d. It was the bottom of a small cardboard jewelry box (lid missing), with a napkin glued around it (his version of wrapping paper).  Inside the box was, still to this date, the most (getting chills writing this) precious gift I have ever received.  There was a Christmas cookie in a sandwich bag broken to pieces and  blue crayon, a stub of one, half the paper missing.  He smiles so proudly and said \u201cI know how much you love your colored markers, I went through all my crayons and this is the very best one I had, and you can eat the cookie with your lunch\u201d.

            "I was teaching at a program in West Baltimore (the not good part) that put kids from the area on track to get a college education. Most of the kids I taught were straight out of the infamous city schools.\n\nOne of my students was an 18 year old girl who was pregnant. She already has a 2 year old. The father was also in the class, and still together. They were both very smart, quick to pick things up. The girl came to every class she could (a lot of them had personal stuff going on) turned in every assignment, aced every test. She even came to class one day wirh her 2 year old. A very bright and hardworking individual. I love all my students but she in particular was quite inspiring.\n\nThe father, as smart as he was, did not put in the work like she did. He showed up for the first few classes, then fewer and fewer until none at all. Later I found out from another student and faculty that he was getting involved with a gang.\n\nThere is nothing particularly striking about this that may pop off the page, but it was a very sobering reality. I still think about them a lot, especially the girl.",
            "not a teacher but a student that had no mom and a disabled drug-addict dad who had a stroke and basically couldn\u2019t take care of himself. he was also emotionally abusive at times. my home life got so bad to the point that i would miss first period daily to make sure my dad was able to eat and get out of bed before i left for school. it was exhausting and emotionally draining. my first period was AP US. \n\nbecause i missed so much class, i was on the verge of failing, so i ended up telling my teacher in hopes that he would understand i\u2019m not just cutting class and would sympathize. i didn\u2019t share the trauma or anything, but i could sense that he sensed the baggage. he didn\u2019t say much to it besides thank you for letting me know, i hope everything is okay etc.\n\ncue right after the AP exam (which i studied hard for and ended up getting a 5), we had a research paper to write as a final assignment. i of course missed all of class before the turn in, but the day is was due i drove to school and got there an hour early to turn it in. saw my teacher in the hallway on the way to class and turned the paper in. \n\ni will never forget what happened when i gave him the paper. he said he was planning on passing me regardless of the paper. he gave me his cell phone number, and he told me that whatever i needed at home this upcoming summer and beyond to let him know, whether it was housework, giving my dad rides to doctors, meal prepping for us, cutting my grass, whatever it was. he said that he could see how hard i worked even while home in spite of my situation, given the completed paper + perfect AP test score, and that he wanted to help a student he respected and admired so much any way he could. \n\ni never took him up on the help, i didn\u2019t feel like i truly could then. but i cried on the way home that morning because of how much that meant to me. it\u2019s one of my favorite high school memories and i hope i can see that teacher again one day and let him know how much it means to me even to this day. \n\ni guess this wasn\u2019t a depressing side to my home life so much as the positive effect it had from teacher to student. but i feel like this was relevant enough to share",

            "I tutored at a children's home. One of the girls had a severe intellectual disability, and at 14 was doing Grade 1 work to fit in with the other kids. I was helping her learn her letters when she asked if I wanted to see her baby. I wasn't sure what she could be talking about so said sure, and she showed me a picture on her phone of a little boy of 4. She had had a baby at age 10! It was definitely hers, because she had a genetic eye defect, and the child had it too. All the children at the home had sad back-stories, and we were discouraged from enquiring about how they ended up there, so I didn't enquire further, but that shook me to the core.\nEdited for disability sensitivity.",

            "I had so many \ud83d\ude14\n\nOne student told me she wanted to kill herself, that her mum only wanted her older sister and that she was treated accordingly. Fortunately the school was able to step in as we had some awesome staff, she left for a few months then came back and told me she was doing a lot better.\n\nAnother was a refugee. She barely spoke English and had been dropped right into an exam class (age 16) in the middle of the year. Sometimes she just couldn't even look up. Her family home had been bombed. With her and her entire family in it. She had pulled several of her female family members from the rubble but they hadn't managed to find any of the males and had to flee. Somehow they made it to England. A few months later she came in absolutely beaming - her dad and one of her brothers had managed to sneak into the UK in the back of a lorry, but instead of deporting them they had been reunited with their family. Still several family members unaccounted for though.\n\nOne student lived in the block of flats right next to the school. They were tiny flats, basically two small rooms and a bathroom. He lived there with his parents, two siblings and four grandparents. They didn't have furniture, just mattresses on the floor. The only clothes he had was one school uniform and one tracksuit. They didn't have electric lighting, so he did his homework by candlelight. The school's principal went to visit the family and sorted the kid out with a small desk and an electric light, battery powered I think with a promise of providing batteries, so that he could study more easily. Definitely changed his life, and by now that of his family.\n\nIf you haven't realised by now, I taught in London. Heard of Grenfell Tower? I spent some time working with kids who lived there when it burned. Really grim.\n\nI had so many other students self harming, stealing, caring for parents, or being forced into arranged marriages. Those kids are the strongest and most resilient people I've ever met, and I was honoured to teach them.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that most kids didn't eat breakfast. I bought my exam classes breakfast before their exams, but I couldn't afford to do it the rest of the time as I was already having to buy classroom resources for them.",

She said she was extra excited because this year was a \"proper\" birthday because she got a present. I asked her when her last \"proper\" birthday was. She told me it was when she was five. She was turning 9. Heartbroken. I gave her three toys from the prize box to take home with her for her siblings as well as a bag of her favourite sweets.\n\nShe made me make sure that I had stuff in my class for birthdays and always made a huge deal about them in class, crowns, songs, own clothes, the works.",
            "This will probably get lost in the comments, but anyway. I'm not a teacher, but my mom is. She told me about this. I just want to make clear first that her husband and I are the only people she tells this, as she needs to talk to someone to cope as well. And she never tells us who exactly it is, and she knows we'd never tell anyone. We dont know the students at that school anyway.\n\nShe had a student who showed up late for school once, and when she talked to her she found out it was because she had literally had to run away from home- without any belongings or warm clothes- to flee from her father who was going to beat her and said he was going to kill her. She believed him, and running and hiding from him all night probably saved her life. She hid in the forest all night and eventually managed to take a bus to school when her dad stopped searching for her. I dont remember what made the dad that pissed off, but it was something small like a bad grade or showing \"disrespect\".\n\nMy mom got her in touch with a women's shelter, child protective services (as she was 17) and helped her get a new place to stay right away. If she hadn't gotten a new place the first day, she would have stayed with us until she got a new place. She stayed at the shelter for a while and then managed to get an apartment that her dad paid for- because he wanted to make himself look better when the authorities got involved. That worked for her though. Sadly she almost stopped getting help from the authorities due to that. \n\nShe never met her parents on her own again, and she's doing well now and is in therapy last I heard. \n\nOn the off chance someone actually does read this- my mom wasn't a mentor for this girl or anything, she just cares about her students and talked to her when things seemed off. We've had students in trouble stay at our place for some time before as well.",

It was often the friends who ended up coming to perform the check and she would always just say that my student was a terrible young girl with loving parents who would never hurt her.

I asked a little about it but the student didn't really say much else. I told admin and moved on.\n\nA couple weeks later the student told me that they had been stabbed in a fight at a house party, and showed me a gnarly wound in their arm. I asked a little about it and the student just kind of laughed it off. I told admin and moved on.\n\nThen a few weeks after that the student told me that they had been thrown through a table at a different house party, with stitches to prove it. Again, told admin and moved on.\n\nEventually, this kid started to open up more and we developed a pretty good relationship. They were constantly in trouble with their teachers but we always got along great, probably because I'm not as much of an authority figure. As it so often goes, they were a really, really good kid that had just been dealt a really bad hand in life and got really tough to cope. Their friends would start to make a huge mess at lunch or whatever and this kid would stand up and yell \"Shut the fuck up and pick up your trash u/zurbzurbzurb shouldn't have to pick up after you!\" It was pretty awesome.\n\nBy the end of the year we were talking about rehab and the student wasn't sure if they should go. I tried my best to share my experiences with them, without openly saying that I have had struggles with opioids as well (probably why I'm a custodian lol). Eventually they agreed, but before they left they gave me a cool Coca-Cola mug as a gift and I sent them with my personal, antique copy of Ernest Hemingway's *The Old Man and the Sea* with a personal inscription.\n\nSaw them not too long ago, and they look a lot better. They told me that they finished the book, so I ran to my bookshelf and gave them an antique copy of Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying.* And, assured them that whenever they finish a book, I'll give them a new one to work on. Haven't seen them since COVID but I think about them.\n\nI think about all of our students that have a rough life.

So the little toddler goes, \"wow, pretty bird\" and tries to get a closer look, only to get chased and attacked by this thing while the parents watch. Most of them said something like \"you should have known better\"; like, HOW if you never teach them! The child can barely walk, you expect them to remember that some animals have a strong territorial sense? And then your baby gets terrorized by this thing that's bigger than them and looks like an alien for all they know, and you don't even give them a hug?\n\nSee also: that one mom we had to kick out of the zoo because she was encouraging her kids to antagonize the llama in the hopes it would spit on them.

The Mom had me come while Dad was at work.  Four weeks later she had me come later in the afternoon so he would come home towards the end of the lesson. His Dad saw his son swimming and cried happy tears.  He had no idea I had been there three days a week for a month. \nMy favorite student was a 70 year old man who wanted to do a triathlon but never learned to swim because his Dad threw him in as a child. It took about 3 months total, a lot of hand holding on the steps and shallow end, but he finally achieved his goal and I got to cheer him on at the finish line. \nI still remember how each of my students clung to my arms and clawed at my neck in their first lessons.  I never dunked or forced anyone out of their comfort zone.  My lessons had to be customized for each student to keep it fun and relaxing. The trauma in their eyes was haunting though.  \nIt stayed with me and I NEVER force anything on my kids that they aren't ready to do.  It's about trust, not force.",

And surprise! I didn't know how to swim!! I remember splashing twice, hearing my mom yell at me to stop panicking, then I went under and tried swimming to the surface like I'd seen in movies and eventually got my head a bit above water, coughed out a bunch of water and started screaming for help before I went under again. My mom told me to stop making a scene and swim towards the edge. I made it to the edge and couldn't pull myself out of the pool so my mom yelled at me to swim to the shallow end; when I tried to grab onto the edge to just pull myself to the shallow ends my mom kept taking my fingers off the edge and yelling for me to stop playing and just swim.

At that time, treatment for an attack was a nebulizer machine that required electricity, which we didn't have at our camp. My parents kept telling me that I just had to calm down and breathe better so the attack would go away on its own. They only intervened hours later because they couldn't sleep because of all the noise I was making as I choked and gasped for air.

They showed me super quick once, fast enough that I couldn't process what was happening, then told me to do it. I didn't understand and so they started yelling at me, telling me how I shouldn't even wear shoes because I was so stupid. I didn't learn how to properly tie my shoes until I was 18, and I had to teach myself. I still use the bunny ears method. The worst part of that was that people would make fun of me for not knowing how, and I couldn't explain the situation at home because they would've just thought that I was making excuses.\n\nWhere I live, we have bags of milk.

I went to make a bowl of cereal, and when it was time to put the milk back my mom tried to \"teach\" me how to tie the elastic band to the bag. I did it, but she had told me it was wrong and so beat me and told me to do it again. For the entire morning she would tell me that I was doing it wrong and beat me. By the time I had my cereal, it was noon and my brother had already come home. I don't even think I was doing it wrong because I've been doing it the same way since then.

His budget was way smaller than it should have been for the houses he wanted, and was looking at the most dilapidated, terrible houses ever. He found one that was just what he wanted: multiple rooms, a basement, 2 acres of woods, and about 15-30 minutes away from nearby cities. It was only about $120,000 and he was sold on it. The problems were abundant however and I told him not to do it. Our parents loved this idea.\n\nThey pushed and encouraged him, looked at it and took pictures, helped fill out loan paperwork, and even started planning all of the restoration projects jt would need. My brother was committed all the way to the point of confirming the loan and moving there immediately. I was mortified. This house was an absolute dump made in the early 1910s and redid once in 1950. It had mold, holes in the roof and walls, old rusted wiring, peeling wallpaper and crumbling shelves. The only redeemable part was the size of the rooms, which were pretty decent. I begged him to not do it and it finally made him think twice.\n\nFinally, he relented and listened to me. He stopped and decided to not do anything. Later, I brought up how bad of an idea that house was and my parents completely agreed. They thought it was garbage but they wanted him to follow through because it would have been a \"good learning experience.\" I was floored and asked why they would support this then, and they simply responded that it would teach him to be careful with these kinds of things.\n\nThey were literally going to let him go into massive debt and struggle so hard in order to teach him to be more careful of opportunities, and they tried to push it and encourage it instead of just sitting down and explaining all of this!\n\nTldr: Parents were going to let my brother go into massive debt to buy a shitty old house in order to teach him a lesson on waiting to find a better house deal after encouraging and nearly forcing him to go through with it.",

If it were a sanctioned fight, it would have definitely been a draw. \n\n3) sadly, growing up with a redneck dad means that I have a tiny redneck living in my brain that not only doesn't fear conflict, but embraces it.

            "This *kind* of counts.\n\nI was a kid who always \u2018zoned out\u2019 or \u2018stared into space,\u2019 which resulted in a lot of adults (including teachers and my parents) thinking I was deliberately ignoring them. They tried everything, it\u2019s like I wouldn\u2019t even hear them when they yelled. Then I acted like I didn\u2019t even know what they were yelling at me for. What a little asshole, right?\n\nI was such a little idiot. I\u2019d stop mid-sentence, zone out for sometimes even up to or past a minute, and then pick up my sentence right where I left off. Sometimes I would stop walking for no reason. \n\nIt could take me upwards of hours to finish a page of maths homework. I was so slow that what took classmates five minutes to do could take me all of a lesson.\n\nMy mum would tell me things, only for me to later insist she has never said that. She would call for me, and I wouldn\u2019t answer, until she had to yell; at which point I would turn around and insist she didn\u2019t have to shout. \n\nIn the end, it was always the same. A teacher would decide that if I didn\u2019t want to give them respect, I could just do things alone. I should have listened to them while they were explaining things if I was really interested in learning, right? So they stopped helping me when I didn\u2019t understand something they had already said. Because I should have been listening in the first place.\n\nSurely, this would get the message across, right?\nAfter all, this bratty little kid has to learn to listen.\n\n\nWell, as a result of stress, I had a grand mal seizure. \n\nI was taken to hospital where I was diagnosed with absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy that doesn\u2019t have the tremors associated with typical seizures. A person having an absence seizure simply stares, having a completely still seizure with their eyes open.\n\nAs a result of this, it often looks like someone is simply staring out into space, unresponsive, or ignoring you; when they *may* actually be having a medical emergency.\n\nSo, during times when I would be \u2018ignoring\u2019 a teacher, I was actually having an absence seizure. Suddenly, they would be yelling at me and I honestly didn\u2019t know why.\n\nNow I have to pay for seizure medication *and* therapy.\n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that this is a lot of people\u2019s first time hearing about absence epilepsy! My experience of it is a little atypical, I would have seizures anywhere from a few seconds to a couple minutes long; I would have hundreds a day, and they persist into adulthood.\n\n\n\n[Here](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/absence-seizures) is a page with more information on it, including bite-sized information on what to look out for. \n\nBy knowing the signs of absence epilepsy, you might save someone years of pain\u2014 and perhaps, even worsening symptoms. It would mean so much to me if you could glance over it; you might realize it fits your little cousin, niece, nephew, etc. \n\nYou could be the hero that I never got to have.\n\n\n**EDIT 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO:**\n\nThank you so much for the gold!\n\nIf you have a story about absence epilepsy, please share! The more folks know about it, the better. If you have any questions, please don\u2019t be afraid to ask. It means the world to me that people are learning about this. \n\nLike, genuinely, it\u2019s beyond words how precious it is to me that people are learning.

He told him he had to learn to swim in two days because they were going to a pool party and he was going to be thrown in and left there if he didn\u2019t learn with us. Poor kid was so scared.",

His instructions included \"make sure you breathe out on your way to the surface\" so I stayed under water for 5 minutes or so, then let all the air out of my lungs and began my ascent from the bottom of the deep end.  Well, my dad thought that I did not follow the instructions due to me letting the air out while at the bottom instead of on my way up, so he held my head down in the water as I came up for more air while yelling \"breathe out\"! I am screaming for him to stop while underwater with no air in my lungs. Now in full desperation mode, I hit him in his stomach area as hard as I could and he let my head go. To this day I cannot scuba dive and I even struggle with snorkels. Solid work dad!",

I WAS a burden though, because I really struggled and fought back and we disagreed on everything, especially things like money and school. \n\nI \"wasted my potential\" (her words) by not finishing a uni degree and pursuing other prospects and my life went downhill, but she never bailed me out in a substantial way, no more than small amounts I'd ask to borrow like most 18 and 19 yr olds do.\n\nWhy this hurt though, was that I had turned my life around. I've had a stable job, I had multiple secondary sources of income coming in, and I was giving her a large sum of money every week to support her and her pursuits, without expecting any return. I was helping out, and returning the favour for her taking care of me as a child, which is something she opted into.\n\nI found out why she was a single parent when I was about 15. She got knocked up, my bio dad told her to abort, and she didn't want to, so he left. She put this on me, and it was my fault her life was so hard.

It hit me hard even when he said it.\n\nOf course, I've always had serious struggles with being a student. I started to let things spiral out of control until I had to drop out right at the end of my 4th year. Failing out of college was the biggest failure that I've ever had that was purely my responsibility.

My first ever nut,  I would rush home from school to tickle my balls and just nut and nut and nut on this stuffed bear. Until one day it disappears. So I start humping my pillows the same way and nutting on my pillows then sleeping on them like an animal. My brother walks in one day, shows me a porno mag then takes me to the computer and shows me a porn video. He goes, \"notice how they clean up after?\" Among other completely uncensored and straight forward sex talk. Years later we are all drunk at my parents for new years. And my brother brings it up, hey remember when you would fuck stuffed animals and pillows? I'm like.. you guys knew???? And they tell me how I would just leave the door open and they have seen me just clapping bear and pillow cheeks. Not to mention the massive amount of cum stains on black stuffed animal fur.

            "Took a 23 hour bus ride to meet a stranger in Canada\n\nEdit: First, thank you for the awards. Secondly, since you guys are asking, it was a round trip. The story is actually a little more complicated. I took a bus from New Jersey to Ottawa with very little planning. I had only spoken to this person for a week. I even went out of my way to buy a passport to do this. Keep in mind I was about 18. The trip going up wasn't that bad, but going back was a nightmare. Thankfully the person was real and I wasn't murdered. The sex however, wasn't worth it and it definitely wasn't worth the headache of trying to get back home. The problem was that I had gotten a bed and breakfast in Ottawa with very limited public transportation around me. I was probably closer to Carp, than Ottawa. So when it came time to leave, I didn't have anyone to drive me to the bus station. I had taken a cab from the bus station in Ottawa to the bed and breakfast. There weren't any cabs available, and the person that I had hooked up with had left. So I had the owners of the Bed and Breakfast drive me to the bus station. Unfortunately I arrived an hour late, thus causing me to be stuck in Montr\u00e9al for over 8 hours waiting for a bus to bring me to NYC. The person at the bus station told me that the next bus will drop me off in NYC at 3AM and that there wouldn't be a bus to bring my to Jersey for 4 hours after I got off. I told them that I would take the risk, because at that point, all I wanted to do was to get back to home. After arriving in NYC, I scrambled to find a way back and decided on taking a train from NYC to Philadelphia and then to Jersey. All together it took me longer to get home than it did going to Canada.",

After I leave I get a text from his wife saying she found my number on his phone and wanted to know if we had had sex.

About 15 minutes later he went to bed, and about 30 minutes later his mom and I were banging on the couch. We did all sorts of stuff and I\u2019m still ashamed.. The next morning we went out to her car, and her battery was dead. She left her headlights on (yeah she drove us drunk) the night before. She was going to be my ride home. At this point I am excruciatingly hung over, and my phone has the thinnest little red line of battery life. I text a buddy telling him where I am and to please come pick me up with my car. Phone dies. I\u2019m looking at this lady, wondering wtf I\u2019m doing with my life, and I guess the best idea we had was get a margarita at this shitty Americanized Mexican food joint. It was 10am. I sat there in the outside dining area with this woman, smoking a cigarette and staring into my slushy shame wondering how many times her poor kid has seen her mom bring home some random college dude. We finished the margaritas and left the restaurant. As I walked out into the parking lot, now warming in the late morning sun, hangover getting ready to destroy me \u2014 I see my car pull into the lot with my buddy behind the wheel, with a shit eating grin on his face. I hugged the lady, thanked her, with no exchange of numbers, and noped like I should have 9 hours earlier.\n\nEdit: glad my regret has brought some of you joy. To clarify,  nothing wrong with getting the love on with someone older than you if both parties are legal and consenting. The main issue here is that I still cringe at the thought of what that woman\u2019s son must have heard through the thin walls of the apartment. Hopefully he had headphones in.\n\nEdit 2: holy shit, my mom would not be proud",
            "In my early teen years, I accidentally made my clit burn using Vicks Vaporub that was supposed to give it a tingling sensation (I watched way too much BDSM and got ideas). I was in immense pain and was lying spread out under cold water to try and make it stop, and I couldn\u2019t tell my extremely religious parents or they would\u2019ve freaked out.",
            "When I was about 12-13, I had just learned about sex. One day I was super horny and was playing with my dads back massager. I quickly realized that it felt REALLY good to press it on my dick. I took it into my bedroom and went to town. My mom was walking by and heard the noise so she just let herself in. Needless to say things were weird after that for a bit, and she hid the massager.",
            "I once got a little too enthusiastic with an eggplant emoji shaped vibrator, and nearly got it stuck inside my backdoor cavity. \n\n\nI really didn't want to explain to anyone why I needed to go to a hospital, so I actually managed to get it out myself, but only because I already knew that if I panicked I'd make things worse. (Don't worry, I would have gone to the ER if it went any further than my fingers could reach)\n\n\nHere's a bit of advice for all, if you put anything up your butt, please buy it from a sex store that has instructions and ways to prevent having something get stuck. Look up safe ways to enjoy having things up your butt because you could really hurt yourself. You could avoid a very embarrassing and expensive trip to s hospital.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the awards! I also love all the fun rhymes everyone has for dildo/butt plug/anal bead safety.

She brought an extra jacket to put over our lap.\n\nAfter feeling her cum on my hands twice I was beginning to feel horny, but I was also very turned off??? It was confusing.\n\nI let her give me a hand job because of that and I remember starting to cry as I started to cum.",

It was ultimately her idea, and it took her hours to convince me, but I take equal responsibility agreeing to it knowing the risks. If anyone cares for the story, we were both servers at a restaurant and became very close, she had a boyfriend and i was freshly out of a relationship when I met her and wasn't really trying to date. I genuinely adored her, just being around her, talking to her, she was very funny and we just made each other laugh all the time, which is important at a high stress job like we had. COVID hit and our restaurant closed down in March, and although her and i would text frequently i didnt see her for months. In July we started meeting up occasionally and getting coffee, went to a winery with another co-worker of ours, it was fun. Her and her boyfriend broke up around this time, but they were on and off constantly and i genuinely wasn't trying to date this girl despite what most people would typically think about a guy being friends witha girl, i've had many female friends in my life that i was neer interested in, some people just aren't capable of that sort of thing i suppose. Anyway one night her and i were drinking, she progressively gets more flirty which is fine because we would always jokingly flirt a little bit. We go back to my place and the flirting gets more intense, shes trying to dance on me, she tries to kiss me, and i gently turn her down saying i don't want to ruin our friendship. She starts to feel embarassed because she had never been turned down before, but i just reinforce i think shes attractive but i just want to be friends. Now i will not hesitate to admit she was insanely hot, but at some point in knowing her i sort of made that decision to essentially friendzone her because she was funny and great to be around, and we had lots of deep conversations. But her relationship with her BF was a mess and i wasn't trying to get tangled up in that. Anyway eventually she's puking in my shower (drunk) so i get in there to help take care of her, i keep my underwear on while shes naked because im just trying to reinforce that im trying to help her and not bone. But within an hour from there i finally caved and was like, fuck it man have some fun, whats the worst that can happen? it was great for about a month, we hung out probably 3-4 days a week, not always hooking up sometimes we would just talk for hours on end. But she started feeling things for me, while she still felt things for her ex, and i reinforced that i was just there for whatever, and that i wouldn't care if she went back with her ex i just wanted to be friends. We both sufferend from anxiety, hers was far worse than mine, and i think it became too much for her to handle. So its been about 3 months and we havent talked and, i dont know if we ever will again. She wasn't perfect, she had a drinking problem for sure, and some bad habits, but she really did light up a room, for me anyway. I miss her",

I couldn't help and excused myself to the bathroom and got to work. It took me a little more time than just 'peeing'. So he knocked on the door. And for some reason I got startled so bad that I fell in a way that my hand landed in the toilet.\nWith all the noise he got concerned, and let himself in.\nNow imagine this, all the times that you've seen a girl naked were in sexy lingerie, fully prepared to do it.

Her breathing would stop in her sleep so we took her in to the emergency room. She was there for a total of 5 days. For the first 3 days her health kept deteriorating. And on the 3rd day my girlfriend got a call that her mother had collapsed and was taken to the hospital. She was without oxygen for 20 minutes and was declared brain dead. That night my daughter woke up and asked about grandma. No one had said anything to her or in the room with her. We asked her what did she mean. She told us that grandma came to her in a dream and said it's not your time yet. I'll go for you. Immediately the next day she was almost 100 percent better. ",
            "There are some researchers who have been collecting and quantifying the data of Near Death Experiences (NDEs) for years now. They have created 6 categories/stages of NDEs that generally sum up most experiences. \n\n1. The hellish experience. It can be either a mildly uncomfortable experience, a cold, dark, damp, loveless experience, or the traditional flames and devil experience. Sometimes say they are drawn out of this realm by an indescribable love. Very few people recount experiencing this.\n2. There is another type of experience where one has an out-of-body perspective, and can travel freely. Often times this happens in an operation room where one's heart has stopped and the doctors are working to revive the patient. The individual many be able to go to other rooms in the hospital, or travel across the country. If they remain in the hospital room, they do not always recognize their own bodies on the table, and can feel confused. (quick note: there have been a surge in NDEs since the 1960s when resuscitation techniques became more advanced.)\n3. Much like many of the other redditor's comments, there is another experience of blissful, warm darkness that just feels comfortable. It is indescribable nothingness, often without memory or any inkling of consciousness at all.\n4. The next experience is similar to the last, but with an additional light that is usually far away, that emanates warmth and love and forgiveness. The individual is either attracted to this light and goes toward it (or the light itself comes to the person.) It allegedly gets better and better the closer one draws to the light, and so they continue. (Obviously this is where the phrase \"go/don't go to the light\" likely comes from. \n5. This experience continues where the last leaves off, where the person has broken through the light (to the other side). They now are experiencing a love/compassion/forgiveness/state of consciousness that is unlike anything they can put into words. Sometimes they encounter a sort of guide (this could be a loving anonymous being, or a religious figure (if they experience this, it is sometimes linked to their beliefs on Earth, but not always.)) This experience is sometimes accompanied by the most beautiful music. This being may present them to loved ones, or show them a life review (this is a very common experience of those who have had NDEs.) It may be at this point where the NDEer decides, or is told to return to their body (there is sometimes a choice) because they have \"work left to accomplish in their lives.\" And I put that last part in quotes because of how many people cite that as their reasons on coming back.\n6. The final experience goes beyond the previous state of love and consciousness and is experienced only by a relatively few  people compared to the previous others. They say that they experience a becoming one with the universe/universal energy that unites everything/God. They have stated that they understand everything; that knowledge is known just by thinking of a topic. \n\n(Disclaimer: people have different words to describe all these experiences, but what they typically agree on is that words themselves can not come close to explaining their encounter, for all of the aforementioned NDEs.) Most experiences are overwhelmingly pleasant, they lose fear of death, and they cannot wait to return to this state. However they know they must wait. \n\nThe NDE's that I've looked into pretty much all fall into these categories, so I'd like to hear any others that might not. As you can tell, this interests me greatly!\n\nI want to end this by saying that if you wind up researching NDEs, come to your own conclusions about them. Is there a reason for someone to be pushing a certain belief on you? I have confidence that what people say about their NDE's, they themselves wholly believe to be true. Whether or not you do is up to your own judgement. There are people who make videos and give talks about NDEs they supposedly experience, but to me some seem to be fake and over rehearsed. Take what you want from my spiel, and if you have any questions about this, I've done a fair share of looking into the topic, and would love to discuss further. If you want any directions on where to look first into gaining your own knowledge of NDE's, I can definitely help you find something. Your NDE plug, out. ",

I was having a non-verbal conversation with him and he was telling me to calm down, focus on breathing. He wore a tropical style button down shirt, one of those old school news boys hats and had a very pleasant demeanor. Mom showed me a photo of my grampa that I never had seen before, and it was the guy at the foot of my bed, and he died before I was even born. \n\n\n\n  * Edit; Didn't know this would comfort so many people, just remember not to worry too much about death and remember to enjoy your life while you have it.

            "My girlfriend is anaphylactic, and it is triggered by a chemical called salicylate (found in pretty much every food). When she was in high school she had her first big reaction, and the school nurses refused to administer her epipen (adrenaline shot) until the ambulance got there. Now obviously, having an anaphylactic reaction doesn\u2019t give you a lot of \u2018waiting time\u2019, so by the time the ambulance got to her school she was in pretty bad shape and barely conscious. The paramedics immediately administered one of her epipens, called the nurses \u201cfucking twats\u201d and loaded her into the ambulance as her mother arrived. She continued to fade, so they gave her a direct injection of adrenaline this time, still nothing. They give her a second direct injection of adrenaline and this time it hits her about 30 seconds later all at once, and her heart fails. She stops breathing, no pulse, nothing. Dead to the world. For about 2 minutes and 46 seconds she was clinically dead. And the scariest thing is, she saw nothing. She tells me that when you are losing consciousness you can\u2019t tell the difference between waves of drowsiness and when your body actually shuts down. All she saw was the darkness of her eyelids, and it felt like going into an extremely calm sleep where she couldn\u2019t hear or feel anything, and she didn\u2019t mind it. All despite the fact her mother and the paramedics were screaming at her to keep her eyes open and the ambulance was flying towards the hospital. She miraculously just came back to life almost 3 minutes later as they were giving her chest compressions, and the cardiologist that assessed her later stated that all the adrenaline in her body was enough to not only stop her heart, but to also restart it with the little help from the paramedic pumping it around. But still do this day, she can\u2019t differentiate falling asleep after a long day, and dying.",

            "My wife and I discussed this at length. 4 years ago, she died twice in 3 months, needing full resuscitation both times. Both were lengthy rescues (one resuscitation was off-and-on for nearly 40 minutes).\n\nI asked her later when she had recovered if she remembered anything at all during the times she was clinically dead. She remembered nothing. Blackness. No light. No relatives and former pets waiting for her. Just...black. Thankfully, also no pain.\n\nShe finally passed 18 months ago, and I hope she felt no pain or worry the final time.  \n\n\n{EDIT TO ADD}  \n\n\nIt started with two spontaneous brain bleeds (technically, it started with her having Lupus).  \nThe 1st brain bleed lead to her passing, but they did a craniotomy, revived her, then a re-bleed.  \nThe trauma from all that caused her lupus to set fire, which lead to complete  kidney failure and another cardiac arrest (passing and recovery), which lead to two strokes.  \nShe recovered enough to be home and mostly independent, but having to go to dialysis 3 times a week for 3 years.  \nShe passed the final test to get on the kidney transplant list on Wednesday, and had a massive cardiac/respiratory event at dialysis on Friday where she passed again, but was kept alive on life support.

I should've been dead well before they took me, even the doctors called it a miracle. Well, I died while waiting for surgery. I had to wait for a pediatric surgeon to come in because no one else felt comfortable performing the surgery on a case this bad with a child this size (dumbasses took me to the adult hospital, not the pediatrics which was 40 mins away. I was 14, 5'3 and weighed 75 pounds soaking wet). So while I was waiting for the surgeon I was in a room with me, the doctor, my two foster parents and my grandmother who is an RN. Like I said, I was really drugged up and couldn't really focus on much and couldn't really do anything. The monitor I was hooked up to would beep really loudly from time to time and the intervals between beeps started to decrease rapidly. Turns out I wasn't breathing. I was conscious for the most part, I just kept forgetting to breathe. Doctors had to keep nudging me so I wouldn't sleep. I just remember being pissed at this loud beeping that kept me from enjoying a nice slumber. The doctor had to step out for a second and my grandmother assured him she could look after me for a second. Unfortunately for her, she was out of her mind with rage at my foster parents. She didn't hold anything back. My grandma is a sweet, Mormon Utahn without a rude bone in her body. Well, I heard quite a few fuck you's, pieces of shit, etc. My point is she didn't notice I had passed out until the monitor signaled I had flat lined. \n\nThis is the bit where I died and is by far the most vivid part of the experience. I remember being capable of thought but no thoughts were in my head. I can only describe it as being conscious of my spirit but without a body for my thoughts to be processed in. I just kind of existed without feeling, thinking or being anything. I was floating. Honestly at the time it was a great feeling. I don't remember any visions of people, family, places or anything like that. But I felt *something* wrap around me and comfort me. Without talking I was assured I was ok, that there was nothing to be worried about, and at that point my thoughts returned. I knew at that moment, without knowing how long I'd be able to keep thinking, that I had to go back. I didn't want to, but knowing that the last thing I'd see before I left mortal life was these two pieces of human trash who had abused me, neglected me, and treated me like a stain that they didn't want to bother trying to clean up, that did it. I wanted to get back to my body, fix my fucking life so I could go back and live with my biological parents and feel loved again. In that moment that's all I cared about. And then I sort of willed myself back. Doctors had tried to resuscitate me but had failed. Everyone was shocked when I opened my eyes and seeing the tears in my grandma's eyes after thinking she'd lost me, that did it. I fixed my life, I reinvented myself and threw out all my anger, depression, rage and everything else that put me in Brent and Karen's home. \n\nHonestly, the only anger I felt (the burning hatred kind that makes you want to do anything  possible to release it) in the last 5ish years since I moved from their home is when I think about them and how they're still fostering youth in custody and probably pulling the same shit with those kids. I live about an hour away from where they are now and I have to restrain myself from driving up there, kidnapping those kids and taking them to the authorities with an explanation of why. The only reason I haven't done that is because I've tried telling the authorities what kind of people they are. I guess the words of a juvenile fuck up don't stack up against the lies from people who have practiced this shit for years. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the rant at the end. I know that wasn't entirely what you'd asked, but it felt good to type out. Thanks OP for asking this question. It's been surprisingly therapeutic talking about this",
            "I coded after surgery. I remember being able to see and hear everything and understand what was happening, but I couldn't physically feel anything. It was deeply unsettling. ",
            "I'm going to have to speak for my Dad here... he passed away a few years back.  I wrote this out while back actually...  but maybe this will be a relevant place for it to be also.\n\n\nDad was fearful in his last days. He had been to the hospital many times and every single time he came close to death, what he remembered didn't reconcile with what most people report when having a near death experience. He, in fact, had a lot of bad experiences. One in particular where he relived a day 3 times in a row where doctors sedated him but he was still fully aware of what was happening to him. He could hear the conversations, feel the pain, feel the choking and suffocation. When I saw him the next day he had tears in his eyes as he tried to communicate a question on how many days he was out. When I told him 1 day he was confused and it took him a while to wrap his head around it. He thought he went to hell and this was his eternal punishment. He pondered for a long time on what he could have done to deserve that as a punishment. He did not ever want to be in the hospital, he hated them his whole life and that experience made him hate hospitals even more.\n\nDad's last trip via ambulance, he actually walked out to the ambulance and it wasn't because of the usual shortness of breath, it was because of chest pains. I was sure this was going to be a short stay and he'd be back soon.\n\nDuring his last stay, he experienced more sedation, more hallucinations and more disorientation. I went to visit him every single day to get an update on his status. One night in particular they had trouble getting his heart rate down. It was steadily beating at about 160 and would calm to 120 or so before going back up to 160. It wasn't good for him.\n\nThen, the next time he was up, I walked in right around his dinner time. He couldn't wait to talk to me but he could barely talk. It took all of his effort and energy, but he had some things to say.\n\nDad: Son... I know without a doubt that there is an afterlife.\n\nMe: Really?\n\nDad: *nods*\n\nMe: How are you so sure? You've been seeing guns on the ceiling and all kinds of hallucinations...\n\nDad: That wasn't me, I wasn't here.\n\nMe: You weren't here?\n\nDad: I was there.\n\nMe: Okay well.... did you see anyone you knew?\n\nDad: *shaking his head no*\nIt's not like that... \nyou can see souls being born into life and its the most beautiful thing you can see. Everyone has their own color and they're trying to get to white.\n\nMe: trying to get to white?\n\nDad: *nods yes* \nTime doesn't exist there. Time is here because of us and we're here because of time. Ohhh, I should have done more. \n*looks at his hands* I could have been another Jimmy Page (he's referring to his skill as a guitarist) I could have done more.\n\nMe: But you were the greatest Dad and...\n\nDad: *smirking a little to indicate that isn't what he meant* Do more, do everything you can...\n\nMe: So... like carpe diem? Like seize the day?\n\nDad: *brightens* yes! Do everything you can. Don't worry about the consequences. Everyone finds their way. People worry to much about the consequences... just do good and do as much as you can. Everyone eventually gets there.  Tell the family...\n\nMe: Can I tell everyone?\n\nDad:  Yes, tell everyone...\n\nMe: okay Dad... I'll tell everybody\n\nDad: *nods in agreement*\n\nI can tell he's tired by this time...\n\nMe: I love you Dad.\n\nDad: I love you too Son.\n\nThis was the last conversation that I had with him. I miss him terribly and have been trying real hard to find myself again after his passing. It's been a long time and I've been able to cope with it enough to finally write this all out.\n\nI hope this finds someone that needs to hear it.\n\nWith Love\n\nEdit:  I just wanted to thank everyone for the wonderful, heartfelt and deeply personal comments and messages that have been sent my way.  I also want to thank the wonderful person that gilded this...  I am truly overwhelmed by all of your kindness.",

            "Not mine but the head of my program was in a horrible car accident. She was dead for a few minutes on the scene while paramedics worked on her. She said it was the most amazing feeling she\u2019s ever experienced. It was blank black nothing, but that was perfectly fine, and she felt a comfort she can\u2019t even explain. \nShe remembers being angry at the man working on her when she finally came back to her body because she wanted to stay there. She told us she can\u2019t wait to experience it again when it\u2019s really her turn. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m really pleased this resonated so strongly with so many of you! I wanted to add some detail about her. She\u2019s not religious in the slightest, and she actively quashes our ghost stories and shit (mortuary students) because she only believes in tangible things, so she fully turned me into a believer. \n\nFelt its important I make a distinction she was very adamant about when telling us this story- she\u2019s not advocating suicide. She stressed that she isn\u2019t telling us she\u2019s trying to reach this place again but that when it was her time she was going to be comfortable embracing it. ",

The doctors say it's likely the first hit stopped my heart and the second one started it (before I was pulled like a lifeless corpse to safety). \n\nI remember experiencing the darkest dark and the most silent silence. I ceased to care that I was dying; time seemed to change, it could have been hours it seemed. It was only about 30 seconds. \n\nI felt as though I was floating and floated toward something that I eventually realized was my body and reality. Upon joining with whatever it was I was floating towards, I became self aware in my body and heard the electricity making horrible noises and knew I was in danger. \n\nFrom there it was a horribly painful experience where I lost most of my toes due to tissue death and had severe electrical burns on all four limbs. More surgeries than I care to count and seeing the round bone ends of my toes that were freshly amputated still haunts me a little. \n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for helping me understand something that happened over 12 years ago. I was in the hospital for about a month inpatient, and then for 10 months, daily as an outpatient (basically sent me home for my mental sanity but needed daily attention). I got addicted to pain killers, had to learn to walk again and had to see a pain management therapist. It was horrible at times but eventually the pain began to subside. I went back to school and became an engineer and I don't think I'd be where I am without this thing happening. Really strange to think that I am in some way grateful now. Also I can't watch horror anymore, Hollywood actually does a very realistic job. \n\nEDIT: Thank you kind stranger for the gold.

            "I don't know if this counts, as I don't think I flat lined, but I had a huge post-partum haemorrhage after my second (and last) child was born. I lost 2.3 ltrs of blood, which I think is about half of all my blood, and considered the highest classification of blood loss before death occurs. I was given general anaesthetic before I passed out on my own, but leading up to that was such a surreal experience.\n\nAs someone has previously mentioned, there is this sense of acceptance, of laying back and going with it. When I first started bleeding I was scared, and panicking. By the time I was being wheeled into theatre, I was smiling at the midwife and telling her it was going to be ok. I was delerious and euphoric and not scared at all. My vision started to go, at first it was coloured spots then everything had a grey hue, as tunnel vision set in. Sound became muffled, like putting my hands over my ears. The whole time, the general feeling of indifference and no urge to fight it was there. It was so calm I don't think I've ever computed just how lucky I am to be here. So a near death experience by blood loss, can confirm, not bad.\n\nThe recovery though, I felt like shit for fucking weeks and had PTSD. I was so physically weak that I could barely take care of the baby and had to inject myself with anti clotting meds for 6 weeks every day.",
            "I was dead for a very short period of time, like 30 seconds to a minute. There's a big misconception about it. It's not like sleeping at all. I'll try to explain. There's always a sort of white noise in the back of my mind. It quiets down when I sleep but it's still there. I never noticed it before I died, but I do now. I don't want to romanticize death, but when I was out, it was like this perfect nothingness. And nothingness is so hard to imagine normally, but once you \"experience\" it, and they bring you back, part of you wishes you could have stayed.  There's no positive feelings there, obviously, but it takes away everything bad too. All your stress, the nightmares, the troubles. All gone. Just nothing exists. It's beautiful in a way. I'm not suicidal at all, and hope to live the rest of a long and happy life. But I'm very much looking forward to a lack of conciousness when I do eventually pass again, and I can honestly say I don't fear death anymore.",
            "   I\u2019m probably to late to this thread but I have an interesting story so I\u2019ll share it. \n   I was not the one who experienced this but it was one of my teachers I had in high school a few years ago. She was having open heart surgery in Minneapolis, Minnesota and coded 3 times during the surgery. When she came out of surgery and began to regain consciousness she kept speaking of all these \u201csouls\u201d that she saw. I remember her saying she was scared for them and wasn\u2019t sure what would happen to them. I can\u2019t remember exactly what she said about the souls but I do remember her saying that they had all just died in an accident.\n   Her surgery was on August 1, 2007. This was also the day that the I-35W bridge collapsed in Minneapolis, Minnesota (the same city she was in). It collapsed while she was being operated on.\n\n",

            "When I was 15 I was scheduled to do a tilt table test (they lean you up at an angle on a table) because I was consistently experiencing dizziness and fainting spells. After about 20 minutes the doctor tilted the table back and I could feel myself passing out. I got severe tunnel vision and lost like 95% of my eyesight, like looking through a straw and then I blacked out. I remember hearing the dr call the code and my father cussing at the dr that he \"killed\" me. I remember hearing alot of slamming and banging around, which I assumed was the crash cart and nurses shoving into this small testing room. I felt a pressure on my chest, like when you have someone stand on your back to crack it, which I found out later was the nurses doing CPR. I saw an array of vivid colors kind of dancing around forming objects in the dark. The scariest thing was how peaceful it felt, just pure 100% peace. No panic, no pain, no sadness, nothing  just bliss. I coded for just under two minutes and as soon as I came too and opened my eyes, I felt seriously angry and hostile, I started ripping off whatever I could get my hands on and yelling at the dr to get me off the table. \n\n**EDIT ein** for spelling, and forgetting to mention my heart stopped because I had an undiagnosed heart problem (Wolff Parkinson White) that caused my heart to more or less misfire\n\n**EDIT numero 2** This blew up wayy more than I thought, I'm trying to respond to every comment I can!

            "I was 6-7 years old and one day I got rushed to the hospital by my parents because they heard me breathing really loud and hard. The last thing I remembered were faces of the doctors and nurses above me while I was lying on my back. Then I flatlined.  \n  \nThe weirdest, unexplainable thing happened then and there - I suddenly could see the whole scene as a spectator, like I was a floating spirit in that room. I could see myself getting revived, saw my mom crying and my dad comforting her. Then, I saw a white entity shaped like my body, falling through the ceiling and slowly, like a leaf on the wind, falling down to eventually  land inside my body. That's when that experience ended.  \n  \nI was put in a medically induced coma, and I woke up after some days, I don't remember. I had stuff plugged into me, an IV, red glowing elastic ring on my finger etc. Anyway, I later mentioned to the doctors that I saw it all, I saw them using the defibrillators, my parents etc. No one really believed me and told me that I was probably dreaming and biasing my memories due to watching tv, but I know what I saw!  \n  \nEdit: Okay, so this blew up and after reading some comments I need to clear some confusion.  \n  \nI don't really recall what was the exact cause of my hospitalization, but I know that it started with an asthma attack, alongside with a heart failure. My memories from that time are a mess and I spent a lot of time in hospitals, and I've taken heart meds and steroids till I was in my mid teens. Wish I knew/remembered more, but I never really had it explained to me, I just went along with the doctors, my parents and medicines.  \n  \nAs for the defibrillators part some of you mentioned, I'm really confused right now. I could have sworn that I saw them preparing the defibrillators, just after they did CPR on me for some time. Maybe they used them after I got my pulse back? Sorry if it all sounds like a mess, maybe I was actually just hallucinating like some of you imply. \n  \nEdit 2: I just recalled one thing, I remember that while I was in the \"spectator mode\" I saw a nurse handing a paper to my mom, for her to sign. I later asked her what did she sign that night, and she was like \"how do you know I signed anything? You were unconcious\". It turned out it was some insurance stuff.  \n  \nAlso, I have a heart defect since birth. I don't know the exact name but it has to do with something in my heart not opening/closing properly, which caused me insane stabbing pains in heart area once in a while. They're gone now so I'm off meds.",

I can\u2019t even explain how long it felt like nothingness. And then I remember waking up with them over me saying we lost you for a second there, are you okay?\n\nThe second time is the hard one to share. I woke up in a type of subway feeling thing but everything was white. The subway, the tunnel walls we were speeding through. \nI didn\u2019t have a body per say, it felt like I was the subway at times, and the. At times it was like i was just  looking out a window at the tunnel wall. \n\nIt came to a stop and it was just black nothingness again.

Like I didn\u2019t know how to speak. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going now if you\u2019re ready...\u201d \nAnd something inside me felt so ready to go. Like I was a magnet to it... this unknown destination in the black nothingness ahead.  \n\nI remember finally saying \u201co..ok\u201d. \nHe said another time with a slightly different tone.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving here. You are ready to go?\u201d\n\nAnd finally something in me snapped, and I remembered I had a life, and people I\u2019d leave behind. And my first thought was \u201cI can\u2019t leave my girlfriend. I couldn\u2019t do that. And my Mom and Dad. My puppies. I can\u2019t leave any of them. My family, my friends..\u201d\n\nAnd I made a decision I couldn\u2019t leave.

That\u2019s at least what I tell myself.",
            "My dad clinically died for over a minute as a result of an iodine drip during a procedure, despite a documented severe iodine allergy. He described it as an out of body experience in which there was complete silence and he was the spectator in the upper corner of the room, watching the staff scramble to revive him. He said he had no concept of time or of the panic below, he just observed in total peace. He saw one nurse (finally) notice his bracelet and alert everyone of what the issue was. They cut the drip and continued their efforts to revive him. \n\nDuring this time, even though he was watching the end of his life, he felt an extreme peace, and was pain free for the first time in years. He was aware that he was dying, and he was ready and content. Everything got bright and he started to float upwards, until he saw a man that he didn\u2019t recognize who told him it wasn\u2019t his time yet. \n\nAll at once, he was jolted back into his body and came to. Once stable, he described what he witnessed and even thanked the particular nurse that noticed his allergy alert bracelet. They were all baffled that he knew such detail. \n\nI can only hope that when he did pass away four years ago, it was an even more peaceful experience than this. It gives me peace knowing death was something that he had faced already, so he wasn\u2019t scared of it when it came again. ",
            "So this is second hand from my dad but he was always a little shaken up when he told this story. Years before I came along my dad was cruising around on his motorcycle when a little dog ran into the road straight at him barking. He swerved so he wouldn't hit the poor pupper and a car in opposing traffic did as well. My dad got clipped and thrown off his bike. It was on a hill so he slide pretty far until his body hit a parked car. Now the weird part, he always got this sort of haunted look when he talked about it which wasn't very often, he says he remembers plain as day standing at the bottom of the street on the corner watching as a man got hit off his bike and tumbled through the air and down the hill. He says he remembers thinking \"that guy is definitely going to die\". He woke up the next day in the hospital with a nurse picking gravel out of his back. He had reconstruction surgery on his hand and arm which consists mostly of metal pins now. Remember kids if on a motorcycle always wear your leathers and helmet. Without them my dad would have died and I wouldn't be around.\n\nEdit: some typos\n\nEdit2: I get it there was a typo about hitting the dog. Please stop messaging me about it.",
            "I was hit by a car while riding a bicycle without a helmet when I was 17. I suffered a traumatic brain injury including a brain bleed which led to a condition called status epilepticus. Not dead, but close. My heart worked, but I was without oxygen for a long time. I woke up in the hospital nearly two weeks later in severe pain - I had one hell of a headache. I had a weird recollection of a dream-like state where I dreamed in 8 bit - kinda like Mario? Except it was a field of flowers and a bunny rabbit. It was quiet. I felt nothing. I was riding my bike one minute...and completely gone the next. It was a traumatic event I still have issues with nearly 15 years later. ",
            "I nearly drowned in the ocean as a kid. A lifeguard on his very first day of training saw me thrashing from 1/4 mile away and was able to get to me after I had filled my lungs with saltwater and sank. I do remember him gripping my arm before completely blacking out (drowning, btw, is a very comfy way to go, after the struggle and convulsive intake of water, there is a warm serenity...).\n\nWith my heart and lungs stopped, I was pronounced \"dead\" on the beach by trained lifeguards but they kept up the CPR until the paramedics came and shocked me back to \"life\".\n\nTo this day I remember everything, both physically and mentally about the incident vividly - way way clearer than any other childhood memory. But the period I was pronounced to be \"dead\" was a black hole of non-conscious nothingness.\n\n*So this is kind of interesting: the scariest thing during the whole incident was after I was shocked back to \"life\" and was too weak to move, I could feel the paramedic undoing the drawstring of my shorts - \"OH MY GOD, HE'S GOING TO SHOW EVERYONE MY PEEPEE!!!\" my feeble brain registered, before I once again blacked out.",
            "My grandmother when she was a kid was walking her dog when she got hit by a car. She and her dog hit a fire hydrant and at that instant she rose up from the city block she was at with her dog (the dog survived). \n\nShe reached the top of somewhere and a voice told her \"Look at your mother [who was crying], you can't go. And you have a lot to do,\" \n\nSo she came to in the hospital and tried to close her eyes and go back and was crying because it was so peaceful. ",
            "Coded after attempting suicide with Ativan (which is stupid.)  My son had passed away three years before, and I remember going to a place without time and watching him grow up without the neonatal Marfan syndrome and hydrocephalus that killed him.  I should point out that I lost consciousness before code was called, so I don't remember rising out of my body.  I do remember slamming back into it after being shocked, though.  That was no fun.\n\nMy life changed completely afterwards.  I left my wife, who wasn't helping me in my own struggles with Marfan syndrome, got the guts to come out as trans and found a great woman who supports me and is totally in love with me.  I don't worry about anything but love and taking care of the people around me-life is too short for anything else.  A visit with my son sorted it all out.",

            "i don\u2019t know if this counts but i had surgery on my hip back in february \u201809 because i\u2019d been in a car accident. when i was coming out of surgery, it was discovered that i\u2019d been slightly overdosed on anesthetic (never found out by how much though). instead of the typical amount of time spent in the recovery room, i think i spent a solid 2 and a half hours in there. i kept \u201cfalling asleep\u201d and ceasing to breathe, every 30 - 60 seconds, for over an hour. every time i faded out, everything simply went black. i felt nothing. i saw nothing. but there was no fear. no pain. i do remember feeling incredibly calm, and like i was being torn between two completely different dimensions every time i alternated between being conscious and slipping away. interestingly, it was my mother yelling at me to breathe every time i faded out that kept me waking back up. \n\nit was a really strange experience; i don\u2019t know if i was clinically dead because it was for such short periods of time, but it definitely made me less afraid of dying.\n\nI\u2019m sure this will sound insane to some, but i\u2019m pretty convinced that there is a lot we don\u2019t know about the universe, and i believe that our consciousnesses are a part of it. i believe quite firmly that when we die, we don\u2019t cease to exist. because we\u2019ve always been here and we always will be, just like everything that is, just in a different form; like how, at one point, everything that exists now was once a simple collection of hydrogen atoms. the universe just had to take a lot of time to develop what would become consciousness, and bodies to house it, so that it could finally observe itself. but bodies don\u2019t last forever. and we should all feel incredibly lucky to have been given the chance to be a part of existence that was alive and self-aware. \n\ni know i do.",

            "People who say they were aware of everything but can't move is my nightmare. It's one of the reasons why I want to be cremated, can't stand the thought of being trapped in my own dead body forever",
            "This is my mother's story. I was privileged to be there when she talked to her doctor the next day and to witness his reaction. She had been afraid to die. After this experience she was no longer afraid and started enjoying life more...seizing the day, if you will.\n\n\nMy mother was in the hospital being treated for a reaction to arthritis medication. This was more than 30 years go, so procedures have changed. She was in a bed far from the nurse's station because she was stable and in no danger.\n\nFor some reason her heart stopped - they never found out why.  The nurse found her without a pulse and called a code.  My mother, meanwhile, had left her body and was floating up by the ceiling.  She said she felt no fear, only wonder at what was happening and pity for the poor body laying on the bed because it was so sick and damaged (she had a lot wrong with her.)\n\nAs the team was working on her without success and the attending physician went down the hall to the nurse's desk.  My mom was curious about what he was going to say, so she followed him and listened to him. He was upset and basically saying he had no idea why her heart stopped, why it wasn't starting again and to call her personal doctor.  He returned to her room and she followed him back.  \n\nThey were working away and she said she found that she had no feeling of fear or regret. She's been physically disabled for some time and was enjoying the freedom of movement and lack of pain. She said she saw \"the light\" (but wasn't hugely bright and more a feeling of peace and safety) and she felt that her parents were near but, mom being mom, was more interested in what was happening to her and her body. I mean if you are dead, it would be good to know why. \n\nThe attending physician finally did something that worked to start her heart and she said she was \"sucked\" back in.  She was really pissed off because she knew she was about to start a wonderful adventure and the doctor spoiled it.  She said she didn't want to be in that fat handicapped body! She struggled to get back out but was held back and then the drugs they gave her worked and she became unconscious.\n\nMy sister and I were sitting with her the next day. She was in a lot of pain from them pounding on her chest and pretty ticked off that she didn't get to go on her \"adventure.\" Hobbit jokes were ensuing when the attending physician came in to check on her. She asked him why they didn't know what happened and why she died.  He didn't know what to say. She told him she'd left her body and had seen what happened. He patronized her and started to tell her about hallucinating and her brain being deprived of oxygen. She shut him off and demanded to know how she could have known what he said at the nurse's station (at the end of the hall) if she hadn't been there. She proceeded proceeded to repeat his conversation with the nurse!  The doctor looked like he'd seen a ghost. His face went white and he spun on his heel and bolted for the door. He actually bounced off both sides of the door before he was able to get out, that's how fast he was going. (She said later that she never saw him again.)\n\nMy mother was never religious and didn't start now. Instead she became more spiritual, something she had previously had no interest in. She just felt more at peace with herself and her condition and started to pay more attention to the little things that people ignore in their rush, like sunsets and butterflies. She was buying all kinds of things, typical of people who don't want to admit that they are very ill. It's a way of staying connected with life. She stopped this behavior and said she didn't need \"things\" where she was going. This was always said with a smile.\n\nShe asked that I share her story so that people know that there really is something after death.  It's interesting and not at all scary.  It has NOTHING to do with religion. What happens afterwards just seemed to be a fact like gravity is. She said she was surprised that she wasn't surprised. \nShe died for real about a year later and I'm sure since she had an inquisitive mind that she's enjoying herself.\n\nOn a slightly different note, I've had several dogs who returned after they passed. The only ones who came back had huge personalities and felt real ownership of the house. The best story is about Joe, a little black dachshund/beagle who ruled the house for 10 years. \n\nThe night after she passed, my ex heard her at the door. There was no mistaking her scratch and bark. I heard her too, as did the other dogs. He didn't believe in ghosts but opened the door and called to her. Honey our doberman, was lounging in \"Joe's chair\" and she got out of like she was shot. The other two dogs milled around as if they were greeting someone. I couldn't see her but I talked to her as if she was there and explained what had happened and that she was to go on over the Rainbow Bridge. I'd join her when I could. The next morning when I came downstairs, Honey was in Joe's chair and made it clear that it was now her's. I think Joe gave it to her. She always was a beneficent queen.\n",

He said that he could see doctors and nurses working on him and family in the room. He said he slowly floated above the hospital and towards a light. He said the most peaceful feeling he has ever experienced washed over him. This is a person who has done mdma and coke in college. He said its almost impossible to describe the feeling with our vocabulary. He said it feels like a weight was lifted off you. He said he saw some long gone family in the light but they told him it wasn't his time. He said he was angry because he felt so good but floated back down to his body.

I remember the moment where the pain was too much to handle he was chocking me and after what was eighty seconds ( I counted) I just stopped. I felt my heart stop. Everything faded and I was in this awkward faze where it felt like I was being pulled out of my body. He got scared and started hitting my chest really hard. I felt like I was watching it happen, the panic in his eyes, but I felt nothing physically. I just watched. Emotionless.

            "I have two stories. When I was 9 I used to have fainting spells. One time I fell down the stairs and lost consciousness. My mom said I went as stiff as a board. I remember, as if floating near the ceiling, watching my mom run to the phone and calling 911. I could see my dad start to do CPR on me. Then I looked behind me and saw a bright light and heard a voice say \u201cit\u2019s not your time\u201d. Then I went back into my body as I heard my dad yell \u201ccome on, damn it!\u201d I was really scared when I came to, and it took me a while, like years, to figure out what I had experienced. I can\u2019t explain what happened. I felt calm though while I was out. I don\u2019t know if I was really dead or just unconscious and my mind made it all up. The other story I have I know was real.\n\n6 years ago my brother died from adrenal cancer. His wife and I slept in his hospital room that night. His friends and the two of us sat around his bed as he lay unconscious and told stories about my brother and laughed about all the great times we had with him. At 3 am I woke from a dream I was having of seeing him walking down a large tunnel that had a bright light at the end of it. He was healthy looking again and he turned around to look at me, smiled and waved, then walked into the light. When I woke up I rolled over to look at him. He had stopped breathing. I touched him and he was still warm and his skin was still soft, as if he had just passed away a moment before. It was like he hung on until he knew we would be ok and then waited to pass until we were sleeping so we didn\u2019t have to watch him take his last breaths. I loved my brother, he was my best friend, my biggest champion, and he encouraged me and built me up when I had no confidence in myself. God I miss him, but I\u2019m relieved that he\u2019s not in pain and suffering anymore. ",

Text didn't make sense, so the first thing she did when she got home was find me. I don't remember, but the next thing I DO remember is feeling like lava was being injected into my brain and like I just wanted to get up and GO. No life flashing before my eyes, nothing like that. Just lava. in the brain. The second time I had no idea it even happened, but my best friend saved my life. I know its kinda morbid, but that's definitely the way I'd be down to go out.

Yes, it was pleasant, but I never want to have that experience again. I\u2019m actually on the verge of tears just thinking about it right now.

So he would ask, \u201cdo you remember anything?\u201d And the gang bangers would inevitably say it was a scary experience and they were frightened by demons or some nightmare scenario. And the victim of a random act of violence like a getting stabbed during a mugging would say, \u201cI saw a white light.  It wasn\u2019t scary.\u201d  Or, \u201cIt was beautiful.\u201d  Im not particularly religious and reasoned this away as the mental state of the victim, but it would give me chills to hear some of the answers.

            "I'm not sure if I was \"clinically dead\" or not but I drowned in the ocean four years ago saving two children who had been swept out to sea by a freak land slip and subsequent strong current. I don't really remember my last action before drowning but the lifeboat crew said they saw me and before going under I threw the children to them, they said the only explanation is a rush of adrenaline at the sight of them arriving and knowing help had arrived as there should have been no way I could have thrown two kids in that situation. To be perfectly honest I had given up hope as I felt my energy sapping trying to keep the children above the water as all three of us were clothed and I felt the lactic acid building up and try as I may I couldn't move my limbs any more, I was just telling the children it was going to be okay knowing full well I was about to run out of steam any moment. The relief of getting to them was swiftly replaced by dread as I turned and realized how far we were from the beach, and the terrifying realization of how fatigued I was set in and thinking that there was no way we were going to survive. After I threw both children to the crew who had arrived at speed with rescue gear they said I went under. Only by sheer luck did they manage to pull me out of the water too and revive me. I remember clearly not being able to see when I went under the waves and beneath the ocean (and as I started to breathe in the water) instead of fear I felt strong sadness at not knowing if I had done enough to save them. A couple of gulps later I must have gone unconscious as the next thing I remember is being revived by cpr (apparantly) and coming round. It was very confusing and I haven't really talked about it until now but the one thing that is deeply strange to me is that there was no fear at the point of drowning, only calm and the wish that I knew that the children had made it and they were safe. Very strange. The children are 11 and 8 now and living happy lives, thank goodness. It could have been so very different and I don't take life for granted that's for sure. Every day is a gift. Sorry for the long post but the original question resonated with me and I haven't really talked about it much since it happened.",

He died on the same day Avicii died, the next day we were able to know how he died, but its been passed 4 months since my little brother passed and we are still in the dark with his death. \n\n Sorry for that rant. No one is reading this, so honestly shouldn't even apologize. I've read pretty much all of the comments, and this is really what I needed to read. People sharing the feeling they had with an NDE. The absence of pain, the release, the feeling of nothing, and not being afraid of nothing, acceptance. Thank you. \n\nThe day I saw my brother laying on the floor of his downstairs bathroom, is still extremely vivid in my mind. His feet were pointed towards the door, his head on the ground near the washing machine, and a small pile of vomit still attached to his mouth, his legs were crossed as if he laid down. He had ordered pizza, from our local pizza joint in town, the receipt and box was still in the living room, it was almost like he was just going to the bathroom. The first thing that jumped in my head was, \"I hope this wasn't painful\" and the second part was months and months of true sadness. Reading these comments, it brings a little bit of closure to me. Knowing that it doesn't hurt anymore, whatever it was. It doesn't hurt. Thanks Redditors.\n\nThe night my brother died, his daughter saw him. She said he told her that, \"Dada Loves You and to be strong\". I miss him, every single day. His daughter who is turning 4 today, told my wife and I, \"I am broken, I have no Dada, I am Broken.\" I am glad that he has no pain wherever he is now, but I'm pissed that he would leave all of us so soon to deal with all this Pain. \n\nAnyways, thanks for posting your stories. \n\nEdit: Aug/25/2018\nI had a dream with him in it last night. It was very vivid. He was wearing a red shirt, and he sat on the edge of my bed. I was just crying, and i leaned in and gave him a huge hug, and he returned the hug. He smelled clean like clothes right after being in the wash. Then he stood, and started eating McDonalds, he said he didn't have to care about his Cholesterol here, and he could eat whatever he wanted to. Then I woke up. ",

This I knew. I also know me and my twin are IVF babies and we were born very premature. I'm talking 1 pound baby premature. Shortly after, my mom developed breast cancer.\n\nWhat I didn't know was that during this time my dad was also taking care of his sick mother (my paternal grandmother) as well as looking after his sick wife and two newborn premies. He ended up asking his brother to help look after their mother since he'd been the one doing it so he could care for his family more.\n\nWell soon after my dad spent more time with us vs his mom, she took a turn for the worse and died. And my father's brother blamed him for 'abandoning' the family and blamed my twin and I for the death of our grandmother. Because if we weren't born my mother wouldn't have gotten estrogen positive breast cancer and also they were all very Catholic and IVF was a sin.\n\nI never met my grandmother. I'm named for her.

However, the fact that you were the asshole and you were the reason some of your friends cut ties with you is a pretty hard pill to swallow.

I told her I wanted to know everything that had happened, because I didn\u2019t know who I could trust any more, and regret it so much - after finding out the extent of it all we divorced and I lost all my friends, because I found out that while she was travelling for work she had slept with so many people, both colleagues and strangers, that she\u2019d lost count, and while I was across the country for a month looking after my nephew after my sister and brother in law were in a car accident (and later died), she\u2019d been sleeping with my aforementioned married best friend and gotten pregnant, then had an abortion. I often think that if she\u2019d just not told him he was pregnant he wouldn\u2019t have told his wife, and I could have lived in blissful ignorance.

We always had food but they didn't really care what we did or ate and mundane things like dental hygiene started to slip, it has lead for me to have very little self control around food and an unhealthy relationship with food. There's many times I wish they would've just spilt up and because of all the arguments and hurt over this half brother, I hope I never meet him because I know logically he's innocent in all of this but by God, emotionally I wouldn't be able to handle it if he looks like me or my brother.",

Then my parents found out when they visited with old neighbors that our old next door neighbor was a child molester (girls only) and got in trouble for it. His daughter used to babysit me, and his son hung out with my brothers. I was over there a lot. It clicked that my fractured memories actually happened.

Never brushed his teeth or cared much about his hygiene and health in general. So I was acutely aware that he was gradually losing his teeth over the years as a child and all the way into adulthood.\n\nMy mom recently showed me two of his teeth that he left in his drawer, recently fallen out teeth, mind you. I was fucking horrified. I had no idea he did any of this.\n\nShe then told me that when a tooth or two would fall out, he wouldn't throw it away or anything. He'd just leave them lying around and my mom would have to pick them up. He'd been doing this ever since they began falling out. Come to think of it, I think I may have actually picked one of them up when I was very young but it hadn't occurred to me that it could've been his teeth.\n\nShe told me the first time she saw one was horrifying and traumatizing. When she brought up seeing a dentist or a doctor, he'd refuse to do that. He absolutely did not give a fuck. Since then, she kept finding them in random spots. Drawers, his pant pockets when she was about to wash them (she had to put her hands in there and usually felt them as she did) or just lying around on the floor.\n\nAnd yes, the man was an asshole and an abuser and I'm glad that I'm thousands of miles away from that drunken asshole.

Don't get me wrong, he was already a repulsive asshole, he couldn't be bothered washing himself for months. I once caught him without his socks on and his feet looked like they were rotten.\n\nI mean seriously rotten, there were bits of purple and black in there.

Well Charlie had a twin, whose name was Kristine. Charlie insisted on introducing me to Kristine, and yelled at her to come across the lunch area to us. Kristine was very clumsy and tripped and almost landed on top of me. I fell head over heels.

I moved in and in the middle of the night i saw Kristine for the first time since 2007. And my jaw dropped. She was always attractive but i guess she became a health nut after having 2 kids with her ex. Instantly, crush reappeared but this time i had the post navy confidence and said something.

Her life just generally took a track mine wouldn't have meshed with.\n\nThe other, I dated in high school and multiple times after high school right up until I was almost thirty. She's married with a kid now. She grew to be strong, smart, and creative. Really, we were dynamite together when things were good, but I don't know how much of the woman I loved remains now.\n\nI have no regrets about how it all turned out between us.

We discovered this about 3 years ago while taking our kids on a walk and seeing them out in their driveway. My wife and her have reconnected since we discovered they lived so close, and they have actually been over to our house a few times. For the most part it's been no big deal because it was so long ago, but at first her husband was really trying to hang out with me or go play golf, which I thought was weird all things considered. Then I found out he only knew we all went to HS together, and doesn't know I dated his wife for almost a year. I'm still not sure that he knows just how well I know her, haha.\n\nAside from that, she's turned out well. Stay at home Mom who coaches cross country I think.\n\nEdit:  Spelling is hard.",

            "She was cute and fascinating girl who grew into beautiful, intelligent woman. We had not spoken in 30+ years before connecting on Facebook a couple years ago. When I went home to visit family, she and I had coffee, spent three hours pouring out our hearts to each other in the middle of Starbucks. We both agreed we made a mistake not being together, but since we are both already married to other people, that we probably need to to stay the hell away from each other. Now the only communication we have is the occasional like on FB posts.",

We were from a remote and rural town and used to go on rather wholesome road trips hours away to major cities to punk rock shows with our group of mutual friends. He was two years older and so kind for letting me tag along. I couldn't figure it out then because, in my eyes, he was way too cool for awkwardly shy me. After growing apart and going to different universities in faraway big cities, we casually connected on MySpace (we're old) and have been together these last 14+ years  (married for almost 4 now). <3"

They got their tests back, had a day to review them, and were allowed to re-submit for a regrade. They knew he was cheating because of the unlikelihood of the grading mistakes on multiple exams but the TAs who graded it couldn't confidently say it wasn't their handwriting.\n\nUltimately it was an office worker for the department who figured it out near the end of the semester, his staples were angled different than the exams handed out that were mass stapled. He was recreating the test, printing it, re-answering it, and then grading it in the same pen as the TAs and had done a good job copying the writing style.",

            "In high school I was in a computer based learning program and our science tests were taken digitally. However, they used a program where once you entered the test your entire screen was locked into the test and the only way to exit it was to click the finish button on the test or turn off your computer which effectively did the same thing. Another feature of the program was that once you were in the test, anything you had in your clipboard (copied text) was not able to be pasted into the answer sections on the test to prevent the only other way to cheat. However, after creating my own classroom at home , making fake tests and playing with the program to figure out a way to cheat I realized that it would allow you to copy things from inside the test and paste them elsewhere in this test. The developers of the program also did not take into account the sign in screen where you have to find the test and enter it. \n\nLong story short, I could copy my entire page of notes I had taken on the test material, paste it into the section where I would enter my login information. Then recopy it, enter the test and paste it again in one of the answer sections, using it to answer every question and then deleting it before clicking 'finish'.  ",

            "So, as a teacher the smartest way I \"cheat\" is by giving the kids a notecard and telling them they can put whatever cheat sheet stuff on there they want. It tricks them into actually studying for their math tests. \n\nAlso a pro tip from a math teacher; most students don't know how to study for math and this is why they struggle. Think of studying math like practicing an instrument. You need to \"learn a piece\" by practicing multiple problems from skill set. If you aren't practicing at least 8 - 18 problems at least every day to two days then you're never going to get past the little mistakes and missteps which have probably plagued you. \n\nEdit: Please stop asking if I'm your old teacher, It's 99.99% likely that I'm not. This is a very common trick that many teachers use and have been using for decades. ",
            "So, not a teacher, but I witnessed probably the biggest cheating related scandal in our high school's history. \n\nFor context, we had the sweetest old guy as our Chem teacher. He called everyone \"Bud\" or \"Buddy\" or \"Ma'am\", he always helped, he *volunteered* to teach Driver's Ed after school so kids could learn to drive. He always had a twinkle in his eye because he genuinely showed love and kindness to everyone. A side effect of this was that he was very trusting. \n\nSo one day, before finals, he ran to the bathroom during class while everyone was wrapping up their lab reports. While he was gone, someone ran to his desk, found the finals just sitting there, snapped a pic, and then ran back to their desk before he got back. \n\nSomehow, no one tattled. Probably because 90% of our grade level in that class was on board with it. \n\nThe pictures got texted around, but a few people were smart enough to Bluetooth in to each other so it couldn't be tracked. \n\nWellllll after the test, everyone had high scores and apparently someone confessed. This resulted in a huuuuuuuge investigation by the assistant principals, school police officer, and faculty. They traced every text message and busted so many people, all except the ones who transferred via Bluetooth. \n\nThey had to re-issue the test. Man that was crazy. I felt so bad for the teacher, he was really sad someone had taken advantage of him and I was too. Such a good dude.\n\nEdit: Oh hot damn, thanks for the Gold! \n\nEdit 2: To clarify, the school didn't 'trace' the messages. They just had 1v1 interviews with the school cop nearby so kids would feel pressured to snitch. Apparently a few cracked under the pressure, but iirc a fair number got away with it. \n\nEdit 3: Also, the cop was our school cop. Real badge, gun, car, he was just there to protect us against school shooters, bombers, he patrolled for loiterers, ran drug searches, ran security for after school events and pep rallies etc. So, no actual police force was present, just this guy.

The King of Siam knew this and, for his pleasure, gave his opposing neighbors this annoyance of an animal; an ultimatum. Either fulfill the upkeep of this economy sucking, worthless elephant or I come invade your kingdom and slaughter you and your people. Being as powerful as he seemed to be, he probably sent delegations to these provinces to ensure the elephant was still around for years to come. \n\nLPT: Keep that elephant alive.",

So he orders his General Harpagus to kill the child at birth. Harpagus doesn't want to kill the baby/spill royal blood, so he gives the child (Cyrus) to a shepherd to raise.\n\nTen years later Cyrus is discovered alive.

When the act was revealed, it is said that Harpagus did not react other than to gather the pieces of his son and remove them for burial.\n\nHarpagus bides his time. \n\nMuch later, Cyrus is gathering forces against King Astyages. Astyages orders Harpagus, as his primary general, to lead the army against Cyrus. After a three-day battle, Harpagus took his revenge for the death of his son by turning on the battlefield in favor of Cyrus, resulting in Astyages' defeat and the formation of the Persian Empire.\n\nCOMPULSORY EDIT: My first award - thanks kind stranger!",

It was designed as an execution device. Victims would be load into the hollow stomach of the bull and a fire was lit under the bull. Don't worry though, you didn't have to listen to the victims screams as they cooked alive. The head was fitted with a special system of pipes to make the screams sound like an angry bull. \n\nProud of his horrific invention Perillos presented the bull to Phalaris the tyrant of Sicily and expected to be rewarded. Instead Phalaris tricked Perillos into climbing into the bull, locked the door and lit the fire. Eventually satisfied with the test as Perillos screamed in pain, Phalaris let him out, had him taken to the top of a nearby hill and thrown off to his death. \n\nThe dick moves aren't done yet. It is said that when Phalaris was eventually overthrown, he himself became a victim of the Brazen Bull.",

Just one of many storys about Gandhi being a dick:\n\nWhen Gandhi's wife was stricken with pneumonia, British doctors told her husband that a shot of penicillin would heal her; nevertheless, Gandhi refused to have alien medicine injected into her body, and she died. Soon after, Gandhi caught malaria and, relenting from the standard applied to his wife, allowed doctors to save his life with quinine. He also allowed British doctors to perform an appendectomy on him, an alien operation if ever there was one.",

            "Was 15/16 at a house party with my good friend, another girl.\n\nThere were some gatecrashers who turned up ( which weren\u2019t unusual at London house parties) but these guys were older, and there was just a vibe. A girl I vaguely knew, was very drunk and being surrounded by them and I asked her if she was ok and she told me to \u201cFuck off, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nI looked at my friend and said to her \u201cI\u2019m gonna call my mum and dad to come get me do you want a lift?\u201d (My parents were always amazing and said to me that if I was at a party or out and for ANY reason didn\u2019t want to be where I was I could call them and they would come and get me) \n\nMy parents turned up, coats on over pyjamas and took us both home. Apparently half an hour after we left, someone was stabbed, the girl we had asked earlier was sexually assaulted and lots of stuff was stolen and people beaten up and held up at knifepoint. \n\nI had such a feel in the air that I\u2019ve hardly felt before or since and KNEW we needed to not be there.",
            "I posted this in a similar one of these threads a couple of months ago, but I\u2019ll paste it over here. \n\nI used to drive for Lyft. April 2018, I picked up a young couple from a bar at about 1:30 am. They were fairly chill and I figured it would be my last ride of the night. The dude asked me to stop at a corner store on the way to their destination so that he could get cigarettes. I didn\u2019t see any harm in waiting so I stopped, and had a nice chat with the young woman while he was in the store. He ended up being about 5 minutes since everyone was trying to get their pre-2 am beer.\n\nWhen he came out, he asked me to take him to a location that was in the opposite direction of their destination, but was only about a mile away. He said he wanted to meet some friends real quick and grab some beer. Since I figured it would be my last ride of the night, I said \u2018fuck it, why not\u2019 and drive him over there.\n\nNow, I know the town we live in fairly well, but the direction that we were coming from was not a way I was used to going when I would go to this location. So when I turned onto the destination street, I missed the turn into the complex parking lot. I just came to a complete stop since the roads were empty and asked them if they just wanted me to park on the street or pull into the complex. This is when the two of them started arguing, as he suddenly wanted to go in and hang out for a few minutes while she didn\u2019t want to go in at all; she just wanted him to do his thing and get out of there so they could go home.\n\nAnd then something hit my car.\n\nThe sound is unmistakable to me, so I immediately started to look around to figure out what it was. But there were no other cars on the road, so that couldn\u2019t have been it. Then I moved to the next thing on my mental checklist: if something didn\u2019t hit me, then what did I hit? But that didn\u2019t make any sense either as I\u2019d been in park and couldn\u2019t have hit anything. It\u2019s at this point that the young lady\u2019s attitude completely changed. She just kinda looked around, and then said \u2018Can we just get out of here? It hurts and I want to go home.\u2019\n\nThis was odd to me as she\u2019d been sitting in my car for about 10 minutes at this point and hadn\u2019t said a word about any kind of pain. She followed this up with \u2018It hurts and I can\u2019t move,\u2019 put her had to her back, and pulled it out covered in blood.\n\nWhat. The. Fuck.\n\nSo the guy starts freaking out, thinking that something in my trunk had exploded, but it was empty. As he reached over to tend to her I noticed something white sticking out of the seat. This hadn\u2019t been there at the beginning of the night, so I asked him what it was. He pulled on it; it was a piece of the filler fuzz from my seat. It came out of the hole that had been made in the seat.\n\nBecause she\u2019d been shot.\n\nAs soon he grabbed that fuzz we both had the same realization. He slammed shut his door and I drove them straight to the hospital, which was only a couple of miles away. That realization, and the follow up realization of \u2018oh, someone could still shoot you while you\u2019re sitting here\u2019 was one of the most terrifying things I\u2019d ever experienced.",
            "When I was 15, a friend and I went for a lot of walks around town (small town, around 5-6k people). We were going to the cyber cafe in town to meet a few friends and we often took different streets to get places, just to keep it interesting.\n\nWe were about to go to Main Street off one of the side streets and a man on a bicycle approached us. He got off his bike, and asked us a couple small talk questions. Something didn\u2019t seem right about him, he was probably mid 40s. We both kept inching away but didn\u2019t want to come off as too rude, so we answered about the weather or traffic. Then he paused and we said we had to go, and he said (and I\u2019ll never forget it) \u201cyou look so young, I don\u2019t want to get in trouble, but I need to touch someone. I just need to touch you. You should come with me.\u201d And he started rambling.\n\nI just felt terror, couldn\u2019t even speak. I grabbed my friends hand and turned. We sprinted the rest of the way to the cafe and as soon as we were inside we asked to use the phone. I called my mom to pick us up while my friend told the worker what happened and what the guy looked like. A month later I got my first cell phone.",
            "About two months ago I\u2019d stayed up past my usual bed time and as soon as I got in bed I smelled something odd and was hearing some inconsistent banging and clattering from downstairs. I don\u2019t live in a great neighborhood so none of this was unusual but I got out of bed to check anyway and saw flames licking up the side of the building. Yelled at my wife to get out of bed and threw on some clothes and we high-tailed it out. Our building has a shared wall with the next and that one had an apartment on the ground floor fully engulfed by the time we made it outside, ended up condemning the whole building. I was the first one to call 911. Have been jerking myself awake in the night pretty consistently since then.",

            "I was waiting for an Uber on the outskirts of Atlanta with a couple friends around 10pm. We were just shooting the shit after leaving a nearby restaurant and talking about what bar to go to. A disheveled older man walked up a few feet behind one of my friends and struck a weird pose for 2-3 minutes while looking in our direction, and there was no one else around. Then he walked off without saying a word. He came back a few minutes later and sat down on the sidewalk about 5 feet away from us. At this point I'm just wondering if he wants something from us, because there was absolutely no other reason to plop down that close to us on an empty sidewalk. Then a small sedan pulls in a nearby parking lot, parking behind some bushes in the spot closest to us and consequently furthest from any of the shops in that lot. I only noticed because I happened to be facing that direction, but then saw 6 guys pile out of the sedan and immediately cross the street directly towards us. I realized there were not any shops or restaurants still open nearby. It suddenly occurred to me that the strange dude might have been sizing us up when he was watching us earlier, and he came back to \"mark\" us. We were all dressed nice with smartphones out and watches visible, basically the fanciest stuff we had for a night out.   Right as I started to speak up that we should head back towards other people, our uber pulled up to the curb. As we drove away, I watched those 6 guys talking  in a circle where we had just been standing, and then they crossed the street again and got back in their car. I'll never have a definitive answer, but I'm pretty sure we were 10 seconds away from some unfortunate shenanigans.",
            "A couple of friends and I were outside a house party talking. I noticed out of the corner of my eye something dart behind some bushes towards the end of the block - maybe four houses down? It was dark out so it was hard to tell. We stood there a bit long and I swore I saw something again move to a tree a little closer. This wasn\u2019t the best neighborhood (heck my whole hometown isn\u2019t the safest) and I knew a couple people at the party were involved in some stuff so I don\u2019t know if that entered my mind or what, but I got immediate goosebumps. I said \u201clet\u2019s go- NOW\u201d. A couple of my friends looked at me weird, but later one told me they knew by the look on my face something was up. I apparently look possessed. I had my keys so we ran to my car and got in. I didn\u2019t even let anyone get their seatbelts on - I just hit the gas. Based on the news stories less than probably 5 minutes later a group of people shot up the house we were at - the others standing outside were severely injured or killed. Turns out a couple guys at the party were thought to have killed someone\u2019s family member and it was a revenge thing.  This was over 20 years ago and I still get nervous if I\u2019m standing around outside - especially if it\u2019s dark.",

So friendly that one of them gave us a matryoshka doll that he was going to give to his mother later that night.\n\nThey seemed a little too friendly, and maybe they just were, but at one point I went to order more drinks and the bartender (who had been watching and serving us) gave me a stern look and said, \u201cyou should leave... now\u201d. \n\nI found this a little strange and unexpected so naturally tried to question what he meant, but his face was drop dead serious. He looked at the friendly group, then at my GF, then to me and repeated his words.\n\nI didn\u2019t really want to take any chances in Russia and wanted to see another bar anyway, so I grabbed my girl, the doll and promptly left.",
            "I was in college when I had my first solo apartment. This guy across the hall would come over, or invite me over, and we'd hang out a few times. However, I would not call him a friend.\n\nOne night he asks me to loan him some money. In addition to not wanting to loan him money, I don't really have any, so he proceeds to ask for a ride to see his girlfriend because she has some money for him. I agree.\n\nWe arrive at her apartment and a small party is going on. When we walked into the party everyone immediately shuts up and stares at us. He runs off to find his \"girlfriend,\" who I find out is his ex-girlfriend. It is awkward because I'm kind of this guy's friend by association, and I'm getting lots of angry stares. He gets into an argument with her and we are basically thrown out of this place.\n\nHe then asks if I can take him to another part of town. He owes another guy some money and needs to go talk to him. We proceed to an unfamiliar part of town, and he instructs me to park in a fairly isolated spot. He explains that he doesn't want the other guy to see my car...BECAUSE HE MIGHT TAKE IT. He owes this guy money for gambling or drugs or something else bad, and he is way behind on his payments. I left him and spent the rest of my time in that apartment avoiding him.",

We often had kids come in our fields from the neighboring park. They would antagonize the livestock and horses, set dogs on the sheep, set fire to hay and just generally cause stress and damage.\n\nWe were told to stay away and ignore them and tell an adult if we saw them. The police often did nothing as the kids would escape onto the park and the council refused for us to close off the public foot paths through the fields, it was a true misery.\n\nI went to catch my pony from the field and saw he was sweaty and wide eyed. I don't think he understood for a moment that he was safe with me from this frightened look he gave me. I realised suddenly there were six people in the copse of our field. I was suddenly frightened and tried to encourage Toffee to come with me quickly.\n\nInitially the boys ran, I believe when they saw how small I was and that I was no threat the group made way back towards me, the field was fice acres and this all occured in one of the corners. Three of them dropped their trousers and flashed at me. Keep in mind, I was a ten year old little girl who did not understand but had an idea what was implied.\n\nIn a panic I went to grab my pony but he was scared of them and backed away. One of the boys shouted \"if you touch that horse I'm going to rape you.\"\n\nToffee in that moment charged briefly toward them, I don't know if it was fight not flight kicking in or he sensed my terror but it was enough to scatter the boys. I started to turn and bolt as fast as my legs could carry me toward the gate. One of the boys chased after me. I obviously screamed for my life and felt his hand briefly run over my hair before he fell over. I sprang the gate and ran down the drive to the barn where my aunt and mom were.\n\nI always wonder about if I had not run in that moment or Toffee not charged at them if I'd be alive. The field was far away from safety, my parents would leave me for hours alone at the farm. There was a forest and stream as well so my small body could easily have been hidden... \n\nIf any are curious, I still have Toffee about thirteen years later. He's 27 and a very old grumpy pony. I'll keep him till he departs the world, he has given so much joy for the little he gave and he might have saved me had he not taken off when he did.\n\nEdit:\npictures of Toffee: https://ibb.co/BgXnXyG\n\nAnswering some questions:\n-This account was on my tablet, I hardly post or comment on reddit I just look. I did not expect to get any attention on this but I do understand why people find it fake or suspicious. \n\n-100 acres is small for a farm. Do you really think a herd of cows, sheep, hens, horses etc would not take up a lot of space? Think about how much is used for barns, stables the old house etc Consider how much is used to feed the human population, I think that farm barely sustained a few butchers in our area. Most english small farms are over 100 acres and go up to thousands.\n\n-the kids were most likely chasing or throwing things at the horses. I dont know why they do this.",

            "Posted this before, but was very late to the party\n\nI was on a date with a girl hiking a trail system that I knew like the back of my hand, something felt weird but I shook it. We went in around sunset, we were going to swim in one of the deep pools in the creek. Maybe 2 miles into the trail I get the feeling again, and she's talking her head off, but i was just listening to everything around me. I told her to stop talking, and she looked at me very concerned, i just put my finger to my lips and listened. I heard something familiar but i couldn't place it. We never stopped walking. We came to the Arroyo just before the creek pool, and I heard it again, by this time I knew. I told her we were going to walk to the clearing where the Arroyo was at and turn around. She told me she heard something weird. As we came to the clearing we stood there like statues, dead silent. Her nails cut my arm from gripping it so hard. Then around 15 feet from us, the biggest mountain lion I've ever seen crossed the clearing with 2 of its young. She looked at us, and as our eyes met... my soul left my body. And I felt her grip tighten around my arm even tighter. She stopped and so did her babies. I'm guessing she sized us up...and then just kept going. The babies kept turning around looking at us, but ultimately they just slowly crossed the top of the hill and that was that. We turned around and told everyone we saw on the way in that there was 3 mountain lions on the trail, they all turned around and left.\nThat was the first time I was ever scared out in nature. I didn't have a handgun on me, I had been there a hundred times. She told me the sound she heard was a deep purring, and that was what I kept hearing also, I just hadn't put it together.",

The fire department had not arrived yet the cop, having cleared the basement, was not with me at the time and my partner was in the ambulance getting some equipment I needed. As I was kneeling down working on my patient with 100% Focus I felt a hard steel object placed on the back of my head. It was a shotgun. The shooter apparently was still in the basement and I was alone with him. He told me he shot this guy for a reason and gave me an opportunity to leave. I left.",

At this point, a bookstore staff noticed something was wrong and went up to question them. \n\nMy sister & I dashed off while they were distracted. \n\nContinued wandering around the mall & realised they were following us.

My friend said not to worry, but I did not like the vibe this guy was giving. I saw the guy talk to his friend and send him out of the room. \n\nI told my buddy, nope we are leaving now. Much to his protest, as there was a girl he liked at this party. I practically ran down the stairs, grabbed our other friend by the hood of his sweatshirt and ran to the car. \n\nAs we are backing out of this long country driveway, I see the guy, his buddy and 4 or 5 more of them run out of the house with baseball bats and they chased us down the driveway. \n\nSo damn glad we got out of there when we did.",
            "About a decade ago, I was driving my Miata with a friend to a track about 4 hours from home. We left after dinner the night before so we could wake up there and get an early start. About an hour from our destination, 11pm a crazy summer storm hit...heavy rain, high wind gusts, lots of debris. I told my buddy that early 90s windshield wipers couldn\u2019t keep up, I couldn\u2019t see shit, and I just felt like I was white knuckling the steering wheel.\n\nI decided to hit the exit, we\u2019d get some late night food at a Waffle House and wait out the storm.

He called the police and while waiting for a call back, my mother grabbed the children and ran out the back door.

I grab both kids and walk straight back to the car with only a small head nod to the clerk. Hubs was done pumping gas and about to go in himself.

            "I live in New Orleans, LA, and years ago my brother wanted to adopt a dog from a small rural town about 2 ish hours away from NOLA. It was an easy enough drive, but as we got close to the town (Clinton, LA), I started noticing a *ton* of police driving around. No sirens, nobody speeding by, but I think I probably saw 15-20 patrol cars in the span of about 10 minutes. \n\nWe get to the house, meet the foster mom and the dog (who is the sweetest thing in the world), decide to adopt her and head home about 2 hours later. Everything seems fine, Tali (the dog) climbs up into the front seat while I'm driving and falls asleep, leaving my brother to sit in the back by himself which was hilarious. We keep driving and notice that there are even more cops driving around, but still no sirens. They're just everywhere though.\n\nAs we're leaving Clinton, maybe about 3 miles to the exit or so, I notice this old white sedan come flying up on our rear, flashing their lights, honking, etc. I didn't really think about it, but I figured maybe these people were hurt and needed help or something. It definitely wasn't a cop car, but it was unusual for sure. I started to pull over to the shoulder and they pulled over as well, about 10-15 yards behind us where they stopped. \n\nI stopped the car, and when I turned around I looked at my brother. For some reason, as soon as our eyes met, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I realized that there was something VERY wrong about this. I still hesitated, wanting to see if somebody needed help, but as soon as the door of the car behind us opened, a voice inside my head said \"get the fuck out of there right this second.\" I peeled out and sped for the exit, making sure nobody had followed us. We got back to New Orleans safe and sound but the entire time, I was watching for that car to ensure they didn't follow.\n\nI never learned what happened with all of the police cars or the white sedan, but something was really wrong. I should have listened to my gut way sooner, stopping even temporarily was really dumb of me. I hypothesize that there was a drug raid or something, and the cops were looking for somebody while we were driving through. The white sedan was trying to get us to pull over so they could carjack us and dodge the cops further. I don't know though, and I hope that it wasn't innocent and somebody needed help and I bailed. But I don't think so, I think something fucky was going on.",
            "I was 15 at the time. I took about 10 of my little cousins with me to the park. 3 of my older cousins (but still younger than me or the same age) came with me to help. As I approached the park there was a man and two other kids there. He came up to me and started talking to me. I tried to give him the hint that I didn\u2019t wanna talk but he kept going. I asked him \u201coh did you bring your kids with you\u201d he nodded and kept talking. Then asked me weird questions like \u201care you married \u201c \u201care those your kids\u201d \u201chow old are you\u201d. I lied about my name and age and tried to walk away. Then he said \u201cI like you wanna sit with me and talk\u201d I said I had something important to tell my family first and I\u2019d join him after. I smiled and went up to one of my older cousins and said \u201cpretend everything is okay but we need to leave now\u201d. She nodded and I watched as the two kids left without the man. So we started walking home again and I made sure he didn\u2019t follow or watch where we went. I later found out that he had picked up one of my little cousins and put him down again and one of my cousins saw but she froze and didn\u2019t say anything to me. Luckily one of us saw him walk into a house and so we called the police.",

            "(Sorry for format, on mobile- probably worth the read though)\n\nI\u2019m (19F) on a Greek island last May with my cousin (22F) as a part of a trip. We liked to go on aimless walks out of the towns we stayed in to see what was around. \n\nOn our way back from one of these walks we were on a long narrow road that dropped off on each side to beaches.  \nA small green car passes by us in the same direction we\u2019re walking and stops 50-100 yards in front of us, just sitting on the road. We say maybe they\u2019re just taking in the view. We continue to walk and when we finally get to the car, the passenger (our side) window is down and the man is staring at us through the mirror. As soon as we pass the car pulls forward past us again. \n\nImmediately after the green car drives past us again, large truck drives past (again in the same direction) and pulls along side the green car. They both stop for a moment and are clearly talking to each other. The green car speeds off, the black truck drives forward a bit more and then stops on the same side of the road again. \n\nKeep in mind we\u2019re on a narrow road, we can\u2019t turn around because town is the other way, behind us is just beaches. And a couple houses. \n\nThe black truck is stopped on our side of the road, as we get closer, the driver opens the front and back door to the cab, but does nothing else. Just stands there outside of the truck mostly looking back towards us.  \n\nWe decide that this is way too sketchy, both cars were clearly keeping an eye on us and watching and communicating.\n\nWhen we get closer to the truck we Nope off of the road and drop into the beach. We get as far away from the road as the beach will allow us, and start speed walking, the man from the truck crosses the road and watches us with BINOCULARS from the side of the beach. \n\nWe ran until we caught up with another couple and followed them back into town. I saw the same green car drive back past us multiple times as we ran parallel to the road down the beach. \n\nWe made it back to our hotel/apartment thing safely and locked and tied up our doors to the balcony and hall.\n\nin a nutshell: potentially almost experienced Taken on a gap year trip in Greece \n\n\nEDIT: Despite this incident, I would absolutely still recommend going to Greece. It is a beautiful place with many wonderful islands to explore, and some very sweet and giving locals. I have solo travelled a bit and the world is actually not as scary as some make it out to be. The person who just broke the world record for youngest person to visit every country is a 21 year old woman, and she would tell you the same thing. Anything can happen anywhere. Do your research, learn self defense, and always be aware of your surroundings, but always be open to new places!",

            "I was 15 and had just moved to a new town right in the middle of the school year. I met some kids that seemed cool and took them up on an offer to hang out and spend the night at one of their houses. The evening started off great, the host\u2019s mom made pizza for everyone, they had a pool table and a Playstation. I was having a lot of fun, when they all decided to head up to \u201cMike\u2019s\u201d and try to buy some weed. I had not been around drugs at all but was feeling rebellious and nervously went along.\n\nIt turned out that Mike lived in a questionably-habitable house trailer about 15 miles out of town in the woods, with somewhat of an entourage of seedy figures. He was a formidable character, lanky, wild-eyed and rail-thin with a nervous way about him that instantly put me on edge.\n\nI am big guy and he instantly started sizing me up, grabbing my shoulders several times and squeezing my arms. He said I looked like a fighter and asked me if I wanted to fight him. I declined, but he kept telling everyone I was going to fight him. I\u2019m sure I was visibly nervous, but my new friends just laughed it off and asked if they could buy some weed.\n\nHe insisted that we have a drink first. I had also never drank, but I did my best to choke down the warm beer that was shoved unceremoniously into my hand. I took in my surroundings as we drank: there were tin foil and glass pipes on every flat surface, at least three guns, and the rest of the adults looked like they were well ahead of us in the consumption department.\n\nMy friend insisted on getting the weed, but Mike kept telling him not to be in a hurry. He brought out a bong, lit it and started passing it around. This was the first time I smoked weed. He harangued me over how I wasn\u2019t inhaling enough, and then laughed like a hyena when I had a coughing fit. He kept making comments on how I was big and acted tough but I was really just a big wuss (and other choice words that don\u2019t need repeating). He also made comments akin to taking me in the back room and making a man out of me. One of the tooth-impaired women began some long monologue about a man\u2019s g-spot being located rectally.\n\nI wanted to leave immediately.\n\nI took the first opportunity to tell my friend that I thought it best that we leave, and now. He finally convinced Mike to retrieve the weed for purchase and an exchange was made. I tried to walk out but Mike slammed the door when I opened it. He started insisting that I was a narc, and that I needed to strip naked so he could check me for a wire. This went for a few minutes as I just stood there uncomfortably, hoping he would end his little joke and let us go. Finally he said he\u2019d know I wasn\u2019t a narc because I was going to smoke meth to prove it.\n\nI looked at my friend and just shook my head, but he was either too stoned, too apathetic, or just thought Mike was being funny. Either way there was no help there. Mike disappeared to a back room while three men that had been sitting on a couch got up and pushed the couch in front of the door, laughing and telling us to sit down and get comfortable.\n\nI had a hallway behind me and walked down it, looking for a way out. There was a small laundry room at the end and to my relief a door. It was only to my relief until I seen that not only did it not have a handle, it was nailed shut. Mike began yelling for me to come back to the living room.\n\nMy brain was in a tailspin. *Fight or flight. Fight or flight. Do something! Move!*\n\nI kicked the door. It opened.\n\nThere were no stairs, so I jumped down to the snowy ground and began to run. I ran into the woods, grateful that I had not removed my coat in the warm house. I heard a commotion behind me as Mike screamed obscenities at me. I kept moving. Then I heard several gun shots.\n\nMy heart was beating out of my chest. I had a general idea of where the road was and headed in that direction, avoiding the meandering lane that led to Mike\u2019s trailer. I slipped on the hill side several times, but luckily there was enough moonlight to navigate through the trees. I heard a loud truck start up and then more yelling. I was leaving a trail but couldn\u2019t avoid it.\n\nEventually I reached the frozen dirt road and started walking back towards the highway, staying in the trees. I seen headlights coming and hid, hoping it was my friend. It wasn\u2019t. Neither was the next one. I continued walking. It is worth noting that this is years before I had a cell phone.\n\nAfter about 4 miles the road met the highway back to town. It was harder to avoid walking on the road at this point, it was clear for quite a ways on either side, but when a car came driving by I ducked down in the snow on the shoulder, trying to get my head just high enough to see, hoping it was a police cruiser. I did this several times, my jeans soaked, me shivering with cold and fear. It was about the fourth time or so that I did this that I noticed the car was driving much slower than the 65 mph speed limit. Was this Mike, coming to kill the suspected narc? I stayed low and prepared to run. As it got closer I recognized my friend\u2019s minivan. I stood up and waved and hoped for the best.\n\nMy friends told me that the scene inside the house had turned to absolute chaos after I kicked the door open. Mike had gone ballistic, screaming that I was a narc and that he was going to kill me. He had picked up a gun and pointed it at my friends, telling them he was going to kill them for bringing a narc to his house. They insisted I was not and that he had just scared me. He then stomped down the hallway and fired the gun several times out of the door I had kicked open.\n\nMy friends took advantage of this moment to pull the couch out of the way and run out the front door, jumping in the minivan and tearing off down the lane. After turning onto the road, they seen headlights behind them and intentionally killed their lights and turned down someone else\u2019s lane. They waited awhile and then went out looking for me, driving up and down the dirt road and highway, absolutely freaking out and not knowing what to do. They apologized profusely and insisted that nothing like that had ever happened before. We were all pretty relieved to be back together.\n\nNot long after this, Mike and several others were arrested in a drug sting. I was worried that he thought I had something to do with this and hoped he wouldn\u2019t be holding a grudge and want to come looking for me, a lingering fear that eventually subsided, until one day a couple years later. I was working at the local grocery store and here came Mike, looking a little worse for wear. He looked right at me and my heart about stopped.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a big kid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou play football?\u201d",
            "Went to friends house that I had slept over at a couple times already. He left the room and noticed something under his pillow. Lifted it to find a handgun ( we were 12).

I grab my shit and tell him I need to leave, but he stops and tells me it's a BB gun he spray painted black. I stayed, but these days I question the truth of that situation.",

It was a new moon and zero light pollution. We grabbed our flashlights and got on the trail. About 3/4 of the way up, the two girls leading us stopped dead in their tracks at the same time. One whispered to the other \"Do you feel that?\" I was right behind them and heard what they said. I looked up and around. I didn't see anything but something in the air made the hair on my neck stand on end. It was just too... quiet. I started to feel very vulnerable and scared. One of the girls in front turned and said \"We need to go back. Don't run.\" One girl asked why not run and they said so you don't trip. Valid reason but I don't believe it was the real reason she said it.",

Chinese man engages us in conversation, claiming to be the curator of a local art gallery. Do we want to check out some paintings? Sure, we were bored and had lost our appetite pretty quickly anyhow. Well we get to the 'gallery' which was a semi-rundown 5x5m building. The Chinese man talks to us from the doorway, inviting us in to see the paintings which are downstairs. The building is in the middle of a large paved courtyard, right next to a popular tourist destination. It's safe, right? Peering through the doorway, no artwork or obvious function to the building is visible. An entrance lamp is broken with its glass scattered over the doorway, and inside shoddy steps lead to a dank unlit basement. One of us interrupts Chinese man's sweetalking (come down, see painting) to grill him on the broken glass. \"Don't worry, many paintings. Beautiful\" \"No, tell me why there's broken glass\". At this point we're all exchanging glances, when I get the urge to break our collective stupor by yelling \"CHEEEESE ITTTT!\" As a group we turn tail into a sprint, covering a hundred yards or so before we slow down to laugh and crack jokes about kidnapping and organ black markets.

            "I lived really close to my school when I was a kid and there was this big thing for us to play in so naturally I always went to play there in the evening before supper or just anytime I was bored.  It was surrounded by a lot of houses and a busy street so it was a safe enough place.\n\nOne day I went with a friend of mine who was about a year older than me. We had two school yards, one for the older kids and one for the younger ones, the big plastic thing was in the younger kid's yard. There was a small corridor that let us go between yards though and as we're playing I see this guy wearing a hoodie with the hood up start slowlu walking into the yard we were in.\n\nWe stayed there for about 20 minutes with the guy but I felt that something was very off. I was too young to really know what to do and imagined he would leave at some point. The problem was that he was slowly walking around a wall  blocking all the houses from seeing him and was much closer to the exit than we were. I will always remember watching him nonchalantly kick a pizza box around as he made his way closer to us. \n\nAs I turned to my friend to tell her that we had to leave because I felt like something really bad was going to happen, I heard my father below my name and saw him running the length of the school yard towards the door with my neighbour in tow. My father was in his 60's and took his car everywhere and that's the first time I ever saw him really run. The guy bolted and my father trailed after him. My neighbour brought us to my friend's house as they all knew each other and we stayed there until pretty late. I remember her mother trying to explain to us what a child molester was, I was 9 at most and I just knew that I was terrified. \n\nMy father, my neighbour and my friend's father both tried to find the guy, I can imagine how scared he must have been. My father was very tall and intimidating and so were my neighbours. The scariest part of this is that I still have no idea how my father had known, as the guy wasnt visible and I lived a few houses down from where we were. I'm sure that he saved mine and my friend's lives that day.",
            "My friends and I stopped at a 7-11 around midnight in a sketchy neighborhood - we'd taken a wrong turn and were trying to find our way back to the highway.  Two police officers were getting coffee and donuts. \n\nA group of local youths came in, kind of roughly messing with each other.  The police officers looked at them, looked at us, looked at each other and power-walked out of the store.  \n\nMy friends and I decided not to complete our snack food purchases and made to leave - and then one of the youths yelled to his friends that we'd called him a racial epithet, when we hadn't even spoken to them.  I'm glad my car started on the first try, and glad no one was coming the other way as I ran a couple stop signs.",
            "So I was waiting at the train station to pick up a friend of mine. I was early so I decided to stand in the sun right outside of the station.\nA guy with a bicycle walked up to me asking in broken English if I knew how late the train would arrive. After I answered the question he stayed around and starting talking to me.\n\nNow I know that's not weird at all but the things he asked and the way he acted and looked just gave me a creepy vibe. Eventually he asked if I would walk with him while he dropped his bicycle of. I didn't want to because the place to store bicycles at this station is very secluded and to be honest I didn't want to be alone with this guy. So I noped out and walked into the station.\n\nHe started yelling at me. Calling me names but at that moment the train came in and it got very busy. So he left.\n\nA few months later I read this article in the local paper about a girl being raped at the station. They had put a drawing of a guy next to the article as he was not yet caught. It was the same guy.\nTo this day I'm very happy I didn't go with him.\n\nEdit: changed my special way of spelling bicycle to the correct way.",
            "I was hiking with 2 friends and we were crossing through some big farms. One of the fenced of areas had a herd of cows in it. They had like 20 calves and 150 cows.\n\nAs we were walking through, they slowly ganged up on us from behind and litterally encircled us, facing inwards while standing next to each other. I think they surrounded us by like 300 degrees before we realised what was happening and fucking ran like hell the last 50m to the edge of the fenced area. I think the opening between the two ends of the open circle was like 20m and they were like 20m away from us.\n\nThat was pretty insane tbh, I will never forget it.  I learned to differentiate between the behaviour of 1 creature opposed to a herd. It blew my mind how they all worked together in silence. I have never experienced fear physically like in that moment.\n\nWhen we hopped the fence they followed us to the edge. There was one black bull in particular who didn't seem to like we got away. I always assumed he was the leader.",

            "I was in a school play when I was about 12/13. This was one of the rare opportunities I got to be in the school after it had closed so I took the chance to have a walk around the empty rooms while the other kids and teachers were all in the main hall. It was about 7pm. At the back of the school was a bunch of temporary classrooms all in darkness so I wandered in. The temp classrooms had a storeroom that  joined the classrooms together, it was only small with nothing but the usual classroom equipment in. From out of this storeroom came my English teacher. Now, the class and storeroom are in darkness. I know I shouldn't be there and I'm pretty sure he shouldn't either. Strangely he doesn't act at all surprised and in fact beckons me over and tells me he has something he wants to show me in the storeroom. It all just felt wrong. As soon as he disappeared back into the storeroom I ran as fast as my legs could go.",
            "The owner of a Mexican restaurant threw two young farm workers at the bar out to the parking lot, they were drunk as monkeys and proceeded to try to fight but mostly just leaned on each other, all in front of the picture window while the place is full of people.

            "My friend and I, both females, met up our first time back home from college. It was a surprisingly nice day outside in the middle of winter so we decided to get lunch and eat outside. We found a park that had no one there and were sitting at a picnic table catching up when I see a scruffy looking guy in a large work van with no rear windows pull into the parking lot. I didn\u2019t pay a whole lot of attention to him at first but I noticed he was moving around the outside of the van for a bit and he kept looking our way. He finally walked down the sidewalk toward us and passed by our picnic table and walked around the backside of the restroom building to look down the hill on the other side of it. Very obviously casing out the place. He walked back to his van and me and my friend were discussing what we were going to do while I watched him open up the back of the van and start digging around it. He made a call on his cell phone and a few minutes later another male pulled up in a different car. He got out and started talking to the first guy, who not very discreetly pointed our direction. They immediately started walking toward us and my friend and I scooped what was left of lunch and fast walked out of the place while keeping an eye on them. One of the times in my life I could literally feel the hair on the back of my neck standing on end. It could have been nothing, but even now I feel pretty certain that they had something planned and I am glad we left",
            "My friend invited me to a \"seminar\". Everyone were dressed in white shirt and black pant with black shoes. I was odd one out in here. For some weird reason, they were praising founder as if he was some kind of god. When I went in to the auditorium, they were showing how these 17 year olds were earning Rs. 200,000 in a month (which is heckuva lot in India, translated to about $3500) with their own bikes, cars and shit like that. Then it dawned upon me that this is eerily similar to one of the biggest scam in that used similar business model about 7 years ago at the time. I really wanted to move out ASAP. My brainwashed friend was sitting a few row behind me (all of those involved in this marketing were required to do so for weird reason). It was cringey at best and exploitative at worst. Never cought up with him ever since.\n\nThat friend of mine wasn't really bad person or anything. He didn't even force me to buy the product or anything. May be due to the fact that I studied in different city. The product seemed really good from outside but the method of selling really looked like one for MLM. There was another person in that group who was from my school (didn't know him in any way) who forced one of my family friend (went to same school) to buy that product. He then resorted to swearing and abused her online for not buying the product. I'm not sure if it is a full fledged MLM because the participants weren't forced to buy product in bulk. Probably because all of them were students. I don't recall the name of the company, so Idk how is that company still doing",
            "Met this cute girl at a party. Spent the whole night dancing a flirting. Offered to drive her home and she agreed.

            "About three months ago there was a shootout at my office park. My next door neighbor was robbed and beaten, but his partner arrived during the robbery, waited for the robbers to exit, and then opened fire on their cars with an AK47 in the parking lot. (turns out my neighbors weren't Amazon resellers, they were drug dealers). \n\nWhile the robbery was going down I felt sick to my stomach and just knew I had to GTFO. \nI left, and was about to walk by their place when I had a bad feeling and went back inside to pee. While I was peeing my heart was racing, and I didn't know why. I ended up dribbling all over my leg, I was practically hyperventilating. Then the shots rang out - two bursts. I hit the floor and hid in the bathroom. When I finally came out there were people all over the parking lot and the air stunk of gun smoke, but everyone was OK. I ran all the way home, two miles. \n\nWatching the security tapes later, you see me walk in front of the shooter twice, as he sits in his car waiting to ambush the robbers. If I don't go back to pee I'm right in the middle of it all. I also could have left as soon as I got the feeling, and would have been clear. But since I didnt get out fast enough, going back to pee probably saved me. \n\nI'm still shaken up, and I'm still having nightmares. Talking about it here helps. \n\nTrust your gut!\n\nEdit: [here is an article about it with a video](https://www.wral.com/three-charged-in-raleigh-robbery-shooting/18827488/). At the bottom there's a video where you can see the shooting. I am not on this video, I am back inside at this time. I didn't know they caught the bastards until I just looked for the article so that is a nice thing. But I'm crying from watching it. I'm still really scared and it's been several months now.\n\nThank you all for the kind comments. It really means a lot to me. I feel ridiculous describing this as trauma when others have been through real trauma during wars, but it's very real to me and I hate it.\n\nI should add, one positive outcome: my brother-in-law has been checking in on me regularly since the incident. He just sends me a text to see how I'm doing. It's really touching. I already liked him a whole lot but even more now.",
            "A friend and I were exploring an abandoned hospital, and the way it was set out was via a bunch of joined buildings. All the windows and doors were boarded up aside from one place where we could squeeze in past a loose board, and the layout meant that once we were in through there, we had access to pretty much the entire main building.\n\nObviously it was darker than dark in there, and we have to remember which wing we'd come in from. We had flashlights so it wasn't too bad, but then we got to this room where there was a lot of cool stuff left behind (beds, filing cabinets, etc) and we wanted to take pictures, so we turned the flashlights off so we could use the flash on the camera.\n\nWe did this for ten minutes or so, only seeing the room in the bright flash from the camera. Everything was cool, and then we both slowly became aware of noises. Usually an abandoned building is pretty quiet apart from water dripping and wind doing weird things, but we could hear floors creaking, doors creaking... the occasional scrape or crash of metal against floor. Basically it sounded like someone was blundering around in the dark.\n\nNow, the layout means that in order to get back to where we came in, we have to walk back towards the noise. There's only one route. We're getting freaked out so we start moving back through the rooms, stopping to listen all the while. Finally we get to the side hall that we came in from, and we bolt to the door at the end, finally risking turning the flashlights on and making noise.\n\nIt's the wrong fucking door.\n\nWe stand there, listening to the footsteps get closer. We're frozen, standing in the dark, totally cornered. If whoever or whatever is making that noise comes down this short hall, we're fucked. We wait and listen, holding our breaths. The scraping and shuffling approaches, slowly comes past, and then fades. We wait a bit, and then creep out of the hall and into the main building again. Carefully we move one hall over, where we can see a sliver of light from the loose board. We quietly make our way towards it.\n\nThen we hear an almighty scrape and bang behind us, as though someone tipped over one of the huge metal filing cabinets -- I mean, it was *loud*. I yell \"time to go!\" and we sprint for the door, and there are clear footsteps right behind us. We launch ourselves through the loose board and down the overgrown path, before taking a quick look back. We can't see anything through the small gap, but we do not stick around to see if that changes.\n\n**EDIT:** found some pictures from the visit! [Nothing creepy shows up in the pictures themselves, but still good for a visual aid and also because abandoned buildings are cool.](https://imgur.com/a/fXnfek1)\n\n**EDIT II:** just because a lot of you are asking, this took place in Scotland.\n\n**EDIT III:** it was not Bangour Village Hospital, though I have explored there a few times, too.",
            "I've told this story before but it's been awhile, and may just get buried, but here goes.\n\nI was out in the country late at night taking some long exposure photographs of the Hale-Bopp comet as it approached the sun (which was marvelous by the way).  I had driven out of town and just picked a dark, empty farmers field to setup.  Nice and dark.\n\nI'm out there for a couple hours when I get this massive feeling of \"I need to leave now.\"  I pack up my camera, tripod and lawn chair, throw it all in my car, get in and start the car.  When the lights of the car come on I see the wolf that was sitting 20 feet from where I was positioned, just sitting there staring at me!  I've never gotten bigger chills in my life.\n\nEdit:  Thank you kind stranger for the silver!\n\nEdit 2:  I've copied my answer to whether I have the photos from below to here, for those interested.\n\n> Sadly I don't know where they are after all this time. They didn't turn out real well though. I didn't have very good film so I had to take longer exposures to get it. That resulted in them being streaky because of Earth's rotation. I remember being disappointed by the result.\n> \n> It was pretty magnificent walking out every night and seeing it though. I love astronomy.\n>",
            "I was in South Africa in Cape Town with my wife. We were living there for the year and were going to get some dinner so we hopped in a taxi with the intent to get off at Station Rd. What we didn't know is that every suburb (which are only about half a mile long in some cases) have a station road where the train station is at.\n\nSo we ask the driver to let us off when we notice that we had gone too far and he tells us that we should just hop back on a taxi and get back to where we needed to be. This should have been a HUGE red flag. It was the afternoon and still daylight so we were like, nah, we'll just walk.\n\nWe start walking down the street which is one way, and its like something from a movie. Grocery bags rolling like tumbleweeds. Some kid in his underwear pretending to shoot a gun at us, but otherwise its pretty quiet.\n\nI notice some guys behind us a ways back, and as we are walking I see a few more guys turn the corner coming towards us. This feels uncomfortable, but we're suburban American students and just because a neighborhood is poor doesn't mean its a bad neighborhood. So I just look forward and keep walking.\n\nAt this point the people behind us are probably 20meters back and the others 20m ahead. I hear an engine rev and squeal its tires from behind us...the wrong way. I turn around and the car has almost run down the guys who jump out of the way. The car drives up to us. Its a newer model Corolla and an older (50s) Indian guy. He says...get in the car. These guys are definitely going to rob you and probably going to kill you. Suddenly the whole scene clicks into focus and I see it for what it is. My wife and I jump in the car as the guys all run towards us and the driver takes off avoiding them.\n\nApparently the Indian man had seen us go down the street and watch the group of guys split up to ambush us. So he turned around and came to get us. Had he not there was virtually ZERO chance that we would have gotten away without my wife getting raped and highly likely that we both would have been killed in the process.\n\nWe got home and ordered food and my wife just broke down sobbing. To this day, it still feels like a miracle, and I feel super embarrassed by it.",
            "It was early 2019 and I was with my girlfriend at the time walking through the woods near my house as we often did. We were having an intense argument over something stupid when I noticed something through the trees off the trail to where we were walking. It was a man wearing a dark top and blue jeans. People came in this woods all the time but what was weird is this man wasn't on any trails he was in the middle of the overgrowth. I told her to shut up (I know bad idea especially in an argument) and she just got madder at me. I told her again and told her to look in the direction I was looking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first she didn't see what I was talking about so I told her to look for blue since the mans jeans stood out the most, then she saw him. A man walking through the overgrowth following us. I didn't know who this guy was but he looked older, still I wasn't taking any chances especially with my girlfriend there so I told her 'let's go we have to leave' and we walked faster. The trouble was we were in the middle of nowhere and far from any exits and to be honest my girlfriend at the time wasn't exactly physically fit so walking fast was hard for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe walked as fast as she could and I kept looking behind us and that old man was still following us in the overgrowth obviously trying to remain hidden. We ended up leaving the woods and never going back there together. I've been back there many times since alone and have had a few strange encounters with another person that looks kinda like the old man but I can't say for sure it's the same guy as he is always watching from afar. He never does  anything besides follow from a distance but I've seen him a total of three times, spooky.",

They announced that the river was currently at 48' 6\" and rising at a rate of half an inch per hour. For weeks the NWS kept repeating the crest would be 49 feet in early May. Now they had changed the forecast! They were now saying the crest would be 49' 6\" in the first week of May.\n\nI immediately began packing, and loaded up everything I would need for several weeks before going into work.

            "Got an Airbnb in Fort Worth at what seemed to be a spiritual retreat. We arrived to a padlocked gate with cameras, and the lady who opened the door had no shoes on. Looking around there was furniture and overgrown shrubbery everywhere. The main house was dilapidated with rotting wood. We went inside and they asked me and my girlfriend to sign waivers (this was the first red flag). We then walked out of the house to where we would be sleeping. While we walked through the compound, we saw other people that seemed somewhat normal (also without shoes). Our bedroom was an old RV near the back of the property. This RV was collapsed at the front, and they tried to cover it up with a bed sheet.  After trying to reason why this situation was okay, me and my girlfriend decided to look around to make sure it wasn't as sketchy as we were making it out to be. \n\nDuring our walk, we saw these long wooden boxes that had strange labels on them. I was getting very cult vibes from the people there as well, some of them seemed entranced. Then, a little girl came up to us (also, no shoes) and started talking to us. The conversation was friendly at first, but then took a turn. She said something along the lines of \"what if I cut someone up with a knife and put them in the oven.\" At first, I thought she was being sarcastic or joking, but she kept following us and talking about cutting people up and cooking them and then that's when I knew I needed to get us the fuck out of there. I told the lady that me and my girlfriend wanted to get dinner in town so she could open the gate for us and let us out without arising suspicion.\n\nLater on I saw the main guy I met at the Airbnb on the Flat Earth Convention video by All Gas No Brakes on YouTube.",

            "I was in a tiny room inside of a big room where there was a lot of servers. And you know, servers rooms need to have air conditioners so I was always so cold. One day, I started to feel the air warming, I didn't care so I kept doing my things. The air became warmer and warmer and I said \"something's happened\": for unknown reasons, the air conditioners had stopped. I ran to the door because I thought servers were going to burn instantly, but when I touched the knob... It was burning, I almost couldn't open it. The servers were making a horrible sound, the heat was unbearable, I was sweating a lot. Before I went out of the servers room, I turned on the air conditioners and I ran away to tell people of the enterprise what happened.\nFinally, nothing happened, because I turned on the air conditioners, but if I hadn't done it, I would have died, because if servers set on fire, those things that put out fires (I don't know the name, I'm not English) would have left me without oxygen (they are automatic).\nWe still don't know what happened with the air conditioners.\n\n(Sorry if I misspelled something, I'm not English)",

With little else to do, my best friend and I drove out there it see what was what. We got there, and the place is *crawling* with kids in various states of inebriation. Cars parked all over the place. We saw this was a bad scene, and noped out of there.  On the way back to the city, we passed a bunch of cop cars hauling ass in the other direction.

            "I've told this story before! TL;DR at the bottom\n\nI used to really enjoy driving around at night, especially because round where I live there are a lot of country roads and they were fun to zip around. One evening, after I'd been at a friends house, I decided to drive to my church (about half an hour away from home) and back just listening to music.\n\nThe route is one I've done most Sundays for 17 years being driven, and driving it for about 4 years at that point, so even in the dark I felt fine to go 60mph (speed limit).\n\nI got maybe... a quarter of the way there? And my stomach started really twisting. I knew that if I kept going I'd regret it. But I shook it off, it wasn't that late, and the weather was fine, I wasn't going to miss this driving opportunity. But as I got further the feeling in my stomach got so much worse and I realised I had to turn around. Just before I reached the hill pass that's about halfway to the church I pulled a U turn and went home, and stopped feeling so anxious and forgot about it.\n\nNext day, woke up and got in my car to go to church, to find my usual route had been closed. Turned out that on the hill pass, the road had crumbled away leaving a sheer drop that would have been around a blind bend for me. The road issue had been called in by a driver going the opposite direction to me about 5 minutes after I'd pulled a U-ey and driven away. I'd definitely have been, at the very least, badly hurt had I kept going.\n\nTL;DR - racing around country roads at night would have got me killed had my stomach not warned me",

            "Me and my friends, after working the close shift at Maccy Ds used to drive over and go wandering around the grounds of an old Hospital that used to house mentally ill patients a long time ago. It was called Whittingham\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittingham_Hospital\nSo this place was massive, and in the 60's had gone through loads of controversy of ill treating patients, medical testing...basically all the bad shit and between our friendship group these had turned into rumours and stories of haunted buildings and the like. They had built a new hospital next door, but the ground to this place were huge, abandoned and barely even guarded (this was around 1999-2001). Anyway, we used to drive over, park up and climb the fence.\n\nEach time we would try and discover a new building or area. Quite often the floors would give way, or we would have to jump across big holes in the buildings. it was pretty dangerous. But there were wards, huge halls, massive old Victorian buildings with towers, an old church...just an amazing place to explore and scare the shit out of each other. Think creepiest place you can imagine and you're probably on the right track. Like literally something out of a horror movie set. I remember one time, we were walking across an old theatre room and a friend actually fell through the floor to the basement, hurt himself pretty badly but trying to get him out/find him was the worst. I have a million funny stories about this place but there are two terrifying times that will stick in my mind forever. We were exploring one of the bigger, older Victorian style buildings and i had lost rock paper, scissors to climb through the window and try and open the door from the inside. I will never forget that as i was shitting myself. I got the door open and we all went in, it was a huge mansion like building with those stairs that are split at the bottom and curve round to join together at the top. Torches on and in pretty much pitch blackness we went up them and right along this corridor, turns out this was a building of small wards. We walked into one and it was like a loop back round to the main corridor again. So we wandered down it and all the beds were just metal frames with nothing else, as we turned the corner there was one bed, however that had a mattress on it and it was just stained with blood. like a big patch. Was gross. We were messing about shitting each other up as we got back to the main corridor. One of my mates freaked out. He was pointing at the steps and there were drops of blood leading from the ward, we had just been in back down stairs. I would say that's the most scared i've ever been, and when you're already a bit panicky and you see this, we absolutely bolted. I don't think we went back for a while after that one.\n\nThe other time i won't ever forget is when we couldn't get into this one building, so we found a basement door around the back, you know those creepy thin stone steps that lead underground with a wooden door at the bottom. We pushed our way in and were in some kind of underground corridor. it had all of the pipes on the ceiling running the length of it. i'm a big lad, and i was stooping a bit to get through this so you can imagine how it felt, tight, low ceiling and pitch black. We dared each other to go first and luckily i was right in the middle this time. safest place! Anyway, this corridor went on forever, we were obviously in the underground network of utility tunnels that joined the buildings. There were a couple of staircases leading off every now and then but most were blocked off so we just kept going. After a good few minutes of walking we came to the end where there was one metal door. It was one of those classic hospital/jail doors you see in films with the little window hatch at eye level. We pushed this open, quite literally scared as babies and inside the room was empty except for one thing. There was a single metal chair in the middle of the room fastened down to the floor and above it hanging down from the ceiling were two metal chains with those wrist wrap/tie things on the end. It may be the single worst thing i've ever seen. We all knew what it was and what had probably happened there. but to see it first hand, in this hidden underground room at the end of this shitty corridor. It will never leave me, that image. The stories of abuse at this hospital are widely known...but this was too much.\n\nhere's some photos so you can see this place for yourself\n\nhttp://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/hospitals-and-asylums/20788-whittingham-asylum-image-intensive.html",

My sister saw it before I did (because it practically dangled right before her face at one point) and asked me: \"chel what's that?\" Pointing at the penis. \n\nI looked at the penis, the man and then my sister. I covered my sister's eyes and immediately went to tell the cashier and left the store.\n\nMan how I wanted to put him in a hospital but I didn't want to traumatize my sister.",

            "Whilst driving on the highway, I stumbled upon some pretty big rocks in the middle of the road (luckily I had my high-beams on), and I had to come to a full-stop in the middle of the highway. There wasn't an embankment anywhere near me and this wasn't a rocky area so I was initially puzzled as to where the rocks had come from... then I noticed a guy in my rear-view mirror coming out of the bushes... It was at this exact moment where I was like 'we need to leave, now!'. I threw my car into reverse and gunned it... nearly drove over the guy in the road behind me; did a j-turn and drove in the opposite direction on travel on the highway until I found an offramp. This was about 11pm at night on a segment of the highway which is notorious for hi-jackers. Turns out that the hi-jackers place massive rocks in the road at night and when you drive head-long into the rocks and get out of your car to inspect the damage, they then pop out of the bushes and rob you at gun-point, and drive off with your car if it is still driveable. Luckely I wasn't a victim that night. God only knows what they would have done to my gf. Good old Shithole Africa",
            "Me and a buddy of mine went to the casino to celebrate my birthday, I have fun going and getting a few drinks and blowing 100 bucks on slots. Well it's like 2am, were both about out of money and then I hit the jackpot on my machine. Lights and noises going off, it was a crazy experience. Someone from the casino comes out to talk to me and asks if I wanted cash, check or direct deposit. I was drunk and my dumbass picked cash, she left and said she'd be back. While she was gone about 10 people all were crowding around me and my friend and asking what machine I hit on, how much, how long had I been playing etc. The lady came back with 2 guards with her and took me to a room off the main floor. Counted out 9500 bucks and handed it to me. I sobered up immediately and realized we needed to fuckin go. I go grab my buddy who was my DD and we start walking out. This woman is following us, talking and asking us if we wanna go smoke a blunt in her car with her, I'm like nah. We get in his car and fly out of there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really thought someone was gonna rob my ass lol.",

So we pulled into this gas station that looked like it'd been abandoned, or at least part of a post-apocalyptic aftermath and he decided he needed to go behind the building to pee real quick.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was ONE car, running, with the driver sitting there in the parking lot, which happened to be about 20 feet from the side of the building he just walked behind.  All 3 of us remaining in the car were watching him like a hawk, and he got out and stood by the passenger side of his car, kind of looking toward where my friend went.  Super shady.  All 3 of us simultaneously unbuckled our seatbelts because if he started heading back that way, all 3 of us were too.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnti-climatically, nothing ever happened.

            "I got home at 3am after a night with the boys. I notice an out of place workers van before turning into my main street but didn\u2019t think much of it. I decided to walk my dog because we usually do it nightly off leash. As im walking down the cross street I see another random car in the middle of the street under a street light. No head lights on but car is on. I didn\u2019t think much of it until I made a right to loop the block and go back home. As soon I turned I see that initial white van and I see that other car start to move and drive right behind me, still with no headlights on. And that was the moment I knew I needed to get out of there. I kinda blacked out and was in survival mode. I picked up my dog and ran as fast as I could down the street. I never looked back. I was scared they were following me home but by the time realized what just happened I was almost home. I never walk my dog late at night now.",

We are also in a not so great area, taking a shortcut from the clubs back to our hostel. Without thinking much of it I spot a large group of men going the opposite direction across the street. A block later they\u2019re behind us and gaining fast. I did a quickie double-take and stuffed everyone into the nearest subway station where we proceeded to loiter on camera for an hour before finishing the walk home at a brisk pace. Not my bravest moment but better safe than trafficked or dead.",
            "Went to a sketchy party. It's in a building that's pretty obviously recently abandoned. No one checked my ID, and the \"bar\" was a coffee table full of 2-liters and fifths. Ennh, whatev, I'm over 21 and this is more fun than the shitty club.\n\nI did, however, kinda move towards the back. Saw a lot of guys with six packs, and just a lot more people in general. Music is getting cranked up, kids are getting crunk. I figure if no one's gonna stop me, I'm going to grab a six pack at the party store, and if the party chills back out I can hang around, and if it sucks I can drink it at home. I found a store down the block, got some beers, and came back to see 20+ cop cars surrounding the place. Drank the beers at home.",
            "I was at a festival, walking through the field with two friends who were both women.  \nA couple of guys came up to us and started chatting all friendly.  \nI had this slightly uneasy feeling, but didn't really think much of it - until one of them was asked his name.  \n\"Dav-uuh, Steve\"  \nas soon as that happened my blood went cold and I turned to my friends and said \"I need to go back to the tent, come with me.\" They both looked at me like I was slightly crazy but agreed to come and said goodbye to the men. As we were walking back I explained my feeling and how one of them went to say a name but changed it, they thanked me for pulling them away from the situation.  \n\n\nThe next morning I'm sat in a portapotty and there's a poster on the door saying that two men were wanted by the police because a girl was raped the night before.  \nI don't actually know if it was them, but the whole situation was sketchy as fuck and I'm so glad we got out of there.",
            "I catered a family reunion for about 200 people. I knew from the very start there was going to be problems because no one wanted to pay the remainder of the bill (50% deposit to hold the date was already received and cashed, but no one had a plan on how to pay the remainder). So I told them that I wasn't putting the food out until I received payment. After about 1 and a half hours I had collected most of the remainder in cash, about $3000 and someone wrote a check for a couple hundred bucks to cover the rest (which bounced and took 4 months to recover).\nOnce the food goes out everyone seems happy except the event space owners (who are super shady from the beginning, we are actually at a second location that they own because the first location \"wasn't available\" , classic bait and switch). Anyways, the venue owner tells me that the space is booked for a second event that starts in 30 minutes. Personally I don't care because I got paid and just want to gather my equipment and leave. Come to find out, the second group is a college fraternity, that has gotten kicked off campus for violence, so they throw their parties else where.\nI told my team to leave, don't clean up, don't help me pack up, just leave now! The frat boys are already starting shit with the family reunion group, no one is remotely close to prepared to leave the family reunion. I grab all my equipment (after hiding all the cash in my truck) and take off without saying a word. By the time I get home, about 35 minutes later, there is a shooting on the local news. 2 dead, 4 in critical condition from the venue that I just left.",

We saw a bonfire and went there to warm up when we suddenly saw two guys carrying a couch towards the fire. We took a closer look into the fire and saw that it was filled with chairs, picture frames and other household items. Turns out those two guys were high on coke, had broken into an apartment complex and were burning peoples property. As soon as this clicked we heard police sirens. We got the hell out of there.",

They got in a fight and started screaming at each other.  I was ready to pass out but I grabbed her and we started running out of the house beciase shit was about to happen. \nThe guy had grabbed a knife and we started running down the street in the freezing pouring rain. No coats, and I had no shoes and one sock, dragging this screaming crying teenage girl down the street with this lunatic chasing us with a damn knife. We eventually crossed the tracks and got to her other cousins house (I swear everyone in Iowa is related). The next morning no one acted like it was any sort of wrong. It was so bizarre.\nThere was no second date.",

            "I've staffed a Summer Camp for 5 years now. A long-standing tradition is that some of the senior staffers regularly sneak out during the night and drive into town to hang out and generally be hooligans. Me and 4 other guys pushed a car around the bend from the parking lot (to avoid waking up the adults), then hopped inside and headed towards the town.\n\nAfter a couple hours of jokes, Baja Blasts from Taco Bell, and teaching one of our goons how to drive in an empty parking lot, we're driving down country roads joking around and listening to music... That is, until we turn down a random road and something immediately feels off. \n\nIt's about 3:30 AM as we start down a hill, and suddenly the road goes from asphalt to gravel to dirt. We notice an old, rusted boat trailer on its side, a bunch of old tools, rotting piles of wood, and a general mess. When we reach the bottom of the hill there's a big shed with a garage door that's wide open, and another shed seemingly made out of plywood with a door creaked open. There's a light shining through the crack of the door faintly flickering, and a fusebox right outside the door.\n\nThe mood of the car changed in an instant. For just a moment we all sat in silence, watching the light flicker. No one said anything, but we could all tell that something didn't feel right. Eventually, to ease the tension that we were all feeling, we start to joke (as teenage boys do), jeering at one of our friends to go turn off the light or open the door, when suddenly the door creaks open.\n\nThe next few moments are a blur, but I can assure you that was the fastest an early 2000s Toyota Camry has ever booked it up a dirt road. All 5 of us stayed just about silent the during the 15 minute drive back to camp. Something about the Aura of the place felt off. To this day when I imagine sitting in the front seat of that car, I get an uneasy feeling in my stomach. Was someone behind that door? Why were they there at 3:30 in the morning?",

Several dogs are on way too short of leashes outside, there appears to be a few fire barrels (no fires) scattered about, piles of wood, and through the darkness I see a couple sitting in an ooooooold truck hitting a crack pipe. The doors of two trailers open and a couple greasy looking people come out and start beelining it for our car.\n\nI start the car and peel the fuck out of there. The guy who was hitting the pipe stuck his head out of the truck window and started howling as we pulled away.\n\nI eventually found the right spot. The air bnb was pretty sketch but seemed like a godsend compared to that parking lot. Got the fuck out of Sligo the next day.",

            "Early 70s, my best friend and I (both F12 or 13) were walking from my house to the public swimming pool behind the high school. To get there we had to cross the football field. Its a weekend and there no one on the field but us. About 1/2 way across we are approached by a man, maybe mid 20s with a camera. He tells us he is a famous photographer and would love to take our photos for his magazine and asked us to follow him to the creek that runs alongside the field for a better backdrop. (It was wooded and we would have been under a bridge) We looked at each other and booked it across the field and I never really thought much of it again until many years later when i read that this was the m.o of Ted Bundy among other serial killers. I\u2019ll never know who we ran into that day on the football field but i am so grateful that we knew enough not to follow him",

            "Me and three of my friends were drinking underage at a local pub when we were about 14/15. There was a local darts team playing and everyone was pretty pissed having a good laugh.\n\nMy friend knew one of the players from playing darts with him. When the games came to an end and we were all pissed we were invited back for beers to one of the darts team houses. Being fairly pissed and not feeling at all like there was any danger we all agreed and me and my friends headed back with maybe four or five guys from the pub.They must of been late 20\u2019s/early 30\u2019s.\n\nWe arrive at the house and we all sit around in the living room drinking beer. Suddenly the vibes had changed, my mates and I noticed and were giving each other glances to acknowledge something was up. \n\nThe men started making sexual comments and one of them stood by the front door which now thinking back he was guarding it. With that one of the guys actually takes his dick out his pants and shows us all. He put it back in his pants and sat down and they carried on chatting shit.\n\nMe and my mates immediately got up and announced we were going for a cigarette, we went out the back door and ran for our fucking lives. I remember turning my head back to see if they were following us and seeing one of the predators out the front shouting \u201cwhere the fuck did you go?!\u201d\n\nDamn we lucky lol\n\nEdit: TL;DR at 15 years old me and my mates all nearly sexual assaulted by group of dart throwing men",
            "I was driving around on Halloween in 2005 with a few friends in my Jeep, one year out of high school.  It was about 10 at night and we were headed to a party not far from our house.  We were waiting at a red light waiting to make a turn onto the main road when a guy in a van pulls real close to the passenger side of my vehicle.  The guy gestures to roll the window down, which I do, and then tells me to take the keys out of the car and put them on my dashboard.  I laughed at the guy and told him \"no thanks.\"  My friend in the passenger seat then looked at me with daggers in his eyes and grabbed my wrist and says \"hes got a gun.\"  I looked over and saw the guy had a gun positioned under his elbow pointed directly at me/us.  I looked forward, saw no cars in the intersection and just floored it.  I drove so recklessly, swerving over the median multiple times driving on both sides of the road trying to call attention to myself, while the guy followed closely behind us.  I drove about a mile down the main road until he turned off onto a side street, then I went the opposite direction and was able to make it home into my driveway.  I told my parents what happened and my dad chewed me out telling me if somebody pulls a gun on you, you do whatever they tell you to.  It could have ended way worse if that guy really wanted us.  I had a sketch artist come to my house, but I never heard if they caught the guy.",
            "I had taken acid for the first time right after my final ever university exam, it was sunny, I felt not a single obligation in the world - me and another friend who had taken a tab went to the local park, watched people go about their day, there's a really nice Koi pond at the park that we stared at and talked about life around for hours. It is one of the best days of my life.\n\nFast forward and I wanted to try and replicate the experience, another friend and I drop a tab each and go down to the park. We sit at the koi pond, and a man comes over to talk to us, we weren't too weird on acid and could still handle ourselves just fine so we spoke to him. He seemed fine, if a little odd, he gave us both a milky way chocolate bar and was talking about his job. He was a chef at a hotel nearby, but he was also a bit of a handyman and was telling us about doing some work on his mother's porch over the summer.\n\nThis was all completely innocent, but it got weird. He told us his mum lived near a big pond, and there were often Geese roaming around the area. He kept reiterating how much he hated Geese, called them the devil's animal, me and my friend were laughing at just how much this man hated these little creatures. Then he starts talking about how he approached one and picked it up by it's neck before wringing it as tight as he could, we kept laughing, he was fairly jokey up until now so we thought it was a joke. I need to mention again that we were tripping balls on acid at this point. He kept describing its eye's popping out and the noises it was making, this is when a switch flipped in my brain, my friend was still in hysterics about this - I looked at him, back at the man, then back to my friend and said I think it's time we head off. I started to feel really anxious about the chocolate bars, but it seemed they were completely innocent. I'm still not really sure how to feel about it, or why of all the days for that to happen, it was that day. \n\nNeedless to say, I never did replicate that first time.",
            "Back when we were 10, a friend and I decided to bike down to the local convenience store to buy slushies. Since we biked, we chilled outside the store to finish our slushies, but I had this gut feeling that we should bike back, immediately. We biked back to her house, slushies in hand, syrup spilling everywhere but we made it back. We kept hearing police sirens and saw a car drive past us with lights going off, but didn't think much of it.\n\nTurns out, the convenience store was robbed maybe 5 minutes after we left. Who knows what would have happened if we stayed to finish our slushies.",
            "Was in Vegas with my wife and some friends. Got invited to someone\u2019s table, everything was going great. But then i saw something weird out of the corner of my eye as the host was handing my buddy a drink. It looked like he took out a piece of candy and squeezed it out of the wrapper, and then the wrapper disappeared. I turned to my friend to ask him if he saw it and he was already staring at me all bug eyed. He told me the dude pulled out an eye dropper and put something in the drink before he handed it to him. I took it and put it on the floor and then proceeded to convince the girls that we needed to leave.. of course they were calling us stupid and asking what was wrong lol.",

            "I was in a plane and the pilot announced there had been a \"federal aviation incident\" and they were bringing us down to the nearest airport--none of us had a smart phone yet and I assumed it was a strike by the air traffic controllers.  We walked into the terminal and all the TVs were off.  I said to my traveling companions: we need to run to the car rental.  We were second in line and got a car to drive home the three hours.  The car rental person told us there had been a plane that had just rammed the World Trade Center.",
            "This happened in the late 90s. I was around 16 cruising around with a friend in his jeep. We stopped at a gas station to get some smokes and we start talking to these two girls our age in the store. \n\nThey invite us to a lock in for their youth group at the YMCA, but we have to attend some youth group meeting first. Neither my friend or I are religious but these girls are cute so we accept. \n\nWe run home to grab some things to keep us occupied for the lock in and drive up to the church. \n\nWe go in and are greeted by our new friends and taken to the sanctuary. \n\nThe sermon starts and it get progressively more and more weird. And it is dragging on and on and on. To the point my buddy grabs a pen and draws this crazy dragon breathing fire on the leg of his jeans. \n\nAnyway... I notice that the doors have large older men standing beside them blocking them. Then the minister drops this line, \"tonight, WHEN the bus crashes on the way to the lock in, will you go to heaven?\". \n\nWe both looked up and at each other to verify what we heard and got up to leave. \n\nWe were immediately called out so we booked it towards the only non-blocked door. It was locked. \n\nThe folks blocking the doors were now running towards us. We both took off jumping on the seats of the pews hopping the backs. We managed to get to a fire door and pull the alarm and run to the jeep. \n\nOnce in the jeep we peel out and look for the exit. The idling charter bus that is taking everyone the 10 miles to the YMCA is now blocking the exit and the people from inside are running at the jeep. \n\nWe ended up just cutting through a field and down to a service road that eventually took us back to the highway and we booked it back to my buddy's house. \n\nWe ended up waking his parents up and explaining everything to them, who in turn called the police. \n\nThe church was locked up tight with no one in sight and the YMCA didn't have a scheduled lock in that night. There were no reports of a crashed charter bus that we could find though. Who knows where all those kids ended up.",
            "A few years back my family was going out of state, and needed to find a place to dogsit our two doggos.\nWe find this place nearby, and decided to check it out. The area and people looked like awful. It looked like a place youd find meth houses at. But, my mom insisted on giving them a chance. It didn\u2019t feel right though, and my brother believes he had saw one of the workers hit a dog that was there.\n\nStill, my mom dropped our dogs off there, despite our protests. Cut to a 30 minute later, and we\u2019re all freaking out and worrying about our dogs. Mom finally decides that leaving them there was a bad idea, and we go to pick them up. \nThey looked awful. Their tails where tucked under them, and where drooling excessively, which we found was due to stress. There two where calm girls, and they had never acted like this before. \n\nWe got out of their with our doggos asap, and got them to a much more reputable location, where they didn\u2019t show signs of stress anymore.",

            "I was playing flashlight tag with my cousins in their cul de sac when I was twelve, it was my turn to hide and I went a little too far outside the zone and ended up in some guys driveway. At which point all of a sudden I hear -\n\n\u201cI can see you, and my cameras can see you so don\u2019t try and hide\u201d \n\nAnd a man stepped out of the garage I was hiding next to. I immediately ran away terrified and met up with my cousins friend and we started walking back together. \n\nThen when the five of us regrouped in the middle of the neighborhood, a white van turned into the neighborhood and began following us slowly, we walked alongside it for a little bit until we all got a little too scared and we all ran back to the house. \n\nWhen we got back to the house exhausted we were all looking out the living room window to watch the van circle around and then turn into our driveway. All of us were about to piss our pants when our grandfather stepped out.",
            "At my twelfth birthday party, my cousin brought bottle rockets to fire off.  My friends, cousin, and myself climbed up to the roof and started shooting them off into the sand lot across the street.  This caught the attention of the neighborhood wannabes.  They came to see what was going on and decided when they saw us to start talking shit.  At first none of us took them seriously, they could say whatever they wanted but to us they just sounded like idiots trying to be tough.  To this day none of us can understand the reasoning for trying to start something with people minding their own business.  \n\nMy mom had heard the commotion and came out to yell at them.  Our family knew these kids had older siblings in one of the local gangs, though, and our collective spider senses got tingling when they hopped on their bikes and rode off.  We went inside and called the police as a precaution, and soon after the group had returned with a few new members, baseball bats, and bike chains.  Fortunately the police arrived right on their heels and scared them off before anything could happen.  A week later there was a drive by, but fortunately no one was hurt.",
            "I took a solo trip to NYC and was walking around this old graveyard to look for where Alexander Hamilton was buried.  It was probably 10 am and I was alone in this cemetery but heard a noise behind me. I turn and see this super skinny, super dirty dude literally crawling up a set of stairs I had just walked up.  He was 10 feet away from me but he was closer to the exit so I\u2019d have to walk closer to him to get to me car. \n\nI pull out my stabby cat keychain and run past him and hear him say \u201cthese stairs will kill ya.\u201d  I bolt to my car, get in and lock the doors.  When I look up at the wall around the cemetery, I see him standing there looking over the wall, smiling at me and talking to someone on a cell phone.  \n\nI\u2019ve never driven away from somewhere faster.",
            "Several years ago I was at a get together with friends where we were drinking heavily and some people were engaging in mild drug use. We all got together at this guy's house because they had a really spacious, cool house including a garage that was heated, had couches, and was essentially an extension of their house.\n\nOne night while hanging out there the host asked us all to head to the garage because he had something really cool he wanted to show us. We all went out there thinking he had gotten a new addition for his bike or some kind of new game that we'd all play. The host comes out to the garage, sets his beer down on top of a safe, opens the safe and pulls out a handgun. This is the same guy that had been shotgunning beers and knocking back shot after shot earlier in the night. He was absolutely smashed and had no business handling a firearm. He proceeded to point it at us and when I freaked out, telling my husband we needed to leave immediately, the host told me to \"chill out and enjoy the excitement\" and that it didn't \"count\" that the gun was pointed at my face because it \"wasn't loaded anyway.\" My husband laid into the guy, he put the gun away, we left and never really hung around that group again.",
            "At last, my moment....\n\n\nI'm still very proud of this decision.\n\nSo it's January of 2014, Southeast US.  It's a work day.  News has been talking about a chance of snow, but school isn't canceled so off to work I go.\n\nAround 11am, Snow flurries start falling.  There's talk that school's will be closing early.  At 11:30am, I look out into the parking lot and suddenly see that the snow flurries are starting the stick to the asphalt\n\nI tell my co-workers, \"you should go, snow's going to get bad.\" and a backup my words with action.

            "I was at a stag doo (Batchelor party) in Warsaw a year or so ago.  As often happens at stag doos, we ended up at a strip club.  \n\nI was sitting with another guy who I\u2019d only ever had jokey non serious conversations with, we\u2019d known each other years but we\u2019re both jokers so we\u2019re always joking whenever we spoke.  Anyway, he\u2019d always had a history of being with a different girl every week but he\u2019d recently got serious with a girl and they\u2019d just got engaged.  I was really curious about what made her so special and changed his view on girls.  \n\nHe said that it wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d never wanted a proper relationship before, it was that this was the first girl he really liked that actually liked him back.  It was really humbling to hear that although he came across as being a god with women, he had actually struggled to find what he really wanted.  He then asked me about my girlfriend and if she was \u2018the one\u2019 I was gonna spend the rest of my life with.  I was perhaps caught up in the moment but started going into a spiel along the lines of;\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s amazing, she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s unbelievable, I think I wanna marry her\u201d\n\nJust as I\u2019m saying this, another of our friends comes over and hears me saying this, totally getting the wrong idea.\n\nHe points to the stage and says, \u201cAre you talking about the stripper?\u201d\n\nMe and the other guy just erupt into laughter.  It was the first time we\u2019d ever had a serious heart to heart conversation yet somehow it\u2019d descended into a hilarious joke.  We were in absolute stitches, that kind where you\u2019re laughing and the other person laughing makes you laugh more.  The bit that was most ridiculous though was what the poor stripper thought!  From her point of view, she\u2019s seen someone in the \u2018audience\u2019 point at her, say something to two guys and then the three of them erupt into laughter.  She thought we were making fun of her!\n\nAnyway, first we knew of it was when the Best Man comes over and says \u201cI dunno what the hell you\u2019ve said to that stripper but we\u2019ve got to go, she\u2019s sending the bouncers over.\u201d  We thought he was joking but he made us go, we figured out later what had happened.\n\nTLDR:  Had to leave a strip club because I was talking about how much I loved my girlfriend too much"

            "A pressure cooker and a slow cooker (you can get both for less than $100). With whatever money you have left over, bulk order rice and beans by the pound.\n\nAs a Brazilian, my father grew up eating rice and beans, and the meal has stuck with him to the extent that every day he'll make at least one batch. What takes my grandma hours to make the old fashioned way can now be done in about an hour and five minutes (with five minutes of effort and an hour of waiting). He buys in bulk so feeding our entire family of five a full meal costs about $1.50  total. For anyone on a budget, or anyone who really likes rice and beans, I could not recommend this more.\n\n**Edit:** \n\nWe use an Instant Pot for the beans and an Aroma brand slow cooker for the rice. While we could just do everything in the Instant Pot, it's easier because both cook simultaneously to speed up the process.\n\n**For the rice:** \n\nPut in 2 cups of rice and 1 cup of water, hit the \"white rice\" button, and you're good! This takes about an hour to cook.\n\n**For the beans:** \n\nMany of us actually don't eat meat in our family, so our recipe doesn't use any (but I'm sure you could throw some in to try it out). \n\nPut in 2 cups of beans, 5 cups of water, 3 cloves of crushed garlic, 2-3 bay leaves, and a finely chopped medium-sized onion. \n\nPress the \"beans\" button (make sure the timer is at 45 minutes) and you're good! \n\nThis takes about forty five minutes to cook, BUT we always let it rest for fifteen minutes or so before releasing the pressure. For the sake of those new to pressure cookers, there's a dial you twist to release the pressure, and we do this with a ladle from a foot away. The pressure lessens the longer you wait after the meal has finished cooking, so after fifteen minutes steam will still release but far less than if you had not waited.\n\nAdd some salt directly into the pot of beans and stir.\n\nWhen serving, people will usually add a bit more salt, and some of our family likes to mix in 1/2 an avocado when we have them lying around.\n\nI hope this is helpful and happy cooking!",

As it turned out, it was amazing to have! Not only did it erase the monotony of a hardly decorated, prison cell sized dorm, but it allowed us to introduce some variation into our lives as well. For holidays we could always choose colors of the season, but when for example someone needed to stay up and study, but the other needed to sleep, you could set it to a dark blue. It would give enough light to read a worksheet, and allow the other to sleep. The icing on the cake was that they were synced to his Echo Dot. All we ever had to do was say \u201cAlexa, turn the lights off\u201d, or \u201cAlexa, make the lights (insert color here)\u201d.  We ended up never needing the overhead light, and just used the RGBs.\n\nFor $20-$30, and I\u2019m dead serious, get a strip of RGB lights in your room.

            "**breeze litter box** ($25/Amazon \u2014 you just need the pan not the included supplies) + **wood pellet bedding** ($6/40 pounds/tractor supply store) + **puppy training pads** ($15/box of 100) = *months* of worry free litter system for cats\n\nThe breeze pans have a reservoir on the bottom and a sifting top. Put the puppy pad in the reservoir bottom. Put sifter on top. Add pellets. The wood pellets turn to sawdust when wet (urine). The sawdust falls through to the bottom where it collects neatly on the puppy pad. Poop stays on top but dries out with the wood. You can easily sift it out and dispose. The wood absorbs odor and there is no litter dust. Every week (or when reservoir is full), place sifter on clean puppy pad, ball up ends of used pad with sawdust and throw away/compost the sawdust, then replace sifter.\n\nBenefits:\n- **COST** : I have 3 cats and using this system, I can get 6 months of litter for under $10. I used to spend $15/week on litter alone\n- **TIME** : because you don\u2019t have to scoop the urine, cleaning the boxes goes *so* fast. I have 4 boxes with this setup and I can clean them all in under 10 mins daily. For the weekly pad change it adds maybe 5 minutes.\n- **EASE** : I have always been lazy with litter boxes, but this system keeps me on it without extra effort\n- **CLEAN FACTOR** : there isnt litter dust and cats don\u2019t track litter around the house. Sometimes One of my cats grabs a random pallet and chases it around the house, but that\u2019s very easy to clean. Sweeps up like nothing.\n- **GREEN(ISH)** : it\u2019s not perfect but it is less environmentally impactful than litter. The wood pallets are byproduct of the lumber industry, made from compressed sawdust remnants. You could definitely skip the puppy pad and make it very low impact by mulching the sawdust. I\u2019m wondering if someone on etsy makes reusable puppy pads that could be washed... hmm\n- **ADAPTABLE** : I use the breeze pans, but you could drill holes into an existing litter box or other plastic container and have it work, making it cheaper. That\u2019s how I started at my house, but my pans had a smaller reservoir between sifter and bottom so I had to empty more often. Again, I\u2019m lazy so I made the investment for breeze pans.\n\nCons:\n- Cats don\u2019t like change so it might be an adjustment period. I give mine a week of the new box next to the clay litter. I only keep the pellets clean and won\u2019t touch the litter. The cats all want to use the clay until they realize it isn\u2019t being cleaned. Then they use the pellets. Then I don\u2019t give them a choice and switch to only wood. I had two feralish foster kittens learn this way with no issues, plus my own cats adapted just fine\n\n//edit formatting",

I told them the keg was full a few minutes ago and it was a tap problem that I fixed. They told me they just came from the keg. I go back to the keg and find the intake was closed again.

Now my suitemate is a straight A student who gets all As mostly due to his photographic memory. Back to the keg. So I tell him that he needs to leave the intake open to let air in to displace the beer coming out of the lower tap. He then proceeds to tell me that since the beer is carbonated air is not needed to replace the liquid volumn lost when the beer is dispensed. So I asked him two questions; If it is not needed, why is there the upper tap, and does he really think the amount of gas the carbonation gives off in a glass of beer is equal to the volumn of the liquid beer?

Two weeks after I dumped him for being an idiot, he married some chick he knew from high school, and had a kid a little bit later. When she eventually dumped him for being an idiot, the ensuing custody battle was bitter. Since she was a teacher and he was an engineer, his idea was to file multiple frivolous motions in court in order to run up her legal bills and force her to give up the kid. The judge was on to him, though, and after multiple warnings, slapped both him and his lawyer with massive sanctions. The case was written up in a couple of legal journals as a \"never, ever do this no matter how mad you are\" example, and his erratic behavior cost him his security clearance, so he lost his DoD gig.

When he orgasmed, she made a run for it back to her residence. She had the clarity and ingenuity to keep the semen in her mouth and spit it in a cup for evidence. There was a manhunt and the guy was caught. He was convicted of three separate student sexual assaults across the state.

            "Not a teacher, but when I was in 5th grade my school had a \u201cbuddy system\u201d. Since I was the oldest out of 7 kids, I grew up learning how to take care of troublesome kids. The buddy system went like this; A 5th grader would be assigned a kindergartner. The 2 classes met every Wednesday and did arts and crafts together. Since my teacher saw I was \u201cstrict\u201d with kids and knew how to take care and be responsible with kids, I was put with the most problematic kid.

            "Had a kid at summer camp one year that kept acting up. One day he actually brought a knife to camp and was threatening some kids that were teasing him. We got the knife from him and of course got the authorities involved. His mom came in and was in tears. She says that he's really a good kid but she just can't control his emotions and he's never been violent before this little episode. The cops had him in the camp office and during their interrogation he got really emotional and could barely pronounce his words above all the heavy crying. He was telling us about how it feels to be made fun of and how much he hurts. Not one adult in the room could hold back their tears. It was frightening to see how badly he was hurting. Sad thing is that the bullying was never reported to anyone and he internalized it all so well until he snapped. I was very actively involved with the kids and although I supervised hundreds and thousands of kids/counselors, I never saw one occurrence or heard about anything involving this child. He went away for a bit but ultimately returned a few weeks later. A few kids were named and also disappeared for a few weeks. When everyone returned it was like it never happened. We had all sorts of experts show up to counsel the other kids at camp and all of the parents came in several times for workshops about domestic violence and bullying. There was most certainly a silver lining but witnessing that kid breakdown was really one of the hardest things I've seen in my 36 years of life. It truly hurt my heart to see him lose it. Nobody should bully anyone for any reason.",
            "I didn\u2019t see it, but I heard it.

Many of them had a lot of mental and emotional issues. One of our youngest girls at the time, around age 9, was talking to an older girl (around 13). Teen was nonchalantly talking about how she was raped as a young girl before she came to the shelter. \n\nNext thing I knew, at least 10 other girls who had overheard the conversation started talking about how old they were when they were raped. Some rattled off multiple ages and times when it occurred. Just causally..It was chilling to hear so many young girls tell their tales.",

I was asked by my film photography teacher if I could help with teaching by showing some of my examples and helping mostly 9th graders (I was in 11th grade at the time). I noticed one kid was really quiet and socially awkward but he had really good prints. And after a couple days I noticed a lot of film was missing and so I asked my teacher. He said the the quiet kid paid for some extra film to take home and use. I brushed it off for a while until it came to show some of the prints to the class. The quiet kid was 3rd up and I was over near his desk and I noticed some of the pictures he printed. It was two people who turned out to be his mother and father on the floor with what I can assume a large quantity of drugs and alcohol. Most of the photos were of his living situation. It was one of the saddest things I've seen. He was a bright and happy person. I got in contact with him a couple months ago and he's living with his grandparents after his mom and dad got into a fight of money. He now shoots a lot of nature photography.",

He would come in every day an absolute mess. He was beyond violent and had zero control over his emotions. Its common to see those sorts of issues in some of these kiddos, but we didnt understand why it was this bad. He had medication prescribed and on file to help with some of his issues. Well come to find out, mom had been keeping his medication to do only god knows what with. He wasn't getting anything to help with these very real problems.

It was a challenge, but I loved them.\n\nThere was a boy, maybe 10 years old, who would talk to me quite a bit about his father who was in a local rehab program for meth abuse.

I cant wait for him to come home.\" He went on about how they were gonna do father-son type things. It was heartbreaking to watch a child deal with a parent in rehab for meth.

Apparently he was adopted by a family member, but it\u2019s unclear what happened to his biological parents. Anyway, he goes through these intense mood swings. Multiple times throughout the year he would pull the fire alarm and made a break for the school\u2019s parking lot at one moment, and then deeply apologetic another moment - as if he wasn\u2019t in control of himself just an hour ago. During his outbursts he would occasionally attempt to enter a room, and when he found that he couldn\u2019t, he would bang the door and scream at the top of his lungs as if it\u2019s a zombie movie. And yes, this is all while instruction is happening. He would literally escape the classroom in the middle of a lesson. He has caused lockdowns. \n\nAs it turns out, this child is suicidal, and his actions might or might not be self-harming in a sense, since he knows these behaviors would earn him a punishment. Apparently, at home, he\u2019s been reported to jump out of a moving car. Later in the year he also told his teacher and para that he wants to die. \n\nHis class was awesome though. His teacher had the whole class write a note to the kid, and they all wrote such sweet encouraging notes the teacher then made a collage and gave it to him as a gift. After his outburst episodes when he comes back apologizing, the whole class would give him a group hug. At one point all his teachers talk to him after one of his episodes, basically saying how they have such high expectations for him, how far he has come and how much further he will go. My mentor teacher attended this \u2018talk\u201d. She cried after. I imagine I would too. \n\nSometimes there IS a comical side to this situation, though.

Anyways, seen lots of shit but I'll narrow down to these 2.\n\n1st one- Student D was hard to connect with. He was so disconnected from his peers even. He was on the smaller side and lacked confidence. D was the head down disengaged type that usually took a little longer to build a trusting relationship with. I just assumed this was his coping mechanism at school. One day he was gone and another student announced that it was for molesting his little sisters. It turned out there was a big bust in our area within his trailer park where children were just being passed around between convicted sex offenders and used to create porn. The reason truth unfolded was because his little sisters teacher noticed that she had bled through her clothing in her 1st grade class. His little sister admitted that he had been abusing her for longer than she can remember.The most upsetting detail I remember is that his mother was allowing it to happen in exchange for child care and money. \nHe ended up in a juvenile detention center before his court date. Because he had an IEP, I was still responsible for providing instruction to him. What that meant was I would send a packet of math worksheets to his tutor at the center. Every couple weeks they would get sent back to me for grading. The first time I received his work there was doodles and symbols. The next time, he started to write phrases. By the end of the semester, he wrote me pleas to help him all over his pages. \nLater on I found out he was being victimized simultaneously by an older man he met on the bus.D is now married and has a child of his own. \n\n2nd-I had a brother and sister (K+M) in class together who had a unique bond. They had not spent most of their years growing up together as they were in and out of foster cares or group homes. At this point in time, they were living with an aunt but it mostly seemed like they were house hopping between family members. Their attendance was poor and it was hard to keep track of their current residence. It wasn't very unusual in this district because there's a lot of mobility especially around this population.\nHalfway through the year we got a new female student J. Her mother had gone to prison so she moved to the area to live with family members. J made a positive first impression with peers despite being quite and more reserved. She had anxiety and depression so when she stopped attending after the first week no one seemed alarmed It was such a big life change so most teachers presumed she bailed on school. \nIt was at this time K+M, we're thriving at school. They were seeming more positive and taking better care of themselves. \nCome to find out, they invited J over one weekend and decided to beat and drug her in an apartment where they had been staying unsupervised. They kept her high in a closet and prostituted her for income. That then explained why they were wearing new clothes and fresh haircuts.",
            "When I was a student teacher, I taught briefly at a school with very \"old school\" approach to teaching (desks in rows, nothing is shared, no group collaboration, students don't engage - only listen). The demographic that went to this school took their children's education very seriously, and students had very strict parents. \n\nOn one of the first days meeting my class of Grade 3 students, I had the students wash their hands before doing an activity. I was helping some students roll up their sleeves while they were washing. I got to the last student, and my mentor teacher tells me to \"stop\", which caught me by surprise. \n\nShe pulled me over, and told me that particular student had cuts and bruises all the way up his arm, from alleged domestic abuse (the relevant government agencies were already involved in the case). She noticed it when she realized he always flinched when she came near his arms, the fact that he never gave high-fives, or that he only ever wore long sleeve shirts to school. \n\nIt was one of those sobering moments where you realize there is still evil in this world.",

This was my first day working as a supply teacher at that school, and my first conversation with the student. I later brought it up to support staff and they were shocked he mentioned it to me. Apparently he killed his rabbit because his mom loved it more than she loved him. The boy was now in foster care, as his mother was a drug addict. He shared a lot of really dark stuff with me that day.\n\nAnother one (more sad than dark) was at a different school. Students had to write their address for an assignment, but this 4th grade girl didn't know hers. Another student asked me \"do you know where the So-and-So Motel is? She lives there!\" Really broke my heart, as this girl was so young and innocent, and didn't really understand how unfortunate her living situation was as she proudly googled the motel and found her address.

If I hadn't seen him do it I'd probably have believed it he was so convincing. I remind him there are cameras and then he admits he did it just because he wanted to. No remorse, no reason, no regret.\n\nI had multiple other incidents like that with him through the year.

Another talked about defending her brother in court for beating her dad within an inch of his life when he found out Dad was sexually abusing her. The next told about fleeing  the cartels after his dad killed one of them to protect him and seeking asylum in America. Let me tell you - kids have seen some SHIT.\n\nAs a light at the end of the tunnel, after like five of these kinds of stories in a row, I asked if anyone had a happy story to break all the sadness.

I turned around, as my back was turned to the table with the bigger blue. Three or four boys had grabbed a much smaller female, held her down on the table, and were rubbing chopped habanero pepper all over this girl\u2019s face.

No student teacher is taught how to tackle four large middle schoolers to save a little girl. The boys wouldn\u2019t listen to me, so I shoved them aside the best I could to save the girl. Fortunately, the teacher came back in and helped me. The boys were immediately sent to the office. The girl\u2019s eyes were swollen and red.

            "I'm not a teacher, I was a student but i need to tell this story. This is a long one so bear with me.\n\nWhen I was in middle school there was a kid who was really quiet. He didnt have friends since he looked weird and just didnt fit in with anybody so he just kept to himself. One day this group of scene kids were acting all friendly to him, like they were hanging out with him and everything. Then in the library, when it was this girl's birthday he came up to her with this little brown lunch bag and said \"happy birthday\" which just about shocked everyone because he never spoke to someone voluntarily; he always waited until someone would speak to him or ask him a question. She opened it and it was a silver necklace he made himself, it was really pretty. It had glass lined up almost in the swirl and the glass was cut to look like little diamond and they were glued on a shell. She gave him a big hug and everyone saw that he turned red and look a bit nauseous afterward. \n\nMonth later they were found passing notes and hanging out more, some kids thought they were dating, everyone else knew he had a crush on her. The two looked cute together; they would eat, read, and laugh together (before he couldn't budge a smile). He was even there for her when she had guy trouble, some of the teachers called him her angel. \n\nEverything was going fine for them until he found out that she had been sharing their notes to there friends, some of which had really private things about him like how his father abused him when he was younger and how he had testicular cancer a couple years prior. Naturally he just blew up and confronted her. I have to say the look on his face will always stick with me; in the middle of their fight she just went out and said that they were never friends and that the reason why she acted like a friend was because he was ugly and felt sorry for him. He calmed down but was visually heartbroken so he just turned around and walked away.\n\nAbout a week later he just stopped showing up to classes, but people kept saying that they saw him eating his lunch outside at the end of the field. Well it turns out that he ended up getting in-school suspension for some reason, whether it was that fight he had with that girl or if he got in a fight nobody really knows. He got back to keeping to himself, you wouldnt see him with those group of kids anymore. Less and less people started seeing him until its like he disappeared altogether.\n\nTurns out he has been either skipping school or being locked up alone in ISS. The school then found out that he has been getting bullied on the bus and at home. On the bus he would be thrown around from seat to seat in the back and then would be followed home while the same twerps would throw rocks and erasers at him. \n\nThe teachers went the same gag of \"there's no proof of bullying\" so there was nothing anyone could do but it was apparent that the bullying was getting worse; one morning he was seen eating lunch again but he was wearing a jacket (it was late April and the temperature would peak at around 90\u00b0). The teachers took him to the counselor and they ended up finding out he had been cutting himself for the past month. Instead of getting him help they just stuck him in ISS again, then came the rumors that he ate rats for lunch and that he took pictures of the girl's bathrooms. \n\nIt would all be over because he was found dead in the ISS room he was locked in. He had tied his backpack to a chair and his neck with which he slung it outside the window and let it choke him to death. The school then held an assembly to announce his passing and for some reason everyone was sad. I personally was really shocked and i honestly felt at fault for not doing anything. The group that pretended to be his friends all acted like they loved him; their sounds of crying were so fake. The girl he had a crush on acted like she lost the love of her life, how he was always there for her and ended up throwing a huge pity party for herself. \n\nI didn't know him personally but I do wish i had done something and i regret not doing so to this day.",

Wanna-be was arrested and the other kid was hospitalized for almost a week with massive facial injuries - two black eyes, a broken nose, multiple lost teeth, and multiple cuts to his face from the beating.\n\nEdit/Update: most comments are staying the obvious - he doesn't sound like a wanna be thug based in this account.

Miraculously, the counselor called in just minutes, and asked me to tell the student she needed to see him. She asked me to walk him there. So, I did, saying I needed to sign paperwork. My student teacher stayed with my other students, and I walked the kid to the counselor. He ended up in an inpatient mental health center for a long time, but when he was released, he was lighter.

We went on lockdown for the day, local police brought out dogs to sniff. It was chaos all day.\n\nSomehow, the call was traced. Since it was a school threat, DHS got involved. They traced the call through the network and routed it back to him, at least. The kid was already on probation and just had his ankle monitor taken off. Last I heard his father was refusing to post bail for him. He may still be sitting in the JDC.",
            "High school teacher. Our first writing assignment of the year for seniors is a college admissions essay, where they have to write about an obstacle they overcame to make it to where they are now. One of my senior girls turned in an essay about being drugged and gang raped at a party the previous summer. Said essay also included how therapy was helping her and how the boys who raped her were being prosecuted, but that was rough to deal with. Parents were super nice and supportive but suggested she find something a little less \u201cintense\u201d to write her admissions essays about.",
            "First day of school: I pick up this little girl from kindergarten to do a one-on-one session with her because she has a learning disability. She introduced herself adorably and then goes on to unknowingly describe a grudge match style melee that took place the night before that involved her Dad and the police inside their house. Tables breaking, yelling from all directions, cops everywhere... She was so young, I think four year old, so she didn't even realize what she was describing to me. She was smiling the whole time. This was the first kid I picked up that day. Welcome back!",

            "I took a class to europe last year. First night, we\u2019re walking around site seeing and this kid just sits down and refuses to move (In the centre of an incredibly busy square). So I\u2019m sat on the floor with her trying to get her up and she tells me she\u2019s shit her pants. So I send the rest of the group and staff away and walk her back to our hotel. Phone her mom who says, \u2018oh yeah she\u2019s had the runs for days\u2019- and no one thought to say anything! Next morning, she comes to breakfast feeling better, but then drops this on us, \u2018I couldn\u2019t sleep in the night so I propped our room open (sharing with 2 other 16yr old girls) and went for a walk back to where we went last night\u2019 -at 3am! So we had to have a word about a) how unsafe it is to wander a strange city at night b) how much danger she put the other sleeping girls in by propping the room open c) she must have meant to get out unseen because the reception had no clue and it wasn\u2019t picked up during checks in the night- sneaky! 3 days later we give the kids some free time to shop. An older group have offered to take this girl because she\u2019s a bit of a loner and she\u2019s excited to go with them. 30 mins later I\u2019ve got one of the older group on the phone in tears because the girl has gone missing, in the changing rooms of a store. We go into panic mode and start calling all groups to come back to our meeting place. Some kids are visibly upset and we\u2019re standing there waiting and calling her, other staff are running up and down the street trying to spot her, then as the meeting time arrives (to the second), she steps out from behind a crowd of people. She\u2019s been watching us and waiting until she had to be back. Another \u2018chat\u2019 ensues and she tells me she\u2019s taken too many of her tablets and someone told her to hide. Another phone call to mom- \u2018oh yeah she takes tablets for depression\u2019- no medical form was given, no tablets handed in (were supposed to keep them) and no other staff had any idea! \nLast issue (I promise), first morning in our second hotel, she comes down to breakfast and goes straight to the reception to ask them to lock her balcony door because someone is trying to come in at night. That\u2019s impossible because we\u2019re up 4 floors. The staff find her a little strange and funny, so they\u2019re laughing and saying that it\u2019s not possible. Next thing she\u2019s screaming in reception that she\u2019s going to jump in the middle of the night. Another \u2018chat\u2019 is had, a move to another room with a small window with a lock and a phone call to mom...\u2019oh she\u2019s been suffering with suspected bi-polar and she\u2019s had 3 suicide attempts this year, we didn\u2019t tell the school because she\u2019s embarrassed\u2019 -Jesus fucking Christ! We felt like lambs to slaughter- no knowledge of the poor girls condition, medication, triggers, nothing! I\u2019ve never lost so much sleep over that kid. Next few days she was forced to spend every waking moment with the staff and I\u2019ve never been more pleased to get home. When we returned to work I get an email from her SOCIAL worker saying she didn\u2019t think the trip was a good idea, and we should tell her not to go! How all of this I information slipped through the net we will never know- I feel like her mom was hiding it to be honest.",
            "I\u2019m a teacher of kids with emotional disturbances and behavioural difficulties. I\u2019ve normalised the dark shit they do. \n\nThere was one kid that was next level though. He was 9. Could not be around other kids. Had to put him in a room by himself with a teacher and a teachers aid in the name of providing \u201ceducation\u201d.\n\nThe room was essentially a cell. There was nothing in it and you couldn\u2019t get out without a key. The boy was EXTREMELY violent. He wasn\u2019t able to wear shoes because he\u2019d hide razors and weapons in them. He had the lining of his pants, shirts etc. unstitched because he\u2019d hide weapons in there too. He\u2019d try to cut our wrists with them given the opportunity. We had an expert come in who advised us to wear long sleeves so it wasn\u2019t a visible target. He started going for our throats. \n\nWhen he didn\u2019t have a weapon he\u2019d throw faeces at us. He was horribly verbally abusive. \n\nSometimes he was okay and calm though. He had pet lizards that he loved, and a vaguely disturbing YouTube channel where he showed himself petting them... too hard, but he was obsessed with them. \n\nThe age of criminal responsibility in my state is 10 and we were really just waiting until then so he could go to prison. He ended up attacking his siblings too often so his dad moved with him to a farm. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to him now. \n\nI answered a question like this before that took off a bit, and I have so many stories I don\u2019t even know where to start sometimes.",
            "One of my kids smiled while pushing a child down the steps of the playground. He also would kill any bug he\u2019d come across even squeezing the worms we got for them. After speaking to the parents they admitted to him running down a sidewalk and straight up stomping on a frog. We quickly acted and thankfully after a couple of months of empathy practice he was fine. It was one of my best accomplishments to date!",

            "Wouldn't say it's the darkest thing but it was upsetting to me. I'm an early childhood educator and I was working in an Infant Toddler room and had a child who was the epitome of love me or I'll scratch your eyes out. We had to watch her around our youngest kids as she would grab them by their necks and squeeze, if one child decided they didn't want to play with her she would bite and scratch them. Once I was changing a child and couldn't leave the changing table to separate her from hitting and kicking the other children. So I had the other kids come as close as they could to me. The little girl then took a book and while looking me dead in the face tore that book to shit after I'd asked her to stop. I asked for help from my coworker and she refused to help me. After that I kinda threw in the towel and whenever I could asked not to have her in my group as we clearly butted heads.",
            "This happened around ten years ago, so the details escape me now. I had this one guy in freshman university English. He was vocal about being Christian and tried to steer almost every conversation towards faith and whatnot. Pretty overbearing about it, sometimes.\n\nOne day at the end of class, I noticed that someone had left their notebook behind on their desk. I figured I had better make sure it got back to them, so I looked for a name. Nothing on the outside, so I opened it up.\n\nThere were all these explicit stories about sexual violence, dominance, degradation, humiliation, etc, written in the first person. Some really disturbing stuff. After flipping through it, I finally found the owner's name. You guessed it. The hyper-religious guy.\n\nI didn't know what, if anything, I should do about it, so I just left it and noped out of there. Nothing was ever said about it.",
            "We had a kid who climbed the railing of the longest staircase in the building and kept threatened to jump because he wanted to die.

It was a high end STEM camp for kids, this kid P was really young for this class, he was 9 and did some really good work when it came down to it. The usually super happy go lucky kid one day comes in looking super down, so I ask him how he is doing. He said that his younger sister J didn't like the eggs he made this morning and didn't want to eat his cooking. I told him it's ok that she didn't want to everyone had their own tastes, it's awesome that he knew how to cook. He turns to me and says \"yeah I cook because mom and dad usually aren't home, and Sitter isn't always around.\" I asked what he meant by that and he said that his parents are often out of the country, sometimes for long periods of time, and the babysitter they pay for is only from after school to bedtime. I asked how he and gets to camp and he said the neighbors drive him, but when they don't answer the door he Ubers.\n\nI almost cried then and there. I told my boss about it and she handled it from there. I don't know what happened to that kid but I really hope he has all the love in the world.",
            "I had a student my first year teaching who I would often  catch blank starring and even mumbling to himself, this student had an IEP that stated he had a hearing issue and I always chalked up the odd experiences to just that. That was until one day I caught him blank staring and then heard him say something (couldn\u2019t make out what he said), I asked him what was going on and he told me the black man was telling him to kill again. Now as a teacher this obviously triggered several red flags and I immediately prompted for clarification. I said what man? And what do you mean kill? He said the man in black and he wants me to kill.... at this point my heart was beating out of my chest and I asked him where this man was. He stated the man was in the room and was looking right at us. After scanning the room and realizing no one else was in the room I asked him to describe the man. He said he had no features and was just like a black shadow, he said he saw him all the time and he always told him to do bad things. \n\nIt was at this point of being terrified I asked him to walk with me to the counselors office where I could find someone to handle this problem that was outside of my  expertise/pay grade. I walked him to the office and told the counselor the entire story. It was at this point where she said \u201cI know that one freaks me out\u201d and explained he has a long medical history of mental disorders.... I was like are you fucking kidding me? Why would this not be included in his student profile and why was he in class with everyone else? Why do you not tell the teachers this? I had a million thoughts racing through my head. I explained that this was serious and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable having him in my class or the school as I think he needs serious help. Long story short it got escalated up to the principal and eventually he was gone for several months to what I learned was a mental health treatment center. He did end up coming back and even returned to my class and was a lot more talkative, he really seemed to like me and explained that his \u201cvisions\u201d and \u201cvoices\u201d went away when he was put on medication. It still creeps me out to this day remembering that blank stare and terrifying words.",

Him.\n\nHe planned to go home and to murder his family unless I helped him to call the police on himself. \n\nHe said I was the only teacher he had ever had,who was not afraid of him.

            "I heard this directly from a kid from our school program and while it may not be dark it was still strange to me.\n\nHad a 5th grader (at the time) who recently transferred to the same school as his little brother (2nd grade at the time). They both had the same mom but different dads, yet had the same last name (not the same as mom though). One morning the big brother talked about his family. I will list it out to make it easier to understand:\n\n-his mom and his dad got together and had him.\n\n-Things didn\u2019t work out so his mom ended up sleeping with his dad\u2019s other older son, his half-brother.\n\n-She later has a kid with the older half-brother.\n\n-this kid became his younger half-brother/nephew and he was the half-brother/uncle\n\nIt was the wildest thing I heard from a 5th grader.

So after a bit he told us about his life..His wife of 50 years has passed away so teaching got him out.. Also at 18 he was a Ranger in WWII. He brought in pictures himself back then, still had his old uniform.  You would not have guessed this because he was just the nicest person.\n\nHowever, there was one kid in our class that just did respect him or any teacher for that matter.. You know the kind of kid that would just mouth off all the time for no reason.. just mean.. he was big and used that to intimate others.\n\nAnyway sometime right before the end of the trimester, my teacher had enough.. I don't even remember what set him off.. but he went over to the kid and told him to stand up. I think the kid was expecting to be sent down to the principal or something.. but no. The teacher said, something to the effect of.. when I was killing Germans, I didn't use a gun unless I had to.. it's too loud.. no... I came up behind them and stabbed them in their heart.. \n\nIt was at this time.. he not only said it.. but demonstrated it.. he grabbed then kid from, put him hand over his mouth and using a pen in place of a knife went in stabbed at the kids heart .. stopping just in time.\n\nThen he told the kids.. \"I used to do that to boys not much older than you, except I respected them, just think about what I could do to a boy like you.\" \n\nAfter that the kid sat down, pale.. didn't act out again the rest of the trimester..",

I'd been informed that he was shooting already but he hadn't killed anyone yet. Luckily because we were spending so much time after school, he began to believe that he could live a life beyond crime, however, he mentioned to me that he'd never let anyone harm me. He was loyal as a dog, but it was scary, the look in his eyes and his tone of voice let me know he'd kill for me and he wasn't even 14.

            "Not a teacher, but my sister was an elementary school teacher, 3rd grade.  Two stories she told me.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Little girl in class would constantly talk about death and dead things.  Everything she wrote about and discussed revolved around it.  She had a conference with the mother who said a few things.  First was that her daughter would ask her mom to stop along side the road to look at dead animals.  And second, she made the comment that she never left her alone with her father (that's all she said, but why would she say that?).  No idea what happened after that.\n2. Two boys in the one of the 4th grade class took one of the girls from her class into the wooded area near the school; had her strip naked and were caught sticking sticks in her vagina.   Problem was, one of the boys was the super intendants son . . . needless to say, it was basically covered up.  The second problem was that they had to separate the boys; and there were only two fourth grade classes, so one boy in each class.  Meaning the girl had to be in the class with one of the two boys.   Since my sister was a 3rd grade teacher, she didn't follow up or share with me what happened after that.",

            "Play it out in your mind. Have the full unabashed conversation like that person was standing right in front of you. Talk to them. Remember why you aren't together. If it was mutual, then this usually works. If it's one-sided, and your heart is broken, embrace it. Embrace the pain, remember, if there isn't anything you can do about the situation, the only thing you can change is the way you react to it. Amor Fati. Love your fate. \n\nIf this person you wish to \"get over\" has passed on, and everything in the world is muted gray, dull, and terrible, then in my experience, \"getting over\" is not something you should really even attempt. That person, as all people, are never truly gone from this world until they are forgotten. It is your duty to live your life as best you can, never forgetting them, but also living as they would have wanted you to. Go on adventures, pet dogs, eat strange foods, read books that challenge your beliefs, grow as a person, and maybe one day find love again. Knowing full well that they would approve.\n\nI'm 40 now, and it seems the older I get, the easier it becomes to walk away from people. I've met the \"love of my life\" 3 different times, I've loved women without ever telling them, I've been rejected, cheated on, dumped, ghosted, married and divorced. I've had one night stands, and 12 year relationships. The only thing I can tell you is that the people we chose to love, leave pieces of themselves within us. Often times, you don't even realize it until you have the strange desire to go to an IKEA on a Saturday afternoon, and have no idea why until you walk in and feel the nostalgia of walking around with someone, laughing at odd chairs, and wondering why this insignificant thing meant so much.",
            "There's going to be good days and there's going to be bad days. I used to convince myself that I didn't think of him anymore, but the truth was I thought of him every day, until I didn't. People say you need time, but you also need patience. Just when I thought I was finally getting over him, I started to dream of him. I would wake up in tears because of how angry I was that I was doing so good on moving on, yet all it took was one 15 second dream to pull me back 20 steps. But in order to move on, you have to let yourself feel every emotion and have patience.",
            "I'm still figuring that out too, but here are what helped me in the process:\n\n* Sit with your feelings. Acknowledge it. There will be days where you just want to cry and do nothing in bed. Let yourself grieve and cry. As many times as it takes.\n* Try to remove your ex from your social media feed. If you don't want to block them just yet, hide their posts/stories. This includes Spotify if you both have it. Limiting their visibility on your feed would reduce the unnecessary trigger points.\n* If you don't want to delete your chats, archive them. This helped me a lot because I wanted to reconnect back so bad, but i know it won't yield any good outcome. So anytime I want to reconnect back I made it hard for myself cause I need to go for the extra clicks.\n   * Also if you really want to reconnect and know you shouldn't, type what you want to say to your ex but don't send. Do something else like watch a youtube video, have a meal, read. Then come back to that text. Usually that urge subsides for me and I became more logical after walking away from it.\n* Remove photos that you took together out of your sight. Take down social media posts that you had with your ex. I couldn't bring myself to delete my whole year worth of photos in my phone so I put them in my hard drive which I don't usually reach out for unless I want to back up stuff. In a way move the photos from your phone to some other drive that you don't usually see.\n* When you can, pick up a new activity or pick up what you have dropped before. Could be as simple as researching on topics you were once interested in. Reading, watching shows that you never watched but said you would, go to a cafe.\n* This is a hard one, but I realize is required for me to outgrow my ex. To consciously keep letting go. Over and over again. It's gonna hurt cause random times a memory will come up from a simple action like going to the store, coffee, cooking etc. This can happen as frequent as your brain wants it. When that feeling comes, go back to point 1. Then tell yourself that you are letting go of that. Let go of the expectations you have had for the future. Let go of that memory.\n\nTL;DR sit with your feelings and cry as much as you need to, remove your ex from any feed that you see including photos, chats, social media, items too even. Do something new or something that you said you would but never got to do. Consciously letting go in your mind.",

But balance it out with ones that uplift you.  \n2) Realise that others won\u2019t always understand your pain.  \n3) Don\u2019t fall into unhealthy habits (physically, mentally, financially).  \n4) Don\u2019t rush into something new because you\u2019re afraid of being alone for a while. Filling the void with someone new without working on yourself is a big mistake.  \nAnd finally...  \n5) It sounds cheesy and cliche, but rediscover yourself! Before you were WE, who were YOU, and what did YOU like to do? What would YOU like to do now that you couldn\u2019t before?",

            "It\u2019s been almost 2 weeks since my ex dumped me (when it should\u2019ve been the other way around). I\u2019ve definitely been grieving a lot. We dated for nearly 6 years, would\u2019ve made 6 in less than a month. I can\u2019t give you much advice though but I can tell you my experience so far lol\n\nDefinitely start with blocking them on social media. Cut all ties if possible. This was what I did immediately after he hung up. I couldn\u2019t even think about wanting to stalk his profile because I did not wanna know what he was up to. Ignorance is truly bliss at this point. The only thing I don\u2019t have my ex blocked on is his phone number because unfortunately, I still have some things left at his house. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to block his phone number as I have no reason to talk to him since he no longer wanted me. If I were to text him, nothing would come out of it. Plus if there was some sort of emergency on his end and he had no one to contact, I would be available to contact. Then again though, if you feel that you don\u2019t need their number anymore or that you think you\u2019d try calling/texting them then block it if you\u2019d like. Especially if you think you\u2019re gonna drunk call them, those usually don\u2019t end up so well lol \n\nI think I\u2019m finally starting to transition out of that grievance stage and am now entering the acceptance stage. Finally realizing that yes, we are over and yes, I need to move forward with my life. But definitely take all the time that you need to grieve because I am! \n\nI\u2019m not over him at all, I still love him but as everybody has told me, those feelings will fade in time. I think what\u2019s really helping me is to vent to those who are willing to listen and to focus on myself. I devoted 5 years of my time to a relationship and now that I\u2019m single, I have all this time to devote to myself instead. I\u2019ve really started to buckle down on my goals and things I\u2019ve been holding off on which helps to keep my mind off of the breakup.\n\nHopefully this helps in some way. I feel like I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of people breakup during the pandemic which is sad but hey, shit happens. We\u2019ll be just fine OP! Hang in there. Sending you lots of hugs and love <3",

Talk to your friends families just don't be alone no matter what. \n3. Read. Just keep reading about relationships or start enjoying poetry. \n4. Whenever you feel the loneliness crawling into you, get out. Just keep walking or running or working out. Just don't sit in your bed and think.\n5. Adopt . I got so many houseplants that they keep me occupied. You can also done hobbies you always wanted to do. \n6. Realize there are two side to the coin. Your ex might be going through her own struggle even if they broke up with you. Acknowledge it and if you did something wrong learn from the mistakes. \n7. Get therapy if things are really messy. It not only helps you with breakup but will help you to understand yourself better. \n8. Write down Everytime you wanna reach out to your ex. Write exactly how you feel and why you wanna reach out. \n9. It's ok to lose your thoughts and reach out to your ex but write how it made you feel to be denied. \n10. Finally realize life will go on whether you like it or not and you will feel much better after a while. \n\nRelationships are messy but the relationship you have with yourself is the most crucial thing of all.

In my mind I was thinking about how we were at the midpoint, when we were dumb freshmen just trying out life and being comfortable with each other. But in reality near the tail end both of us were worn out from our issues. So I would not want to be with who she has definitely became today. \n\nPick up a sport. Read.

            "Wanted to share the best thing I've read regarding this on reddit. Initially this was a response to a loved one dying, but I think this part works for this as well. From user u/GSnow\n\n\"...As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\"",
            "Sometimes, I like to think about \"the good old days.\"\n\n\"Back then, I never even knew this person existed. I sure as hell can live without 'em now.\"\n\nFor me at least, it helps. Definitely not a miraculous cure for the pain but it's nice to try.",
            "So, I've spent the last year trying to achieve just this. I sucks so much. Probably the hardest thing I've had to do with the most pain and frustration at failure involved.\n\nSomething I feel eventually really helped is actually talking about my feelings. In my situation, I consider myself extremely lucky in this regard. Long story short, we sort of talked about how we felt and came to an understanding that we needed to be compassionate with one another. This helped a great deal. About a month later, we chatted with each other more about it and that seemed to help me even more.\n\nSomething else that helped was physical space and not interacting via social media. You can take the hard way, by using a lot of focus and determination in not initiating or looking into their social media lives, or the easy way by blocking them in social media. Either way will work.\n\nTime also helps. Time to process your feelings and to talk about how you are feeling with yourself or a therapist. You also need time to work on yourself with the goal to be that you alone are what is important. You will hear people say something like this a lot, but it seems so incredibly unobtainable. It really only becomes obtainable once the emotional door opens. It's closed when you are still really infatuated with them. So give it time and hopefully you will be able to push that door open.\n\nTry to stay busy. It doesn't feel like it's helping but every second of every day that you aren't spending mental energy on this person is a step closer to reaching your goal. It takes a lot, and I mean A LOT of time NOT thinking about them to reach your goal. So take every opportunity to distract yourself. You may find that you are taking on hobbies you aren't really interested in, or maybe you'll find a passion for something you never experienced before. Mostly for me was halfheartedly \"enjoying\" things I didn't normally do. I did run into situations where I would physically break down and wish with all my heart I was doing these things with my person. But these emotions are normal. It's part of the process. Don't beat yourself up.\n\nIt took me a full year to reach a point where I feel like I've gained control. I'm not completely over them. A part of me just doesn't want to fully let go. But something someone told me: \"If it is going to happen, it will happen. If it isn't, it won't. Nothing you can achieve by trying to will it into existence or by thinking about it is going to make it happen. So why allow yourself to pour all your energy into this if it doesn't change the outcome?\"\n\nThis was very helpful. I finally realized that regardless of anything in my power, I was powerless to control it. Nothing I can do will change the outcome. All I can do is try my hardest to enjoy my life. Don't hope for things to change. Don't try to make them change. Accept every moment for exactly what it is and enjoy that. Enjoy everything for exactly what it is this very second. It may not be perfect or even good, but enjoy it for what it is.\n\nOnce you accept you cannot change it or control it, you gain the ability to walk away from it.",

Try to make them exist to you as little as absolutely possible.\n2) Allow yourself to be sad and acknowledge why you're feeling that way. If you suppress the emotional urge to be sad, you're just pushing off dealing with those feelings to later.\n3) Don't romanticize your relationship. Sure, there were good times but there were also bad times. Take the bad character traits your ex had and remind yourself why it's good for you in the long run it did not work out. It's so easy to look at a failed relationship through rose - colored glasses and want to get back with them. Resist that urge.\n4) Pick up some new hobbies. Keeping yourself busy and investing in yourself are great ways to come out of a breakup much better than you were before.\n5) Try to start dating again as soon as you're ready. Don't enter into a relationship with the first person you go on a date with... Rebound relationships basically just delay the sadness you're feeling from the breakup. It takes time before you can become emotionally available enough to have a real connection to someone again. However, you need to retrain yourself to talk with the opposite sex in a non - platonic way. Going on dates with a lot of different people will help with this. That way you'll be ready and can take action when you do need someone special.\n6) Suppress the urge to backslide. We all have it. Don't do it; it takes you right back to square one.",

So long as the item was put it, in can be retrieved by me without issue. The objects do not interact in this interior space, and are preserved at their immediate state indefinitely while inside of the bag. My body cannot be contained by the bag, but can insert and retrieve objects from the bag. Furthermore when going through any sort of bag scanner, it shows a single mousetrap. If anyone steals the bag it shows up beside me when I wake up the next day in perfect condition. The bag is impervious to damage and wear. The design on the bag is a simple black fabric that im not allergic to. Any attempts to intentionally damage the bag backfire in comedic and cartoonish manners, such as a sword drooping before it could cut the bag. There are no consequences of owning the bag, nor are there any other bags like it in existence, and the douchebag genie must place himself inside of the bag as the wish is completed.\n\nDouchebag genie.

            "Pretty much everybody from Jurassic Park 2. \n\nIngen set up a defensible position after capturing a bunch of **herbivores** to bring back for a park in San Diego. Then Nick (Vince Vaughn) breaks out all the dinosaurs which proceed to rampage through the camp destroying the perimeter walls. Since he\u2019s been sniffing glue since kindergarten, Nick decides it would be a fantastic idea to bring an injured baby T-Rex back to his team. This predictably draws in the parents which eat Eddie.\n\nAfter being rescued by the Ingen Team **who** **he just screwed over and endangered**, Nick sabotages the bullets in the elephant gun the lead Ingen contractor carries. You know, the one weapon they have against the T-Rexes whose fury Nick brought down on them. When the hunter has the T-Rex in his sights he is unable to put the animal down and save everyone. This leads to a few of them getting eaten and the rest running right into raptor territory and mostly getting picked off. \n\nAfter losing all of the plant eating dinosaurs and already having a tranquilized T-Rex sitting there, the only way for Ingen to recoup their losses for the trip is to bring the Rex back instead. Which kicks off the disaster in San Diego.\n\nThe movie talks about Nick being in a fringe movement of Green Peace. Apparently, he\u2019s supposed to be a fanatical animal rights activist. Based on his decisions I think he\u2019s more of suicidally stupid crusader against human lives. \n\nBut really the master stroke of idiocy, the magnum opus of moronic ineptitude is performed by Sarah (Julianne Moore). This experienced field researcher travels to a dangerous island alone and without means of communication, endangering herself and the rescue team. She gets close enough to touch the dinosaurs all while chastising the others and saying they can\u2019t disrupt so much as a blade of grass. \n\nAll of that is bad enough, but then she performs surgery on the baby T-Rex that numbskull Nick brought to the camp. Then this **expert in her field** travels across the island in a vest covered in the baby T-Rex\u2019s blood, despite (1) Knowing the T-Rexes track by scent, (2) Seeing the T-Rexes act vindictive when it comes to their child, (3) and having the god damn blood pointed out to her by Ingen\u2019s Big Game Hunter.\n\nShe still wears the vest and leads the T-Rex to the survivors. She only realizes her mistake when the Rex is poking its head into her tent. \n\n\u201cToo Stupid to Live\u201d is a well-known movie trope.

How did he live with himself?\n\nTom Cruise also intrigues me, not because he's so provably horrible. I want to know just how shady he is, or if he really is just a super go-getter and he got where he is just by working hard and impressing people. Either way, I am curious about what makes him tick, because he's so unrelateable and inscrutable to me.\n\nEdit: The [Psychology in Seattle Podcast](https://youtu.be/abrAdmoj55w) has a lot of insight into what potentially could have been Cosby's inner landscape and what his mindset was. But I'm still curious because it's all speculation. I want to know what his childhood was like. I wonder why someone like this wanted to specifically be a comedian, to specifically be this amazing fantasy parent for a lot of people, to be a role model. Why was he so conservative? And of course, what was his inner narrative about himself? \n\nMy best guess was there is some horrible truth he cannot face. Something about women and sexuality makes him feel utterly powerless, that he has a belief that the people he abuses must have something so wrong with them that they are worse than someone who is a rapist (him). Maybe he tells himself, \"I can't articulate it, can't compose a coherent justification, but the feeling is so strong it must be true.\" I don't know at what level he realizes that he hates women, or anyone. I think if he does, it's pretty deep down, because to even admit to yourself that you don't like someone means that they have some sort of power over you, and that you're not so great that someone could actually get to you. I wonder if he's the kind of person who if he had the right audience, would admit to what he does. Because that would mean that he feels like what he does is on some level right, but society is not on his level and just wouldn't understand. Or, is this something he never ever talked about with anyone? \n\nIn contrast...known rapist Jimmy Saville...I just see someone who was very psychopathic and people were just toys to him. I read that he used to do wrestling and he broke most of the bones in his body fighting and he fucking loved it. I think he has even less shame about what he did than Bill Cosby, he wouldn't care if people knew, he just cares about the consequences of people knowing, and him being put in jail and losing all his money. \n\nHowever, both of these people had a lot of power, and a lot of what they did was seen as so noble and charitable. They're sociopaths, but why was it important to them to have this lifestyle? They could be in the military somewhere torturing people. Or they could be serial killers.

People tend to scale their lifestyle to their income, buying trivial things, spending far too much on food and entertainment, etc.  This is a bad habit, why? \n\u2022 It prevents you from building up a meaningful economic base to fund investments and things you care about, makes it hard to plan trips, and nearly impossible to manage catastrophies.\n\u2022 Over time, those little bursts of happiness from buying stuff fades\n\n\nDo #1: \nMake a budget. Microsoft Excel makes this way easier than it used to be, providing templates that can be adjusted as new debts or income streams are realized. I found it fun and engaging to build my own. There are loads of tools online for practical budgeting, you don't need to get too fancy (unless you enjoy that sort of thing) it's simply about being mindful.\n\nDo #2: \nMake goals with plans, and try to make it fun. Find some time to sit with yourself and continue the familiar \"what do I want to be when I grow up?\" question. Not the tenuous all encompassing planning that tries to map out everything, speaking from experience, that's insanity. Setting goals, big or little\n\nDo #3:\nFind ways to stay active and frequently eat healthy. Get your heart rate up for 20-30 minutes a few times a week. There are way too options here, just pick some activity/activities you enjoy and build it into your week. Food, again just try not to eat too much overly processed things.. I fell off this bandwagon 2 years ago and the impact on happiness/health took less than a couple months to hit me.\n\nDo #4:\nLast one, but I think a very important one. When you get a burst of energy to be creative, show kindness, spread joy, pursue passions, etc., Grab it and make something happen. Those bursts may fade if your let them pass you by."

            "Had a kid in my year who'd had a surgery that left a nerve bundle in his neck exposed. If pressed it would paralyse him.  From memory it was for spina bifida and for some ungodly reason he told everyone.  \n\nCertain boys took great pleasure in going down stairs behind him and pressing it which completely paralysed him for a few seconds and he'd fall like a brick. Usually onto whoever was in front of him. \n\nSo dangerous. There were a fair few teeth knocked out because of this, his and other people's.  \n\nIt happened so much that in his 3rd year the school installed an elevator and you had to have a special key to use it. He got the only permanent issue key at that time.  \n\nKids are assholes.",
            "In the 6th grade, I had a friend who was a troublemaker and a class-clown. I\u2019ve always hated going to my math class because my teacher was a cranky old lady who\u2019d yell at you for the smallest things. Me being an 11-year old, I actually had the worst anxiety just knowing I could be the next person yelled at in front of the class. The one thing that helped get through the year was that friend cause I knew he\u2019d always make jokes and have me almost in tears cause they were *that* funny. \n\nOne day, when my teacher walked out to use the bathroom, that friend went over to her desk, picked up the mug she was drinking out of, and spat out the biggest loogie into it. We all saw it and just waited for her to come back. 10 mins later, as she was just normally teaching, she picks up her mug and chugs it down. Everybody just starts laughing and giggling, including me, but nobody said anything when she questioned it. It was horrible but I wasn\u2019t about to be the kid who snitched.\n\nLater on during the school year, I guess we had a day where it didn\u2019t start at the normal 7:30am but instead 10:30am, but I didn\u2019t know so I showed up really early. A bunch of kids didn\u2019t get the memo so we were all just placed in the cafeteria until school actually started. Around 9ish, my math teacher noticed I was sitting out in the cold and invited me to her class where it was warm. When I got there, she let me work on my missed homework and even let me eat breakfast in her class. She asked me about home life, school life, if I had any friends, etc. she made me feel welcome. She then told me about her life, about her only son, about her husband who passed away from cancer 20 years back. She was very sweet. \n\nThis was like back in 2008, and I think she was like 70 years old. I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s still alive after all these years. But I wish I could go back and stop my \u201cfriend\u201d from doing what he did. :(",

It wasn't one of the mean teachers, she was mostly nice to students. Cops got involved but don't think they got punished accordingly, i know one of them was in and out of juvie already, and were all around 13- 14yr old, one was even in nazi shit,. I know later on those kids got all tangled in dealing and robberies, probably all went to jail at some point.",

            "There was one kid in a group 3 years ahead of me in a religious school. He was super volatile and it made him easy to pick on. I used to laugh at the jokes and his reaction too, although I did a couple times tell him they only do that because of his reaction. He would flip the fuck out, scream and cry. Turned out he was being raped and sodomized by the youth group leader regularly. No wonder the kid had issues. I feel so bad for him now.",
            "I had a Spanish teacher, Ms. G. \n\nEDIT: This was in Arizona. I found her full name in a yearbook because I had her sign mine in 2008.

She doesn\u2019t have a Facebook either. \ud83d\ude14\n\nStudents would lock her out of her classroom, unplug her computer, and they spread an awful rumor that she was having sex with another woman teacher in front of a classroom.\n\nShe got locked out because a student came back from the restroom and said her car was hit in the parking lot. She ran out and then a kid locked her out. A few kids unlocked the door for her, but that was really sad.\n\nThis teacher was so kind hearted, soft, and an excellent Spanish teacher. It was really sad what students put the teachers through. \ud83d\ude22\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t believe it was racially motivated. She\u2019s white, just a little older and frazzled looking at the time.",
            "Had a classmate come in every so often with a bruise or small cut on her face or arm, but she was part of the punk scene so I chalked it up to maybe hopping into mosh pits, although I had never heard her mention going to shows.\n\nAt one point during our Junior year of high school, she spoke to a few people sitting close (myself included) about going through the emancipation process of separating from her parents and living with a friend. It was also around this time that I noticed the bruises weren\u2019t occurring anymore. \n\nIt took me a full five years to figure that one out. It\u2019s been a full 18 years since the incidents and she\u2019s doing much better.",
            "This actually happened to me\n\nA group of 3 kids that used to be my friends invited me to come hang out with them at the lake. I had kind of been outcast from the group because I wasn\u2019t \u201ccool enough (or whatever)\u201d, so I was eager to get together with them.\n\nWhen I got there, they had apparently stolen all of my school books out of my locker and threw them all in the lake right in front of me. They laughed hysterically and just left without saying a word.\n\nThe next day, when I went to confront them about it at school, one of them had collected a ziploc bag full of all 3 of their clipped fingernails and toenails and threw them in my face. Some got in my mouth, some got in my eyes, some got in my ear. I broke down crying and gagging.\n\nNobody faced any consequences other than me because I pushed the kid away from me and he fell into a teacher carrying coffee. \n\nI was suspended for two days and had to pay for all the books that they destroyed because I had no proof that they were the ones that did it. I didn\u2019t do well in school and had anger problems, so the teacher\u2019s assumed that I was the one who did it and tried to blame the other kids.\n\nSchool is fucking rough, man.",

            "I had this teacher whos breath was HORRIBLE. Like someone literally took a crap in her mouth horrible. Anyway, this one kid left a big bottle of mouthwash on her desk when she wasn't looking one day. The whole class was laughing. Then she turned around and saw it...and you could see her kind of \"die\" inside. She went on to tearfully explain to the class how she had some kind of an intestinal issue that she has been suffering with and that she realizes her breath is bad. Then she excused herself from the class for the remainder of the period. Now as a kid, I thought that was hilarious until she started to cry. And how she was able to continue teaching us monsters after that is not something I will ever understand. And if that had been MY wife or mother, I would have encouraged her to quit.",

This guy was hot, tall, model looks and such, and what started with a bunch of girls openly gawking at him and agreeing he was sexy...escalated. I remember feeling genuinely bad for this guy - he just wanted to teach, he seemed to really want to do a good job, but he ended up getting sexually harassed like crazy. In the end, I think he got transferred within the district to a middle school or something, and I remember the principal ranting and screaming about how inappropriate some of the girls had been.",

This was in 9th or 10th grade back in '01 or '02.\nMost of the class thought it was funny and the rest didn't care too much. Different times.

Anyway he sustained a shrapnel wound and needed very strong medication for it. In 11th and 12th grade he was gone for the majority of the school year, as asshole kids we broke into his desk and found a morphine patch. Obviously we thought this would be a fine time to let someone wear it. We as not even fully functioning adults thought it was fine to let another person wear a morphine patch designed for someone much heavier with a higher resistance to it. We finally realized the enormity of our fuck up when someone asked the kid how he felt and he said he felt his heartbeat slowing down. It was a collective oh fuck moment as everyone rushed forward to remove the patch. He lived and our sub, who was an english teacher and not a plumbing teacher had no clue it ever happened.  We were not a smart group.\n\n(My teacher went to Vietnam, volunteered for a second tour and carried his wounded friend to a helicopter while under enemy fire when he got wounded.)",

Nothing ever happened to him. I believe they both moved across the country and later got divorced, it seems she got too old for him.\n\nAll of us dumb high schoolers thought it was funny.

            "Pretty late comment so I doubt anyone is going to read this story, but it has stuck with me my entire life and I still think about it from time to time.\n\nWe used to have a girl in my class, Jordan, who was severely overweight and autistic. Kids being as ruthless as they are, always picked on her for being different. Instead of \"yo mama's so fat\" jokes they'd say, \"Jordan's so fat\", among other cruel things. Whenever she'd get frustrated with them she would hide her face in her shirt and cry. Well, the reason why she was overweight was because weight gain was a side effect of the medication she had to take for her autism, but most kids were too naive to care or understand.\n\nI was one of the few people who felt sorry for her and understood her, because my brother has autism. We sat next to each other in 4th grade and I would help her out with her school work if she was confused and would reassure her that things would be okay in times of trouble. She then saw me as an ally and would show me her drawings and the good grades that she would get from time to time. I'd always give her compliments for both.\n\nAfter that year, I never saw her again. That summer between 4th and 5th grade, she came down with a rare disease and was hospitalized. To this day, I still don't know exactly what it was. But she ended up profusley bleeding into her stomach and puking it all out. She died within five hours from blood loss.\n\nOnly about 20 kids from our entire class came to the funeral. It kinda pissed me off, but I assume most of them who didn't come did not feel welcome because they were ashamed of the way they treated her.\n\nWhen I got there and saw a few of my peers, the select few of us who accepted her for who she was, standing in front of her coffin. I joined them. It was open casket. We all stood in silence. I guarantee none of us have forgotten that moment. Ten years old, seeing one of our peers lifeless. I mean she looked lifeless. The mortician tried their best to use makeup, but her body was so pale that you couldn't hide it. It was a traumatizing sight. The whole thing was just so sad.\n\nA few weeks later, her mom had a garage sale to sell most of Jordan's stuff. Partly because it pained her mom to see her things around the house, and partly because her mom needed the money after the hospital bills and the funeral. She worked as a dishwasher for the high school, so it wasn't the best paying job.\n\nWhen I got to talking with her mom and she realized my name, she started bawling. She told me that Jordan talked about me all the time at home. I was her closest friend in our classroom that past year. She thanked me for being her friend and hugged me for what felt like an eternity, and I didn't mind at all. She took me inside and let me look at Jordan's drawings in a sketchbook, (her mom didn't sell that for obvious reasons), and I stumbled upon a drawing she made of me and her sitting at our desks with big smiley faces. I couldn't fight back the tears. Her mom rubbed my shoulder and cried with me.\n\nWe sat for a few hours and her mom told me countless stories of her late daughter. I enjoyed listening to them. I got to know her better and it made me beileve knowing those stories that a part of her will live on in my memory. When I left, her mom let me keep the drawing she made of us. I still have it to this day.\n\nThe whole thing was quite a traumatic experience for everyone in my grade. But I guess in the long run, it brought us together as a class. It opened our eyes to the blatant fact that we bullied a kid and now she's dead. After that realization, we all had an unspoken understanding that it was wrong and we'd never do it again. All the way up to graduation, we never had a single fight within my class. Everyone was just so nice to each other. Even though we had our cliques, any one of us could sit down at anybody's table during lunch and we'd let them jump in the conversation.\n\nRest her innocent, beautiful soul. Her untimely death inadvertently brought peace and understanding to our entire class.",
            "When I was in junior high, there was a kid that was a bully.  Kid wasn\u2019t too smart, was overweight, was on the poor side, etc. (basically a real life Nelson from the Simpsons).\n\nOne day at lunch, a group of kids were venting about the bully and another kid who was pretty tough just happened to be there.  One kid jokingly asks the tough kid \u201cHow much $$$ would it take for you to punch the bully?\u201d  He gives an answer, probably not really thinking it wasn\u2019t going anywhere but one thing leads to another and kids start what amounts to a grass roots verbal Go Fund Me campaign (long before Go Fund Me or even the Internet was a thing), pitching in spare change.  Goal is reached, but by this time, the bully got wind of what was happening.  Bully is the first one out of the lunch room, with tough kid and probably 40 other kids chasing because they want to see it go down.  Tough kid finally catches up to the bully just as a teacher steps into the hall and realizes something\u2019s going on.  She tries to get between the 2, tough kid reaches over her and punches bully just once, stops and let\u2019s the teacher escort him to the office without objection.  It was like one of those TV shows where someone ends up killing the perp out of revenge right in front of the cops and turns around and holds out their hands to be cuffed.\n\nClassic case of teenagers and hive mind.  Looking back, the bully really wasn\u2019t even that bad.  It was more the threat of being beaten up than him actually acting on it, and it probably was somewhat of a survival mechanism given his personal situation.  But when you\u2019re in junior high, you don\u2019t exactly have that wisdom and maturity, so the idea of finding a hired gun seemed like karma at the time.",

It looks a lot like you're having an orgasm.\" The response from us girls would always be a haphazard \"eww Jason, that's gross!\" And then we'd roll our eyes and move on, because \"that's just Jason!\"\n\nYears later I got a message from him totally out of the blue, (haven't seen him in years,) and he'd sent me a photo that had come up on Facebook of me at his 21st. It was a typical embarrassing photo of me mid conversation looking really weird. I thought he'd sent it to me just as a \"remember this silly photo of you\" thing, but once again he made a gross comment about how it looks like I'm \"enjoying myself a little too much\" and that I'm doing something a lot dirtier than what I had said I was. Getting this message from him now as someone in their late 20's just made me feel really gross and uncomfortable. It really made me realise how much of a perv he actually is, and I told him it was a gross, inappropriate comment to make to anyone, and promptly blocked him.\n\nEdit: thank you kind stranger for the gold.",

            "In highschool we had a Geography teacher who students used to torture because he had a nervous breakdown in the past. \n\nHow this particular teacher used to deal with disruption is by asking students to leave his class and standout in the hallway. So one particular day we decided to play a game of how many people could we get standing in the hall by the time the class ended. We got up to 14 of the 25 students and then the Vice Principal saw us all and got angry at the teacher for making us wait outside instead of just dealing with our bullshit. \n\nI believe said teacher eventually retired in the early 2010s after yet another nervous breakdown.",

            "When I was in 4th grade this girl used to sit on boys laps on the playground during recess and be a tease to everyone.  She was sitting on my friend's lap and whispered in his ear \"come over to my house on Sunday at 3 and i'll show it all to you.  I was at my friend's house that weekend for a sleepover and we went to her house at 3 (we all lived in the same condo development and she was in the next square over).  We go in and she's home alone. The house is a mess with bottles all over and it smells like a wet ashtray.  She makes us promise not to tell anyone and that we weren't allowed to touch unless her Mom was there.  She starts dancing.  Takes off all her clothes and gives us an adult level strip show in her living room.  As 10 year olds we thought it was pretty wild.  She gives my friend a big kiss on the mouth after and says she'll let us know the next day she's alone so we can come over again.  About a week or so later she disappears from school.  I'm over at my friends house that afternoon and there's probably 6 cop cars at her house.  I found out later that the parents were bikers and her dad was in jail and her mom was entertaining the other biker friends at the house and letting her daughter join in. I didn't see her again until high school and she told me she was living with her Aunt and wasn't allowed to hang out with boys.  I never realized how fucked up the whole thing was until i was much older.  \nTLDR; Girl in 4th grade was abused and would do VERY inappropriate things with her classmates on the DL.",
            "So much racism. \n\nOur water polo team was banned from playing the Jewish school in our city because one dickhead drew swastikas all over himself in the change room before the game and walked out doing a nazi salute. That guy and his group of friends would regularly drop our countries version of the n-bomb too. They were a small group from a specific culture, and were very proud of our countries racist past and that part of our countries culture. They would regularly bully anyone from any other culture/race. The ringleader swastika guy always got a pass because \"he was a good kid from a bad home\" and our head teacher happened to be from the same culture.\n\nWe literally used to have group fights between the 4 main cultures/races at our school, there were even allegiances, like a pg16 prison gang war with the occasional knife or spade to spice it up.\n\nHell, I used to say \"thank you, come again\" when my Indian friend had to stand up in front of the class and present. I didn't even know where the reference came from, I just heard other people say it. He was my friend but looking back he was probably just too shy to tell us to stop.\n\nThe list goes on and on.

            "The friend/classmate was me and another friend, and we pulled a prank on our friend for April Fool's day. This is one of the worst things i've ever done to someone. \n\nOur friend (let's call her Jessica) had this older man in her neighborhood who was a family friend of her mom and step-dad. She had expressed to us in the past this man was pretty creepy towards her and made her very uncomfortable. For example, she once found him in her room picking through her dirty clothes, with the excuse that he was going to help her with her laundry. But, as is often the case with high schoolers, she didn't feel like she had any actual proof and that her parents wouldn't believe her, so just kept quiet about it all until she told us in confidence as friends. \n\nOn April Fools my junior year, my friend (let's call her Trish) and I wanted to pull a prank on Jessica because she had done something to annoy us recently. I don't even remember what it was, which speaks to how incredibly dumb this all was. We decided it would be hilarious to borrow someone else's phone who she didn't have in her contacts and text her pretending to be the creepy guy. During homeroom we sent her some pretty fucked up texts, things like \"see you through your window tonight\". \n\nJessica, understandably, flipped the fuck out and had a panic attack when receiving the texts. She went to the nurse and then the principle and told them everything. Her parents were called into the school and it was only then that they identified that the number wasn't the creepy guy, and at that point another mutual friend who knew about what Trish and I did spilled the beans. \n\nThe most shameful part about this for me is that Trish and I still thought it was funny as all hell even after getting caught. And so did a lot of our mutual friends. Jessica, after recovering, laughed along with us though in retrospect she was clearly pissed off about the whole thing, which was confirmed in ensuing months as she slowly broke off her friendship with us. It wasn't until I went to college and started to really examine the kind of person I was in high school that I began to feel ashamed for it. Both Trish and I did offer Jessica a heartfelt apology, but at that point it was two years too late. Neither of us have spoken with her since. \n\nI guess if there is any silver lining, her parents did listen to her about the guy and he was no longer invited to their house, and ostracized from the neighborhood in general. Not sure what ever happened with him long term though. \n\nMorale of the story: posing as a stranger sexually harassing your friend over text is an absolutely shithead thing to do.",

            "When I was on the high school hockey team years ago, we used to do a hazing thing called \"frag out\". The rink we practiced at every day had small showers, just a 15 by 15 foot cube with multiple shower heads and everybody showered together. There was no natural light. One of the \"initiation procedures\" for the newer players was to yelp \"frag out\" into the shower, turn off the lights, and then throw in a lacrosse ball as hard as we could, then shut and lock the door. Inside the shower, in pitch darkness, the lacrosse ball would ricochet around madly, striking players as it did. I can tell from personal experience that it hurts like hell, but when it happens to someone else, it was so damn funny. I'm guilty of doing it as well, but at the time, we thought it was OK. I do know that there is now a zero tolerance rule for hazing on that team.",

We were all ready at the ambulance bay, unsure of the woman's complete condition.\n\nShe rolled in breathing on her own, but very labored with asymmetrical chest expansion. She was profusely bleeding, had multiple deep lacerations, pupils blown, debris covering most of her, etc. Her vitals were unstable, she was circling the drain, we knew she was on the verge of coding... I was standing near her head, ready to assist in supporting her airway but also providing comfort and doing my best to calm her.\n\nThe woman looked me directly in the eyes and in a hoarse, labored voice stated, \"I was angry, I told her I was disappointed in her.\" She began to cry, her vitals plummeted. \"I'm sorry,\" was the last thing she said before her heart stopped. We coded her, intubated her, performed round after round of ACLS, only to eventually have to call time of death.\n\nI still see her face at times, her eyes filled with more emotional pain than physical. It took much longer and was so much harder to write this than I thought it would be....",

She was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years earlier and had a mastectomy. The doctor recommended for her to have a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction due to high risk of recurrence of cancer.  She said that she wanted to keep her breast (a real breast rather than an implant) incase she remarries and will be somewhat whole. She regretted not getting the bilateral mastectomy. If she did, she would not gotten cancer in her remaining breast and dying at such a young age. The patient never ended up marrying after all. \n\nA week later, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I instantly told the doctor that I want a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. I also had an aggressive form of cancer.

            "This is a difficult question to answer. I\u2019m an ICU nurse and I\u2019ve been present for a lot of people\u2019s end of life.\n\nThe reason it is so difficult to answer is surprising simple: people come in to ICU, they get put on a ventilator (which involves a tube in the trachea, through the vocal chords) and then they can\u2019t speak.\n\nDepending on medications they require, they aren\u2019t commonly conscious, either. So the communication happens before the ventilator, and either a) they didn\u2019t have time to express ideas about regrets due to the urgency at the time or b) they didn\u2019t think it was time to express those ideas...they thought there would be more life, more opportunities.\n\nThe problem is that they didn\u2019t tell any family members or loved ones, either, prior to coming in.\n\nSo I come on to a shift several days later. I don\u2019t actually *know* this person. I haven\u2019t heard their voice, or their ideas. What I have heard about my patient is from their visitors, the loved one and the family.\n\nBut what I\u2019m doing with my day is trying to remind those same people that under the tubing, behind the equipment and the drugs (that are the bread and butter of my job), under the blanket and on the bed is *their* loved one. The person *is* the point.\n\nBut we also tend the machines. \n\nMachines for breathing, machines for making the heart keep pace, machines  helping to reduce effort a tired heart needs to pump, machines to do the work of the failing kidney, machines to remove need for the tiny spaces left in diseased lungs to push more gas than they can ever hope to move. \n\nAnd we tend to use drugs. Drugs that assist the machines. Drugs that push the body to do what it currently or no longer can.\n\nAnd the patient moves from day to night and back to day. And the family want us to do *one more thing*. And another. Because they want their person back.\n\nSometimes we can do that. We can give you your person for more time together at life.\n\nSometimes we can\u2019t. And if you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about regrets of dying patients, these are the regrets many people can never express.\n\nThe regret that they weren\u2019t able to tell their loved ones and families they didn\u2019t want *all* the things. Maybe *some* of the things, for a while. But not all of them, until the end.\n\nThe regret that the loved ones and families want to help, but as the patient they physically could not tell them no, don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s not helping.\n\nThe regret that those who understand that there are worse things than dying are those for whom those worse things present their current reality.\n\nSo I guess the point is this:\n\nDon\u2019t wait until you are there. Have a conversation with your significant others about what you want to happen if the worst happened. Don\u2019t put it off as having bad thoughts or ideas or unpleasant or even that it\u2019ll invoke some sort of fate that wasn\u2019t otherwise going to happen. Discuss organ donation as if you really had the chance to do it. Let your loved ones know what you think, and leave your *actual* end of life regrets for stuff like not going to Disneyland that time, or spending too much time driving to work.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "A little different but I worked in a gi lab and we had a much older man late 70s probably maybe late 80s (it\u2019s been awhile) come in for gi issues. While doing the procedure we found cancer and it was a death sentence. Super bad and I think he had refused to have a colonoscopy up until this point. The doc said it was horrific we couldn\u2019t get past the cancer it was so bad. He said maybe a few months. We finish up and I am at bedside with the patient and doc comes in to talk and family wouldn\u2019t believe it. The guy wouldn\u2019t believe it. The doc backed down and not once told him how bad it actually was. I was pretty upset because doc basically lied to the family and gave them false hope because they wouldn\u2019t stop arguing and he just didn\u2019t care to tell them the truth. I still wonder often about what happened to him. If he spent his last days fighting it and wearing himself out or if let himself enjoy his last few months. \n\nColon cancer is horrific. It looks exactly like the word cancer. It\u2019s disgusting. It looks alien. Please please please people get your colonoscopy when you are told. It\u2019s not just you you are saving it\u2019s your kids who will get screening earlier if they find something in you. But if you don\u2019t they\u2019ll never know they are at risk.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve seen some questions so here are some recommendations. \nThey changed the recommended age from 50 to 40 a few years ago. That doesn\u2019t mean insurance will cover it that early though but fight for it. Also if they find precancerous polyps it\u2019ll be a 1-3 year follow up depending on how many how bad etc. if normal polyps 5 years and if no polyps 10 years. If they find something bad like lots of polyps or precancerous it means your kids brothers sisters etc get their colonoscopy ASAP. No age rule. \n\nI had a mom who got her colonoscopy for issues at age 40ish and had colon cancer; her 20 year old daughter got hers a week or so after that and had colon cancer already as well. Both survived by catching it early.\n\nLastly the prep is pretty poopy(...) but no one is looking at your Asshole at any time. The doctor will do a digital exam but almost never has to to look because it\u2019s pretty easy to get into a butt hole and you\u2019ll already be heavily sedated. The scope goes in and it\u2019s done. Most take literally 10 minutes. Legally we have to stay in I believe 6 minutes. \n\nSo go forth and get it done!",

JD wished he fought harder, because her brother married a chinese woman and if it weren't for his \"jocky dumb attitude\" he would \"gotten over\" her decision to end things and fought harder for her to understand it would be all right. decades later, this petite, long haired girl with an \"amazing smile\" (me) comes back into his life and he was flooded with the memories of the love of his life. he said the 6 months they were together were just the most deep and loving and peaceful months of his life. he should have been with her and she was the one who got away. he said back then, you would fall in love in weeks and you loved hard and that was the love of his life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nto the people in this thread contemplating asking out their crush, do it. to the girls out there waiting on the guy to make a move, do something about it!!!!! to the person unhappy with their career choice, dude i changed my mind twice. if you put your head down and try, you will always find some solace in that.",

It was, honestly, 1 min of pure \"Why me\". \n\nAfter looking at everyone's faces however ... This quickly left me. \n\nI simply watched everyone deal with the news around me. In the room was my favourite nurse, my mum, wife and obviously the Dr.\n\nI never saw my mum look so helpless. I could almost see the hope drain from her as she leaned into the wall hoping for support. She was just told her baby was going to die and this time she couldn't fix it. I could see the whirlwind inside her as she tried to not cry. The nurse, who was there, was only there to give me more chemo. At this point of my care I'd been in hospital for months, I'd see her almost every day and you bond. She didn't take the news well (I heard later on)  at the time I was told she had a reaction to the chemo she was administering. In reality I was told she broke down and had to leave work early.\n\nMy darling wife, who I had put through so much was clearly trying to hold it together...she was in the anger / bargaining stage...This was the first time seeing my wife not taking no as an answer where I didn't have the energy or the motivation to calm her down. \n\nShe was asking for second opinions, researching other hospitals, calling /emailing them, scanning reports, test results for her emails etc ... She refused to accept it and just went to work.\n\nI just sat there with what felt like billions of thoughts ... Watching it all go on around me.\n\nWhen you're told you're going to die, eventually you get to acceptance. Once I accepted there was nothing more to do, all the little things in life that annoy, stress or anger you go away. EVERYTHING is beautiful... and I noticed everything. My perspective had completely changed. My time was running out and I just wanted to be surrounded by love. That's it. \n\nMy only regrets ... As most people are saying in this thread... Time. \n\nI didn't do enough with it. I didn't have more to see my beautiful baby niece grow up. I wondered if she would take after her mother, my lovely sister who never got to enjoy her pregnancy due to her brother getting cancer months before she was due to give birth. Why did I waste so much time being angry towards my father? We wasted so much time ignoring eachother over petty family bullshit.. Why the fuck didn't I travel more. Why didn't I take more photos of ourselves when traveling... (I had tons of travel pictures over the years, but hardly any of me and my wife or my family enjoying the holiday...just holiday crap like pictures of museums, buildings and food) \n\nNow I'm on heavy drugs scrambling my brain for memories of my wife's face when she saw our view from our hotel in Croatia... Believe me, when you're dying, you can Google the art and the architecture pictures, the real value are the pictures of you and the ones you love.\n\nGoing through cancer robbed us of joy, and I just wanted to see the twinkle of happiness in the eyes of my loved ones .. \n\nLove and time, that's it. When it boils down to it, that's all that's left. Love and time. \n\nTLDR: \n\nI was diagnosed with Stage 4 Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), on my birthday \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89.\n\nMy regrets were: Time (wasting it on petty things, not doing more with it), not forgiving people over petty shit, not taking more family photos, not traveling more/creating more memories.",

I'm a nurse, was working icu at the time, and was freshly coming off orientation without about 1.5 years total nursing experience at the time, so not quite a rookie.\n\nAnyway, I had a patient one hour after my shift have severe difficulty breathing and after consulting the doctor we decided to intubate, and were getting ready to start the procedure. The woman was on a BIPAP with widened panic in her eyes, and before we gave her sedative for when she went out I told her \"Dont worry dear you can relax we can do the breathing for you.\" This seemed to calm her some and then we sedated her and did the procedure.\n\nShit started going south. As it often does in healthcare. Her pressure started dropping, i had her on two BP sustaining meds, that went to a total of 4 and ended up having a total of 6 meds going in at once, trying to sustain her. I sat in her room the entire time and did any charting I could at bedside since alarms would constantly be going off, this went on until 2 PM, where the family came and decided to take her off the vent as she had a poor prognosis (end stage copd) and she died a little bit later.\n\nI will always regret telling her not to worry, that we would do the breathing for her.

            "In the experiences I have had, the dying person is usually too preoccupied with his own pain or suffering to actually say out a regret. There have been plenty of experiences where I've had a lot of regret and which sometimes still wake me up from sleep even though they are 10 year old stories. The regrets are not related to something wrong that I had done, but rather about 'maybe I could have done more'. \n\n10 years back I lost an 18year old patient who was had come in a critical state to the hospital. I was working in a very busy (overburdened) hospital in a developing country. She was an only daughter and I still remember her parents. The father had told me something to the lines of ' she's our only daughter, please do whatever is possible to save her'. She had a sudden collapse. I've asked numerous colleagues and seniors about what more I could have done to save her and they've all said that nothing more could have been done. But I still feel that I should have left everything and just sat with the patient the whole night. It is my one huge regret of my life. I blame myself even though I can't fathom what more I could have done. It took me 4 years to tell about this to my wife. And this is probably the third or fourth occasion in the last 10 years that I'm mentioning this. But it stays with me. \n\nA huge learning experience came while I was a student and was treating a patient of advanced breast cancer. She was extremely cheerful and lit up the whole ward. I struck a good connection with her as well. One day, during the rounds she pulled me aside and asked \"Do you think it will be cured?\". I was a bit surprised as doctors senior to me had already done her counselling and as far as I knew she already knew her prognosis. So I said the honest thing - No, it cannot be cured. She suddenly pulled back, smiled and told- never ever say that to a patient, doctor. Never tell them it won't be cured. It was a learning experience for me.

The PACU is where you go after surgery to recover from anesthesia before going home or being moved to an inpatient room. What\u2019s stuck with me most is how older married people act when they wake up. So many older women wake up from anesthesia after major surgery and ask me how their husband is doing, explain that he can\u2019t drive well in the dark and are worried that he didn\u2019t eat. They tell me to send them home and to stop worrying. But so many older men wake up and cry for their wife, wanting her to be there with them. A few times outright sobbing about how they\u2019ve treated their wife in the past. Just very interesting.",
            "I'm a nurse on a palliative/ care the elderly ward and a patient had recently died she kept calling for her son... Her son had been there but the first thing he asked me was 'when can I get death certificate?' I couldn't believe it, I was like well she isn't dead for a starter and that isn't the priority... I explained how we've kept her comfortable and told him the staff were looking after her. About 5 minutes after this conversation he left, I was fuming.\n\nMe and one of the doctors spent the day in the room with her making sure someone was with her at all times even though she cried for her son.\nShe died as we were handing out over, no word of a lie it was a two minute change over and she went. It was like she knew she was alone and her son wasn't there, so she died alone, that breaks my heart.",

I've changed my life dramatically so I can spend as much time with them as possible while they're young. You would not believe his much shit I get for doing this. My family literally tells me I'm being lazy by not working 12 hour days 7 days a week. Friends don't understand why I'm not around as much anymore. However, most of my customers ( I'm self employed) do understand and respect the boundaries I've set for myself. \n\nBottom line: you only get to do this once, your children will only be children once, and money and things will not make them love you more.

            "A question I can answer! RN of 10 years here. Worked 4 years in oncology and the past 6 in critical care and have seen plenty of dying people. I usually don't get into these kinds of conversations (I mean, I don't just go into their rooms and ask, \"What are your regrets?\") but have seen some interesting stories.\n\nAs a nursing student, one of my clinical placements was on an oncology/hematology unit. I remember going to do a set of vital signs on a patient and, I forget how, but we just ended up chatting. He was in his 60's, I think, and I will never forget what he told me: \"I worked all the time, never went on vacation, and pinched every penny, just to save up for a great retirement. Then I retired and got cancer. Don't make my mistake. Don't wait to enjoy your life.\"\n\nAnother big one is about estranged family. If a patient is dying and they have estranged family members, there are usually regrets surrounding that.\n\nOnce, we had a patient who had a massive heart attack and his heart was so weak, we needed to fly him out to a larger hospital. We asked him who his next of kin was but he said there was no one. We pressed him for someone, anyone...and he eventually told us he had a sister but they hadn't talked in many years. He refused to give us the contact information but we told him he would likely need to be put into a medically-induced coma and needed someone who could speak on his behalf. He eventually allowed us to contact her. I spoke to her and she was surprised to get the call but seemed to have no hard feelings about anything. I passed the phone to him and left the room, but when I looked back, he was in tears and I'd like to think they forgave each other. The patient was soon flown out but I don't know what happened to him, sadly.\n\nAnother time, I was looking after a First Nations woman with cancer. The doctor that day told her she didn't have long to live. We had developed a good rapport with each other and when I saw how shaken she was, I gave her a big hug. Then she made a request of me: to see if she could reserved the hospital's medicine lodge. She said she wanted to get her relatives together and talk. \"There were too many things said between each other that need to be talked about before I die,\" she told me. I made a bunch of phone calls to get it arranged, she got her wish, and when I saw her next, she said she was at peace.",
            "I had a female 32 year old patient dying of aids. It was way back when the stigma was severe. Her husband who already died, got it from a prostitute and gave it to her. She had no local family to comfort her. She refused to tell her parents and siblings she was imminently dying. The reason was that she was so ashamed. It wasn\u2019t her fault! We tried to convince her to call them. Nope she never did. She died alone, except for the hospital staff who cared for her. So so sad.",
            "I was with my wife's grandfather when he died. We sat around his bed as his breathing slowed. His wife of 61 years broke down beside him, begging him for more time. She said, \"Two weeks ago we got into a fight because he put on mismatched socks. We wasted so much time fighting over nothing.\" They fought all the time, constant bickering. It was in that moment that I saw the emotional weight of a lifetime of negativity come crashing down.\n\nSometimes my wife and I remind each other, \"it's just socks.\"",

The chiropractor would fix the pain, and it would return within about a week. Everyone just assumed it was work & age-related (He was early 40s), and nothing to worry about. \n\nAfter about 6 months the pain started getting worst and worst, so he went and saw a GP, he died two weeks later, cancer had already completely destroyed his liver and kidney.",
            "I'm a palliative medicine physician.\n\nMy patient was a 26 year old female, with metastatic cancer. She had a lot of extenstential grief (\"why me, why would God hurt me like this?\") through her months of decline from diagnosis till death. We got to her know well thorough repeat hospitalizations. I paid a home visit to her, 2 days before she died. Her whole family was in the home, holding vigil as she drifted in and out of consciousness. \n\nHer biggest regret was that her estranged father wasn't a part of her adult life, until these last days. As we talked, she pointed to a painting she drew as a student - a corner of it was taken up by a figure of her crying. The majority of the painting was of a large heart, with her whole family (including her father) holding hands, side by side. He had come to stay by her side, and in his hands bearing a ring she had worn when she was a child. \n\nShe was thankful, glad that her family was finally reunited in her last days. I cried a lot that day. It's one of those memories you never forget.",
            "After working in palliative care for a year and a half, I think 3 things sum up the advice I've gotten from the dying:\n\n1. Enjoy your youth, but don't be reckless. Travel, try new things, and have fun but don't cut your life short with substance abuse or other destructive habits. You can buy the motorcycle, but get a helmet, too. \n\n2. Cultivate your relationships and be good to the people who care about you. The people who are most at peace at the end are the ones surrounded by their loved ones. The people who are most scared are the ones who have lived their lives selfishly and sarcastically and often end up alone. A woman I visited this week told me that the key to everything was \"love and patience\" because that's what's needed to grow relationships. \n\n3. If there's something you want to do, don't put it off any longer than you have to. Time is limited. Going to therapy, taking that trip, getting a skin cancer screening, getting out of a lousy relationship, applying for that job that seems just out of reach, can all save your life or make what you have left of it significantly better.",

            "Hello all\n\nSo I\u2019m a specialist palliative care nurse here in the UK. I\u2019ve been through a few thousand patient journeys to their deaths.\nIt\u2019s very rare that anyone mentions really poignant regrets but they mainly revolve around a life choice they made/ didn\u2019t make. \nThe main one which will stick with me is a older male priest who half way through my assessment mentioned that he was gay and his whole sexual life had been a lie. He had a wife who was aware of his sexuality and made him closeted throughout his life to maintain his career. \nI feel he had loved another chap but was never given the chance to explore that due to his role in society. He kept alluding to a close male friend that he wanted to see who his wife never let him see (I feel she figured out what may have been occurring and emotionally blackmailed him). \nI got him out of my hospital to the local hospice. He gave me permission to mention to the staff there so they were able to treat him as he would wanted to be treated at this stage of his life and also meant they had a head start with trying to cope with his wife who was a little odd. \nShe never knew that I was aware of his sexuality which made conversations with her to really fascinating from a psychological perspective. They both got the support they needed prior to his death. \nIt\u2019s one case that will stick with through my career. \nKeeping loving the ones close to you everyone. Much love to you all.",

            "I can\u2019t prove it but as an ICU nurse I am completely sure that a lot of people regret not getting Advanced Directives.  An advanced directive specifies what you want done in case you are not able to express your wishes due to some kind of illness.  For example, if you want to be coded or not if your heart stops.  If you want to be given artificial nutrition and a tracheostomy if you cannot breathe on your own.\n\nPeople with debilitating illnesses are kept alive artificially for YEARS. They waste away in hospital beds coming back into the ICU with infection after infection and bedsores.  We can do all sorts of things to keep a body alive, there is not an orafice on your body we will not tube.  You will have tubes in your urethra, in your nose, in your throat, in your rectum. All of those tubes come with their own unpleasant if not BRUTAL/medieval insertion techniques and subsequent risks of infection.  Even if you may not know what is going on, bodies still have the capability of feeling pain and discomfort. Imagine not being able to express that you DONT want that tube being shoved down your nose because your Alzheimer\u2019s is too advanced to say so BUT you feel every ounce of pain and your family insists on keeping you around for their own comfort and not for yours.  This actually happened to my patient the other night. He was screaming bloody murder but he couldn\u2019t make his own decisions to tell us it wasn\u2019t what he wanted so we deferred to the family. \n\nWithout an advanced directive your family could choose to do a tracheostomy on you, which is a hole in your throat that bypasses your nose/mouth to allow a breathing machine to ventilate you. Tracheostomies cause you to build up secretions in your lungs so badly (because our nose and mouth filter most environmental contaminants), that they sound like a constant bubbling of spit and boogers that have to be manually suctioned out with a vaccum tube that goes into your lungs and tickles the inside of them.  People with chronic tracheostomies come in with pneumonia the likes of which make me want to vomit and I\u2019ve literally seen and smelled a lot of pus and shit that could make most grown men gag instantly.  \n\n\nMost people don\u2019t know that this could be their fate until it is too late and they have had a hypoxic or traumatic brain injury or a stroke which leaves them alive enough to feel pain but not alive enough to express what kinds of measures they would refuse.  Family doesn\u2019t have enough first-hand medical knowledge of experience not to consent to these torture devices and they think that their family would want to \u201cfight\u201d but don\u2019t understand the discomfort and pain that entails. \n\nPlease please get an advance directive or talk to your loved ones about what you would want done in case you are not able to express yourself.",
            "When my dad was in hospice, my older brother found our sister that I didnt even know we had (I am 20 years younger than my siblings. Adopted, all of us at different points. I was there last foster child) and this sibling and mom didnt get along at all and she ran away at 13 and mom just wrote her off entirely. My dad battled internally with that for his entire life, but never talked about it at all (I guess mom would start fights and 'punish' him if he talked about her/continued to see her)\n\nWhen he was admitted to hospice, he was estimated to have less than 3 days. He held on for a week, and fought to breathe because his long lost daughter was there and despite his inability to talk, you could see so much guilt behind his eyes and gasps. \n\nI havent spoken to my mother in 3 years, since the funeral that she refused to follow his wishes because it was 'to much work' despite my brother and I offering to pay for and organize it.",
            "\" I wish I spent less time in the office and more time with my family\" is what a dying patient one time told me. That put a lot of things in perspective.

            "Maybe wasn\u2019t the last thing they said but it was the last thing he and she said to me. \n\nI was working in a hospital doing XR and CT.  A man came in with abdominal pain and they ordered a chest and abdomen X ray. The man and his wife were relatively young, about mid forties. We conversed as I performed his exam. He said he started feeling bad while he was working out.  I made a joke about how being out of shape kept me out of the ER because I was never in any gym accidents. We all had a good laugh. When I was done he said \u201chey man, I glad that I met you. Your attitude is infectious\u201d.  I thanked him and was a little embarrassed because I\u2019ve never gotten a compliment like that from another guy. \n\nFast forward an hour later and they order a CT to rule out an aneurysm. His wife and nurse accompany to the scanner because he is not doing well.  His breathing is lethargic, he\u2019s lost almost all his color and he did not look good at all. I perform the CT and it\u2019s obvious he has a massive tear in his aorta from the top arch all the way down to his iliac. I\u2019m no doctor but I knew it was bad.  I do my due diligence to close the exam, I notify the performing doctor and the radiologist.  I knew time was not in his side. I went into the CT suite and the patient asked me what I thought.  I gave him a BS answer and told him the images were still being processed. He could tell I was lying.  As I was getting ready to slide him back over he grabbed my hand and said \u201cI\u2019m scared of dying\u201d. I said \u201cyou\u2019re not going to die\u201d. He nodded his head as tears started streaming down his cheeks.  When we got to the ICU I began to connect him to the monitor. The doctor came in and started to explain what was happening and what to expect next. He was going to be airlifted to larger hospital for surgery.  I headed back to my department. \n\nAbout 15 mins later the page came overhead \u201cCode Blue ICU\u201d and I knew exactly who it was. I came over to see if I could help in any way. When I arrived there was tons of staff, performing CPR, the doctor hollering orders, and nurses running around trying to help. He was now intubated, the life was gone from his eyes and a small pool of blood had accumulated on the side of his mouth.  I looked over to the corner and there was the wife witnessing everything. I asked her if she wanted to step outside and I took her to an empty room next door.  I asked her if she needed anything and she said \u201cno, I\u2019m just scared he\u2019s going to die\u201d. I didn\u2019t know what to say because I knew in all likely hood this was the end.  I\u2019m not a religious person but in that moment I just blurted our \u201ccan I pray for you?\u201d.  She nodded yes, I grasped her hands and started praying, and praying, and praying.  I prayed for what felt like a lifetime but turned out to be around 15 mins.  \n\nThe house supervisor stepped in and asked to speak to the wife.  When the wife walked away I decided to go back to my department. About half an hour later when my shift ended I decided to swing by and see what had happened. \n\nWhen I got to the room I didn\u2019t go in. The wife was sitting at the bedside and her back was to me.  She was quietly humming a song holding his hand and caressing his hair with the other.

I can't remember which stage it was at the start, but it was evident that he'd had it for awhile. For a bit, he still thought he was going to live. \n\nI still remember the day where we came home from school, dad said he wanted to talk, and as soon as we sat down, he started crying. I had never seen my dad cry before that. He was the strongest person I've ever met. \n\nI know his two biggest regrets. His first was that he didn't get more time. He desperately had wanted to see my graduate high school at the least. And I regret this... But he died before my graduation, and I couldn't bring myself to go for my mom. He also didn't get to raise his son - I'm not his full kid. He's my step father, but he was my dad to me. His son is actually his full kid. \n\nHis second regret was that he didn't fix things for us before he got too sick. Just little odd jobs here and there that the rest of us didn't know how to do. The biggest thing was that he wanted to put a new transmission in his truck and give it to me to be my first car, after teaching me to drive manual. He didn't get to teach me to drive, or fix the truck. \n\nHe didn't tell us all of his regrets... He definitely didn't want to. But I do regret not spending more time with him. Had I known, regardless of how bored I was or whatever, I would've taken every opportunity to go on those fishing trips with him, and had gone camping, just whatever he wanted.

He sometimes uses hearing aids but can get by without them in general.\n\nHis family had a bunny, Tupu. Of course he had learned about cows mooing, cats meowing etc. before he had his surgery. He was very shocked when he came home and greeted his bunny that it made no sound. It took the longest time for him to understand that bunnies are pretty quiet animals in general.\n\nHe explained he thought all pets were loud.",

I thought you could hear your eyes close, \"blink\" but there is no sound when you close your eye lids. No whoosh.\n3. You know how wind makes a noise going through trees? I thought it would make more noises going through hair. Nope.\n4. Now I could hear soft sounds, but I still get spooked when I see a bug crawling, and I don't hear it. They don't make a noise. at. all.\n5. Pooping does not make a sound, only the splash into the toilet. I thought the body makes a noise to push it out. I was disappointed.",

            "My daughter suffered from recurring ear infections, that went on for over a year,  before I could get the doctors to push for tubes in her ears. I felt that she was either unable to hear or that it was very muffled. The doctor that placed the tubes confirmed my suspicions in stating that she most likely heard noise as though she was \"under water.\"  \n\nI cannot attest to what EXACTLY she expected to make noise, but I still tear up when I think about her face as she re-explored the entire house with renewed fascination. I can however, give my subjective opinion based on her facial expressions- the thing that sticks out the most is the refrigerator. She was in awe over the humming noise that it makes, a noise that we often tune out because we are so accustomed to it. As she focused on that appliance for a bit, she made her way around to everything else that was large and stood in front of it, as if she was expecting everything to have its own \"secret noise.\" I can't say for sure, but the amount of time that she stayed with her face pressed up against the inactive washing machine and dryer, leads me to believe with *almost* certainty, that she was expecting those to hum and whir as well. At her age, you wouldn't expect her to make a correlation between similarly sized appliances, but I'll be damned if it didn't appear that way.",

Its quite sad actually, his parents definitely failed him. He is also dyslexic and its effected every part of his life and self worth etc. Anyhoo! My mum told him he needed a hearing test because the tv was starting to deafen her! He thought oh its just years of loud music and using a shotgun occasionally. So he has this hearing test and some other tests etc and gets told he was actually born deaf in one ear and significant loss in another - he can't hear phonics... you can imagine his problems through life. \nHe finally gets hearing aids and the first day he sits down to eat a packet of crisps. He absolutely flips out! \"What the F is that noise? Holy shxt my head is exploding\"! We had to explain you can hear the crunching of food etc and some foods are louder than others etc. It was heart breaking to see what he's missed out on. Now he only uses his hearing aids after a good nag from my mum. We still have to put up with his noisy eating but he's back to ignorance is bliss lol.",

At the time, he and his wife were living in the downtown of a large city. \n\nApparently he had it about 2 weeks before he threw it out, saying everything was too loud, he hated the noise and sound, that things were more peaceful without it.\n\n15 years later, he moved out into the country on a few hundred acres of woods. Still, he refused to wear a hearing aid, and kept refusing for the next 10 years. Finally, his wife convinced him to give it a try, and his mind was blown. He couldn't believe how QUIET everything was and how much he enjoyed hearing. \n\nHe finally explained that he thought the noise of the traffic downtown was the wind and that it sounded like that everywhere, all the time. So, for 25+ years, he thought wind sounded like the hundreds of cars driving by.",

            "I'm a pediatric audiologist, and some of the responses in this thread are a bit concerning.  Let me give a quick outline about auditory development, hearing aids, and cochlear implants:\n\nAuditory development happens in various stages of varying overall importance.  The Critical Period, birth to three years of age, is exactly that: critical for later speech and language development.  After age 3, a person who was born deaf has a much lower chance of \"making sense\" of auditory stimuli through a cochlear implant.  This does depend on the degree of deafness and previous hearing aid use: more hearing aid use and less hearing loss leads to better outcomes, but birth to three is incredibly important for proper language development.  3-7 is there grey area, and is generally a mixed bag of limited success and rejection of implant use.  Beyond seven years of age is very difficult for new cochlear implant users who were congenitally deaf, especially if they were not using hearing aids before.  Some Deaf adults will go back to get a cochlear implant because they want to hear, but they are unlikely to do well with speech and language: the auditory deprivation has already caused massive restructuring in the auditory cortex.  In fact, they have found that parts of the auditory cortex will be remapped for visual stimuli in Deaf adults: meaning the brain hijacked the unused auditory cortex to make room for what a person who is deaf needs: space to make sense of visual stimuli.\n\nWe often see people talking about getting hearing aids and cochlear implants later in life and, depending on their history regarding amplification and degree of hearing loss over time, this can be helpful.  But a full picture is needed, and there are really no miracle stories with exception of the miracle that a baby who is congenitally deaf can learn speech and language as well as or better than their peers if they are given good auditory training.\n\nA couple final notes on cochlear implants:\n\nAnyone who gets a cochlear implant will have access to soft sounds, but what the brain does with that information varies.  Some brains can't make much sense of it at all.\n\nThe notion that cochlear implants \"sound robotic\" is usually perpetuated by those who get cochlear implants later in life and are comparing to their previous hearing.  This is not something we often hear from young children where cochlear implant sound is all they've ever heard (it just sounds like their ears!)\n\nFinally, to get cochlear implants, there is a very extensive evaluation that takes place.  The auditory component of this evaluation is very strict: you must be performing VERY poorly in order to qualify (except children who are born deaf: they are fast tracked).\n\nIf you have any more questions, please feel free to DM me.",

As a result, I never really knew what is was like to hear in stereo.  \n\nAt the age of 28 I had a surgery that was able to replace the bones of hearing with a single titanium piece, and rebuild an eardrum.  I was told it would take 6 months for my brain to relearn how to interpret the audio signal, but when I woke up from surgery I was instantly assaulted by what felt like a wall of sound.  It was quite painful.\n\nAt the time I had three kids, ages 8, 5, and 3.  One of the biggest shocks to me was the sheer volume of noise that my children could make.  The first day we were home I turned to me husband and asked, \u201cHave our kids always been this loud?!\u201d\n\nThe other biggest shock was surround sound.  A year or so before my surgery my husband had gone out and spent a good sum of money on a surround sound system for our house.  I was livid!  What a waste of money!  The first time we watched a movie in surround sound after my surgery however, I was in awe!  My husband just laughed at me as I kept turning from side to side saying, \u201cDid you hear that!  Things are actually moving around the room!\u201d  When the movie was finished I sat in stunned silence for a moment before turning to him and saying, \u201cI get it.  That was worth every penny!\u201d",

My professor freaks out that her organs make noise and other people can hear inside her body.\n\n The class was dying from laughter.",

He also was surprised to learn that when he rubs his hand across fabric, leather seats, clothes, etc... that it makes noise. Poor kid, he had to discover background noise at 12 and then go through the process of making it background noise.\n\nThe biggest change for him was learning that people have different voices. He could generally tell male from female, but he said that basically women all sounded the same and men all sounded the same. I guess pitch was completely absorbed by his hearing loss.",

            "My brother recently got hearing aids. About a week ago actually. He's had trouble with his hearing for about 10 years now caused by damage during cliff diving and time on a weapon range without ear protection. He was constantly surprised that his sons toys that light up don't make an associated noise, when he mentioned this to his wife she explained that about a week or so after each of those toys arrived she would cut the wires to the speaker sometime in the night so that she wouldn't have to listen to it. Her son is just convinced that toys that make noise break easily. I was very amused. On the other hand he is horrified that he can hear his hair and clothes. Each time he moves his head and the hair drags across his collar or when the wind ruffles his hair he's just like 'WHY CAN I HEAR MY HAIR!?' My dad, who has had hearing aids for several years now, assures him that everyone can hear these things they just learn to tune it out and he will get used to it. For now its slightly amusing to see the look on his face when he hears things, like the tiny whine his dog does when he wants pets.",
            "Born with a congenital birth defect where there was absolutely nothing inside both of my ears, but they didn't know til I was 2 1/2 yrs. old, when I got severe staph infection, had to have emergency surgery, had less than 3 minutes to live. So EVERYTHING had to be man made, back in 1975, there were only 2 other known cases in the world, I was the third. The other 2 were half way around the globe in 3rd world countries. Point being is that back in those days there were no \"procedures\"  My ENT had to basically make shit up as he was going, thank God he was smartest man besides God himself. Long story short, I've had 15+ ear surgeries, since it's all man-made, every 1 - 1 1/2 yrs  scar tissue would grow over everything that he had just done, so I continually had to have surgery.  To answer the op's question re: sounds, 2 instances I'll never forget, 1- bout a month after a surgery when I was 15-16 (40's now) I was sitting in the kitchen with my parents and my mom was microwaving something, suddenly I got terrified and started crying, freaking out asking them what that noise was, it was the microwave.  I had no idea that they made noise and sounded like that. I look over and both parents were in tears besides themselves, now I'm really confused, they were absolute tears of joy, they couldn't believe that I could finally hear little everyday things like that! 2nd is I had no idea that blinkers made noise, I come rushing home, telling my dad, \"DAD, somethings wrong with my car\" of course he says \"what did the noise sound like\" ? Him thinking something drastic was wrong, finally had me sit in the car with him and he says \"this the noise you heard\"? Said YES, YES that's it!  He said those are your blinkers that your hearing.  BLEW MY MIND! it still blows my mind that they make noise.  It truly is the little things in life that really matter!\n\nThanks mom and dad!\n\nEven more of a thanks to \nDr. Michael M Paparella!  \nI'll always be forever grateful.",

After walking around for a while feeling things and seeing where it was really loud, we discovered the computer tower was the culprit.\n\nI had no idea that fans made noise and that the fan inside the computer would make noise. \n\nI stopped wearing my hearing aids pretty quickly because it was very hard to deal with SO MUCH noise all the time. Before if I wanted to 'listen' to someone talk, I'd just look at them and read their lips. If I didn't, I just didn't look at anyone.

I've gradually lost my hearing over 10 years (but didn't notice, my pals and family suggested a hearing test because they're sick of me asking them to repeat phrases, or having music / TV up too loud).\n\nWhen I heard the world for the first time with hearing aids, I was confused will all the sounds coming at me.  I had to take the afternoon off from work because I was too disorientated (and a bit emotional about it all).  As I was walking home, everything was bombarding me, I was surprised at the sound of people's shoes as they walked, and very surprised I could hear things around corners and behind me.\n\nNow, I can turn the volume up on them and hear \\*everything\\* - it's ace and feels like a superpower :)"

First-born to a single mother who was tormented and hindered by her own mental illness.\n2. Little brother born with autism. I took care of the majority of his needs from a very young age. One of my earliest memories is taking care of my younger siblings alone for an indeterminate period of time when I was 4 and they were 2. We were left alone a lot.\n3. Because of my mom's struggles she didn't work, so the constant threat of freezing to death/dehydrating to death/starving to death was a fear she instilled in me when I was 6.\n4. This is also around the time I was being molested. I didn't understand what was happening but I could tell he was lonely and I wanted to help him. (pathetic, I know) It was made very clear that I was not to tell anybody about all of this.\n5. I started working my first job cash, under the table at age 12. Throughout the rest of my teens I was working upwards of 3 jobs at a time. The jobs I worked were largely shitty and I was absolutely taken advantage of financially: I'd get paid sometimes as low as $2-3/hour but I was so desperate I took the jobs anyways.\n6. Not for nothing but I also had to maintain perfect grades to keep up appearances. Thank GOD these perfect grades and spotless record secured me a full ride (need based financial aid ftw) to my dream school.\n\ntl;dr: Mom was crazy abusive. Other people in my life were crazy abusive. Little brother needed me. I had to parent myself, my mother, and my younger siblings, all while acing school and financially supporting us. The pay off was great when I finally got the fuck away from them at 18, and got into therapy at 19. Shit got really dark before they got better. Now I'm happy, healthy and safe :).

            "How I would feel about Jeff.  \n\nJeff was a really big deal in middle school. We went to different elementary schools so I never heard of him prior to middle school but as soon as I got there his name was going around the school a lot and it became clear he was a big deal. Jeff was the toughest guy in our grade, the most athletic, the best looking, and the coolest according to both the guys and the girls. The guys wanted to be his friend and if they weren't then they were wary of him because of how tough he was and he gave off that vibe that he wasn't someone to make angry. The girls loved him and he was making out and going out with them all the time. He even went out with a girl a year ahead of us in school and she was the most popular girl in her grade. This was basically unheard of but he did it. He was in my class in the 6th grade and it became clear that despite his coolness, toughness, and ability with the girls at a young age, Jeff had some problems and couldn't control himself that well. He would act out in funny ways by causing mischief and trouble but he would also act out in less funny-yet-troubling ways by doing things like smoking cigarettes on school grounds and he would occasionally get physical with any guy dumb enough to piss him off. Because of this, he got detentions and suspensions. \n\nThat year our class had a field trip to some place that I don't remember but I do remember the bus ride to and from the trip. Jeff and I were on the same bus and for some reason still unknown to me he decided to sit next to me. On the way there he was talking to me about different things and since he was such a big deal I was kind of passive and awestruck by him sitting with me so I just listened and then followed up with questions to interact with him and he seemed to be cool with that. Then at some point he started talking about his home life and his dad and he said that his dad would hit him in the head. When he told me this he had his eyes averted and sort of looking down and he said it kind of like it was a joke but he was breathing kind of heavy and his head was kind of bobbing up and down, sort of like he was crying but he didn't shed any tears. On the bus ride back to school we stopped at some place and there were these vending machines that some kids were getting snacks out of. I went to get myself a snack and a drink and I got my drink but something happened when I tried to get my snack. I can't remember what it was exactly. It may have been that I thought I had more money than I did and when I went to get my snack I came up short for money, or it could have been that the machine ate my money. Whatever happened, I couldn't get my snack and I was upset because I was pretty hungry. Without asking him or saying anything, Jeff just stepped in front of me and put a dollar in the machine for me so I could get my snack. I looked at him, surprised, and he just gave a subtle head nod to me. Then we sat next to each other on the way back to school after that. \n\nAt some point during that year we had a substitute teacher for our class and some kids were acting out and I was laughing because it was funny. Our substitute was a middle-aged woman and she was not happy at all. She was yelling at us to shut up and knock it off and she physically grabbed me by the shoulders and then started pushing me downward into my chair and desk and I was frightened by it. I was scared and didn't know what to do and she was hurting me. When class ended Jeff grabbed me, put his arm around me, and he basically pushed me and pulled me down the hallway to the principal's office. I had no idea what was happening other than that I was very confused and afraid of the teacher and now of Jeff doing this to me and I remember tripping over my own feet a couple times because he was pushing me down the hallway but I didn't have any clue where we were going or what he was doing. We get to the office and he does all the talking and tells the principal what happened while I just sit there in silence, nodding each time that the principal asks me if what Jeff is saying is true. See, the principal had and would go on to have numerous run-ins and issues with Jeff because Jeff could not behave and kept getting into trouble way too often. The principal was wary of him and didn't trust him much and I suppose he had good reason not to. However, I still remember the concerned look on his face when Jeff was telling him what happened. When Jeff was done talking we left the office and the principal said he'll look into the incident and that's all I remember. I figured that Jeff was just using me to act out and cause trouble or give the principal a headache in having to deal with him yet again. I was too afraid of Jeff to say to him that I didn't want to go to the office so what happened happened and that was that. \n\nJeff was expelled from school early in the 8th grade. Word spread around the school quickly because the kid was such a big deal. I don't remember why he got kicked out exactly or what the final straw was. He basically disappeared in 2003 and I figured that I would never see him again.\n\nHe was off my radar for years and it wasn't until freshmen year of high school that I heard that he was going to a catholic school in our county. This was all that I heard about him since he was kicked out of middle school.\nIn the Winter of 2008 I was a senior in high school and I was hanging around at a friend's house after a party ended on the weekend. Seemingly out of nowhere, Jeff shows up with a guy I used to be friends with in earlier years. I hadn't seen Jeff since 2003. He was still big, looked about 6 foot 3, and still had that kind of socially and physically dominant way about him. He was joking around with the guy he came with and he playfully pushed him on the shoulder after making a joke and the guy almost lost his balance and fell over. Jeff just couldn't help it. Being the alpha male and dominant is how he always was and it was just his nature. I was sitting on the couch with the guy who hosted the party and then the guy who almost got pushed over smiled at Jeff a bit and said \"You remember [insert my last name here]?\" and Jeff stared at me for about 10 seconds. I definitely didn't look exactly like I did in middle school but he then stepped closer to me and looked me in the eyes and put his hand out to shake my hand but didn't say anything to me. He leaned down and over towards me pretty close and just held my hand tight and we just looked into each other's eyes for about 10 seconds and then he let go and backed away slowly. We both held our gaze of each other as he did this and even when we broke it, we both then turned and looked back at each other a bit out of the corner of our eyes. That's the last time I saw him before he died.\n\nJeff died a few years ago from a heroin overdose. He was 27. I determined that at some point his father, who was abusive and violent with him when he was a kid, left the family, likely when Jeff was about 15 or 16. Jeff, his mom, and little sister had to leave our town and they wound up in a crummier, more rundown area nearby. He didn't finish high school at the catholic school he started at and it looks like he may have been kicked out or that one or both of his parents couldn't or wouldn't pay his tuition anymore so he wound up finishing school at a not-so-great public school. He fell into the druggie crowd in later years and I suppose this shouldn't have been surprising because his older brother overdosed on heroin and died when he was 18 when Jeff and I were in the 7th grade. I remember that going around the school at the time and people talking about it in whispers. \n\nIt took me until I was 30 to put my brief-yet-meaningful moments with Jeff together. I went my whole life thinking that he was the school bully and I was afraid of him yet I realized eventually that I never saw him bully anyone and that he never bullied me. I remembered our time on the bus together and our trip to the office but I couldn't connect the dots at the time. Now I realize that on the bus, Jeff was grateful that I listened to him talk about his dad hitting him so when I needed help at the vending machines he was there for me. When our substitute teacher did what she did to me, I later realized that this happened after the bus trip and vending machines day. Because I was there for him, when he saw what the teacher did to me he didn't decide to use me as a way to act out or start trouble -- he was just trying to help because he cared about me. When I saw him after that party was over in high school, he truly remembered me and those moments we shared together. Those memories came back to him that night but not to me at the time.  \n\nI'm truly sad that he's gone and when we were kids I would have never thought that I would say that about him, feel that way about him, or that he would die young. The guy was the biggest deal and the last person I would have thought wouldn't make it in life but sadly his demons and troubles took him away. Once I understood Jeff, I began thinking of him as a legend of my childhood. Eventually I realized that calling Jeff a legend -- while accurate and true -- doesn't truly explain and express what he means to me. In a life filled with much hurt and pain doled out to me by the people whom I used to call friends and family, as well as abuse dished out by others out there, Jeff is one of the only people whose friendship, goodness, and memory is not tainted by time and by how people eventually began to treat me. All that he ever was was good to me, respectful, kind, decent, caring, supportive, fearless, empathetic, friendly, and true. He was never anything bad to me for as long as I knew him and he's the best friend that I never had. That's why calling him a legend doesn't quite express what he is to me all these years later. He's not a legend; he's my hero.",

Here\u2019s more info.\n\nI used to be extremely conservative. I still remember being a freshman in college and sticking out for it. I was definitely homophobic. As I went through college I slowly realized that I had been brainwashed into hating people and things. I had Muslim, gay, and liberal friends. My biggest revelation was breaking free of the identity politics that plagued my childhood. I voted for Trump in 2016 and it wasn\u2019t too long before I realized the mistake I made. I consider myself a moderate now, and I like to think I can see through the BS that politicians sling around.\n\nMore recently, I have abandoned Christianity. I was never a huge participatory Christian, but Covid really tested my faith. I saw so, so many Christians turn themselves toward prayer and healing rather than masks and quarantine. It got to the point where it felt like everyone was actively brainwashing themselves with hokey mythology nonsense. I live in the Bible Belt and it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll ever be able to come out about it. My career would be damaged by people thinking I was an evil atheist.",

            "In 1996, I had just dropped out of University and was moving home to my parent's place. My tail was firmly between my legs, I had almost no money and no job prospects. Basically I was screwed.  \n\n\nI had an old Jeep Comanchee with all my belongings in the back and 200 miles to go. I borrowed $20 from a friend for gas and started the trip. I got to a point that was 30 miles from home and was on empty. I pulled into a gas station/rest stop and sort of cried for a minute in my truck. I needed $5 for gas to make it the rest of the way and had nothing. There was no way I could call my dad and ask for help...he was already so disappointed.\n\nAfter a minute I started searching around my truck for change...anything...I opened the glove box and there were these paper 'loyalty bucks' for a gas station that I never used. It turns out it was the exact gas station that I was stopped at. $4.70 worth of bucks. I found another $2.00 in change, put $6.00 in the gas tank and bought a coke.   \n\n\nI made it home.   \n\n\nFast forward 20 years, I had sorted my crap out and am a lawyer...that Gas Station hired me as their outside counsel...I got to tell this story to the President of the company.",

            "As a child visiting my Grandma's house (My Mum's - mum), whenever I left the house I'd wave next door to Ken who was always sat in the bay window looking out at the sea.

So I head down the steps and towards the gate. I turn back and see Ken in the window. Big smile as usual, waving at me. I give him a wave back. He stands up, gives me the thumbs up, and wanders towards the back of the room. My Mum comes walking down the steps and asks \"Who are you waving at?\" I replied \"Ken\".\n\nTo this day, I can remember my mam's face. She just went white, but didn't say anything to me.\n\nIt was only a few weeks later when she plucked up the courage to tell me, that Ken had died a few days prior to our visit to my Grans.\n\nI don't believe in ghosts, but I know I saw him. I can still picture his striped grey sweater with light stripes across it. Him waving and getting up out of his chair.

            "Once, my mom and I were driving to Las Vegas from Santa Clarita. We were just passing Barstow and on the I-15. It was right about high noon and very hot. Not a cloud in the sky. She had a fancy Lexus at the time with a touch screen console on the dash that could play DVD\u2019s while driving. I remember we were on a long stretch of road with a lot of space between cars on the highway. One minute we see nothing ahead of us and then all of a sudden, a woman was walking across the highway right in front of our vehicle.  \nMy mom swerved behind her and barely missed her.  \nShe pulled off to the shoulder and we look behind us, and we see her go all the way across the highway, including westbound traffic.  \nThen she turned around, and walked all the way across again. Each time, nearly getting clipped by an unsuspecting and oncoming car like ourselves. At one point, a semi truck almost hit her head on missing her by literally one step. Each step she took was a steady and confident step, looking ahead of her and never batting an eye to any oncoming traffic. She was barefoot mind you and walking on the boiling asphalt with zero sense of urgency.  \nSo my mom calls 911, we\u2019re directed to highway patrol. They say they\u2019ve received numerous reports and they\u2019re headed out to it.  \nMy mom decided after hanging up to slowly reverse down the shoulder to get a better look and see if she\u2019s okay (yes, I know, stupid in more than one way). As we get to a spot behind her now, she\u2019s crossed the highway and is now in front of our vehicle.  \nThis part I will never forget.  \nThe women slowly turns her head and looks at us and is now slowly but steadily walking towards our car.  \nShe was white as day in every way. White night gown, pale, dry, wrinkled skin, white hair, and the palest bluish grey eyes I\u2019ve ever seen and barefoot. Almost looked like a walking dead version of Rose Dawson from Titanic.  \nI was in the passenger seat, which was on the shoulder. When my mom made eye contact, she froze. Absolutely shut down. I remember the woman walking so close to my door, I could see her eyes make contact with mine. It looked as if she was blind and lifeless but could not just see me, but see into and through me like into my soul. I went cold immediately. She reached for my door handle and I remember screaming at my mom to punch the gas and without hesitation, she came to quick and we peeled out of there. In the back window, I saw her watch us speed off and then continued across the road again.  \nA mile down the highway, we called highway patrol to see what happened and they didn\u2019t have a clue what we were talking about and said they got no reports of a women crossing the highway. My mom to this day still doesn\u2019t remember the time between when we reversed to when we dipped out.  \n  \nI have no idea what happened that day except for what I witnessed and experienced.",

Please evacuate at the nearest exit.\u201d and accompanied by flashing lights.\n\nThe guy is having a seizure on the floor, so all we\u2019re focusing on is getting him help.

No, because it was his first seizure.\n\nJust reading it might sound lame, but witnessing it and working out what was happening in real time was just eerie.\n\nTL;DR: I watched a guy start having his first scary-looking seizure the MILLISECOND before the building\u2019s fire alarm went off.",

            "This one is strange to me because it was so long ago and I'm convinced I have to be remembering things wrong. I was a young kid at the grocery store and I saw this toy helicopter (like hot wheel sized) that I really wanted for some reason. I, of course, didn't buy it, but it the memory of it stuck in my head.\nA few nights later, I had a dream where I was playing with the helicopter, but I realized it was a dream and stupid young me thought that if I put it under my pillow, it would still be there when I woke up. After that, I woke up and eagerly checked under the pillow to get it. For some reason, it was right where I left it in the dream. As a kid, I wasn't surprised to find it there as it all made perfect since to me then, but years later I have no clue how the toy helicopter actually got underneath the pillow.",
            "About 5 years ago I was out with two friends. At the time, this group of friends liked to party hard, as did I. We were a few years out of college living in a resort town. That night, we went out to dinner and then went to a bar. We all did a round of shots when we got to the bar. Immediately after the shot, I felt like I needed to throw up. It was odd because I had not drank much at dinner and I was very accustomed to taking shots. This was a very bizarre reaction for me. I had been driven there by one of the friends but I immediately decided I needed to leave, so I got a cab, went home, and felt completely fine when I got home. I would usually have been out until 4/5am, but I was home by 11pm. I watched TV and went to bed but the whole night, I had a weird feeling.\n\nI woke up the next morning and the two girls I was with had been in a car accident. The person driving was drunk and texting, and she hit a huge telephone pole. The pole fell onto the car, almost splitting the car in half. By the grace of god, the universe, something... Neither of them were harmed, but if someone was sitting in the back seat, they would have potentially been dead. I am 100% certain I would have gotten into that car and likely would have been sitting in that seat. I don\u2019t fuck with drinking and driving or anyone who attempts to drink and drive anymore.\n\nEdit: typo",
            "One morning I woke up and noticed my camera was on top of the sofa opposite my bed. I knew I didn\u2019t put it there because it was a very expensive camera and it could very easily fall from this place. I had placed it in my cabinet. I went over, picked it up, and turned it on and clicked the button to view photos. There were hundreds of photos of me sleeping, all seemingly taken from the back of the sofa. I was literally so freaked out, I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I lived alone. It was just photo after photo of me sleeping. The photos were taken in \u201cquick snap\u201d, where the camera takes approx one photo per second. I later realised the camera didn\u2019t even have a \u201cquick snap\u201d setting so technically it was impossible for the camera to take the photos at all. The time stamps suggest all photos were taken between 2 and 3am. I\u2019ve never figured out wtf happened, how the camera got to the sofa, or how it is even possible for a camera with no quick snap to quick snap, but I still have a USB with the photos on it and it still freaks me the fuck out.\n\nEdit: to answer a few questions. \n- I am safe. This happened several years ago. I now live with my partner and we have several dogs and a very good home security system. \n- There was no sign of forced entry to my home \n- I owned the home, and I had the locks changed when I moved there because I felt uneasy about living alone ( good hunch haha) \n- I did go to the police. They did not give a shit. They said it\u2019s probably a friend playing a prank. \n- My mum had a key to the house \n\nWeirdly this thread has actually jogged my memory about something potentially related I had completely forgotten about that was sitting deep, deep down in my memory bank. Approx 12 months before the camera incident I received a letter in my PO Box that was typed (not hand written) and addressed directly to me saying if I did not agree to meet with the sender, they would kill me while I sleep. To be honest, I deadset thought it was a stupid joke because I couldn\u2019t think of anybody that would want me to meet with them and I binned the letter and never told anybody. I got three or four of those threatening letters demanding that I respond but no actual way of responding or no hint about who it was from. The sender wrote like I should know who it is but I did not. One letter did provide a time and place to meet but of course I did not attend. That was the final letter. I did move house and change my postal address shortly after the camera incident though. I am alive right now, so obviously they are all talk, no action haha.",

            "When I was younger, in elementary school, I used to have the same dream every weekend starting on Saturday (when I would go to sleep) and then waking up in the middle of the night (on Sunday) and throwing up. The dream was always a bunch of numbers. Not even anything happening just a bunch of random jumbled up numbers all over the place. I never understood why that happened where the same dream would happen on the same night every week and I would throw up every single time. I always think about it and wonder what it was or if it was just some weird coincidence. Also I would not have any signs of being sick before or after. Maybe someone else has experienced this???",

There was a very strange, distinct handprint placed on the mirror.  \n\nI lived alone and she was the only adult that had been to my house in about two years.  We each placed our handprints on the sides of the mystery handprint for reference and neither look anything like the mystery print.

            "I have 3 that really stand out to me and as far as explainability, i can\u2019t explain any of them but one is the winner as far as scaring the shit out of me.  They all involve doors. \n\n**1:** in my teenage years I lived in a townhome owned by my then-stepdad who freely admitted he thought the place was haunted. He was self employed as a sound equipment installer and often would come and go during the day & my mom worked 9-5 at a law firm. It was summer break, but I wasn\u2019t driving yet. I spent a lot of time outside and this was before the time everyone had a cell phone, so I\u2019d often take our cordless home phone outside with me. I went outside one day, and realized I\u2019d forgotten the phone. When I tried to go back inside to get it, the door was locked. Not the handle - which I may have written off as something I accidentally did on my way out - the deadbolt. The handle freely turned but the deadbolt was engaged. The deadbolt that requires a key to lock from the outside, which I did not have. \n\nI stood there dumbfounded for a few minutes. Nobody else was home, & the only other entrance to the house was a set of sliding doors in the basement that were always locked. What the fuck just happened. I kept trying to open it like an idiot for a while before finally resigning myself to borrowing the neighbors phone & calling my stepdad. He was in town & after asking me if i was sure 1,000 times, came by to unlock the door. I\u2019ll never forget him saying \u201cyep, the deadbolt was completely thrown. I can\u2019t explain that.\u201d I spent the rest of the afternoon inside, trying to recreate the situation. I slammed the door shut so many times in an attempt to get the deadbolt to wobble and lock itself. But it never did, & honestly I didn\u2019t expect it to. \n\n**2:** same townhouse. I was now driving and often stayed late after school as I was in theater and had practices. This afternoon I had about 30 minutes between class and practice and I drove home to get a snack. When I got there, my mom was at work & my stepdads van was gone so I assumed he was gone as well. The door was locked. Now when you walk into this home, right in front of you to the left is the kitchen, the right is my bedroom, & the middle has a staircase going downstairs. I unlocked the door, came inside, and turned into the kitchen with my back to the staircase. As I was making a sandwich, I heard someone downstairs. I turned back around & the staircase door was open, stairwell light was on, & someone was clearly downstairs. \n\nAt the time I thought \u201cwasn\u2019t that door closed when I got here?\u201d but I also rationalized, because my stepdads van was a cargo van & it wasn\u2019t uncommon for someone to borrow it to haul things. So I assumed he was home, his van was borrowed, & I went to the top of the stairs. I stood there, looking down the stairs, eating my sandwich & I almost said something. It was almost out of my mouth, but *something* stopped me. I still don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t yell HI JAY down the stairs. Instead I turned around & left, and I left the door unlocked because he was home, right??\n\nWhen I got back from practice my mom was mad at me because Jay said he came home around 5pm to an unlocked house. He had a lot of expensive equipment in the basement. I was always to lock the door. I tried telling her what I\u2019d seen. He was home at 4. She said he wasn\u2019t. I swore he was. Something was home. My brother believed me, but my mom never did. \n\n**3:** I lived in a shitty trailer in my early 20s when I was poor with 2 young kids. It had 2 bedrooms, which I\u2019d given to the kids, & I slept on the couch in the living room which was in direct line of sight to the front door. I put the kids to bed around 9pm, and I always locked the door. Always. I still to this day clearly remember locking both the handle & deadbolt & checking to make sure it was fully locked before taking a shower. Eventually I fell asleep. I woke up suddenly around 3am on high alert. As my eyes cleared & I started thinking sensibly... I realized I was staring into the street. My front door was *wide open.* Not like oh it\u2019s a little open or cracked or I didn\u2019t quite close it all the way and a strong wind came along... it was fully open. Like 90 degree angle here. Plus I had a glass storm door that was fully closed and latched, blocking any wind we might have had, which we didn\u2019t have anyways. \n\nI got up & walked to the door to close it, and that\u2019s when I lost my shit. Y\u2019all. The deadbolt was still in the locked position. It was fully turned to lock, sticking out into the living room air for god and everyone to see. You ever have those moments where you swear there\u2019s ice in your veins? That was it for me. I\u2019ve never been scared like that in my life. In a closed door, you can\u2019t even turn the deadbolt to \u201cfully locked\u201d without it being lined up in the door jamb properly. I knew I\u2019d locked that door. And yet here it was, staring me in the face. I didn\u2019t sleep without the lights on for a week.",

One night when I was around thirteen or fourteen I was dreaming of a safari hunt for t-rexes and we had to save a golden idol from pirates in the jungle.

Everything is about to shake and you're in danger. Wake up!\"\n\nI woke up instantly and sat up confused. Roughly fifteen seconds later my boxer puppy woke up and started whimpering and whining and the rabbit I had started hopping in his cage. Seconds later an earthquake occured. It wasn't very big, but strong enough to knock several photos down and my shelf. Now this specific shelf was mounted above my head. It was made of a very thick type of wood and on it was a collection of random \"prized\" items, including a quart jar filled with sand and shells, several large books, a heavy statuette, etc. Sufficient to say it was quite heavy. When it fell, it fell directly onto my pillow where my head had been a moment before.

I need to check that out in the morning.\u201d\n\nAt maybe 6 AM, my wife and I awoke to our fire alarms screeching, with a recorded voice telling us carbon monoxide was detected. We grabbed the baby and the dog, piled into our car in the driveway, and called the fire department to check it out. After they tested, they told us no carbon monoxide was detected, but sometimes fire alarms behave unexpectedly when their batteries are low.\n\nThis was maybe 5 years after moving into a house that\u2019s new construction, so yes, I was super delinquent in checking it.

In other words our completly sealed house was locked from the inside. My mother flipped, grabbed us, and ran to a payphone to call the police because if that door is locked then there ***is*** someone in the house unless the left via a second or 3rd story window. 3 cop cars came, they unlocked the door with my mothers key and swept every last inch of the place down to one of them going into our crawl space. Nothing. Not only that my mothers gold necklace was laying on the table and all the windows were locked. We had a family friend who is a cop and one of my uncles who is a cop come spend the night.

Pretty unusual this time of night as it's all young families and retiree's around me. As I get closer it's definitely a kid which is even stranger, like, doesn't this kid have parents? They're standing directly under the street light with a rain coat on (not raining) and their hood up over their head so that the shadow cast completely covers their face.\n\nI know my neighborhood pretty well and while I don't know most by name, you know who has kids and who doesn't.

This kid did a full 180 with their body and watched me drive down my street. \n\nWhile I only live six or so houses into the close, it's just enough I lost site of the kid. It was super unsettling, I couldn't even quite explain to you the feeling I got from it. I back into my driveway, put my truck in park, think about what I saw, and say f it, Ive got to check this out. Back into drive and back down the street, maybe twenty seconds, tops, since I passed and kids gone. Vanished. The roads are straight enough in any given direction that in that short amount of time that kid would of had to straight up sprint to stand a chance of being out of site. \n\nFucking demon child is gone. I went home, parked quick and didn't take my time getting inside and locking the door. To this day never saw the kid again or anything that's given me a bad vibe like that.

I stood for less than a minute, and all the streetlights in front of me, starting from the closest to the first light, started flickering and going out, and it was only the ones on my side of the road. At this point I said nope, turned around, went home and called in. I heard sirens later in the morning but was not going to investigate. Been maybe 5 years and it still freaks me out when a street light suddenly flickers and goes out.",
            "I was about 18-20 (around 2008) and in the backseat of the car going down the highway. It wasn't windy out in the slightest (unless you count the wind from the car going 60mph on the highway, but that's irrelevant). We're going between two large hills (not mountains, but they're about 50ft+ tall) and atop one of the hills is what looks like an all black hot air balloon kind of thing, but not made of cloth or fabric. It's clearly metal and had no basket and it has no sunlight shine/reflection, like a black matte color.\n\nNo wind, but this thing is moving like you see UFOs zip around in movies. It's literally going like 100+ MPH all over the place in different directions and turning upside down and sideways super fast. There were several cars pulled over on the side of the highway with people outside gawking at it. We didn't pull over but mom and dad also commented that they had no fucking clue what it was and had never seen anything like it before.\n\nMy dad tried rationalizing that it was a fallen weather balloon, but it looked nothing like a weather balloon on google images. Someone else I told this to said it was probably a broken hot-air balloon, but this was very clearly not made of anything flexible like cloth, it was very stiff and not 100% the exact same shape.",
            "When I was 8 I had one of those life size rag dolls with yarn hair. one night I woke up and she was waving her arms around while placed on my bean bag.\n\nI know it\u2019s not malicious, I know it sounds crazy. I know it sounds like I was dreaming...but I wasn\u2019t. she was moving around all by herself. to this day I don\u2019t fuck with dolls.\n\nedit: so when I saw her moving I got super scared and hid under my blanket for like 10 minutes with my heart racing frozen in fear building up the courage to run out of my room. Eventually I ran out of my room to get my parents who\u2019s bedroom was downstairs, and my dad came and got the doll and put her in the living room. I was too scared to sleep in my room so I went to sleep in my brothers bed which I would do when I had bad dreams and stuff.\n\nWe heard farting and magazine pages flipping and at  first thought it was my dad (it was like 4am at this point) who just couldn\u2019t go back to sleep, but when we were yelling out for my dad he didn\u2019t answer, so we were like omg it\u2019s Samantha (the doll)\n\nSince I was with my big brother I was brave and we started shouting at her from his bedroom saying we weren\u2019t scared and we were gonna kill her and all this lmao.\n\nI was so traumatized by this living doll though that my parents brought her to my Nana\u2019s house. it was a Christmas gift from a family friend that I didn\u2019t want to get rid of cause I felt bad and didn\u2019t want the doll to come back and be mad at me.\n\nBut I would go for sleepovers at my Nana\u2019s multiple times every year and when I would go, she would take the doll out of the playroom and put it in the back room and lock the door. It was always so hard to fall asleep but the dog would always sleep with me which would help.\n\nFast forward when I was 15 and having a ton of mental health issues (unrelated to the doll lol) and a new med ended up making me have some paranoia and see a few things including a little girl a few times. My aunt was upset over my struggles and hearing the \u201clittle girl visuals\u201d she went to my Nana\u2019s, took the doll, and burned it in the backyard to end my fear of it once and for all.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the full story and what happened with the doll.",
            "I drove home at 2 am one night. I live way in the country. I was on back roads  I've drove many times, and this car looked like it was coming over the hill quite a ways away. As I got closer it seemed like it was parked just over the hill waiting. I stopped and waited as it was a long way off when I first saw it so it should have come over the hill a while ago. Waited 5 minutes. ( seemed really weird for where I was. No houses around )  Started to drive up to it and the light got super bright and then it went dark.

            "Sorry this is a long one! \n\nWas on holiday staying at an old cottage. Went out to the beach with my mum dad and sister and left my grandma in the house. She fell asleep sitting in a chair in the lounge. \n\nAt one point whilst we were still out, my half asleep nan saw a woman wearing a lilac dress walking through the room. She assumed it was my mum back from the beach. She woke up a short time after and couldn't find us in the house. When we got back from the beach a couple of hours later she said oh did you go out again? You were back ages ago. We told her that we had only just got back and she told us she had seen my mum wearing a long lilac dress in the lounge. This obviously wasn't possible. \n\nDuring this holiday, I was sharing a room with my sister as we were young and in the middle of the night we heard the front door slam loudly. Our parents came running into our room but we were both still in our beds. I scrambled and looked out the window which was directly above the front door but noone was outside and my dad went straight down and could find noone in the house. \n\nAnother day my mum went to the bookcase in her room and took a random book out, placed within the pages there was an old handwritten note, it was personal written by a lady and she got a feeling that she shouldn't be reading them. She put them back into the book and put the book back on the shelf. The next morning when she woke up, the note was on her bedside table. She asked my dad if he had moved it out of the book but he had no idea what she was talking about.\n\nWe would also find that the furniture had moved downstairs overnight sometimes. My mum also kept finding curtain hooks in her bed and on the side table (the plastic things that hold curtains to the pole) again she asked my dad if he had put them there and he hadn't.\n\nWhen we came to leave, the owner of the cottage came to collect the keys and my mum asked her if there was a cleaner who might have visited and the owner said no - why? My mum explained that my nan had seen a lady in the house wearing a lilac dress. The lady said \"oh, she's at it again\" - The house was owned by her grandmother who had recently died, her favourite outfit was - you guessed it - a long lilac dress. Apparently they had already had the house blessed because she had made a couple of other appearances. When she died, they didn't clear her stuff out of the house and just put it up as a holiday rental which is why the note hadn't previously been found.\n\nOnce we left and went home for the next few years my mum would find curtain hooks in her bed at home. I moved out of our family home to go to college / uni and at my student house i once found a curtain hook in my bed there. (There were no curtains in the house only blinds) My mum stopped finding them in her bed after a few years but believes it was the woman in lilac. My whole family witnessed all of this so it adds credibility to what happened, combined with the owners testimony about her gran.  \n\nIt actually kind of creeps me out writing this down now as it has kind of been forgotten about and posting it makes it feel real again. But this was a genuine experience we all shared. I hope I didnt miss anything out and if you made it this far thanks for reading!",

I mean there is literally not a person in the place. No wait staff, no customers, no cooks. Nobody. There was partially eaten food on all the tables. Bags and purses in the booths. TVs on everywhere. Burgers on the grill slowly burning.

Can\u2019t see anything but, in the dream, it feels like some sort of smoke is filling up the gym and I can hear and barely see people panicking, running to the exit.  Feels like maybe it\u2019s a terrorist attack?  I start running, trying to get to the exit, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to breathe.  Just as I\u2019m kind of hyperventilating and succumbing to the toxic smoke... I jolt awake.  Very intense dream that stuck with me.\n\nA week later, in real, actual life, I\u2019m working out in my gym... and boom, the lights and TV screens go out.

In the dream, we were able to narrowly avoid each crash of car as we drove down the interstate. When I woke up, I thought, Texas doesn\u2019t even get ice storms (I was only 19 at the time). Then, a couple weeks later, I saw on the news there was an ice storm in Texas that caused a pile-up on the interstate. I told a friend of mine I dreamt about that a couple weeks back, but he didn\u2019t believe me.\n\nThe second time occurred when I was an exchange student in Mexico. I dreamt there was a volcano that erupted somewhere and there was flooding and mayhem and people being swept away. I told my buddy about my dream while we sat at the kitchen table of our home stay. We turn the tv on and there was a news story of everything I just told him.\n\nIt\u2019s been 25 years, and I haven\u2019t had another dream like those ever since.",
            "This actually happned last night.\n\nSo I went to the bathroom and outside the door I hear someone walking, no big deal since I have siblings- Thats when I hear **FUCKING SNIFFING.** That caught me off guard since the dogs in the kitchen. So I stay in there for a while more then I hear someone walk by the door, Maybe its grandma? No, I would hear her cane. THEN I HEAR THE SNIFFING AGAIN.\n\nAnyways, thats how I ended up staying in the bathroom for about 20 min.",

            "Hubs and I going up to my parents\u2019 house on Christmas Eve. Hubs is driving, we\u2019re in the mountains, there\u2019s snow on the ground. It\u2019s just past midnight. \n\nI see a woman wearing shorts and a striped tee shirt, walking a dog, wearing no shoes. She has brown feathered hair- think Farrah Fawcet in the 80s. I turn to my husband to ask him if he sees this crazy woman... and she\u2019s gone. Weirded myself out, but laughed it off. \n\nNext day, I tell the story to my parents. They give each other a weird look, and my Dad says...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen her, too.\u201d",
            "I was driving to work on a two lane highway, and I was going about 65 in a 45 zone when for some reason I got the feeling that I should slow down. \n\nI don\u2019t know why that thought came into my head as I was a young douchebag who sped all the time, but it was strong enough that I let  off the gas and slowed down tho the speed limit and right then, like 30 seconds later, a guy in a pickup pulled out of a parking lot right in front of me. I got on the brakes, but still t-boned him hard enough to knock the bed clean off his truck, and totaled both vehicles. \n\nNeither of us were injured, but hard to say what effect another 20 mph would have had on that...",
            "I've shared this story before, but when I was 17 I was at my friend's apartment building, which his parents owned. It was a pretty old building in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago, and according to his dad it used to be owned by Al Capone, but I'm not sure how true that was. We had an apartment on the top floor that they let us use to just hang out and it allowed us easy access to the attic (it had a lock but we had a key) so we could go out to the roof and smoke cigarettes.\n\nOne night, we were about to go up, but I had to pee, so I told him I'd meet him up there. After I was done, I went up the stairs to the attic portion that was connected to the roof. There were no lights, so we always used our phones to guide us. We had those old flip phones without lights, so you only had the light from the screen to help navigate the cluttered mess that was up there.\n\nAs I made my way to the roof door, I saw a shadow pass by me. Now this wasn't like the shadow of something moving with the light of my phone, this shadow felt solid like a person. I followed the direction it went thinking it was my friend. I kept saying that I knew it was him and to stop playing around. It passed me a few more times, before heading to the other side of the attic and that's when I heard my friends voice from downstairs.\n\nHe got a call from his girlfriend and was in another room talking to her the whole time. It really freaked me out, since I know I was following something, so I basically jumped down the stairs. I told my friend what happened and that I did not want to go back up there and he agreed, so we decided to go for a walk instead.",
            "Sometimes when I walk at night street lights will go out above me and turn back on when I\u2019m a few meters away. It\u2019s happened ever since I was a kid. It\u2019s frequent enough that other people notice it happening around me. I literally don\u2019t understand how or why it happens.\n\nEdit- with the amount of people saying it happens to them too we need to make a sub for it and try and get a video of it!",
            "My sister had two pet parakeets. Named Tweety and Sweety. One day, they somehow got out of their cage and flew away. We still haven\u2019t figured out how they got out of the enclosed cage, nobody was home at the time. \n\nBut that\u2019s nothing: later that exact same day, my sister was inconsolable. I was outside and I see this very colorful small bird. Definitely not my sisters\u2019, but clearly not wild. We caught it and still have it today. Still haven\u2019t named it.",
            "It's hard to pick the strangest, but there was the time a can of soda exsploded, and then didn't. \n\nI was working in my garden and had gotten myself a can of coke zero. I cracked it open on my way out the back door, took a few hearty chugs and sat it on my small garden table I keep out by my raised beds, and got back to working in the garden. I have on wireless earbuds and listening to a podcast as I work on cleaning the pumpkin patch of weeds, when out of the blue I hear and practically *feel* a loud *BANG*, to the point I exclaimed louded \"what the fuck?!\"  and pull my ear buds out. \n\nI live in a rough neighborhood, there's been shootings and what not so I kind of duck down and start looking around to get a feel of things. That's when I see it. My can of coke is knocked down to the ground and just spitting foamy coke every where. No way that's the noise, right? But I run over and pick it up (with the logic being diet coke probably isn't even good for plants) and I wipe it clean and start looking it over and I realize not only is it *full*, it's completely unopened. I know I opened it, I know I drank half of it, and I know moments before I had seen it laying on the ground shooting coke up into the air. I even had to wipe it off.\n\nI have no idea what the bang was, or how my open spilled coke suddenly became full and unopened in my hands.",

He said he would come back and visit me and bring photos of the injuries that the Dr.s said would leave him unable to walk (same diagnosis I had been given).\nHe did come back with photos, we had a good talk, I felt very encouraged when he left.

So ceremony ends and we drive to my grandmas house waaaaay across town in the styx. We pull up, and the doves are there. My grandma starts bawling, saying it\u2019s a sign and stuff. We had to call the guy to come get them. Said he had never seen anything like that before.\n\nEdit:auto correct dropped the ball\n\nP.S. Should also add, something I didn\u2019t witness, that my great grandmother would walk down the street and back for exercise. She\u2019d then ring the bell outside the entrance to the property, there was a courtyard between the property line and the actual house that had steps she\u2019d need help getting up. She\u2019d start her walk at the same time everyday to make it back in time to watch her favorite thing, Mexican wrestling. Well, for a couple weeks after, the bell would ring at about the same time everyday, the usual time of her walk, with no one pressing the bell. My grandma also took that as a sign. My dad and uncles sat out there a couple times to watch to see if anyone was maybe pressing the button. But they\u2019d watch, and the bell would still ring. My dad wanted to open up the bell and check the wiring and components but my grandma pleaded not to. It stopped not too long after. I\u2019m an open skeptic. I want to believe but need proof. I believe in energy and circle of life kind of stuff and have experienced some strange \u201c coincidences.\u201d But either way, whatever was happening, helped my lovely grandmother grieve. That grandmother died in her early 60s from breast cancer. About 12 years later, I\u2019d lose my other grandmother. It was an exhaustive process. My uncles and mother were spent and obviously in pieces. I had to step up and do almost everything. The lady that helped me with the funeral, legal stuff, etc. actually had the same name as my other grandmother who died. She was exceptionally lovely and helpful.",

It happens but the weird part is that I have this feeling of immense fear and all of a sudden I would hear really loud sounds. An example is hearing an orchestra play a note off key for a few seconds and then suddenly silence. It was awful. I use to think it was paranormal but now I\u2019m 100% sure it isn\u2019t. I still have no idea what caused those insane moments to happen. I know for sure I was awake and I know it wasn\u2019t sleep paralysis cause I would be able to move.

If anyone else has gone through that or knows what it is please do tell! \n\nOh and I also use to feel like I\u2019m falling when I\u2019m laying in bed.

I just always locked myself in the bedroom at night because of it. I, also, being a paranoid human made sure every door was locked and bolted every time I got in the house. \n\nOne night I was getting ready for bed and went to the room, and I ended up hearing loud heavy foot steps outside and what sounded like a door slam. I turned all the lights on to go check (dog was still in the living room) and he was laying on the couch staring at me as the front door was wide open. When I tell you I was freaked out. \n\nNo one believed me about the noises or the door until my boyfriend spent the night one night and heard the footsteps and dog paws in the living room.

They had to be processed one slide at a time so even though they were just boring pictures of a family\u2019s vacation, they stuck in my mind unlike most photos we printed. Especially one where the family was posed around a pretty distinct sign that said \u201cWelcome to New Mexico.\u201d Several hours later a different customer brought in a roll of film to be developed. I was pretty blown away when the first few pictures were of her family standing in front of the exact same sign in New Mexico as the earlier customer! 2 entirety different customers who probably lived in the same neighborhood decided to come into the exact same store on the exact same day to get pictures developed of the exact same vacation they took decades apart.

I stood in the foyer scanning my surroundings & I remember the house was empty of furniture & people & only some track lighting was on, so it was rather dim. There was a door to my right & when I opened it, a noose dropped down from above the door, & then I woke up. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time, other than how vivid & real it was. Two weeks later, my Dad called to tell me my 14yo cousin had hung himself.

As I got closer I realised it was a fairly decent sized (2-3lb) carp. Not the ornamental type but a lake/river fish (I used to fish at the time). It was still alive so could only have been there a very short time. I picked it up and ran around looking for water when I saw that one of houses had a small goldfish pond so I dropped it in there.

Only dawned on me now reading some of these other responses. \n\nWhen I was on exchange in Australia, I took a trip down the east coast with 5 friends. We rented a big junker van and squeezed 6 of us in a 5 seater (not safe at all). It\u2019s my turn to drive one evening heading into Mission Beach. We are going down this winding two lane highway. It\u2019s a remote area, a sort of tall grass plain close on either side of the road . \n\nAs I\u2019m driving all the sudden I get what I guess I would call an intrusive thought.

I knew right away I would have to run it over, there was no time to react. If I swerve we could all die. I Hit the poor thing with a loud thud that startled everyone. \n\nPerhaps purely coincidence, or maybe it can be logically explained that I noticed the hazard and acted accordingly but it felt different. The thought was so sudden and extreme that I needed to run an animal over or my friends would die that it felt like an early warning for something that was literally about to happen. If it weren\u2019t for that sort of warning I probably would have instinctively swerved when I saw the wallaby and rolled the van. Luckily that did not happen. \n\nRIP lil wallaby",

The voicemail was mostly garbled shouting and crying, but it definitely sounded like my voice, then my ex telling me to calm down, then me crying again.\n\nMy phone had no record of the calls, or the voicemail. We hadn\u2019t argued, or yelled. I hadn\u2019t cried. \n\nWe still don\u2019t know what happened, but it was weird as heck.",
            "One time I pulled my phone out of my pocket and there was shaving cream all over it. I was at work. I had just taken it out of my pocket when I clocked out for my break. I put it back in my pocket. I walk over to my friend's desk. I pull it back out of my pocket to show her something and there was shaving cream all over it. No fuckin clue. Still baffled to this day.\n\nEdit: It was crazy though! It was all over the phone. I had to take it out the case to clean it off. Pocket was completely dry. And it was the shaving cream I use at home. My sister works at bath and body works so I had the hook up to really nice shaving cream for free. It's not like a normal shaving cream. It was a thick silvery paste, not that stuff that comes out like gel and turns to foam. And it has a really nice scent and it smelled just like that. It was crazy. The matrix definitely glitched. Aliens. Idk, something happened.",
            "I find this story very weird. So I was at the beach with almost my whole family and my dad had to leave due to work stuff he needed to finish. After ~30 minutes I was talking to my aunt when she got a call I didn\u2019t even knew who was it but I immediately thought \u201cMy dad crashed his car\u201d. It turns out that my dad did crashed his car and he called her asking for a ride back. He was fine, thankfully.",
            "This will probably get lost in the sea of comments, anyway.\n\nI took a solo backpacking trip to Japan in 2018. During the first week of the trip a group of travellers and myself decided to go and drink at one of the local karaoke bars. After approximately 2 hours of constant drinking and singing we all left the place fairly drunk. \n\nWe were all on the street when myself and a girl from the group decided that we needed to go to the toilet. We left the group that was congregating on the sidewalk and entered a building a block or two away.\nWe caught an elevator up a few floors an exited, as we were walking down these red felt corridors we approached the entry of what seemed to be an old school Japanese gentlemans club. The tipsy Danish girl whome I was with walked straight on into the place and I instantly got tingles in the back of my neck. Every single Japanese man there was looking at her as she strolled on up to the bar. I felt something was off and grabbed her wrist and swiftly pulled her out. \n\nWe jogged out of that place and came to a set of firestairs, we started to briskly walk down them while talking about that weird encounter. This is where it gets fucked. \n\nDuring our rush down stairs we went one floor lower then we should have and ended up in the basement. As I rounded the corner I saw a man dressed in a SWAT uniform couching with his gun drawn (his back to us) in the room I could count about 3-4 dead Japanese men  riddled with bullet holes leaning up against pillers and on the floor. I grabbed my Danish friend and noped the fuck out of that place. \n\nStill to this day I don't know what the fuck I saw. Was it a snuff?, was it roleplay? I dunno. I was very drunk but I also know what I saw.\n\n*Excuse the grammer and spelling, writing this on a work poo break.",
            "It's 2008, I'm in my dorm room working on a paper and I've been pounding water and coffee. I have to pee but I'm in the zone. My suite-mate comes home from class. We mumble a greeting to each other, he enters his room, mills around, then leaves. Gotta pee, can't hold it anymore. Paper pause, I get up and go to the bathroom, passing my suite-mate's open bedroom door, and go into the bathroom. My brain is in full writing mode, I'm still on the page and I might as well be in a different universe. I close the bathroom door and lock it but my hand literally would not let go of the door handle, as if it wasn't mine to command. I come to realize that the hairs on my neck are standing. I really need to pee but there is this overwhelming sense of alarm. I reluctantly opened the door that my hand was still attached to view a perfect line into my suite-mate's open room. It's on fire. Or at least his nightstand is. He had come home and lit a candle on his night stand (not allowed). He then decided to head to the kitchen to make an afternoon snack and as he walked out of his room he took off his trucker cap and tossed it onto his nightstand... directly onto a freshly lit scented candle (fellow smoked a *lot* ). The plastic/napalm hat was shooting a jet of flame at least a meter/yard up the wall, licking posters and a calendar. It looked like a textbook fire safety video.\n\nI threw the hat on the ground and stomped it out. I assumed the guy would come back soon and could explain what happened.. but he just didn't. (I brought it up a couple of days later in the dining hall and he was relieved to figure out why his hat was melted and smashed.) It gave me enough time to walk through what had happened. What I can't explain is how my brain detected something outside of my extreme peripheral perception. It would have had to be done by hearing or smell in a dorm hall that was bereft of pleasantness or quiet. This is also the only time I have had a hand deny me its function.\n\nI have had a couple other instances like this where I was overcome by a sudden and incapacitating sense of doom where something bad happened as a result, but they were both more abstract and had minimal physical effects. I am not an anxious or credulous individual, but this has always been something that fizzles in the back of my mind."

We could barely afford it at the time, but donated the hundred bucks and they put Whoopi Goldberg on the line! She thanked us, said a few things...we mostly just smiled and at the end she was wrapping it up and I said \"you are awesome as center square!\" and she laughed! one of my friends to this day periodically reminds me that I once made Whoopi Goldberg laugh :)",
            "I live in Maine. My brother is a hobbyist photographer (a really good one, in my opinion), so one Christmas he gave my girlfriend and I some nice prints of some photos he took of us. He threw in a few scratch tickets to fill out the gift bag. Lucky for us - we won $30,000 on one of the scratch tickets! We used most of it to pay off the interest on our student loans (ugh), but used the rest for a vacation to Ireland, a place my girlfriend and I always wanted to visit. It was amazing.\n\nFlash forward a few years, my brother (who lives in DC) has a new girlfriend. She spent a year studying abroad in Ireland back in college, so we chatted a bit about how much we both loved the country. The conversation moved on to something else, as conversations tend to do. However, someone pipes in later \u201cHey parkerob, did you know that brother\u2019s giffle spent a year in Ireland!?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh yeah, we talked about that earlier, so cool.\u201d\n\nNow back on the subject of Ireland, we start discussing some of more obscure things we did on the trip. I bring up this stand up comedy show we found one night, in the basement of some pub. Really small space, probably 20 people in the audience at most. Brother\u2019s girlfriend says that she had been to show there once, too! I start remembering some traits of the comedians - one was black Scottish dude, another was a young woman with the side of her head shaved, the emcee was even funnier than the main acts. \n\nHer jaw drops - she remembers those same comedians, too. I\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s way too much of a coincidence, so I look up the old event schedules to see if those same acts performed on multiple dates. Nope. Only once. What a crazy coincidence.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were at the same 20-person basement comedy show as my brother\u2019s future girlfriend, in completely different country, on a trip that was funded by a scratch ticket from said brother. Pretty neat.",
            "When I (F44) was 18 years old I was travelling alone from the US to visit my parents who lived in Russia. My connecting flight in a super rough city (in the US) got cancelled. I can't remember exactly what happened but I believe that there was a weather issue and all flights were grounded. It was very late at night. I was young and naive and had no idea what to do, and so I just stood in the airport looking lost and trying not to cry. \n\nA gentleman in a suit- probably in his mid to late 20 's --possibly early thirties noticed me looking distraught and realized it was because I was going to be stranded at the airport. He offered to help me find a hotel. He said he was on the phone with his travel agent and managed to find 2 rooms. Then he offered to share a cab with me. Looking back it was so dangerous, but I got in the cab with this stranger and went to the motel. I had no cash and this was a time before cabs took credit cards and before uber. \n\nWhen we got to the hotel i tried to figure out a way to use my credit card to pay but he just paid for the cab. Motel was a total shithole in a REALLY rough area but there were no other rooms because of the airport canceling flights. While we were checking in, a prostitute popped in the lobby and asked if we had any condoms. I was too dumb to be terrified. When I went to give the clerk my credit card for the room, this guy said no and paid for both rooms. He then asked me how I was going to get back to the airport in the morning and I told him I would figure something out, but truthfully I had no idea as I had no way to get any cash. \nThis man walked me to my door and did not even stop at the door; did not suggest drinks, did not suggest hanging out, didn't try ANYTHING.  He continued to walk past my room and said over his shoulder, \"please make sure you lock the door\".\n\nI am sure this motel was used to \"pay by the hour\" clientele, as in the morning the front desk called my room to tell me that my \"boyfriend\" had left an envelope for me. In the envelope was a $20 bill and a note that said \"use this to get back to the airport\". \n\nHe never told me his last name or any way to find him after; he expected nothing from me. \n\nI have no idea who that man was but I really wish I could find him and thank him. Thinking about this story has restored my faith in humanity many times in my life. What a good human.\n\nIf this man is found, he will remember the city we were stuck in.",
            "I realize this post already has over 1,200 comments but writing things down feels good sometimes.\n\n\n\nWhen I was in college, I was dating a guy who lived in an off-campus apartment. One night when he was walking me down to the lobby to head home, there was a woman on the floor just outside the elevator. I remember she was wearing a skirt and her blouse was backwards. She was looking in her purse for her keys. We initially stepped around her to leave because we live in a city with a lot of college students so drunk folks on the ground aren\u2019t uncommon. But something felt wrong. I turned around and went back to her and asked if she needed help. She was slurring really bad, talking about how she lived here and she needed her keys. I offered to help her get to her apartment and was eventually able to prop her up, get her in the elevator and then down the hallway to the door number she kept repeating. I asked if she had roommates or a boyfriend and she just kept saying \u201che\u2019s in there.\u201d So I knocked but no answer. I knocked super loud again but no answer. Woman is now back on the floor and actually drooling/spitting like drunk folks do when they might throw up or have already thrown up. So she\u2019s exactly zero help. I end up going through her purse to try to find information or keys or something because she hasn\u2019t even been able to tell me her name at this point. On top of her stuff in her purse is her underwear, balled up. I pushed it to the side and kept digging where I found the woman\u2019s work badge with her keys attached. I put the keys in the door to open it.. but it doesn\u2019t work. She tells me over and over that those are the keys and they work, despite my showing her that they don\u2019t. I knock another time but no answer. I go back into her purse to find a phone or something and there is mail in there with her name on it, but a completely different address in a different borough of the city. \n\n\nMy stomachs drops. This woman is heavily intoxicated. Her blouse is on backwards. Her underwear is in her purse. She\u2019s been insisting that she came out of this apartment where her boyfriend lives but nobody is answering and she lives on the other side of town. \n\n\nEventually, after probably 45 minutes, I am able to get the woman to unlock her phone. Obviously I don\u2019t know who any of the people in her contacts are, so I just call the one labeled Mom. After a few tries, Mom answers, clearly having been asleep. I explain that I am a stranger but I have her daughter with me and I\u2019m trying to get her home. Mom confirms the address on the envelopes is where she lives. We talk for a couple minutes and I give her my number. \n\n\nNext I focus on getting a cab and bringing her home. I eventually get her inside, put her in bed, phone on the charger and a couple bottles of water next to it and a trash bin. I send a text to her mom to let her know she\u2019s home and in bed, then I leave.\n\n\n\nThe next day, I\u2019m on the bus between classes when Mom calls me. She thanks me for helping her daughter last night and they wanted to let me know what happened.\n\n\nThe woman went on a date with a guy she met on an app. They went and had 2 drinks at a restaurant, but the woman became insanely drunk very fast. It turns out that when she went to the restroom, he had drugged her drink when it came to the table. He took her back to his apartment and assaulted her, then dumped her in the lobby where I found her. The door we were pounding on was the rapist\u2019s door. The woman didn\u2019t remember hardly anything the next day after the drink, but she was sore and smelled latex when she went to the bathroom. If I had taken her to the hospital instead of just taking her home, she could have received treatment faster and had a report written.\n\n\n\nThat day I wrote down in a Word document everything I remembered from the night before in excruciating detail. I told Mom that I did this and was willing to testify or talk to police or do anything needed of me. She said she would tell her daughter but she just wants to move on. I texted Mom a few months later to ask how her daughter is doing and to remind her I\u2019m still able to provide a statement or anything else. That\u2019s the last time I talked to her.\n\n\nThat was years ago but whenever I get a new computer, I make sure to transfer that Word document to a safe place on it, just in case they ever came back and needed it.",
            "I was at the zoo one time when I was younger (camp trip) and I stopped by the Gorilla enclosure. The gorillas, being gorillas, were ambling all over the place and hooting like crazy. But for some odd reason, when they saw my face, they were enchanted. I had 4-5 gorillas just staring at me, and lounging around. They didn\u2019t seem territorial or anything. I ended up playing a game of peekaboo with one of them, and unfortunately never got to see any of the other enclosures. It\u2019s a fond memory that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\nAddendum:\n\nChimps did the same thing to me as I was walking out of the zoo. Like what did they want with me? What did they see in me?

            "The story of how my mother reunited with her sister. My mother was born in the very Far East of Russia. Her father was a survivor of the Gulags and she was raised in a small settlement that was mainly populated by ex-prisoners and their families. Before my grandfather married, he had survived a mine collapse and while in recovery had an affair with a nurse that produced a child. After being released and settling down with my grandmother, he had reached out and established contact with his daughter. They met a few times and he even took my mother on a few occasions to meet her (she lived in a city 5000km to the south). But eventually, once the government let them move, my mother\u2019s family moved across the country and this being the times before cell phones and social media - they lost touch with my aunt. The last time my mother saw her - she was about 12 and my aunt was about 20.\n\nFast forward about 17 years later - my mother is on the Moscow metro, taking my sister to music school. She sees a woman sitting across from her and as she describes it, just felt a \u201cgravitational pull\u201d towards her. She begins staring at her, trying to figure out why it feels like she knows this person. Suddenly - it clicks, and as the train pulls into my mother\u2019s stop, she gets up and grabs this woman and says \u201cAre you AnotherRusskiPianist\u2019s aunt, daughter of his grandfather? Get off the train with me now!\u201d And lo and behold, her intuition was right.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how after about 17 years of no contact, my mother just happened to reunite with her long lost sister on a crowded Moscow metro train.",
            "When I worked for USFS, there was one week I'd been flown in with a wildland fire crew by helicopter to this super remote mountaintop way out in the backwoods of Idaho. We were miles and miles away from anything. (In fact, when one of our guys went through his boot with a chainsaw, it took like six hours to get him out and that was with a medevac.) \n\nI was on a crew of young people, mostly young women, and we were assisting the crew of slightly older men. The only other woman on the mountain was the chief of their crew, Tara, which will be important later. \n\nSo, my crew went to sleep first and a couple of the older guys stayed up drinking. And from somewhere outside of the light of their fire, they heard this awful blood curling scream like a woman being tortured. They of course came running to see if it was my crew but it wasn't. So then they remember that their chief is also on the mountain and she's sleeping in a hammock way away from everyone else, so they go running to find her. \n\nWhen they get there, they see Tara facing down a massive cougar. And though she was shouting obscenities at it, it was actually the cougar making those unearthly screams that echoed off the mountains. It continued to stalk her even when there were three people there yelling at it and even when they started a chainsaw to scare it off. Eventually, one of the guys ran screaming at it with an axe like a beserker and it backed off. \n\nI'll never forget that scream. And I'll never forget realizing that for it to spot Tara and lable her as one of the weakest and single her out as the only one not sleeping with a group, the cat must have been walking around right outside the reach of the firelight for a long time.",
            "Wife was on her first zoom meeting last March in the kitchen. I asked if I could be off screen cooking breakfast quietly and she said yes, as long as I\u2019m quiet and not distracting. I wound up burning what I was cooking, causing lots of smoke. Then when I was trying my best to get the situation under control, my robe that I was wearing layed on the burner (electric stove) and started smoking. So basically my wife told me to not be distracting, and I wound up lighting myself on fire. To her credit, she maintained poise and completely ignored my situation. We still laugh about it a year later.",
            "My step sister has a lot of mental and health issues. Severely autistic and a lot of people assume she just can't function. My step mother (neither of our mothers, another wife) was horribly abusive when we were kids and much more so to my sister because she couldn't vocalize it. There was a point right after my grandparents got custody that my sister enough and just walked downstairs, stared our step mother in the eye and pissed everywhere before walking back upstairs. She knows exactly what she did and it was the funniest shit because the step mother had to clean it. To this day she acts like my sister was a horrible person who just didn't like her and every time she tells the story I laugh my ass off because my sister dealt with so much shit and that was her best \"fuck you\".",
            "I have never seen a question that would let me tell this story. \n\nI was a production assistant on a stop motion kids show. A big part of my job was going out to purchase supplies the workshop needed to build the sets and puppets etc. Now the thing about these kind of workshops is they will use whatever works and they often come up with unorthodox solutions as short cuts, like the time they sent me to a sex shop at 9:30 am to buy thumb cuffs (our cop puppet needed handcuffs and they were the perfect size.) But that didn't even compare to my most\n amusing/embarrassing supply run ever.\nThe animation director came up to me one afternoon saying that he needed me to go to the drugstore. to buy, and I quote,\" the largest tube of KY Jelly you can find. \" ( in stop motion KY is used to simulate water, especially when it has to interact with the puppets. It stays put between frames and doesn't damage the paint.) Anyway, our seamstress overheard our discussion and asked me while I was at the drugstore to get every tube of Wet wipes they had.( safe way to clean the puppets and wardrobe and we went through a lot of them) Next, the woman in charge of making all the limbs pipes up and asks me to get 6 pairs of white nylons while I'm at it. ( they hold the magnets in the feet) \n\nSo this was my shopping list:\nOne extra large tube of KY Jelly\n6 pairs of white nylons\nAnd every tube of wet wipes in the store\n\nThe look on the cashier's face when I dumped  my basket out on the counter was priceless... and for me fairly embarrassing.",
            "My great-grandmother lived in a nursing home for the last years of her life. She was about 95, with minimal eyesight and hearing when this happened:\n\nMy great-grandmother told my mother, she was afraid of \"that lady in black\". \"What woman in black?\" my mother would ask. \"The one that is standing at my bed every night. I think, she is finally coming to get me.\" Naturally, my mother dismissed this as a figment of her granny's imagination.\n\nOne evening, when my mother was visiting, ggm told her \"I think, I am going to die tonight. Can you stay? I don't want to be alone when the lady in black comes for me.\" So my mother stayed at her bed, sleeping uncomfortably in an old armchair. Suddenly, she awoke to some noise she could not immediately pinpoint, but she saw a figure in a long, black gown, standing at the far end of the bed. My mothers scream must have woken the whole nursing home, but it especially scared the lady in black. she turned tail, left the room and ran into one of the nurses, who came running to investigate my mother's scream.\n\nIt turned out, the lady in black was my ggm's bedridden and demented neighbour. Nobody knew, she could actually walk, let alone dress up in her favourite black dress and wander the nursing home at night. Apparently, she was seen by some of he other inhabitants, who, fearing they would thought to be crazy, simply never talked about the ghost that would enter their rooms at night to stand at their beds and water their plants.",

            "My family pet growing up was named Arwen, and she was a massive Airedale terrier. She was the light of our lives, truly the worlds best dog. She would herd the chickens and let the baby chicks nestle into her fur and nap on her as she sat quietly in the sunshine, not moving lest the peeps be disturbed. But her most heroic act came when my brother Liam (about 10 at the time) was trying to move our basketball hoop and base out into the yard for the summer. He didn\u2019t notice the two rattlesnakes coiled up under the base. But Arwen did. She leapt in front of Liam, between him and the snakes, and both Liam and my dad (who was nearby) saw both snakes strike. Dad ran and grabbed Liam, pulled him away, pulled Arwen aside with the other hand, then sent Liam running to grab the hatchet to dispatch the snakes. We took Arwen inside and put her on her bed, and we called the vet. The vet said he would come out to put the dog down but if she was bitten by two snakes, there was basically no chance she\u2019d live. But my Mom said no way in hell was she putting her baby down without a fight. So she did some googling, and found out that just loading the poor dog with Benadryl can counteract snake venom. And that\u2019s just what she did. Arwen lay still, swollen and bleeding, for three days. But then she got up. And she walked around. And she lived five more years, dying at 17. She was the best dog.",

He sent me to Walmart to stock us up. \n\nI loaded about 10 or 15 cans of Comet and a few jugs of Clorox in the buggy and was headed over to get something on the other side of the store.  As I rounded a corner I almost collided with another lady\u2019s buggy.  She looked down and all but SCREAMED \u201cIs there a SALE!! on COMET!!  OH MY GOD!\u201d  And took off running with her buggy towards the cleaning aisle.  I tried very hard to catch her and tell her it was for work.  But she was absolutely determined to grab the rest of the Comet.   \n\nIf you were accidentally scammed by a teenager into buying a fuck ton of comet in 1984 or so, please know I tried to stop you.",
            "Once, in high school, I had eaten some magic mushrooms right before my curfew. I went home, my family went to bed, and I was quietly enjoying myself in my bedroom. Suddenly, I hear a massive boom, like ear shattering and earth shaking. At this point, the mushrooms were fully kicked in and I was looking around like whaaaat?. I stayed still for a minute, waiting for the fallout, but nothing happened.  \n\nAfter a few minutes I crept out to my living room. My house was still quiet, but my front door was wide open.  Not knowing what to make of it, I warily looked out the door and saw people running down the street. But everyone in my house was still sleeping including my mom who was a notoriously light sleeper.\n\nAt this point, I couldn't trust my judgment. Were the shrooms hitting harder than I thought or was I in fact facing end of days? Not knowing, I went back to my room, gathered some blankets around me and set up watch from the corner of my room, too scared to do anything else. \n\nThats where my mom found me sleeping the next day when she came in to tell me the neighbor's house had blown up. They were on vacation, there was a slow gas leak and when the fridge clicked on, BOOM. A fairly large home reduced to rubble and my family slept right through it.",

Screaming commences for 5 minutes, climaxing with this brilliant line 'What the hell do you know! I have a masters degree!'. Shortly after that his wife calls asking where the hell he is and he starts blaming the staff. She starts yelling at him and he gets all sheepish then slinks out the door to the italian restaurant next door. \n\nHilarious to witness but I felt sorry for the wait staff so I left a 40% tip. Inside joke in the family now to say 'I have a masters degree!' when things start getting heated. Normally calms things down pretty quickly.",
            "When I was maybe 12 or 13 years old I was out camping in my backyard and was watching the stars hoping to see a meteor or two. Out of the corner of my eye I see a satellite moving across the sky traveling right to left. Out of the corner of my other eye I see another satellite appear moving from the horizon, up. I see the speed they are both traveling and realize that if they keep moving at their current speed and trajectory, at least to my eye, they're going to hit each other. I keep watching them get closer and closer together until finally they are about to cross paths. They intersect each other and suddenly there's a quick bright flash, and then neither of them are there anymore.\n\nI've often thought about what I saw. I know the odds that I watched two satellites collide and obliterate each other are basically zero, but I can't think of any other explanation for what I saw that night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up!\n\nThanks to u/sirxez I may be getting closer to an answer:\n\nThe timelines work out for it to have potentially been The August, 1996 collision between the French [Cerise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerise_(satellite)) military reconnaissance satellite and debris from an [Ariane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_(rocket_family)) rocket. But I would need to know where the collision happened in relation to the ground. If it was over the Northeastern US, we may have a winner!\n\nI'm having a hard time believing that a piece of space junk would be reflective enough to appear in the night sky as a setellite, but this is closer than I've ever gotten to having an answer so I'm running with it until someone finds me a better answer!\n\nEdit Edit: u/sirxez took a deeper dive and it looks like the geo-location doesn't match up. Crash happened over the Indian Ocean and I was in New England at the time.... Oh well, the search continues!",
            "Pulled a strangers dildo out of my pocket at the pub.\n\nWent to buy a new jacket at Target, tried on the one on the rack but it was 1 size too small. Went back to the rack, grabbed the next size up and went straight to the counter and paid for it. Cashier throws it in the bag, I head home and throw the bag on the table.\n\nNext night my mates turn up at my house unannounced to grab me to go to the pub. I get dressed real quick, grab the bag with the jacket and jump in the car and head off to knock the top off a couple of frothies. A few shandies later and we decide to head home, get outside and it's definitely jacket weather. I throw the jacket on, the boys give me a hard time about how fancy it is, I put my hands in the pocket and find an object in there. No idea what it is or how it got in there, I pull it out in front of everybody. I'm left standing there, in my fancy new jacket, out the front of the pub with the lads, with a strangers dildo in my hand and no idea how it got there. Of course nobody believed that I had no idea how that thing came to be in my possession. \n\nAlmost 20 years later and I am still curious about the series of events that lead up to somebody needing to hide their dildo in a jacket on the rack at Target, why they didn't return to get it, and if they did return, what their reaction was when they couldn't find the jacket.",
            "One of my favorite stories to tell. Pure shenanigans. \n\nSo when I was a teenager I was in an iconic trio of friendship with Patrick and Pinky. Once we got older though we all moved around and we would hang out in pairs but it was hard to coordinate us all hanging out at the same time. About 5 years ago we were all finally free just after Christmas and decided to meet up at our favorite spot, Denny's. Patrick had been dating this girl who is awful and I did not like her. She was mean, they fought a lot, it was a very toxic relationship. However, Pinky had made a painting of Patrick and her as a Christmas present and brought it with her to the restaurant. We also had a video camera going so this is all on tape. We were just filming us being silly and stuff. Patrick ended up dropping the news that their girlfriend was trying to get pregnant. My reaction, on tape, is \"...why?\" Lol.  We then proceeded to have a deep friend talk with them about how thats a terrible idea and they opened up about how they were really feeling about it and how things were in the relationship and we were basically trying to convince them to break up with her. But then we had this fucking painting so what are we gonna do with it? Awkward. Lol. So me and Pinky went into the women's restroom and on the wall there was nothing but a nail. We hung the painting up and it fit perfectly.  Even the colors coordinated with the style of the bathroom. It was perfect and the funniest thing ever. We left it there for YEARS and would each go back and visit it whenever one of us was in town. Apparently a while back though that Denny's closed down but luckily the painting was saved and it now lives at Patrick's brother's house.",
            "I once gave the singer Meat Loaf two very awkward handshakes. \n\nThis was obviously a few years back, when both conventions and handshakes were a thing. Meat Loaf arrived at his booth, and the first thing he did was go down his line to personally shake hands with everyone there. \n\nUnexpectedly, Meat Loaf was offering hand shakes with his left hand, and me being a righty when it came time for me to shake his hand my brain had a meltdown of what to do so instead of also using my left hand to shake his hand, I extended both hands and awkwardly cupped his. I knew I messed up so I didn't commit to the awkward hand cupping, so on top of it being awkward it was also loose (And if there's one thing that makes handshakes worse, it's when they're weirdly limp).\n\nHe then went to his booth, began signing autographs, and eventually I made my way to the front. I got my autograph, and once again he offered his left hand to shake. This second handshake was slightly better than my first, in that this time I only extended one hand, my right, which I then noticed and went \"OH\" and then finally successfully offered my left hand. He shook it, and I went on my merry way with my autograph and a new story to tell.\n\nVery nice man, was very friendly to his fans and never once brought up my inability to give a proper handshake to a left hand.",

            "I\u2019ve shared this before, but my friend from grad school had previously been a skydiving instructor in Colorado, and had jumped more than 600 times. One of these times, he (for some reason) had his wallet in his suit, and it fell out. Fell to earth somewhere, he figured \u201cThis sucks but OH WELL!\u201d Absolutely no chance of finding it.\n\nSeparately, a man in rural Colorado was found murdered. Turns out in their remote cabin where he lived with his daughter, he had been sexually abusing her and she finally had enough and killed him. The police searched the house and all of his property, and found my friends wallet in the trunk of his car. Police thought to themselves \u201cfuckin idiot murderer left his WALLET in this dudes trunk damn easiest arrest ever\u201d\n\nFriend had the super believable alibi of \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been me Officer, actually that wallet fell out of my pants while I was skydiving.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdit to add:\nMy friend was never arrested but he was questioned, and had to have his story corroborated. \nFrom what I remember of him telling me the aftermath, the cops knew early on that it was the daughter so she might\u2019ve confessed (that\u2019s pure speculation though). The sexual abuse/self defense detail didn\u2019t come out until later though. \nWhen the cops cleared my friend they told him the father had taken all of his cash. They have no idea why he kept the wallet.",
            "Back in early 2018 when I first moved to Utah to start school, I was at a 7/11 when there was this girl, and she was asking for directions to the train station. \n\nI pointed her in the right direction, but she was walking. I figured fuck it, I have an hour until class, so I'll give her a ride. \n\nShe tells me about studying/volunteering(can't remember which) in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, or some other Spanish country for months. She says she came out here to explore the area and that she moved in with an old high school friend, but he ended up being crazy and flipped out on her. She had to pretty much jump out of his truck because he wouldn't pull over. She was planning on just taking a bus out but she left her wallet in his place. \n\nI tell let's go grab it real quick but he ended up following us there and I flipped a quick u-turn out of there. Ended up completely just leaving everything there because I figured this dude might shoot us. \n\nI let her use my charger so she can get in contact with her parents to give her enough money to buy a ticket home, and sent her on her way. I had to get to class so I kinda left in a hurry once I dropped her off at the station and didn't get her info so she could let me know she made it home safe. \n\nI never got her name, but I know she was going somewhere in the Midwest. \n\nSo if this story sounds familiar, and you remember a buff bearded Mexican dude in a white Volkswagen hatchback helping ya out let me know that you're okay. It's been on my mind forever because I never knew what happened after I left.\n\n-okay, okay, I get it. Puerto Rico is a part of the US.",
            "When I was a child I thought the term \u201cbust a nut\u201d was the same as \u201cbreak a sweat\u201d or to heavily exert yourself.

            "One time I was walking across campus stoned.\n\nI'm walking by two kids, aged maybe ten and five, like twenty meters away.  Not sure why they were there without an adult, but they were.  The younger one looks at me and yells, \"Hey, I like your shirt!\"  So I yell, \"Uh, thanks!\"  He responds, \"And your backpack is ok!\"  I don't respond.  The older one yells, \"He's working on his compliments!\"  We both continue on our ways.\n\nA few hundred meters away, a dude about my age walks up with a tray of cookies, says, \"Hey, you want a cookie?\"  I'm like, \"Yea, I'd love a cookie.  What's the cookie for?\"  He says, \"No reason, just handing out cookies.  You want two?\"  I say, \"Yea, I'd love two cookies.  Thanks a lot bud.\"  So I take two cookies and they were awesome.\n\nIt was a pretty good walk.",
            "One time I had a substitute teacher who fell and hurt herself while walking me somewhere. She went to the nurse, didn't tell any of the other teachers (they asked me during lunch where she was), and disappeared forever.

I hope she's ok now.",
            "I haven\u2019t told this story in a while, but Uber Eats scammed me out of 2k+ and ruined my 20th birthday lmao. \n\nIt was pretty much my first birthday where I was on my own and didn\u2019t celebrate with my family at all, since I was a 5 hour drive away at college. It also fell on a Tuesday, so I wasn\u2019t able to do anything with friends either. The plan was to grab dinner at an Indian place that Friday to celebrate.\n\nI got out of class early, and my only celebration was to order some IHOP through the Uber Eats app. It was like my third time using it? Anyway I got some chicken tenders for $16, then took a five hour nap. Real exciting.\n\nI woke up at around 8pm, after all the food places on campus closed. So I figured, fuck it, it\u2019s my birthday. Let\u2019s order out twice!! So I tried to get some chicken nuggs from McDonald\u2019s delivered.\n\nI press confirm order, the page loads... aaand I get an error. Ok, strange, let\u2019s try again. Another error. One more.\n\nI google the error code, and see that it pops up whenever a card gets declined. That can\u2019t be right! The meal costs like $13, and At this time, I have about $1k on my bank account. For anyone who has a Student Wallet through PnC, you know that it\u2019s basically three accounts in one. You have a checking account and two savings accounts that are all linked to each other. As a broke college student, this was quite literally all I had to survive on.\n\nSo I check my bank: every. Account. Was. Cleared. Out. $0.00 across the board.\n\nI had over *thirty* different pending transactions, all from Uber eats. They ranged from .99 cents to $104, going until every account was emptied. I was sitting at about -600$ by the time I checked.\n\nSo obviously, I\u2019m freaking tf out. My bank was closed, so I couldn\u2019t call them. I hit The Uber Eats customer service: they ask me to list every transaction, which I do. They confirm the transactions came from them. Then, the agent tells me that these are just \u2018temporary holds\u2019 that they always do, and the money won\u2019t actually leave my account. Ok... but over thirty transactions?\n\nI spend hours trying to figure out what exactly went wrong in their system, and each agent keeps giving me the same copy and pasted response. \u201cThe charges won\u2019t post to your account, just wait\u201d. The thing is, with debit cards, they treat pending transactions as if the money is already off your card- so I couldn\u2019t use my money at all. I was helpless.\n\nThe next morning, I called my bank as soon as they opened. My card was cancelled, and they had to dispute each charge. There was so many of them that they couldn\u2019t all fit under one report, and had to be split into three. Usually when you dispute a transaction, the bank gives you a \u2018provisional credit\u2019, which is a temporary refund of your money. They could only provisionally refund me on one case report, which still left me at about -150$.  I would have to wait the ~two months until the investigation ended until I would get the rest of my money back.\n\nOh, and guess what? The money *did* leave my account. Not only that, but I was hit for ~10 overdraft fees for 35$ each for all the ones that bounced. And when I went back to Uber Eats about this, they *kept repeating the same message* that the transactions wouldn\u2019t post. They already posted!\n\nThat entire week was a mess. I was stranded at college with literally no money. My family struggles enough, and my mom had to skip a few bills to send me cash through Moneygram. I couldn\u2019t have money come through my bank account because it would eaten from all the fees I had accrued. I even cancelled the get together that Friday, though we were able to go in the end. \n\nHappy birthday to me. Fuck Uber Eats.",
            "I love my backpack. It's nothing fancy, just a bog standard Element rucksack, but I picked it out and it's like the only \"fashion\" brand article I own. I remember the kids in my middle school flipping out over Element gear back in they day so it brings back fond memories.\n\nAnyway a couple of years ago I was backpacking/roadtripping across Canada. We stopped at Hope, B.C. for a bite to eat before continuing on to Kelowna where we had booked accomodation for a couple of nights. I don't quite remember how, but when we arrived around 9pm and unpacked the car, I couldn't find my backpack - bearing in mind this had everything in it: passport, house keys, iPad, canadian currency, my favorite sweatshirt, phone charger... I figured the worst; that we had forgotten to lock the car while in the cafe/diner and someone had yoinked it, because I couldn't remember bringing it with me into the shop. I did not get a lot of sleep that night.\n\nThe next day I called the diner, just in case I had forgotten it inside. The nicest girl answered the phone and said that yes, there was a backpack there; I asked could she send it out to Kelowna and just take whatever it cost out of the cash envelope in the bag. She agreed immediately to send it out that evening and I hung up, relieved.\n\nUnfortunately, being a weekend, it didn't arrive before we were due to leave the area on a 7 day camping trip through Alberta down the Icefields parkway. So I asked the Airbnb owner if they could send my backpack on to our next stop in Calgary, to a UPS drop off point or whatever, and again just help themselves to some cash. She agreed, and I left on a weeklong trip with no signal, camping in the Rockies. It was a great week; I almost forgot that I was missing just about everything I would have needed to get home to Europe. I remember finally understanding what Bilbo says in the Lord of the Rings: \"I want to see mountains again, Gandalf, mountains, and then find somewhere where I can rest.\" I still wish I could go back there and do it all over.\n\nLeaving Banff though I came back down to earth with a bump. We got to Calgary for on Canada Day, so everything was closed, which meant another night of worrying - but the next day I was first in line at the UPS store to pick up my parcel. It was such a relief seeing the familiar shade of burgundy when I opened it up, and everything was there, minus about 40$ in shipping costs. \n\nWhenever I look at my bag I remember how nice people can be when you just ask for help. They went out of their way to help an idiot stranger get his bag back, and I remember all the more vividly that wonderful trip through an amazing country.",
            "One late night coming home from an evening out, my husband, a friend's of ours, and myself rounded the corner to the stairs that lead to our apartment, when we saw it. Sitting about half way up on the stairs was an opossum, eating a sandwich. He was sitting on the stairs just like people do - on his butt, with his little feet sticking out, and in his hands was an honest to God subway 6 inch, still in the paper but slightly unwrapped, just like people eat it. It was like he was a tiny person in an opossum suit. There was just something so human like about everything he was doing. We stood there for what felt like ages watching this opossum eating, and trying to figure out what to do. No way were we going to risk walking past him.. We finally decided to take the long way around back to the second set of stairs, but as long as I live I'll never forgot that opossum. It was such a truly surreal moment.\n\nEra - oh my goodness thank you for the rewards you guys! Also for everyone asking about photos - this was around 2003 so cameras weren't in everyone's pocket at that time. Trust me if that happened today I'd be sharing video of the funky little man and his sandwich.",
            "My father has gotten into a fistfight with a raccoon, a buck, a turkey, and goat all on separate occasions and at this point I\u2019m scared of the thought of him going somewhere with more dangerous animals like Alaska or Australia\n\nEdit: Since people asking and my phone finally decided I\u2019m allowed to make paragraphs:\n\nA turkey bit my sibling when he was five, and my dad somehow got it in his (admittedly drunken) mind that he needed to defend my brother\u2019s honor via fightin the turkey\n\nThe raccoon had repeatedly gotten into the chicken coop so my dad moved the chickens in the garage and staked out the coop for the bastard. Good news: he found the raccoon and had a rifle handy. Bad news: the raccoon had rabies and it turns out it\u2019s pretty hard to aim a rifle in an a small, enclosed space while trying to dodge a raccoon trying to launch itself to your leg. \nIdk where he shot it but it wasn\u2019t going down very easily and he had to resort to punching off his hip.\n\nThe goat was our senior, brain damaged goat named Ozzy. (If you want to know what he looked like, imagine if all the 80s shagged carpetting had a baby with a goat) I mention the brain damage because no goat with a quarter of a functioning braincell would from peaceful to batshit in 10 seconds and try to ram then stomp my dad quite like Ozzy did.  (or get intimate with a tire swing but that\u2019s a story for another time) They both made it out okay (though my dad had multiple hoof shaped bruises, and Ozzy had to wear the Pool Noodles Of Shame on his horns among other precautions. I know we probably should have gotten rid of Ozzy at that point he was in his twilight years as it was and we didn\u2019t want him spending it getting shipped around or slaughtered.)",
            "So about five years ago I'm walking with a guy I used to hang out with. We are crossing the street in the crosswalk and he says \"even if we get hit it's not our fault\" and we IMMEDIATELY get hit by a large truck. I fly through the air, which is actually liberating for someone with a fear of heights(kept my eyes closed though). I hit the ground about three feet from hitting a large stone pillar that would've killed me. I stand up, check on my guy, walk to the guys who hit me and say dead serious \"is your truck okay\". I walked away no injuries, the guy I hung out with had a cracked pelvic bone but turned out to be a sex offender later so ... Y'know. Love telling that story though.",

            "My grandparents have lived out in the country since they married 60 years ago and they built the house they still live in today. At some point the neighbor's house burned down and they didn't rebuild and sold the land. Eventually my grandparents came to own like 1/8th of the land. Nobody ever did anything with the land so over decades it turned into mature trees and grasses, fruit trees, berry bushes, etc. My grandpa expanded their property line some in two directions just to have some extra grass and he also maintained a walking trail on the land. Everything was so green and so refreshing compared to the drab colors of flat farmland for miles around. I basically grew up at my grandparent's house. I picked berries with my dad and made jams and pies and my cousins and I played in this abandoned barn and storage silo from the original house that used to stand there.  \n\nThe land was sold 1-2 years ago because all owners are aging. I recently visited and the new owners have completely razed the land. No more grass and no more trees. It's completely flat now. They're also trying to rezone the land from residential/farmland to industrial so they can build a factory. In their right they're trying to regain that extra land my grandpa had claimed which runs right down the center of mature pine trees my grandpa planted 30 years ago as a wind block as well as their garden. It's depressing because 1) I've only ever known that land as green and flourishing, and 2) my grandparents have enjoyed 60 years of peace and quiet and if all goes as planned they'll be spending the rest of their days looking at a factory next door and a road running immediately behind their house to get to the factory. There goes the peace and quiet.",
            "Back in high school 2010-2011 my buddies and I would get together on weekends and watch and laugh at shitty movies. One day my buddy brought a movie he rented from a Redbox. It was by far the worst movie we have seen. It was called Hellraisers or Hellrisers. Not to be confused with the popular body horror classic. This was an absolute piece of shit. It was about a monk, a knight of Templar, and a ninja fighting vampire like demons in the desert. We all remember this movie. We remember plot points from it.

Like, I would be carrying my guitar on my shoulder in the hallway, She would say \u201chey anon\u201d I turn around and smack her with the back of the guitar. Another time she snuck up behind me and shouted \u201cboo!\u201d Into my ear and I turned around and hit her with my elbow. One time I was moving the big cymbal from the band room to the assembly hall, it was still locked in its stand and because the cymbal was really front heavy I was carrying it out in front of me, kind of like a spear. I turn the corner, guess who? Decked girl square in the chest with cymbal. Another time I was getting some stuff out of my locker and as I put my head in I see a guy that was always fucking with me approach from behind, when I felt someone graze past my back I snapped around and poked at the attacker with this really leaky red pen I had. But it was just the girl again, caught in the crossfire. I also think that I hit her with a backhand when I was practicing the Nae Nae (i was 12) but that memory is kind of fuzzy.

            "It was the day after my birthday after a break-up two months prior. I had been with my ex for 8 years - we were high school sweethearts, and I considered his family to be mine. Our relationship didn't end well, and we had stopped talking due to some disrespectful behavior I had received post break-up. So, on my birthday that year, no one from his family wished me happy birthday. I was expecting as much, but at the same time was pretty hurt about it. The break-up and its aftermath left me in a pretty vulnerable place.\n\nThe day after my birthday, I was studying at a coffee shop when my mom called. I was venting about being hurt that my ex and his family didn't wish me happy birthday. About a half hour later, a staff member at the coffee shop brought me a piece of cake. The staff member, as she was handing me the cake, said an anonymous person in the coffee shop wished me a happy birthday. I started bawling in the middle of the coffee shop in disbelief that someone could be SO nice. I asked around and asked the staff with no indication of who got me this slice of cake. So I'll never know.\n\nRegardless, it was the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for me, and I'll always remember that kind sentiment for the rest of my life.",

As I continued, I noticed an animal in the road jumping frantically and upon closer inspection, I noticed it was a fox with a crisp packet fully over its head and it couldn\u2019t see anything. Naturally it was pretty distressed. \n\nKnowing it had just escaped certain death from the truck, but would almost definitely be run over by another car, I put my hazards on and jumped out my car, still on the slip road. \n\nI crept up close to the fox but he sensed me and darted away. I ended up chasing him for 5-10 minutes around a major roundabout, all the time both of us dodging fast moving cars. \n\nEventually, he seemed to give up the chase and let me creep towards him, I held the end of the crisp packet and he yanked his face away, before giving me what looked like a grateful eye nod and darting off into the night, leaving me standing there full of adrenaline, with my car now holding up at least 10 other people on the slip road and the door wide open.",

            "When my aunt died, my boyfriend and I flew across the country for the funeral. My brother was there. My brother is a really shy and reserved individual until you get to know him. Once he\u2019s comfortable with someone, he can be loud and obnoxious, but in an endearing way. Anyway, my boyfriend and brother had met once before this, so they were comfortable with one another. We were in town for two days. In those two days, I was entirely a third wheel. My family kept asking me where they were. They were always somewhere in the house or in the RV in front of the house playing games, watching videos, or whatever. They were having a great time. My brother was very comfortable, being loud and laughing so hard we thought he was going to puke. I got several videos of them. They became instant best friends and it made me really happy. My ex husband never said more than ten words to my brother. It was nice to see someone connect with my family.",
            "Once during a port call in Naples, me and a bunch of buddies were walking around lost looking for a place to eat.  A nice older dude is broken English asked us if we needed directions.  We told him we were some lost Americans looking for decent local place for dinner.  He told us to follow him and he took us to a nice small restaurant on a side steets side street.  Food was awesome.  He just sat in a corner sipping an espresso and when we were done the waitress said he paid for the bill.  We left her a wad if lira as it was our last day in port went and  went to thank him.  I always carry Zippos with the command with me when in port, so I gave him a USS ENTERPRISE Zippo.  He was very appreciative in return.  Nicest man I have ever met in Italy.",
            "When I was like 4 or 5 (This was like a decade ago) I was at a neighbour\u2019s party across the street. You know those parties, the parents hang out and put the kids in the basement, backyard or somewhere else and none of you know each other. Any way, we\u2019re in the basement and some of the older kids start playing darts. Me being a little kid, I wanna try because I think it\u2019s cool and I don\u2019t know what it is. Anyway, I\u2019m throwing darts and suddenly hit the center of the dart board (the dart fell after I hit it, I wasn\u2019t strong enough to make it stay). Then everyone starts to cheer and go like \u201coh my god!\u201d \u201cYeah!\u201d and stuff like that. Me being young, I know it\u2019s good because I get 2 high fives from 2 of the older boys and people are saying I did a great job (remember, I don\u2019t know what darts is, i\u2019m 4 or 5) and I felt awesome. As you can probably imagine, the cheering made a racket and could be heard upstairs. My father soon came down to see what was up and everyone was going \u201che [me] hit it right here (pointing to the center of the dart board)\u201d and things like that. I don\u2019t remember much of what happened after my dad showed up, whether he was proud of his son or what. But I was proud, and I still think about that story, 10 or 11 years later. And it still makes me smile.\n\nEdit: wow thanks for so many upvotes!",
            "Back in the early 90s I was stationed at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas.  I have ridden a motorcycle my entire life, and while I was stationed there, this was no exception.  One of my buddies that I used to ride with was with me this one day when this happened.  Trigger warning:  It has a very unhappy ending for a bird and most likely therapy for a girl I had known only a few hours.  It also involves some very unsafe vehicle/motorcycle driving that should never be attempted by anyone.  Period.  I mean it.  Don't drive that fast.  \n\nMy friend Mike's girlfriend wanted to introduce me to her friend who liked motorcycles, and earlier in the day we met at his place and once it started to get later in the evening and cooler we decided that the Apex dry lake would be a great place to go.  Being bullet proof and 22 years old, we liked to ride FAST.  Not necessarily in town, but out on the straights, we'd really twist the throttle (I've since calmed down since then, but back then you couldn't have told us about the dangers, we were 22, horny, had girls, and up to nothing but shenanigans, anyway).  The full face helmet and leather riding jacket added to that feeling of invincibility.  \n\nI barely knew Christy, only by about six hours and I quickly found out that she wasn't the most experienced passenger.  Bikers know what I mean.  She was stiff on the back, not fluid, held too tight or not at all, scared of making turns, almost terrified.  When we got out to that little two-lane stretch of road that goes nowhere, it was still light out.  The road is technically Las Vegas Blvd North, I think...and I mean way north, and it became obsolete when I-15 was put in.  When we turned up that way, we rocked the throttle....and I mean rocked it.  The road was still in good condition while not really maintained, and there was never (arguably) any traffic coming the other way since the road really went to...well, nowhere.  \n\nAfter my bike limited out, I was riding 105mph and this bird crosses the road in front of me.  I barely make it out, it was a white \"L\" shape that you see when you're going that fast.  I don't even have time to think about it when a second bird comes out and I simply bring my chin down lower and I feel a very meaty \"thump\" on the top of my helmet. What ensued seemed like pure chaos. \nI could hear my passenger's screams over the noise of the wind, and fellow cyclists know this is not possible when going that fast.  I had already released the throttle, waiting to reach a speed where I could begin downshifting when my passenger decides to try to GET OFF THE MOTORCYCLE.  I reach back and grab whatever article of clothing I can with my left hand, holding her down, still screaming, yelling at her to sit down, and through the grace of whatever angels were present that day, I managed to get the bike under control and stopped.  \n\nMike pulls up next to me laughing uncontrollably.  His girl is wide-eyed with terror, mine is still screaming, I'm screaming get off the bike, which she does, and promptly falls on her ass.  I put the kick down, and then I see it.  Her face shield (always a full-face helmet, btw, I've never ridden with anything else) was covered in blood and guts.  This bird had hit the top of my head and literally (not metaphorically) EXPLODED right into her face.  I don't mean exploded in a Tom & Jerry kind of way, I mean more like an M-80 in a goose down pillow filled with chicken guts and gravy kind of way.  And it plastered her entire face shield.  In fact, that's kind of how Mike explained it.  He said suddenly there was this big puff of feathers like a pillow had exploded as he flew by it.  \n\nI don't know how I managed to get her back on the bike to get her back home, but I never heard from her again.  Mike and I fell out of touch long ago, and he and his girl broke up.   \n\nBut, I know it's not your real name, but Christy, I'm sorry, and I hope you're doing well.  Sorry about that mental scar.",
            "This is a dumb one but while working in Rite Aid, a customer was paying about half of of their purchase in quarters. The total was less than five and she gave me two $1s and some quarters which combined equals to less than what she owed. I told her that she was short and she told me \u201cNo I gave you five dollars.\u201d I thought that maybe I mistook a half dollar coin as a quarter so I recounted and there was no difference. I told her that she\u2019s short and she bitches to me how she gave more than enough and that I need to give her change. I then told her I had x amount of quarters in my right hand and y amount in my left. She finally understand and gives me enough coins so that I can continue the transaction. Before she gave me more coins, she complains that it\u2019s my fault and that I acted like I\u2019ve never seen quarters before. Like wtf. I counted in front of her twice and told her that she was short each time. She\u2019s throwing a hissy fit that an employee is making sure that the customer gave the right amount of money.",

            "This one is a bit odd, and kinda gross? This is how I learned a new medical term, scarred my family, and started a long health journey. \n\nSo while I was in college I went a week without eating, or going to the bathroom. My schedule, overload of credits and two jobs, I honest to God didn't notice. \n\nI was stopped in my tracks by a phonecall from my dad. With a shakey voice he said, \"Great Grandma [my last name] passed away this morning. She was dropped while being loaded into the ambulance and her heart stopped. She's gone.\" \n\nMy great grandmother was an amazing person, I should have told the story about her and the spirits, maybe another time. She was fascinating and had a mind like a steel trap. Miss her. \n\nSo that weekend I go home for the funeral. At the wake my mom asks when the last time I ate was. I didn't remember. She made me eat a sandwich. It felt like torture and I didn't know why. \n\nA short while later I began sweating profusely and and got very weak. I said I didn't feel well and my brother took me to my parents house. I immediately fell asleep in my bed. \n\nAt about 2am, I shoot straight up in bed. We all know that feeling, the \"I needed to throw up 30 seconds ago and have 3 seconds to make a 25 foot dash to the bathroom. I couldn't hold it back, as I entered the smallish basement bathroom (my two siblings bedrooms are right next to bathroom), I threw up hard into my mouth, but something was....wrong. \n\nI tasted, iron? And some liquid went between my fingers (yes this is gross but there's a point). My eyes still blurry from just waking up I begin vomiting the most painful vomiting imaginable. I'm practically screaming. My eyes start to focus on my hand, which is trying desperately to grasp the edge of the toilet.\n\nIs that...is that, blood?? I begin to look around and the is blood, everywhere. My sister, hearing this had run to get my parents without looking into the bathroom. When my mom opened the door she immediately say blood all over the white linoleum floor leading to me. Me slumped over with my head partially into the toilet no longer moving. Blood all over the toilet and spattered on the wall. \n\nI suddenly started gasping and coughing, I had blacked out. I began throwing up again and turned to my mom, and she was horrified. I was whiter than printer paper and had blood all over me, running out of my nose and mouth. \"Help me...please,\" I gasped weakly pleading, \"Am I going to die?\" \n\nThen I blacked put again. I woke up to my mom and sister sobbing as my dad was cleaning me up with a blood soaked white towel. The towel was dripping red. My eyes were blurry and I said, \"hospital.\" \n\nWe get to the ER and Inwas finished with throwing up. I couldn't walk I was so weak. The doctor was beyond perplexed. They did scans, tests, but they couldn't get any blood from me for hours, they'd hit a vein but couldn't get enough. It sucked. \n\nThe doctor finally said, \"mesenteric lymphadenitis. Your lymphodes did their job in gathering all the bad stuff, but stopped doing there job in discharging it. As for the vomiting blood, honestly I'm at a lloss. Had 4 people not witnessed it, and brought I a cellphone picture, I wouldn't have believed it. But your tests are indicative of a lot of blood loss.\"\n\nNever did find out why the blood, although years later in the ER, again, I did have a slow bleed in my intestinal area. Also unexplained. On a more sad note, I missed the funeral.",
            "I was a server at this beach restaurant/bar for a few years, and it\u2019s always busy during winter because that\u2019s when snowbirds fly down to Florida. \n\nOn one really busy night (and way too crowded; management tried to work in as much seating as possible), I\u2019m trying to make my way to a 15 top with their drinks; I tell this woman next to me \u201cexcuse me, I have a lot of drinks and I need to get over there please, excuse me\u201d about 5x. She keeps talking and ignores me. I shimmy my way between her chair and the pillar behind her. I almost made it through, until she talked with her hands a bit too expressively and pulled the tray of drinks down on top of her... extremely embarrassing. (Edit: sounds ridiculous, but I\u2019m 5\u201d1. I\u2019m pretty low to the ground lol.)\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s a horrific scene- a couple of rich and snooty folks (wearing full suits and formal dresses to a causal beach bar- you can be barefoot in there... lol) are screaming and threatening to call the cops on me and sue. They also started hurling racist insults to our Puerto Rican busser. One example: my busser was speaking perfect English to them trying to deescalate the situation, and the husband yells, \u201cDo you even understand me? Manager! ENG-LISH. MAN-A-GER\u201d. \n\nI feel like the universe used me for their karma that night. Racists deserve to get beer and water poured on them all fucking day. Honored to serve!",
            "The time I, as a 25-year-old, called the police to check for boogeymen under my bed and they found all my bondage stuff.\n\nIt was a Friday night. I was cleaning the upstairs bathroom of the house (yes, on a Friday night, I like to start the weekend clean, don't judge me) and the dog (Dog) was chilling out on the landing to the stairs right outside the bathroom. To understand this story, you must know about Dog: worst. guard dog. ever. To illustrate: One time I was at the store and had left the house's attic fan running, but it started to rain. I asked a neighbor who had the key to run over and turn the attic fan off so that the attic didn't get soaked. Once the neighbor entered the front door, instead of \"protec the house,\" Dog ran into the basement in fear, passing our neighbor on the stairs on his way down.\n\nBack to Friday night: I'm cleaning, and suddenly I hear Dog start to growl and bark. Another thing about Dog: he almost never barked, and when he did, it was always more of a cry because he was upset about something. This was a bark-bark, growl-growl. I turn off the bathroom fan and go stand next to him to try to figure this out. I hear the door to the garage closing. I go down to investigate (I know, I was auditioning for a part in a serial killer movie) and don't see anything super amiss, except I left the patio door unlocked. Dog had followed me downstairs, and keeps doing bark-bark, growl-growl, so I grab my keys and phone and take him out to my car which is parked on the street. Once inside the car, I called the non-emergency police number to have them maybe come by? Or decide if they should?\n\nWell, the non-emergency person told me to call 911. Which resulted in the immediate response of Suburb's Finest, ready to rock. Of course, they found nothing; they thought probably the wind had made the door I heard close, or rattle in its frame. I say they found nothing, but at the time, I had a full set of bondage straps and other toys set-up under the bed that could be pulled out at a moment's notice.\n\nAs they were leaving, the one cop said over his shoulder, \"We even checked under the bed. You're safe. I'm not so sure about your dates, though.\" *Facepalm*.",
            "A voice saved my life: In 1987 I was driving, by myself, north on 101 in Calif around 2AM in the middle of no where near King City. (When I was in college. My entire family had been in a roll over car accident and was in the hospital in the bay area. I was trying to get there to be with them.) I decided to drive in the fast lane so I would wake up if I dozed off and hit the \"bumper lights\" that stick up on either side of that lane. As I was driving had a bad feeling my life was in danger. Out of the blue a voice, coming from the passenger side of the car, clearly said \"Move over to the other lane.\" I was so startled I said out loud \"What?!?\" It repeated itself even louder: \" MOVE OVER TO THE OTHER LANE!\" So...I didn't think I just changed lanes.\n\nAs SOON as I completed my lane change a car, going SOUTH (Wrong direction) at least 100MPH, came over the rising hill in front of me and ZIP went past me and into the darkness behind me. This was before cell phones. I pulled over at the next exit and found a pay phone to call the highway patrol. They said they had heard of this drunk driver and had been trying to locate him for a while. I sat in my car a good 15 minuets to finally stop shaking and continue on. Will never forget that experience as long as I live.",
            "Ok so maybe I\u2019ve told this before I don\u2019t know but I fucking love my dog and she saved my life so she deserves the attention \n\nWhen I was preggers with my first baby, I was swelling up like a balloon. The hospital kept testing me for preeclampsia and sending me home because my blood pressure was high but not high enough (don\u2019t even get me started). Anyway, from my third trimester my dog (retriever x) started acting wierd af like watching me constantly, following me everywhere and wouldn\u2019t let me bring her for walks, she would just sit there on the grass and nudge my legs with her nose until I went back home. But if my husband brought her out she run around having fun as normal. \n\nAnyway as I got towards my due date, she also started licking and sniffing my legs a lot and a few nights I was awoken by her breath because she was legit in my face watching me sleep. I thought maybe she was just anxious about the baby coming or how cumbersome I waa getting but after the third night where she didn\u2019t sleep a wink from watching me I rang the hospital and basically told the the midwife what my dog was doing and that I knew that was a wierd reason to call but before I even finished my sentence she asked me to come in immediately. \n\nThey did some more detailed tests on me and turns out not only did I have preeclampsia pretty bad I also had placenta accreta and my baby wasn\u2019t getting adequate support from the placenta anymore. They induced me that night and thankfully my baby girl was born 3 weeks early but perfectly healthy. \n\nI have since had 2 more perfectly fine pregnancies and my precious pup has been with me every step of the way. I literally trust her more than the doctors in some ways lol. She saved my and my daughter\u2019s life and I will be forever repaying her that debt, mainly in snuggles",

            "There was a little magical place me and all my classmates would go. Behind all the houses on a certain street, there was a grassy area concealed by trees that was high on two sides but low in the middle, so it formed a river when it rained. Me and my brother and all my friends would go there and walk up and down this little area, it went for a couple blocks. When it rained, we raced paper boats in the \"river\". It was the only place our parents couldnt find us if they looked, so we all pretended it was our own little kingdom which belonged to us. Some days it was a fairy tale forest and we would play knights and princesses some days it was a nerd gun war zone, some days it was a functioning city with businesses and busy streets. Almost everyone I knew at school hung out there. At night, when all the little kids went home, teenagers went there to smoke and have sex. During the summer the \"river\" was filled with mosquito larvae and there were ticks in the grass, but it was all ours. We had little wars that took place there. \n\nThere were a fair share of interesting things that happened there. Once, there was a beehive on one far end of it, so we all avoided it and played on the opposite end. One kid decided to be brave and whack it with a baseball bat. He went to the hospital, this happened when we were at school. There was a rumour spread by some kid that pirates treasure was buried there, so a few of us dug around looking for it. One time we watched a cat give birth there, half the babies didn't survive because some idiot decided to use them like golf balls. Another rumour was spread that an adult teacher regularly held orgies with teen girls in his class there, but it probably wasn't true. \n\nIt was everything to us, until I moved away. I kept in contact with some people from there, and one told me it was later cleared to build something. I cried when I heard that. That little place meant everything to me.",
            "\nAfter getting out of the marines eight years ago I was severely depressed and suicidal. I had been for over a decade since around thirteen years old. It was the summer of 2013 and I had figured I wouldn't make it to next year. A friend bought me and another buddy tickets to see Phish at an outdoor amphitheater. Never was into Phish. \n\nWe tailgated in the parking lot and I was drinking steadily to offset my all too familiar social anxiety and negative thought habits. The show was starting in an hour and a woman from Colorado came up to our tent pitching bud. Some folks bought and I got this idea seemingly out of nowhere to ask if she had any shrooms to sell. Turns out she did. A dude who I'd met that day, and am still friends with now, kindly bought each of us an eighth.\n\nI ate the thing in one go which I now consider an amateur move due to the volatility of the come up but thankfully it didn't go that way. As we were walking toward security I began to feel and notice some stuff I hadn't experieneced in ages. Something so foreign to me it kept taking my breath away. It was wonder. Straight, childlike, unencumbered wonder.\n\nAs we approached the skies began to darken and an enormous, I mean *enormous*, rain storm blew in. I felt the sting of the tiny drops and the weight of the heavy drops as the world around me exploded into technicolor ecstasy in spite of the darkening skies. I was inside of *the* moment. The moment that monks, and new age officianados chase after for years by way of meditation hoping to grasp a shadow of what I was now completely immersed within. I was swimming inside life for the first time in what felt like my entire existence.\n\nWe got to our seats on the mezzanine and the show was cranking. Ocelot, now one of my favorite jams, was blasting through the torrential downpour with Phishs' always unmatched light work causing the entire scene to undulate in this orgasm of existence where the universe just took notice of itself because it had no choice. I danced sincerely for the first time in my life. I outstretched my arms to the skies as the universe poured down upon my body and in that instant(those instants, I suppose) I became so incredibly self aware and also so incredibly devoid of ego. Matter, sound, light, all energy, everything became the same thing expressing itself in it's own unique way. I was the 13.7 billion year old cosmos. Everybody was. We were alive. We were together. In this chilly tempest dancing to express our love for self, our love for each other, and it was the most earth shattering concept that ever dared to enter my mind. I was crying tears of joy.\n\nI came down a bit after getting home to my buddy's house that night and slept in a manner I hadn't known in ages. It was peaceful. It was devoid of worry. It had no tension to it.\n\nI awoke the next morning a person I could scarcely recognize and it was this person that saved a life. I had no more urges to end it. I had no more worry about needing weekly therapy, or wondering if I should go back on antidepressants. I'd found something I never knew I would, happiness and contentment.\n\nPsilocybin saved my life. It still does to this day whenever I find myself needing a voyage to the other side of existence. It is so incredible and I am forever grateful toward it for it giving myself back to me.",

            "One night on my way home after work on an especially freezing night, I stopped for gas and was approached by a homeless man, called himself Miami. I typically hand over spare money to homeless people, and try to make a little small talk even if I don't have cash on me, I think it's important to treat people like people. I won't go into too much detail, but after forking over a few dollars I ended up driving this fellow all around town. He smoked crack in my car, he tried to entice me with promises of women in some cheap hotel, he asked me to give some *other* homeless person a ride, and on and on it went until like 4 or 5 am, when he went into a hotel room. I took his plastic bags out of my car and neatly put them to the side, and left before he came back out, in my defense he was in there for over half an hour before I left. The entire encounter was pretty unpleasant from beginning to end but for some reason I remember it fondly. \n\nI know he thinks he was taking advantage of me, and I shudder when I imagine the girls he wanted me to meet. But it was cold, he had absolutely nothing, and I helped alleviate that at least for one night. I don't talk about it because I don't want people to think I'm trying to brag or anything like that, but it did happen and I often catch myself wondering how Miami the crack smoking homeless man is faring out on these streets.",

            "I have posted this before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout seven years ago I was in a city a few hours away from my home with a group of friends for a concert. We were staying at a mid range hotel, our rooms all lined up next to each other. A bunch of middle class white kids in our mid twenties with very few responsibilities, good jobs, plenty of time on our hands, out free in a world that had, for the most part, treated us pretty well.\n\nWhen we checked in and rode the elevator up to our room in a group, we were chattering and laughing. Our basic state of being was a continual banter, and we thought we were hilarious. We got off of the elevator and found our rooms, and we hardly noticed when someone cracked a door on the other side of the hallway to look out at us.\n\nAn hour later, we were back in the hall. We'd showered the road off of us and gotten dressed, discussing dinner plans. The door across the hall opened again. A black man in his... fifties? sixties? stepped out. His clothes were clean but worn. His hands shook a little. When he spoke, he had a slight slur in his voice. He introduced himself as Matthew. I shook his hand and gave him my name. I'll admit, we were a bit aloof. This man was intruding himself on our evening. His presence changed the tone of the entire moment. It was impossible to keep on cracking the jokes, making the snappy replies, when he was there.\n\nHe asked what our plans were, and we answered simply. We told him about the concert that night. He said maybe he'd come to it, too, and we told him - truthfully - that it had sold out hours after the tickets went on sale months ago. He went back into his room and shut the door, and we stood there awkwardly before we started down the hallway for the elevator.\n\nWe hadn't gotten more than a few feet before the door opened again and he was looking at us, offering most of a grocery store rotisserie chicken. \"Just in case you're hungry.\"\n\n\"No thanks, we're heading to dinner,\" I said.\n\nHe was silent a moment. \"You all must be thinking, 'What's this crazy nigger's problem? Why won't he leave us alone?\"\n\nI stopped. I had been turning back away. \"I'd never think that. I don't...That's not a word I use.\"\n\n\"Sure, you don't know me. Who am I? You don't know. You got your own things going on.\"\n\nI didn't speak. It was true. I didn't know him. My friends were silent behind me.\n\n\"I've been in this hotel three months now. Ain't nobody will give me the time of day.\" The plastic packaging of the chicken was dripping condensation on the lurid carpet of the hallway.\n\nI took a step towards him. My (at the time) girlfriend did, too. He said, \"Been here three months. Government pays my stay and all, but it's lonely. Look-\" He disappeared into his room and came back, a letter folded piece of paper in his hand. I took it. It was a declaration of permanent and total disability for Corporal Matthew Adams, with a disability benefit of $3000 per month. He was a vet. Vietnam. I looked into his room. It was a little disheveled, with drawers open and groceries sticking out of them. Boxes of crackers, cookies. Food that didn't need preparation for a long hotel stay.\n\nI could feel the discomfort of my friends behind me. They were still and soundless. \"You guys go ahead,\" I said. \"I'll catch up.\"\n\n'I'll stay, too,\" said my girlfriend. Her hand found mine.\n\nI'm not sure how long we spent in his room talking. He was in the hotel while they arranged a new place for him. He got moved around a lot, he said. It had been three months. He had everything he needed, he was just lonely.\n\n\"What about veterans groups?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, all of them. I'm in all of them. Doesn't mean much. Doesn't make you less alone.\"\n\nMy girlfriend was silently crying. Matthew started to cry, too.\n\n\"They took me and made me a stone killer and left me all alone. All alone in a hotel room with nobody.\"\n\nI gave him a long hug. He shook in my arms. He was very thin. I could feel his tears through the fabric of my shirt.\n\nAfter a long time he let go of me. \"Thank you.\" He took a deep breath. \"Thank you.\" He sat on the bed. He looked tired.\n\n\"We need to get going, but I want to stay in touch,\" I said. I looked at my girlfriend. She nodded emphatically. \"Let me write down my number and our address.\"\n\n\"You don't need me bothering you.\"\n\n\"Please. If you need to talk you can call.\"\n\nHe let me write them down for him. I wonder if he still has them.\n\nIn the elevator down I hugged my girlfriend and she cried. I did, too. I thought of Matthew in his room above us, laying in bed. In my mind his eyes were open and he was staring at the ceiling.\n\nIn the lobby our friends had waited for us. They looked a little relieved to see us.\n\nI think about him a lot. His name wasn't Matthew Adams, of course. I didn't want to use his real name. I'll never forget it. He's never called. I still have the same number. Occasionally I try to find him, but I really don't know where to start.\n\nI don't blame my friends for opting out of that situation. They simply weren't equipped for it. Neither was I, I suppose.\n\nThe girlfriend is now my wife.\n\nThis will be pretty far down this thread, so I guess I don't know if anyone will find it. If you do, consider donating to a veteran's group or volunteering somewhere.\n\nHe never tried to reach out to me.\n\nI wish he would.",
            "One evening my husband and I were eating a Mexican restaurant that happened to be next to a hotel we could see out the window.\n\nWe see a person all dressed up in an elaborate costume, which was strange because it was not anywhere near Halloween. Then we see another one, and another one, until there were nearly 50.\n\nIt was a furry convention! We thought this to be an awesome thing to stumble upon and knew we had to go check it out.\n\nWe get inside and they were really nice people who let us take pictures with them and stuff. It was a wonderful experience.",
            "I'm amused by a newspaper article that I read a while ago, about a man who went to his local convenience store and bought two lottery tickets.\n\nMost people in that situation would play different numbers on each ticket, in order to double their (minuscule) chances of winning.\n\nNot this guy. He played the same numbers on both tickets.\n\nIt turned out that he won, and he owned two of the three winning tickets for that drawing.  His same-number decision, while it looked \"misguided\" on the surface, actually let him walk home with two thirds of that jackpot instead of only half.",
            "I backpacked in Australia for a year from 2011-2012. I was in Sydney at a small park near my hostel drinking goon (bag of wine) and smoking spliffs with about 4-5 other guys. I was baked out of my mind and had the spliff in my hand and another 1/4oz in my pocket when I heard my french friend say quietly \"police, police, police\". \n\nI looked down the path and saw three police officers coming toward us and thought I was fucked for sure. The cops started questioning us and were doing the goodcop/badcop thing. Bad cop is threatening to take us all to jail and saying he could smell the weed a block away. Good cops are trying to get us to consent to a search.\n\nEventually the cops get sick of it and say they are going to search us anyway since our eyes are redder than the devil's dick and we obviously smell like weed. I'm freaking out about the weed in my pocket and when it is my turn to get searched the cop asks me to empty my pockets and put everything on the bench next to us\n\nNow, in my stoned mind I knew there was a way out of this. Some combination of words I could say or some kind of action I could take that would get me off scott free, I just had to think of exactly what to do to get away with it. That's when my favorite magicians popped into my head, Penn and Teller. I've never been good at magic, like whatsoever, but I remembered them talking about palming playing cards to hide them, and figured why the fuck not.\n\nSo the cop says \"is everything out of your pockets?\" And at the last second I grab the bag of weed and \"palm\" it (not very well either). He pats me down and says I'm good. I was in complete amazement as the bad cop yells at us and says he knows one of us has weed and we are lucky we didn't end up in jail\n\nOnce we are told we can go I remembered that I had the spliff underneath my shoe on the ground, so I told my friends we need to gtfo. We hastily walked away as the cops searched the ground/bushes.\n\nTurns out they came back to our hostel later than night looking for me after they found the spliff, but lucky for me I wasn't there.\n\nTldr: didn't end up on an episode of locked up abroad",
            "It was my proudest moment of my teenage self. When I was fourteen we had moved across the country (USA), so pretty far. When October came around I decided to volunteer in a haunted house for something to do. During one of the nights this drunk guy (early 20's) came in and decided he wanted to be in it too. Anyone was allowed so they gave him a spot. About halfway through the night the little girl he was put with came up to me and said he kept touching her leg and wouldn't stop. I told her I would switch with her. So I am in a room with a drunk guy and when the lights go off again he started poking my thigh. I warned him to stop touching me. Of course he didnt take it seriously and kept touching my leg. I used my arm to slam his into the wooden wall behind us and told him loudly to stop touching me! The creep finally got the message and sneaked away asap after that. I am so happy for my young shy shelf for standing up for that little girl because who knows what could have happened.",
            "One night when my wife was pregnant with our first kid, we were just getting into bed. I shut off the lamp and went to kiss her goodnight, so I reach my hand out to find her face and end up poking her in the eye. She starts laughing so hard that she farts, which makes us laugh even harder. She ends up laughing so hard that she starts crying, which because of the pregnancy transitions to actual sobbing/laughing. This persists until she is coughing and gagging. She runs into the bathroom and kneels over the toilet retching while still sobbing/laughing, and as she is puking she pisses herself.",
            "I\u2019ve always had incredibly realistic dreams, dreams so vivid that I\u2019d swear they were real. When I was a kid, my mom would frequently find me crying in the morning because the goldfish rock band that lived in my closet had left, or because she\u2019d promised me a pet dragon and hadn\u2019t delivered. Obviously that was all in my head, but I was utterly convinced that they were real. As I got older, I only had dreams that vivid once every few months or so, and it would take me a couple of minutes to find my bearings in the morning. But by then I knew they were just dreams, no matter how real they seemed. Except...\n\nMy first boyfriend in college was a really sweet guy\u2014very romantic, pretty sexy, and one of the smartest guys I knew. We\u2019ll call him Sam, but that\u2019s not his real name. We dated and lived together for about a year, but every now and then I\u2019d have a disquieting recurring dream. I\u2019d dream that he\u2019d wake me up in the middle of the night by grabbing my throat and pinning me to the bed with incredible strength. He\u2019d whisper in my ear that he was actually a highly advanced, immortal android and that if he wanted he could break every bone in my body without breaking a sweat. That he was made of solid metal, and there was nothing I could do to hurt him or stop him.\n\nIt was all so strange because he was such a nice guy, and I never thought he\u2019d so much as think about hurting me. I had no idea where these super disturbing dreams were coming from, but I always felt uneasy the day after I\u2019d had them. \n\nThat summer, a bunch of our friends got together to watch a particularly beautiful meteor shower that was slated to peak at about 2am. Most people gathered on one of the campus lawns, but Sam knew about an old, abandoned water treatment plant hidden in the nearby forest that apparently had a great view of the night sky. Nobody else was particularly keen on traipsing into the forest in the middle of the night, so it was just Sam and I. \n\nDespite my initial skepticism, that abandoned plant was an amazing place to watch the meteor shower\u2014the forest was so dark and the sky so clear we could see the Milky Way. We had to climb up on top of the building to get a good view though, and there were a bunch of rusted signs warning that the water tank beneath us was 100 feet down and any falls could be fatal. I was a little worried, but Sam laid down the blanket he\u2019d brought for us and pulled me down next to him to reassure me.\n\nThen he leaned in and whispered in my ear, like it was a secret we were both in on: \n\n\u201cI guess if the ceiling falls in we\u2019ll get to see if I can actually die.\u201d \n\nMy guts went ice-cold in an instant. It all came crashing in on me at once\u2014I suddenly realized that those times he had pinned me and threatened me, the memories I\u2019d thought were dreams, were actually 100% real. It\u2019s a good thing we were already lying down to watch the meteor shower, because I swear I actually passed out for a second. Then the reality of my situation hit me, and I realized I had to act like nothing was wrong until we got out of the woods\u2014where, I started to think, nobody would ever find my body if I were to disappear. \n\nThank god nothing else weird happened that night, but first thing the next day I broke up with him. I said I just wasn\u2019t feeling it anymore because I was terrified of confronting him. We\u2019d been a pretty popular couple so I got a lot of flak from my friends for breaking up with him so suddenly, but I just couldn\u2019t find the words to explain to everyone that Sam actually believed he was an immortal robot and was threatening to kill me at night. I wasn\u2019t sure if anyone would believe me\u2014honestly, to this day I almost wonder if it was actually all a dream. But then I remember that night in the forest, and I know in my gut that it wasn\u2019t.",
            "I was once chased by a group of Serbian dudes, in a car when visiting my Dad in Kosovo, Serbia, absolutely steaming drunk. I ended up falling flat on my face in someone's back garden (it was a pitch black evening) and burst open my nose and brow. When accepting that I had been caught, I turned round to what I thought would be 4 guys who were going to kill me, but turns out the resident of the garden I was in had scared them off. However, not knowing who the random Scottish guy was, I was held at Shotgun point (he was in the right to shoot me there and then for trespassing).\n\nHe didn't shoot me though, he sat me down on his porch, whilst pointing the shotgun at me (a totally old school double barrel bad boy), and had a full on argument with what I could only assume was his brother.\n\nLong story short, I managed to mention my dad's wife's name (she's from there) and they called me an ambulance. They knew her, and very well too. Totally dodged a bullet. Literally.\n\nStory ends with me, starting to become sober/hungover, sitting on a hospital bed, having stitches put in, from a smoking doctor. Yes, he was smoking a cigarette whilst putting in my stitches.\n\nI used to have a photo of my bashed face and x-ray, but alas, they have been lost in transportation.\n\nAnyway, hope that meets the requirements, it's better told over a pint :)",
            "I drive for Fedex. My routes typically run in very VERY rural areas. One lane roads everywhere, delivering to what looks like abandoned houses that have fire damage, and too many weird people to even count. One guy even casually carrying a medieval style sword around his yard. Anyway, this is Ohio and there are deer everywhere. As a loving goodbye before you leave your parents house they say \"see you soon, watch for deer.\"\n\nSo I'm driving my rural route on a one lane road in winter, two empty farm fields on either side of me. I see two deer in the right field, startled by my large blundering van, running in a panic along side me and angling towards the road. If I keep up my speed and they continue their projected path, I will hit one or both of them. No big deal, it wasn't like a slam on your brakes situation like it is most of the time. I had ages to avoid them. So I slow my van to about 15 miles an hour, and the deer cut harder. I'm almost completely stopped in the road now. One leaps the fence on the right and bounds gracefully into the road right in front of me followed by the second. The first deer leaps over the old wire fence into the left field, the second deer follows... Or tries to. \n\nThese graceful majestic beasts make mistakes too.\n\nIt all happened in what seemed like slow motion. Second deer jumped too early, or slipped. I'm not sure. But it slams chest first into the top of the wire fence. Fur EXPLODES in every direction. I felt like I was watching expertly worked ragdoll physics as this deer tumbled through the air with limbs splayed. It slams face first into the cold ground and probably sharp old broken corn stalks. Then it just jumps up and runs off into the woods on the other side of the field like nothing happened.\n\nThere is dashcam footage of me floating in some database somewhere, with my fist at my mouth saying \"OOOHHH SHIIIIT, DEER! ARE YOU FUCKING OK?!\" I bet that deer is STILL sore.",

Apparently the bill happened to come out to exactly $66.06.\n\n\nShe seemed genuinely freaked out a little insisting it happened naturally (which is what I choose to believe) and offered to add a penny for the bad juju or whatever, but that was too cool to alter (also bro, offer to deduct not add). Drove home extra carefully lol. \n\n\nI still have a photocopy of the receipt lying around of my $66.06 bill on 6/6/06.",

            "I\u2019ve shared this before, so I\u2019m just gonna Copy and Paste from the old askreddit thread. \n\nMy junior year of high school, I was taking a class called \"Sci-fi and Fantasy\". Predictably we read books of said genre. We did readers theater (each person in the class gets assigned a character on a voluntary basis, anytime the character says something, the assigned person would say it aloud, the teacher was the narrator, and roleplay was involved if you choose to) on a couple books, one being \"The Hobbit\" by JRR Tolkien. So in this chapter of the book, my character, Thorin, had maybe one or two lines so I was bored. This was the chapter where the eagles swoop down and save the day from the orcs. As the group was saying goodbye (I forget how the book actually goes in this part to the specifics, please forgive me) to the eagles, my teacher stops and asks the group, \"anyone wanna like to do the eagle part?\" Gazes around the entire class and does a double take at me (I'm a fairly outgoing person, especially in that class with roleplaying) so I'm like \"f*ck it. Why not right??\" And out of the silence, with ZERO warning to anyone, I just scream a high pitched \"CCCAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW!\" And did the best eagle screech I could do (It was pretty spectacular, especially for being very much on a whim). Everyone stops and looks at each other. Now its DEAD silent. I wish I could convey the level of silence that was in this room. Nobody knows what to do, or how to react. So my teacher, pipes up after 5 seconds of pure silence \"ok.. does anyone wanna do the actual eagle part?\" Apparently they had actual lines where they say things.",

I excused myself to go to the bathroom and sat there trying to calm myself down because I was suddenly incredibly high. For a bit I sat on the toilet, lid down, swaying from side to side, because I thought I could hear water inside my head. I thought \"I'm going to be like this forever, how am I going to explain this to my parents?\"\n\nI used to go to a stage school when I was about 8, so in that moment I remember where they taught us how to stop feeling dizzy in dance class, so there I am, stood in a stall jumping up and down on the spot with my hands in front of my eyes.\n\nI thought I was okay, even though I really wasn't because it didn't work, so I went back to my friends, sit down and one says \"...are you okay, AdderWibble?\" I'm like \"yeah??\" And he says \"well it's just you were in the bathroom for twenty minutes?\"\n\nGenuinely thought I'd been in there for about five.",
            "When I was young (I must have been 6) I had a dream of a paper card you put on doors in a hotel to say you might sleep in/ don't want room service, I still remember the \"hook\" that you'd put on the door handler. Already, this is strange since it was just this object floating around and there was no action in this dream. On the card was drawn a penguin in a corner made by two orange walls, he was looking sad at the viewer and it was written \"In summer, the penguin is in his corner\" (Note that I'm french so it acfually was \"En \u00e9t\u00e9, le pingouin est dans son coin\")\n\nThe next day, we were learning how to write in class and the teacher starts her phrase by \"In summer\" and I yell back \"the penguin is in his corner\". I was a very quiet kid and well behaved in class so even I felt strange about doing this. The teacher turned confused and angrily asked \"Who said that?\", I admitted but was scared of possibly getting scolded because I yelled back. But the teacher turned around and wrote the full phrase as is.\n\nI didn't think back that much about this event, except the embarassment of getting caught yelling back. Fast forward about 6-8 years maybe, my family situation changed and my stepfather is my then PE teacher from elementary school. This event came up in one of our discussion and he clearly remembers that my teacher was scared one day and told him about this exact event \"I was really scared because I just thought of this phrase on the spot, I never wrote it or anything\".\n\nThis is the closest I've been to something \"paranormal\" and as you can see if you read this wall of text this might not be really interesting. It never happens again that I know of and it's just a story I sometimes tell people. I am not a believer into things \"paranormal\" and always thinks that an explanation is there but I am also a researcher in probability and I am surprised that such a large deviation event actually has occured since, to me, it can only be a coincidence.",

And they absolutely were MANDATORY. Kids included. I remember the adults being afraid to break the rules.\n\nOne time all the kids were forced to participate in a play that all the adults had to watch. It was basically a recreation of the TV show, Gilligan's Island and the entire plot was that when Gilligan and company crashed on the island their was salvation waiting. Their was a Salvation Army there, hidden in the jungle. My part in the play was to be a \"head hunter\" which was what they called the natives on the island. I wore a mop on my head, had to run like a monkey while hollering \"ooga booga\" and lead the shipwrecked crew to their \"Salvation\" aka the secret Salvation Army that was somehow on the island.",

            "Edit: Just a quick preface: the guinea pigs were adopted a couple years apart from each other. The oldest, Peaches, deliberately. The youngest, I can't remember the name, due to a classmate of my brothers not raising theirs right.\n\nMy youngest brother had 2 guinea pigs that he ended up not taking very good care of, leaving my parents to do it instead. She offered for my wife and I to take the older of the two, named Peaches, because she was calmer and did very well with my son, 3 years old, at the time. We followed the same routine as my parents did, fresh vegetables every day, frequent handling and cuddle time, bathing/swimming for exercise.\n\nI was giving Peaches a bath but this time she went under the running faucet and didn't come back up. I grabbed her quickly and turned her upside down in my palm, pumping her chest with two fingers, breathing in her nose. I had no idea the breath to pump ratio but I tried to follow close to a babies. \n\nDown the hall, my wife yells at me that her water broke for our daughter while I'm also yelling for her to look up how to give a Guinea Pig CPR and trying to use my feet to gently push the door closed on my son so he doesn't see his first dead pet at 3 years old.\n\nEdit: I managed to get Peaches to come back successfully and wrapped her in a towel to be placed back in her home while I took my wife to the hospital.\n\nOnce my wife was squared away in the hospital, she wasn't anywhere near ready for delivery. My son was with my parents and I was on my way back home to pack an overnight bag.\n\nPeaches was still in the towel where I left her. She had stopped shivering but her hair was matted and covered in the wood chips we used for her bedding. I used the towel to dry her off and loved on her for a while, before giving her a very quick bath in the sink with very slow running water; never did a bath again.\n\nMy daughter was an emergency c-section nearing 24 hours of labor. I almost thought we lost her when she was blue and wouldn't breath for a good minute or two. Luckily, my wife couldn't see so I was able to tell her everything was fine.\n\nWe went home, eventually introducing Peaches to our newest family member and got to enjoy Peaches company for another eight months before she passed in her sleep. My parents put her in a Tupperware container, sealed it tight so it wouldn't be dug up and buried her on their acreage.",
            "Heart radio hosted a competition entitled \"Who's on heart\" in 2016 where three celebrities will say one of the three words and the public can phone in and guess who said what for a cash prize. The prizes for the guesses are \u00a310,000 for one, \u00a320,000 for two, and \u00a3100,000 for three.\n\nTwo of the guesses had been said. Emma Stone was guessed as a right answer, however the second one in my opinion is unbelievable to how they accepted it. A caller named Sophie Bowen rang in and guessed that Mark Zuckerberg was one of the three, which in fact was a correct answer according to the radio station. However, if you listen to the \"Heart\" you can clearly recognize that it is Jesse Eisenberg, who **she said she was going to say, but she saw his name on the list of incorrect guesses**. Having met Jesse Eisenberg in person (once at MCM Comic Con and once in public) and seen many films he has starred in, I can confidently say that it his definitely him saying the word, and that the \u00a320,000 winner was incorrect. I have also seen many different interviews and speeches given out by Mark Zuckerberg, and the two have very distinct accent's and voices. My guess is that heart radio stupidly confused him with the Facebook founder he portrayed in *The Social Network (2010)*. Thousands of people have inevitably rang into this competition, costing them 50p for each phone call and giving a correct answer yet they haven't had a chance to win the cash prize. Here's the link for the audio to hear for yourselves.\n\n[https://vocaroo.com/1fPiLgcyUG1l](https://vocaroo.com/1fPiLgcyUG1l)\n\nTL:DR, Heart Radio are fucking moron's and confused Jesse Eisenberg with Mark Zuckerberg, causing thousands of votes with correct answers to be discarded as well as charging people 50p for each phone call, and the \"\u00a320,000 prize was wrongly given out.

            "So this happened the last weekend of college for me. My roommates and I wanted to go out to the bars one last time before we went off to the real world. My roommates girlfriend dropped us off at the bar and we begin drinking heavily. Throughout the years of living together we had a couch that we all hated with a passion. It sucked and was really uncomfortable. We only got it because it was cheap and we needed a couch. Being the last weekend we would need the couch and being very drunk, we decided to go home and destroy the couch. \n\nNow I was a history major as was another one of my roommates. We specifically had interests in the Vikings so naturally we had about 5 swords,spears, and axes that looked like they were from that time period. We got back to the apartment and proceeded to tear the couch up with these weapons which was great fun. After that everyone is getting ready for bed. On roommate is brushing his teeth and the other is in bed with his girlfriend about to have some sexy time. I decide I wasn\u2019t as to stab the couch one last time. I assume that I was holding the sword by the hilt with my right hand and the blade with my left. I stab the couch and a cloud of blood shoots up. My left hand is a ruined mess. I get my roommate without a girlfriend and he tries to tourniquet my arm with some tshirts. Does not work. We realize we need to go to the hospital and only my other roommates gf is sober. We knock on the door interrupting their sexy time. They wrap my arm in a towel and we are off!  I am laughing the whole time. \n\nGet to the hospital and I have bled through everything. The nurses see my condition and rush me back. This older friendly looking grandma nurse asks how this happened. \u201cI\u2019m drunk and I stab a couch with a sword\u201d to which she replied \u201cstupid ass boys stabbing shit with swords.\u201d  This made me cry laughing. \n\nSo doctor comes out and begins stitching me up. I had nicked an artery so I was fading in and out due to blood loss. What brought me back to full consciousness was when I saw through the window of the ER my one roommate fly past in a wheelchair with a security guard chasing him. Once again I started laughing uncontrollably. In the end I have some massive scars on my hand that still hurt occasionally even 11 years later but I also have a sword injury story so... worth it?",

They were about to throw me under the bus quite literally and it probably would have killed me had two builders who were installing a satellite dish on the pub across the way seen what was going on and intervened. They literally saved my life that day and walked me into the pub, the landlady was so kind and gave me a drink, helped clean me up and let me use their phone, I called a taxi and used my birthday money to get home. I didn\u2019t phone my mum as she would have been angry at me. When I got home she was angry anyway. She didn\u2019t care what had happened.

This thing was like twenty feet tall, and inside there was a slide.  I dismissed it as a dream I had, because this thing didn\u2019t make any sense.

            "About three years ago my wife was pregnant with our second child. At her 12(?) week check up they performed a blood test to check for a variety of things, including genetic abnormalities. A week or two later, she got the phone call that every expectant mother dreads. The baby had tested positive for something called Turner's Syndrome. She was in tears. I was too stunned to speak.\n\nThe next day we drove 45 minutes to see a genetic counselor. We were terrified and had no clue what to expect. We had our son with us - he was about 2 years old at the time - and of course for him this was just another errand with mom and dad. As we sat in the waiting room before our appointment, another family came in with two kids. The woman was very pregnant, and all the kids proceeded to do what little kids do. Giggling and exploring the small room. Moving chairs around. Messily eating snacks. Looking at our two families, you would have never known the anxiety bubbling beneath the surface. We might as well have been waiting to get new tires put on our car. Kids are great that way. They keep you anchored to world around you.\n\nThere was another woman there, though. She was a tall, African-American woman sitting off to the side. Her hair was in long, tightly wound braids that spilled over her shoulder. She was wearing sandals and a long, brightly patterned dress. She was very pregnant; I would guess 6-8 months. She looked a little older, maybe late 30s. And she was alone.\n\nI'll never forget the look on her face. She sat staring straight ahead, grim-faced. She never showed any expression during the time we were in the room with her. She didn't look at or react to the kids. She didn't speak or acknowledge any of us. In retrospect, I realized that she was just sitting there alone, trying to process feelings of fear, dread and sadness. And, for the moment, at least, she was completely alone with those feelings. There was nothing to keep her anchored to the world around her.\n\nAt the time, I naively assumed that all of us in that waiting room were in the same, horrifying boat. I now suspect it was worse for her. She was much further along in her pregnancy than my wife. And we had more than a glimmer of hope for our unborn child: it turns out the particular test she was given has a very high false-positive rate for Turner's. We had learned this information on our own before our visit. It  gave us real hope that this would all turn out to be nothing more than a terrifying mistake.\n\nThis woman's face was devoid of hope. There was only sadness.\n\nAs it turns out, we did get lucky. An amniocentesis confirmed that the original result was a false positive. My daughter was born later that year, perfectly healthy.\n\nWhen I think back to that time, a lot of emotions and memories come flooding back. Invariably, I think back to that waiting room and that poor woman's face. I feel something like what I imagine survivor's guilt feels like.\n\nI hope she found a way through the pain and sadness. I don't know if I could have.\n\n\\*\\*Edit #1\\*\\*: Thanks to u/persikofikon for reminding me that even with a positive diagnosis, Turner's babies can go on to have rich and fulfilling lives. Compared to many genetic disorders, the symptoms are mild and, in some cases, imperceptible. Even infertility isn't an absolute certainty.\n\n\\*\\*Edit #2\\*\\*: If you're reading this because your NIPT came back positive for Turner's, take a deep breath and go see a specialist (i.e., genetic counselor) immediately. As of 2018, the NIPT false positive rate for Turner's is about 60%.",

You don\u2019t have to bring your own to a public restroom because there\u2019s one in every stall here in America, and it\u2019s free.\n2. Restaurant service and food abundance. You asked for a medium well steak but was slightly over-cooked? You send it back to the kitchen and you get a new one cooked for you, and the server even apologizes for it!\n3. Black people. White people. Asian people. People with natural red hair. In my fifteen years living in a small town in Central America, I saw maybe two black people, a handful of white people, the one Chinese restaurant owner, and 0 red-heads. Now I get to see all kinds of people from all over the world, with different experiences and backgrounds. It\u2019s kinda neat.",
            "Just how much of my mind was previously occupied by machinations of keeping my family alive. Like always subconsciously running through the drill of what to do in the event of an armed high jacking or house break-in, and being super vigilant around people and in various places, no matter the time of day. \n\nI felt like at least 10% of my mental capacity has been freed up for other more productive thoughts like appreciating beauty and freedom, planning a prosperous future and trusting that the sense of security my family and I feel isn\u2019t just a ruse.",

He had been in the US for around 6 months but even things like tv was an amazing luxury to him.  Someone in the group picked up one at a pawn shop off post and gave it to him and he was just amazed that someone would just give him a TV.  \n\nSomething nifty.  He had it set up so direct deposits would go to an account his village had access to.  His salary as an E2 in the Navy made his family semi royalty in the village.",

I've had friends leave a purse on a table in a restaurant and I made jokes about how easy it would be to steal it. Just a lot more relaxing in public due to less theft. \n\nAnother one is how less physical fighting in schools there is.

            "In my first year of university I had a Nigerian fellow living with me in halls who was an absolute riot.\n\nFirst day here apparently he was struck dumb by the appearance of a woman driving a rubbish truck down the street, just could not believe what his eyes were seeing, and despite living in the UK for over 6 months at some point, could not get over the fact that many houses were built directly onto the pavement and that you could even look directly inside people's windows and observe them if you really wanted to (supposedly back home he lived in a compound surrounded by barbed wire and angry dogs). I remember sitting in the kitchen one day and he came in grinning from ear to ear. He was genuinely delighted by the fact that he had left some food exposed on his desk, and returned later to find it intact and not devoured by insects.\n\nThen there was one incident where he came into the flat looking quite flustered and annoyed. I asked him what was wrong and he explained to me that he'd been unable to get into his classes because there was a cat sitting on the steps up to the door. Confused, I asked how a cat was stopping him from going into his class, and he explained to me, quite seriously, that the cat was a witch, and would turn into a snake and eat him. At first I thought he was taking the piss so I started laughing, but no, he was genuine in his believe that the cat was, in fact, a witch.\n\nApparently some parts of Nigeria are still quite superstitious, and cats are especially despised.",

            "I visited Germany once with my family. We were about to cross the road when a Porsche came racing through. Living in India, we experience daily traffic mishaps and there is negligible concern regarding pedestrian safety and courtesy. So we were actually shocked when the driver literally halted to a stop and insisted on us crossing the road. There was no traffic light, no zebra crossings nothing and we actually were used to letting cars pass by before walking, so this was the biggest shock to us.",

Internet actually works more than it doesn't. Public transportation actually arrives and shockingly, it does on time. If you hire a service, it'll actually be done and with an expectation of quality. The list goes on.\n\nOf course it's not perfect and there's shitty people everywhere, but that's the exception, not the rule. And it's a massive difference.",

Such a weird thing - we lived in grass roof huts so the only time you'd see your reflection would be in our tiny mirror, there's no glass or bathroom mirrors. I'm not vain but it was very strange to suddenly see what I look like all the time. I had lost about 25 kgs (55 lbs) while I was there so that was even stranger.",

            "What the word \u201chope\u201d really means.\n\nMoved from a Southeast Asian country, as a working but near poverty class family. I always had thought that was it: living in a slum-like neighborhood, get a shitty job while doing fuck all everyday, knock up some poor girl before we got to adulthood, then just give up, hoping that I don\u2019t contract any random plague or contagious illness due to an unsanitary environment, and kinda waste away the rest of my life because we were poor and lived in a developing country.\n\nThirteen year old me looked at the world with this grimy shade of filter; it felt like this purest sense of shittiness.\n\nWhen we moved to the US not longer after, it was the first time that I realize life didn\u2019t have to be that way. Even though we were still poor back then and we barely could integrate to the society, _we finally landed somewhere better_.\n\nIt really did make me realize what it means to look forward to a better tomorrow.\n\n**Edit**: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger. Made my day! It feels good to be saying this out loud on the internet... it would be really awkward to share this thought anywhere else, since friends & family members from back home would see it.\n\nI miss the people a lot, and I frequently felt like I \"left them behind\" and escaped on my own. Many of them still are stuck in their own variation of unpleasant lifestyle like my family had been, and I am not really sure if there will ever come a day of change.\n\nThese days, I can't really carry out too long of a conversation with them without it getting to the point of them commenting on the fact that they are jealous of my current situation; it basically means that I have to intentionally distance myself them to keep a reasonably healthy (albeit growingly distant) relationship between us\n\nIt just sucks that my home country couldn't be more developed, progressive, and/or safer for its people, but I am really not sure what I should or can say to the people I know back home. It was incredibly lucky that my parents took a huge risk and it somehow worked out for our small family despite the odds against us. \n\nBut I guess that's just how life is.

Have you seen this!\" He kept exclaiming over and over again, \"Amazing, amazing!\" It made me laugh very hard, but he was a lovely guy.\n\nWow, thankyou so much for all the Karma, did not expect this small but sentimental memory to effect so many people. :)",

The water turns INTO ICE!\"\n\nWe all had a laugh and everyday came for an update on his water cup. Eventually winter did arrive. The teachers let us keep our winter coat in the classroom so that he could leave his glass of water next to the open window.

            "Oh boy what wasn't a shock. I lived in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the 90s when I was a kid. When we came to Portugal to spend time with the family I would, on a regular basis, embarrass my parents with the questions I would ask. Example : Fire Hydrant? What the fuck is that dad? Pastries? MOM WHAT IS THIS?! Traffic lights? What are those lights with little people in them for? Among other stuff.Something that was mind blowing to me was television. Shows running almost all day and several channels! S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 had one channel that started airing at 20:00 and ended at 23. 1st thing that aired always? Cartoons and the same three episodes for the duration of my stay there (around 8 years).\n\nAnother thing that shocked me was the tap water. I couldn't for the duration of my stay drink tap water, nor open my mouth during bath time and i couldn't even gargle with tap water when I brushed my teeth, so the 1st thing I did went I was in Portugal at my grandmas was down the maximum amount of water directly from the bathroom tap.\n\nNot having power outages several times a day was surprising, likewise not having to drench myself in mosquito repellent the second it got dark.Not having to drive to the other side of the island in mud roads to go to the doctor because there were no trustworthy doctor anywhere except that one. Also not having to bring from Portugal needles to give to the doctor so he could perform blood test for malaria without me incurring in the risk of getting infected by some random ass needle in the \"hospital\".\n\nNow that I'm older, I realize the absolute lengths my parents went to keep me healthy while keeping the semblance that everything was fine and safe, when in reality if I caught some fucked up disease, depending on the day I got ill, the next plane out of there would be in a week or more. I broke a tooth and it stayed like that for at least 2 weeks because imagine having a dentist in the 90s on a small island on the equator.\n\nBeing able to eat salad somewhere else that is not home. Eating rice (there was no steady supply of rice in S. Tom\u00e9 until 1994 or something like that). Drinking milk without it being Nido powder milk. Being able to buy meat and on that note GOD DAMN SUPERMARKETS AND MALLS! HOLY SHIT! Food that I had never seen in my life. CHOCOLATES EVERYWHERE! TOYS IN THE SHELFS??? WHAT?????\n\nThe concept of Cinema was almost alien. I had heard of it but the Cinema in S. Tom\u00e9 didn't work.

Light pollution. Even at nights. Even in closed stores and other establishments. This hit hard since where I come from, despite it being one of the biggest metropolitan cities in India if not the absolute biggest, power outages used to be very frequent growing up and this felt like a criminal waste of electricity.\n2. Crowds and traffic. OMG, the level of organization in queues, lane discipline, indicating and stopping at lights even when there was no one around is something I find surprising even today. If a crowd is waiting for a train and the train arrives, they form a single file and get in, ever so frequently giving up their seats for others. No jostling around, pushing, nudging, squeezing, crowding and so forth. \n\nFirst impressions - people/mindsets:\n1. Despite the rightward shift of politics in the States, just about everyone I've met is extremely liberal. If something I do isn't bothering people, they keep it to themselves instead of wasting time judging and labeling me in a certain way. \n2.

Two days before, I canceled and booked it with my credit card which provides rental vehicle coverage because it looked like the weather wasn't going to be great while we were there and I wanted the extra protection.

            "I used to be a banner tow pilot, and was often tasked to fly banners over NYC area, especially over the Hudson River. I would pick them up at an airport in NJ and make my way over from there. Typically, if you were to run into some kind of engine problem, you have a fair number of places you could theoretically land if you had engine trouble. Not so much over the NYC metro area. So I picked out a \"trail of breadcrumbs\", if you will, of specific places I could try to land my plane if I ever had to.\n\nOn the one year anniversary of the Miracle on the Hudson (Captain Sullenberger, etc.), I was given the job to fly a banner over a boat on the Hudson that would be carrying the crew and some passengers from the flight. On the way there, my engine failed while I was less than 1000 feet above the ground. Sinking quickly, I needed to find a place to land right away. Fortunately, my best previously selected spot was just to my left- a landfill on Staten Island, and I put the plane right on the top of it.",

            "I was offered a job in Europe, where I was promised a bonus that was x% of my salary, paid twice a year. When the offer was sent, there was no mention of the bonus and when I questioned why, I was told, \"don't worry, it's in this email with my official company signature.\" I put that one into the saved folder, \"just to be safe.\"\n\nFast forward to moving, on the first payout period I was told I needed to be with the company for 90 days first before a bonus would be paid. Ok, I was annoyed, but I guess that makes sense. On the second bonus payment, they mentioned that the company hadn't had a great year and nobody would be getting bonuses. More annoyed, but if the company isn't doing great, what are you going to do? I should add this was in 2008.\n\nThe following year rolls around and the company announces that things have really taken off and they will pay out the previous bonus period, in addition to the current bonus period. Only problem is, I literally handed in my resignation that day. I inquire to find out if I'll be receiving my bonus from the previous bonus period, and they say \"are you kidding? You just quit.\"\n\nI call a lawyer. I dig up the email from the start of this post, hand that over, and the lawyer says it's a slam dunk case.

Company HQ calls me and tries to get me to drop it, and I refer them to my lawyer.\n\nA week later, at my new job, the lawyer informs me that they've paid all 4 bonus payments, and she also went after her own fees, so it cost me nothing. \n\nGlad I saved that email.

            "I was undergoing pilot training and was pretty new to the whole thing feeling the pressure to perform, etc.. I walked out to preflight a plane for a solo flight (you do this completely alone... instructor was back at flying school doing something else).\n\nAfter doing my walk around it's time to check the oil. Cessna 172's have a dipstick that is attached to a cap that screws into the engine. You unscrew cap and remove dipstick along with it and check the oil. Except, after I unscrew the cap there doesn't seem to be a dipstick attached to it.\n\nI have this thought: \"Well, the engine is still warm from the dudes who just flew before me so ... they flew it like this.... maybe they had a separate dipstick? They must have checked the oil then some other way ....\". Then I have the \"well, to be safe, I should actually pack this up and go ask someone at the flight school exactly how to check the oil in this case\". Note: This takes quite a chunk of time out of my supposed flight and will cut my \"lesson\" for the day short by quite a margin, but I do it anyway.\n\nLong story short (info gleaned from subsequent investigations): The dipstick had broken off during the previous flight, that had landed just minutes before, and had slid straight into the engine, where the crank-case had been chomping away metal from the tip, that metal now circulating in the engine. The aircraft was grounded, it was extremely dangerous to fly, and at massive cost had to be stripped down, the entire engine disassembled, and they actually had to find every bit of metal missing from the dipstick and \"re-assemble\" the dipstick before plane could be re-assembled and made flight worthy again.\n\nIf, in a moment of stupidity, I'd taken off in that plane I'd probably be dead.",

I gave her my keys and we start walking down the block. One by one we notice almost every parking spot has shattered glass next to it.

I wanted to use the crane on the HEMTT wrecker to support the upper arm while we worked, but some higher ranking dumb ass decided it would take too long and told us not to. \n\nCut to my good buddy holding the upper arm back and up on the trailer and me moving the lower arm up to place in the pin. I am bent down while attempting to line up the lower leg and place the pin in. I hear a \"Look Out!\" and do not have time to react as the upper arm comes down from near vertical and catches me on the side of the head. Splits my scalp open and knocks me to the ground.\n\nBlood is everywhere as head wounds bleed like a stuck pig. But i am alive. Several staples later and i would be fine. Moral of the story do shit the right way even if it takes an extra 5 min. Listen to that little voice. If my head had been 1 inch further inward my skull would have been popped like a watermelon. ",

            "Going to the doctor. Turns out I have testicular cancer but caught it early. Getting it removed Friday. Check your nuts guys!\n\nEdit 1/2: man i love this community :) thank you all for the kind words of encouragement. I'm trying to respond to people but I just can't keep up with the comments and need to go back to work.   Lots of people asking about symptoms so please see below. And thank you stranger for my first gold! Wish it was for a happier occasion but beggars can't be choosers I suppose! \n\n**List of Symptoms**\n\n* Dull pain in and around the testicles. Edit: For me this pain came and went; it wasn't consistent. Often related to sitting uncomfortably or agitating the testicle.\n\n* Right testicle is overly sensitive. Edit: this WAS consistent and still is. \n\n* Eventually the right testicle began to swell.\n\n* That turned into a firm, irregular lump on the surface of the testicle. Mine is about the size of a cut in half marble though not as round. Some get much much bigger if you wait.\n\nThe pain and swelling can be caused by a number of things but you should get that checked out regardless. ANY lump on the actual surface of the testicle needs to be checked out immediately! Do not wait!\n\n\n**Info about me (For those curious if we share medical history etc.)** \n\nI'm 29 years old. No recent trauma to the testes. My grandfather apparently had some cancer previously. Medium health, I'm not a fit geek but I'm not exceedingly unhealthy. According to the ultra sound report I have evidence of testicular microlithiasis, which is basically calcium build-up. This is positively correlated with testicular cancer, though not a positive indicator on it's own.\n\n\n**Updates**\n\nSeeking a second opinion I found that an outside doctor initially reviewed the ultrasound results. I got a hold of the report. He found the lump was hypervascular, meaning increased bloodflow, which is consistent with quickly growing malignant tumors. It was not cystic, and the make-up of the lump was fairly consistent throughout. Said it had properties most consistent with seminoma- a treatable, low lethality type of cancer that DOES respond to radiation. This still needs to be verified. \n\nHe also noted \"bilateral testicular microlithiasis\" which is a fancy way of saying sparse calcium build-up, which is positively correlated with occurrence of testicular cancer.\n\nI will update after surgery but the real news won't be until future bloodwork and pathological exam of the tumor. Gonna be Johnny One Ball for a while until i get a prosthetic. Hopefully lefty is okay and didn't pick up the cancer just yet or Ill be Jimmy No Balls instead.\n\nEdit 3: For those asking why a prosthetic. Honestly I haven't thought about it much. I know it's an option and I'm considering it, but I'm not tied to the idea at all. Part of me just thinks having a fake nut would be cool for some reason. I think I'm weird guys. Think they will put one with an LED in it? I could have a glow in the dark sack!\n\nEdit 4: Updated the symptoms a bit. Also with the amount of encouragement I think i might actually try to get an LED testicle... will update for sure haha\n\nEdit 5: Formatting cause I'm bored. Also an update on symptoms, medical report, etc.\n\n**Extra info based on comments in thread (For those worried about symptoms they might have.)**\n\n* A lump on the skin of the scrotum is not necessarily cancerous, and more often than not is a sebaceous or skin cyst. I have one myself. If it grows slowly and eventually just settles on it's size thats probably all it is. I've had the same lump for years. You can actually lance these to get some of the skin juice out but its pretty gross and not really that safe to do on your own. If it grows too much it may need to be removed.\n\n* A few people saying they had localized swelling *near* the testicles but not on them. There are a number of things this can be related to that are not cancer. Obviously get them checked out, as some can still be bad. If it's squishy swelling above or around the testes it's probably something else. If it's a firm lump *directly on the surface of the testicle itself* then it very well may be a tumor. In either case, go to the doctor people!",

I accidentally overpaid for the total coverage Cadillac insurance package. When I got to the place I was staying, I called my dad to see why I had paid so much. He called the car company, figured things out, and told me that the next day I could drive back to the airport and get my money back for a less crazy insurance package. At the last second, I figured I'd never driven in another country, much less switching to the opposite side of the road, so I decided to just keep the insurance.\n\nHalfway through the trip, I made a boneheaded mistake, hit another car, and totaled my rental car. Didn't pay a penny.\n\nAlso, Mr. Plunkett of Sneem, I'm still sorry I fucked up your car.",

            "Got divorced 11 years ago from a horrible woman when my son was only 7 years old. Once I got my life together and settled in I tried to get him to visit me as often as I could. ( due to work I had to live in a different state.)\n\nEvery single time I tried to make plans to fly him to see me or come see him, she would give me some horrible excuse about some medical thing he had, some event with school, or some emergency as to why he couldn't spend time with me. Or even sometimes she would just tell me to fuck off and straight up say no. She knew I didn't live in town and I wasn't just going to show up and see him, so that gave her some power.\n\nAfter the 9th or 10th time of that happening I said to myself, \"you know what, just to be safe I should keep record of all of this.\" So I made sure I saved every text message as well as every email conversation between her and I.\n\n Over the years my son started to resent me thinking that I did not want to spend time with him. He became more distant and I was not able to communicate to him what was actually happening. At the age of 15 or 16 he stopped talking to me because he said that his depression was due to me not wanting to see him. I couldn't explain anything to him at all, so I emailed him and apologize and let him have his space.\n\nLast year I was able to get through to him and convince him to let me come see him and spend the summer with me. I had legal visitation to do so, and told him  that he needed to tell his mother he wanted to spend the summer with me.  She tried to come up with an excuse, but he was resilient in asking and told her it was his choice to spend his summer break with me. She wanted to seem like  a good person so she said yes  finally. I drove 1100 miles to go pick him up and take the drive back with me to my state. I cleared it with child services, his mother, his grandparents and everybody was okay with it. I was going to fly him back in 2 months when his break was over, a week before he started school again.\n\nOn the drive back he expressed to me how upset he was with me about not being around in his life and not wanting to see him. We had a difficult conversation and I just let him  tell me everything he was feeling.  It was hard to hear , but I wanted  to know where his headspace and his heart was.\n\nSo when we stopped the first night at a hotel, I pulled out my laptop and told him I wanted to show him something.\n\nI knew it would hurt, but he had to know how much I cared about him and how hard his mother made it for me to see him. So I showed him every message and every email his mother had ever said to me about the lies she told that kept me from seeing him. I also showed him the legal documents from when I hired a lawyer to try to get custody of him and how difficult she made things. I showed him the communications between her and I and how downright mean she used to get to me when we communicated. I showed him the tweets from his now stepdad that was basically calling him a loser and saying how much he didn't like him. I showed him a part of his family that he had no idea existed. \n\nImmediately his attitude towards me changed. We spent the entire summer together and had the most amazing time rebuilding a relationship. He came to where I lived and saw the clean and responsible life that I lead, and the hard work that I do to make a living. He started to realize that the life in the small town where he is at is very lacking and that his family there is toxic. The entire summer he spent with me he had zero bouts with depression, and actually stopped taking his medication for it. (his choice) He started to understand that his perceived depression was an environmental thing.\n\nAs a thank you for coming to see me, I canceled his flight home and gave him my old pickup truck as an early 18th birthday present and his first vehicle, and drove it back to his home state with him when the summer was over. \n\n\nHe graduates from high school this year and is going to be moving here where I live to do college.\n\nThank God I saved all those messages.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nThank you so much to all of you that have replied. I must not have had notifications turn on my phone cuz I just opened Reddit now after posting that this morning and I'm flooded with responses and my first gold, silver and platinum!\n\nI will scan through and try to reply to as much as I can throughout the night.\n\nFor anybody who is going through the same thing, all I can say is for the love of God document everything!

            "I was leading a group hike down an 8-mile stretch of canyon, following an innocent-looking ankle-deep stream. I had been down this hike many times before so I knew what was ahead, and although I told everyone in the group well advance what to expect -- no one believed me. Once you started out on this 8-mile-canyon hike there was no turning back; you couldn't just call it quits and hike out to the nearest highway and hitchhike back to town. And the innocent-looking ankle-deep creek turned vicious at the end where it got squeezed by the canyon walls into a torrent. It was a hot hot hot August day when we set out. A couple of the people asked me why I was carrying a fully loaded backpack, asking me what was in it. \"Oh, you know, the usual: wool clothing, first aid kit, firestarters, highway flares, water purification, flashlights -- just the typical stuff.\" Well, these two people ridiculed me for carrying this load, particularly the wool clothing on a 98 degree day. They were dressed in flimsy running shorts wearing flip-flops and were each carrying a tiny fanny pack with a single bottle of water and a sandwich. Eight hours later we're nearing the treacherous part of the hike, deep in the bottom of a canyon, just at sunset, with no light reaching the canyon floor, where the water gets deep and fast and if you lose your footing -- you get soaked from head to toe with an hour still left to hike before reaching the safety of your car. Sure enough, Little Miss Running Shorts goes into the drink and comes up sputtering. By the time she reaches the opposite shore, she's already hypothermic because a 98 degree day sometimes turns into a 50 degree night at the bottom of the canyon. We stop the hike, pull out all of my wool clothing, dress her from top to bottom (including the wool gloves) and are fortunately able to continue the hike to its conclusion without further ado. She apologized for having teased me as she handed the wool clothing back to me when we reached the car. ",

            "A few years ago, my wife and I had two cars, an old Civic with a ton of miles and a Ford Explorer. My Explorer was approaching 200k miles. I knew we'd need to replace it within the next few years so I convinced my wife that we should start saving up for one.\n\n We had each aquired a lot of debt in college and we're just now getting to a point where we were making some real headway paying it down so it wasn't easy convincing her that we should set up the account. But I finally convinced her with the hopes that the SUV would last another 5 years so we'd have time to save and hopefully be able to buy outright or at least have a substantial down payment. \n\nSure enough, within the year, the Explorer blows a head gasket leaking oil in all sorts of places it shouldn't be. No mechanic would touch it without doing a full engine replacement which would have cost more than the SUV was worth. If we hadn't been putting back in the car fund, we'd have been royally screwed.\n\nTL;DR: Started saving a \"just in case\" car fund. Needed it almost immediately.",
            "When I was 7 I got really sick. I was up literally all night puking my guts out. Once my stomach was completely empty I started dry heaving. All night. I had a massive pain on my right side. In the am my mom took me to the doctor saying \"my son has appendicitis, please just check and see.\" The doctor said he thought it was some kind of \"flu thing.\" And not to worry. (Besides what does an RN know about appendicitis anyways?)\n\nAfter my mother refused to leave he finally said \"well. He's obviously very dehydrated, so we'll keep him overnight for observation.\" Somewhere around 11pm my appendix ruptured. The surgeon who worked on me said if I'd have been home I wouldn't have survived until the ambulance arrived let alone made it to the hospital. According to him it was one of the worst ruptures he'd ever seen, normally it's just a small tear, mine popped like a balloon. I spent 2 days in the ICU and was able to go home a week later. I missed almost 2 months of school.\n\nIf my mom hadn't been so adamant I wouldn't have made it. ",
            "When I camp or anything like that, I tend to go overboard with bringing snacks. Jerky, granola bars, peanut butter, and pretty much anything else that is calorically dense and easy to pack. My husband thinks I'm crazy and gets annoyed by it but ultimately just rolls his eyes and tells me I'm carrying it.\n\nWell, one time we go camping for a few days in the middle of nowhere and bring some food that requires cooking. Nothing fancy, just nonperishables like pasta, salami, instant mashed potatoes--stuff you can just make and eat quickly. It's cold outside, and while he's getting ready to start cooking I set up the tent so we can eat \"inside\". \n\nA few minutes into my setting up, my husband is giving off major annoyed vibes. I ask what's wrong, and he said that he can't get our camp stove to light. He's tried several times and gone through the typical trouble shooting steps, but nothing is working. I get done setting up the tent, including laying out our sleeping bags and mats, and he still hasn't been able to get the stove to start. This is definitely not good because we rode into the camp spot and there weren't any stores or other people probably for miles. It was too late to track back so he thought we were fucked. \n\nCue me dumping out my junk food bag and telling him we have dinner. It wasn't ideal by any means, but we were really fucking hungry from the physical activity earlier in the day and we were cold. We got filled up, which is the best that could have happened in a situation like that. I also got a huge \"I told you so!\" moment which is always an added bonus.\n\nTLDR: Junk food can save lives.

            "I'm a Level 3 Rope Access Technician. What that means is I am usually a supervisor on job where we work at height using rope systems to access hard to reach areas. I do most of the rigging, client interaction and occasionally if I have inexperienced techs on my crew, I am supposed to babysit/supervise them to make sure they are safe.\n\nWe were working in a major NFL stadium on a painting project. About 300ft off of the ground. We were using devices called beam sliders which we attach ourselves to and slide across I-Beams. In rope access, we have to maintain two points of contact at all times. A \"working line\" and a \"back-up line\". In this scenario, the technician, we will call him Johnny, was attached to the I-Beam by two beam sliders. Some of the beams in this stadium have small gaps on the ends of them that would allow the beam sliders to go right off of the end. I notice, from quite a distance away, that Johnny, one of my less experienced techs, is attaching his set of beam sliders to one of these beams that have the gap on the other end. I get on the radio and tell him that once he gets close to the end to be very careful and stop 10' from the end and throw a sling around a vertical beam near the end as a third point of attachment that would catch him in the event his beam sliders slid off the end of the beam. I watch as he attaches himself to the vertical beam with a sling and he chokes it around meaning, that if it were to be weighted, it would cinch around the beam and hold him in place.\n\nI turn around to start making my way back and I  hear the sound of beam sliders clanging together and slamming against steel. I look back and I see Johnny hanging on the single attachment point I told him to put on as a safety. Johnny is frozen in fear hanging there. He fell about 5-6ft before the extra point caught him and he hurt himself pretty bad. I radio down to the ground to have the rescue kit brought up under us. I made my way over to him and attached a second point between him and the beam. I lowered my tag line and pulled up the rescue lines after climbing above him and setting some anchors. After attaching the anchors I got on the ropes and lowered myself next to him, attached him to myself and hauled him up a foot or so so that I could remove his lines and then lowered us both to the ground.\n\nHe wasn't too hurt but he was in shock. He didn't remember what happened. He said he remembered reaching to paint some bolts and then he was hanging in midair. \n\nWe called a safety stand down and we had a meeting about what had happened. After completing an incident report and rescue summary I sent him home. He didn't come back to that job.\n\nHad I not told him to tie off to a third point, he would have been dead. Effectively, saving my ass from fines or prison as I am responsible for the lives of my crew and can face charges if they die.",
            "Back when I was in a high school I had a big stencil/ street art phase. My friend and I were hanging out, sitting on the couch and talking and we decide to wait till it gets dark and head out to go \"tastefully\" stencil some of our designs in hidden parts of the high school. (Under benches, hidden alleys, etc. we were always pretty respectful and wouldn't throw a stencil up in an obnoxious / hard to clean place). \n\nWhile we were sitting on the couch we saw this dark truck drive by with a bunch of 20 something year old dudes in it, they parked at the end of the street, got out, and stared at us in my house. Like for an UNCOMFORTABLE amount of time. I thought it was weird so before my friend and I left, I wrote down the license plate of the truck in the notes section of my phone and didn't think much more about it besides \"eh, just in case something happens\". \n\nCut to about 2 hours later, my friend and I were done being hooligans and we come back to my normally quiet dead-end street with 2 police cars in the road with their lights on. My friend and I instantly freaked out and thought we were busted. I walked up to a police officer and nervously asked \"what's up?\" and that's when I noticed my mom's car was completely totaled in front of our house. \n\nThe police officer explained there was a collision and they suspected a drunk driver. I whipped out my phone and gave the officer the license plate number I had written down and told him about what had happened earlier. He left the scene right after talking with me and returned to my house no more than an hour later and said they had arrested one of the guys for drink driving and for hit-and-run because they found the dark truck in the driveway with half of the bumper caved in with matching paint from my mom's car. The police officer said there were no witnesses of the crash or evidence they could have gone off of and that he was absolutely amazed that we came out of no where with the lead. \n\nEdit: Minor wording changes",

But I had made such a habit out of it that I would do it before bed even if I was black out drunk. Towards the end of the year two of our neighbors got robbed on the same night. And guess what.

            "This will probably end up buried, but I've got a good one for this. \n\nSo, I'm working as a merc in Iraq defusing IEDs from different areas after the town has been liberated from ISIS occupation and rule. \n\nI'm tasked with a school, which has killed 5 people on 3 separate occasions when they went to enter from one of the few entrances. A couple local cops and 1 or 2 civilians I believe. I circle the huge compound, disarm a few switches, and trace the wires into a window on the ground floor, where it enters the room and leads under the ceramic floor tiling. There are some disturbed floor tiles, but just barely so, more like the dust settled oddly on them because they had been pulled up and replaced while Terrorist Terry is running and hiding the wire. \n\nThis turns out to be the most dangerous and complex IED I've ever encountered over a decade in this career field. Certain tiles on the floor have been lifted, and the foundation was chipped away to allow placement of different firing switches. If you step on certain tiles while walking around the building, you lose. If you lift up certain tiles trying to get to the right wiring and circuit components, you lose. \n\nEvery action is done remotely and from a good distance away, so if I make a mistake or there's something unexpected, I can walk away from it intact. After 2 days of work, I've disabled 8 different firing switches, and finally find the detonator attached to the IED main charge. It's under the floor in a store room, so I cant see exactly how much explosives have been used, which is important information to determine safe operation and evacuation distances. Just a large area of disturbed tile approximately 10' x 5'. I remove the detonator carefully after safing this last bit of circuit, and get my tools ready to start excavating the dirt and sand hiding the explosives that are just beneath the surface (it's slow work because each bit of dirt is moved carefully with a paint brush). \n\nI get this odd tingle in my nether regions, and decide to leave that be for the moment and brush away some dirt at the outer edge of this hole/disturbed tile area to give myself a warm and fuzzy feeling about my next steps and adjusted plan. After two strokes, I see another bit of the wiring that's been encountered the last few days, and have a \"well... fuck\" moment. Not only had they worked 8 different firing switches into this one giant sub-floor \"fuck you\" charge, but there's another entirely independent firing switch leading into a different area of the explosives. I snap a few pics, get my tools ready, and start walking back to my safe area to perform my actions on the new components. Radio back to my safety team who are further away at the cordon edge, update them on the situation, and actually tell them \"just wanted to let you know what's going on and what I'm going to do, so if everything blows up, you'll know why\". We laugh at the dark humor, and I conduct my actions.\n\nKA-FUCKING-BOOM\n\nIt was a Hollywood moment come to life. I was literally blown off of my feet while crouching, and flew back about 5-10 feet. The explosive charge was estimated near 400lbs or so, but the destruction of that part of the building had triggered one of the booby trapped floor tiles in a different area, which sympathetically detonated THAT explosive charge, also estimated near 400lbs. Parts of the first and second floor collapsed to the ground, the hallways and rooms within 30 feet were completely destroyed and covered in rubble, and the blast from the explosion and the nearby dirt had created a large mushroom cloud of dirt and dust, completely hiding anything inside the entire compound from sight (maybe 200' x 500' total area inside the compound walls?)\n\nMy team freak out thinking I'm dead, and they blow up my radio with traffic, which of course delays my ability to assure them I'm roughed up but alive. Had some minor cuts and bruises from the falling debris and a concussion and migraine from hell for about 2 weeks, but I walked away at the end of the day. \n\nAlways trust that funny tingle, folks.",

Tell him I am so glad I had no faith in their Customer Service Agents knowing what they are doing, or their Tech savvy systems, thats why I kept the paper proof.\nAsk to see Manager to lay a complaint    against agents who obviously generating fraudulent CL's cause if the computer says no such letter was generated, then agent must have then manually typed the letter for us and took the money? Miraculously the pc then found the CL that was generated on that acc.\nWonder how many ppl who dont keep the physical letter had to cough up time and time again, cause the pc cant find the CL.",
            "Renters insurance, 5 weeks after purchase my rental home burned. Saved my ass.",
            "This was many years ago. My sister was moving int with me at my place in San Diego. We had rented a Uhaul truck and randomly got insurance. I'd never used their insurance before and had heard it was a waste of money, but I was a bit flush and it was only like $50, so got it on a whim.\n\nSo the move goes fine and as we drive off to turn the truck to the local Uhaul I smash it into my place's balcony. Prices of wood rain down on the windshield and I was stunned. I couldn't see the balcony because of the truck's overhanging cab. When I pull back I see the balcony it's fully detached from the house and only the stairs are keeping it from complete collapsing.\n\nI continue leaving to return the truck, got pulled over by the cops BTW because someone reported that I hit a house and then drove off. They let me go when I explained that I actually live there.\n\nI'm thinking I'm complete screwed as I've done huge structural damage to my little rental place.\n\nIn the end the $50 Uhaul insurance paid for a complete rebuild of the balcony. Thousands and thousands of dollars. I always get the insurance now.",
            "Saved a kickass molecule module that me and my dad made for a science class project one year in elementary school. It was really good to as my dad is a bit of nerd like me. Fast forward to senior year, I have another science class that I\u2019m not doing to hot in. Teacher announces final project that will be a big part of our grade. We have to make a molecule module and get to pick our element. Pick the element me and dad made Way back when. Turn in project a week later get best grade and pass class. It still sits in his classroom to this day. ",
            "I was at boy scout camp and was sitting alone near a campfire at about 1am and heard a noise I decided to put the fire out and go back to my cabin/Adirondack thing to be safe. A few minutes later I heard another noise but closer this time I opened the door and there were 4 bears right where I was going through someones cooler.",
            "Was skateboarding with my two friends. We were just messing around in this parking lot, and I was gonna do a board slide on this little metal structure. As I'm starting to go my friend, David, literally pulls me back and goes \"hold on, hold on. Just to be safe...\" and then pulls out this longish metal rod that was sticking out the other end of this metal thing I was about to try grinding on. I didn't even notice it because it was stuck in about 5 feet back from where I was attempting to skate. So I go up to it. I ollie. I turn, and my skateboard is dead center. Just like I planned. But I fucked up because I'm leaning back... so the board *immediately* kicks out from under me, I go flying backward through the air. Straight back. And I end up falling right in the middle of this metal thing I was trying to boardslide on. I didn't get hurt. at all. However I looked over at my friends and all of us had our mouths agape... Because all of us knew right then that had David not took out that metal rod I would have fallen directly onto it with a *lot* of force. It would have gone right into the back of my head, right at the base of my spine. \n\nSaved my life, and saved themselves possibly years of therapy having witnessed such a brutal accident.\n\n ",
