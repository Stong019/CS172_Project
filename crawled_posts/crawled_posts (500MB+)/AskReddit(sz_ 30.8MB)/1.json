He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  \n\nI remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. \n\nOr how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves \"what I didn't hear you!\" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  \n\nMy time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.   \n\nRIP Stan.

            "I always loved superheroes, and my childhood was filled with Marvel. Spider-Man was always my favorite, because I was a weird kid and found spiders fascinating. I loved him more as I grew up, because there were so many similarities: raised in poor families beset by financial troubles. Quick with jokes to cover insecurities. A deep love of science that shaped everything I did. The implicit knowledge that I may not be the strongest, or the toughest, or the most resilient, but that I always had to stand back up. Intellectually gifted and, with it, a compulsory, driving need to use that to help people. It's why I became a scientist researching psychiatric illnesses, and then later Alzheimer's disease, because I recognized that I had a gift - and so I had a responsibility.\n\nSpider-Man is paper and ink, but he is an ideal I always have, and always will, aspire to. He is my hero. And the man who helped give me that ideal, who shaped so much of my childhood and identity, has died, and the world is a sadder place.\n\nThank you, Stan Lee. Thank you for your heroes and your dreams. Thank you for helping shape me into the person I am.\n\n*EXCELSIOR!!!*",
            "I know it\u2019s \u201csilly\u201d to mourn public figures who you never personally knew, and obviously my grief pales in comparison to the grief of his loved ones, but this one (and Iwata) really got to me.\n\n\n\nI knew Stan Lee before I knew who the hell he was. He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I\u2019m not powerless just because I was a kid. \n\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to write off comic books as a child\u2019s entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes. Thanks to Stan, I\u2019m able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what I\u2019ve come to call \u201cPeter Parker Syndrome.\u201d So, even beyond his personal impact on my own life, I owe Stan Lee a great debt. \n\n\n\nHis is an influence that will be missed. Marvel games, movies, and media at large will simply not be the same without him. Through the act of creating superheroes, Stan Lee himself became a superhero, a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world. May he Rest In Peace, but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come.\n\nEdit: since people were asking what \u201cPeter Parker Syndrome\u201d is, I\u2019ll copy/paste my response here. It\u2019s an allegory I use to illustrate certain themes:\n\n\nIt\u2019s how I explain codependency and hero complex to clients. \n\n\nI started by introducing Spider-Man and his real identity. I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the \u201cdisguise.\u201d \n\n\nAnyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn\u2019t care, because he gets to be the hero and that\u2019s what matters most to him.\n\n\nTime passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can\u2019t even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.\n\n\nThen the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.\n\nI then relate the client\u2019s self care to their \u201cPeter Parker\u201d and their desire to be there and care for others to their \u201cSpiderman,\u201d to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.\n\n\nA seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around. I then have them keep a running tab of how Peter Parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care.",

            "I know I\u2019m late to this post but I met him when I was 17. Shook his hand and asked him some questions and had a muffin with him. He is my hero, I didn\u2019t have the most active male role models in my life and I used comics to fill that void. I learnt more from spider-man about responsibilities then anyone. I learnt all about racism at a young age through x-men and I learnt patriotism and to always fight the good fight through captain America. Of course I learnt weird things like don\u2019t go through space portals or don\u2019t inject yourself with a weird virus as your girlfriend tries to kill you. But most importantly I learnt there is others out there like me who also were alone and needed someone. I grew up when it was still lame to be a nerd and I was bullied for knowing what the circle in iron mans chest was. My first fist fight was over Spider-Man. My first memory of my dad is him reading me west coast avengers. \n\nTo Stan lee, thank you. You helped me grow up and become a much better person then I would of become without you. I owe you so much and it hurts I couldn\u2019t give you more than a smile when we met. But he called me a true believer. So to all the other true believers out there.

We were walking around and we saw Stan walking with a bunch of suits. We asked to take a photo and he was so happy to meet us and take a photo with us. He was warm, kind and inviting. He talked to us while the executives stood their looking at their watches. He was genuinely happy to talk with us and spend that little time with us. \n\nTwo years later, we went to SDCC and printed that photo. We knew it was a long shot to run into him at SDCC, but we would be upset if we missed an opportunity. We found a booth that was hosting Stan. They had Spider-Man guitars and if you bought one, Stan would sign them. We get there and there is this huge crowd. Stan comes and starts signing. My wife and I take out the photo in the middle of the crowd and hold it up high. After 10 minutes or so of signing, surrounded by people holding comics up to get him to sign, he spots our photo. He smiles and waves, then leans over to one of the booth employees and says something to him. The guys comes through the crowd and asks my wife to follow him. She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo. His mannerisms were so different toward my wife than they were to the people getting the guitars because this was something that was special to us. It has no monetary value. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/kgnSLWt",

That\u2019s where I saw Wizard magazine (#34) for the first time, which featured on its cover an illustration of Rogue and Psylocke of the X-Men. I was somewhat familiar with Batman, Spider-Man, and Superman, but I really didn\u2019t know of any female superheroes (aside from Wonder Woman, who frankly seemed pretty lame to me as a kid) at that time. I bought the magazine, and for months, it was an obsession for me. I read it over and over again. I started buying comic books, drawing characters, reading the stories out loud in the voices I imagined each character to have, dreaming up new powers and imagining new worlds. What I loved about the Marvel universe was that there was room for everybody: men, women, people of different races, nationalities, ages, abilities, and backgrounds. It made me feel like comic books were something that everyone could enjoy. I shared my love for comic books with my brother. Although he struggled in school and teachers couldn\u2019t get him to focus, he would pay attention when I read The Uncanny X-Men to him, and when he finally learned to read, it was because of comic books.

Because although he\u2019s gone from the world, he\u2019s still within all of us. It sounds cheesy I know, but it\u2019s true. He\u2019s the gamma radiation, the super soldier serum, the shrapnel in our hearts. He\u2019s the pym particles we breathe. He\u2019s the spider DNA in our blood.

At one point in the tour, the guide told me to watch out for a cord on the floor. The cord ran to a small, window air-conditioning unit that was duct-taped to a vent. Supposedly, one day the plant began to overheat, and the plant would have to be shut down in order to repair the malfunction. There are emergency reserves for situations like this, but the plant was overheating faster than they could switch it over. Someone at the plant had just purchased the ac unit, and had it in the back of their vehicle. The ran and grabbed it, plugged it in, and pointed it into one of the vents. The amount of cool air it produced was enough to not only offset the overheating, but to also re-regulate the system, so instead of repairing the issue, they just fixed the the ac in place, and let it run continuously until the day the plant shut down.",

It was a grid of squares and you had to click each square to harvest it, and sometimes other players would jump in and start harvesting too.  I wrote a macro on a hot key that when i found a full field to harvest, it would take the mouse cursor, move and click every single square in the grid, so once it was claimed, no one else could harvest it.  It would click the entire grid in about 5 seconds, where if you were doing it manually, it would take you about 30 seconds.

            "Might get buried, but my dude in my head is literally Mr. Spock from Star Trek, and I don't avoid him.\n\nHear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.\n\n\nMr. Spock: \"The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful.\"\n\n\nKirk: \"That's horrible!\"\n\n\nSpock: \"Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob.\"\n\n\nSo, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. \n\n\nme: \"Spock, science report.\"\n\n\nSpock: \"Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes.\"\n\n\nme: \"Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself. I suck!\"\n\n\nSpock: \"I disagree. It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable.\"\n\n\nJust going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.\n\nEDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly. \n\nOne - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.\n\nTwo - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK! He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that \"getting gas\" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior \"science report\", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, \"godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*\" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, \"That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock.\" That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!\n\nThree - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.\n\nFour - trust your intuition.

I mean, except for kissing the occasional mommy, he usually works alone. \n2) Santa is magic; diseases don\u2019t affect him. \n3) Santa caught it in April and is all better now. There are excellent doctors in the North Pole. \n4) Santa got the vaccination so he wouldn\u2019t make anyone sick when he visits. \n5) Rudolph\u2019s nose emits ultraviolet light, so Santa gets sanitized each time he gets back in the sleigh. \n\n\nCrazy answers for \u201cfun\u201d parents:\n\n6) Santa is already dead. He\u2019s been a friendly zombie for centuries.\n\n7) Santa signed a contract with Amazon to deliver all his presents this year.\n\n8) Santa is a saint, so he can perform miracles. Miracle makers can\u2019t stay sick. \n\n9) Santa is a robot and robots don\u2019t catch diseases. \n\n\n\nAnswer for mean, realistic, or boring parents:\n\n10) Santa\u2019s not real, so he doesn\u2019t get sick.",

Also he's wearing a mask this year and has special snow gloves. And his elves are giving him that very rare medecine (chloroquine if you wanna tell them) so it's less probable that he brings the virus with the presents",

Great money saver if you don\u2019t know much about mechanics. Someone I knew was going to get screwed by their mechanic (700 bucks for a water pump replacement). Showed them that, they did it themselves for 30 bucks. It makes it quicker too, knowing what tools you need ahead of time for your particular car.\n\nEdit: I agree they\u2019re not the best for parts, this was just about their videos. For parts, rockauto.com is great. If you need an item quicker and have an Advanced Auto nearby, order online and pick up in store. They almost ALWAYS have a coupon online for at least 20% off, which you can apply and pick up in store, around 30 minutes later, yet save quite a bit versus just going in and buying.\n\nLast edit: For those that are not mechanically inclined and do not want to mess with it, use Repairpal.com when you receive a quote and make sure the price is reasonable. It will give you a pretty general idea of what you should be paying in your area. It\u2019s not 100%, but will help keep you from getting ripped off.

            "Functionally - you would need an amendment rather than just a law.\n\nCongressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members. More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.\n\nArticle 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:\n\n>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\n\n27th Amendment:\n\n>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\nIt also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President. So that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort.",
            "I personally like the Canadian system.  If their legislature ever fails to pass a budget, they've failed at their primary responsibility of running the government.  Failing to pass a budget is treated as a failure of confidence, and a general election is triggered whereby every parliamentarian must face their voters and rejustify why they should have a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot saying that would force all U.S. legislators to act, but it would probably incentivize enough to avoid stupid shit like this latest shutdown.",
            "This is a terrible idea.\n\nFor one thing, most of them would not care. My Senators are worth millions of dollars, they don't even notice their salary.\n\nFor another thing, *some* Congresspeople do really depend on their salary. This is their only source of income.\n\nSee the problem here? If we cut off their pay then the rich Congressmen have a weapon to use against the poorer Congressmen. There would be *more* government shutdowns and threats of shutdowns, and \"vote with me or lose your paycheck\" would become a viable, common tactic for the wealthier members of Congress.\n\nA better idea would be to just stop voting for idiots. Or, more applicable to this audience: fucking vote.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold and silver, and the great discussions! This shutdown is extremely frustrating for everyone, and there are no easy answers. But the more we talk about potential solutions, the more likely we are to find some that work. ",
            "This simple argument against it is that newer or less corrupt congressmen would be the only ones to suffer. If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. \n\nSo this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?\n\nI feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.\n\nAdditionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.",

As others have said, the problem with anything that punishes senators financially is that it encourages wealthy people to get involved in politics, and discourages less wealthy ones - or leaves them dependent on wealthy patrons, which is even worse.\n\nInstead, when the government fails to pass a budget, everything should continue at previous levels (maybe even automatically increasing for inflation.)  This is not ideal, but defaulting to the status quo is far superior to having everything grind to a halt - people who want to implement changes should have to get support for them and shouldn't be able to use shutting down the government as a cudgel to try and force them through.",

            "it's the same in the Netherlands. It's a good thing- people can opt out, and also, the relatives of a deceased person can still decide to opt out if they want to. Many people aren't against this, but don't really want to think about it or make an effort while alive, and organs are needed hard!",
            "When my brother killed himself the hospital was incredibly pushy and pressured my grieving mother to let them harvest him. \n\nThey took away our chance to say goodbye, and they botched the procedure and ruined ALL of his organs by not putting him on a ventilator. Then they billed us $30,000 for butchering him and refused to budge on the bill. We still can't even collect his estate because of the hospital bills from them cutting him apart against his wishes. \n\nHe was dead before he ever arrived and they still found a way to charge us for a surgery. \n\nIts not ridiculous to think those people would let you die for your organs. They absolutely fucking will. I've seen the way they get when they think they have someone they can use. I don't doubt for a second that they would have pushed us to pull the plug if he was on life support. \n\nDon't have so much faith in these people. They're highly paid and see you as a profit center. They only care about how much they can bill your insurance company. \n\nFuck St Mary's hospital in West Palm Beach Florida. \n",
            "I'm from Austria and it's been like this over here for as long as I can remember. Honestly, there is no issue. Very few people actively don't want to be donors. They care enough to just opt out. Most people don't care whether or not their organs are donated/don't think about it and would be too lazy to opt in if it weren't automatic. I literally see no reason against it and anyone I've ever talked to about our system has expressed the same opinion. It's beyond me why it's not a thing in more countries. \n\nEdit: TIL it's more widespread than I thought. I hope it's going to become even more common! ",
            "I'm not a fan of having to opt out of something you didn't sign up for in the first place. The onus shouldn't be on the non-consenting party.\n\nI am an organ donor myself, and encourage everyone to be organ donors. However, I know that many people and their families have personal reasons for not wanting to be donors. Despite the ability to opt out, there will still be cases of people who didn't get around to opting out or maybe weren't even aware that they are compulsory donors.\n\nAlso, if people with mental illnesses or cognitive disabilities aren't automatically opted out, this raises *many* ethical issues.",
            "Not a fan; it violates the idea of free choice over ones body. How can the logic of \"my body my choice\" be applied to abortion but not to your own bodily organs?",
            "If I\u2019m dead I don\u2019t need my organs. ",
            "I have to disagree.  While morally I think it is great to have organs more readily available, I think you should NOT automatically be opted in.\n\nMy feelings on this stem from the technology industry.\n\nApps, Windows (microsoft), browsers, video games, they all automatically opt you in to their information gathering, email sending, text message viewing, invasive \"services\".\n\nI personally think it should be illegal to have anyone automatically opt me in for anything.  Everything should be a default NO until I otherwise give my consent to it.\n\nIt also should be illegal to give out other people's information under the guise of \"if you recommend 5 friends, you get a free t-shirt\".  Because then all the sudden I am getting spam calls from Gyms, Window companies, scammers, all because some asshole that has my number decided to put me down as a recommendation.  Even asking to take me off lists, I still get calls.\n\nYes I am an organ donor.  Yes I wish more people were.  But No, I don't beleive anyone should be automatically opted in for anything.\n\nNo one should have to spend time, energy, or have to navigate tricky menus just to opt out of something they never agreed to in the first place.  Even if it is a simple 5 minutes of your time with an easy to navigate website.  Most companies/places bank on people not paying attention/not knowing in the first place.",
            "I don't really care but I do have a funny story. When I was 16 I was with my dad getting my driver's license. The lady asked me \"Do you want to be an organ donor?\" I looked at my dad, horrified, and said \"When does that operation take place?\"",
            "Unpopular opinion but: I do not like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am all for organs going to those that need it, and I would hate for organs to decompose and go to waste. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I am very much against the notion that you are automatically subscribed to becoming an organ donor, this would suggest they would have an automatic claim over your body unless you opt out. I principally believe that they do not and should not have any claim to my organs and body unless I willingly opt myself in.",
            "I think it\u2019s great to have more donors and I\u2019ll get hated for this but, I want to be complete when I\u2019m buried. Please respect my selfish wish.",
            "We\u2019ve had this in Wales (Part of UK) for a few years now. ",
            "I don\u2019t know, what if there was a law where all your possessions went automatically to the state upon your death unless you specifically opted out and said it goes to your spouse and kids. Such systems may lack accessibility for many people, and others may not even know about the fact they are automatically opted in. It also seems to reduce the medical idea of body autonomy, so for these reasons I\u2019d say no",
            "While it is a good idea for saving lives, I feel like the government automatically opting in is kind of an overreach of powers."

            "The man who redirected an entire warship to get the sun off his eyes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch. But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks.\" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting. And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face.

It helped me get through all kinds of grief over the last few years, from deaths to painful breakups. Really changed my life and how I handle these hard situations. An excerpt:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As for grief, you'll find it comes in  waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage  all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty  and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you  can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for  a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a  photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all  you can do is float. Stay alive.  \n>  \n>In  the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without  mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch  your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe  weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but  they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you  and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You  never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a  picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be  just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves,  there is life.  \n>  \n>Somewhere down the  line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are  only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come  further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or  Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most  part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that  somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet,  sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but  you'll come out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to full comment here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)",

As I reviewed our resupply plans once we took hold of the city, a strange man with a long beard and a fur coat entered the tent. My bodyguards were nowhere to be found, their sleepy minds betrayed them. Was this an assassin? Had Kutuzov somehow infiltrated my Grand Army?*\n\n*He approached me with wide eyes. \"Bro! You're that Bonaparte dude! Whats up my Corsican from another mother! Been waiting till your retreat from Moscow!\"*\n\n*Who was this? His French was bastardized, his accent was a noticeable strange English. He spoke of a retreat from Moscow? Impossible I thought, the Russian Empire would break today. He was insane and made no sense. He walked over to me with his hands up, showing that he held no weapons. But with a quick motion he sprung his leg and brought to bear the weight of his foot against my manlyhood. The pain shot through my body and left me on the ground, it was more painful than the injuries I sustained in the Italian alps.*\n\n*He ran outside as I called the guards after him. We searched an hour trying to find him, Ney personally lead a squad but to no avail.*\n\n*I sometimes question, as I sit here in this forgotten island on the edge of the world, if he existed at all. He may have been, perhaps, a figment of my imagination. My own intuition manifested in a dream-like form telling me to leave before it was too late, foretelling the pain of me losing France.*\n\n*Whatever it was, it is lost to the Russian tundra.

Do not ignore the Oracle of Moscow.\"*\n\nEdit: [permalink](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/91184s/you_are_sent_back_to_the_year_10000bc_and_are/e2vemh1/) to comment",

            "Sorry if this ends up being long but its angered me for quite some time.\n\nAbout ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.\n\nSo after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).\n\nMy father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. \n\nAside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.\n\nWell she did, passed with \"Flying colors\" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.\n\n1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.\n\nMonth later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.\n\nAt this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was \"home from running around\" \n\nThen around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.\n\nUpon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.\n\nShe's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.\n\nTurns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.\n\nShe thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.\n\nBecause of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.\n\nBy the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.\n\nShe even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.\n\nYears later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.\n\nI have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.\n\nIf you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.\n\nIts horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.\n\n\n**EDIT** Thanks for the gold mysterious stranger!",

She took his license out of his wallet and threw it in the fire when they got home.

            "I am a police officer in a medium sized suburban town in Texas. I have been in law enforcement for 14 years. I love my job, I love how I get to help people and I love how I get to cause positive changes in peoples' lives. I love how 99.9% of the time, my badge is shiny...today my badge is not shiny.\n\nI am tired of hearing the excuses given by other people for a police officer's misconduct. I am tired of excuses being made for people who tarnish my badge. I am so tired of hearing how officers have a stressful job and their misconduct was a result of that stress. You know who else is under stress? The people who called us, that person whose loved one just committed suicide, the family who called us because they found grandma dead and now we're asking everyone questions, the 7-11 clerk who just had a gun shoved in his face, and even the guy we just put in handcuffs and told him he is losing his freedom. Sorry, but our stress is low compared to these folks. We might have to go into these situations, but we get to leave them and pretend none of that shit ever happened after our shift is over.\n\nI am tired of hearing excuses for the bad police officers, I am tired of the excuse \"well, he puts his life in danger\". Sure, I know we put our lives in danger, I've had guns, knives and even swords pulled on me. I've responded to bomb threats, suicidal subjects, assaults in progress, robberies in progress, etc. You know who else puts their lives in danger? Fire fighters, deep sea fisherman, loggers, people who step foot outside their homes in Chicago. We are trained to deal with danger, we are provided with equipment and training to help us survive those dangers. Do I face an increased risk of not going home? Sure, but that's why I am at an increased level of awareness at work, so I can respond to threats appropriately without panic and over responding.\n\nI am tired of hearing about the thin blue line. I believe in the thin blue line, I believe in looking out for my fellow officers. I don't believe in hiding the misconduct or unlawfulness of other officers, and I have always spoken up. What many forget, standing behind the thin blue line doesn't mean concealing the misconduct of other officers, it means confronting those officers so they don't do something to ruin their lives, the lives of others, or violate the law or code of conduct. It means walking up to the officer with his knee on a suspect's neck and saying \"dude, this is too much, stop\", before the officer commits murder. It means walking up to the officer who has been drinking all night and saying \"dude, I'll give you a ride home\". Instead of hiding misconduct, prevent it, help your fellow officer not do something to ruin his life or another's life. If you do see misconduct, address it, take it to the appropriate level, stop tarnishing my badge. We took an oath to uphold the law, uphold our ethics and protect our communities, sometimes that means arresting other police officers or holding them accountable for policy/ethics violations.\n\nThis officer violated the rights of George Floyd and murdered him through his actions. The officers who were on scene and failed to act are just as responsible. There are multiple videos of this incident and there is no real question as to what happened.\n\nFor those folks who wonder what makes it murder or manslaughter. Murder is the act of causing death to another human being through an action which a reasonable person would know (or intend) could result in the death of the victim. Manslaughter is the act of causing death through an act which is reckless in nature.\n\nEvery officer in America is taught about positional asphyxiation and while some departments allow neck restraints, all officers are taught the dangers of neck restraints and are taught not to apply pressure to the back of someone's neck or head when they are proned out on the ground in handcuffs.\n\nFloyd was handcuffed with little resistance and they were able to walk him across the street to a patrol unit. Floyd can be seen in a surveillance video falling to the ground next to the unit on the sidewalk side of the unit. Cell phone footage then shows the officer on top of Floyd's neck on the opposite side of the unit, the street side. There is a random man in the background telling Floyd just to get in the car and he can't win. Floyd can be heard saying he knows and he's done. This implies that Floyd may have resisted or attempted to escape, but was still restrained in the handcuffs. Floyd can be heard multiple times saying he can't breathe. The cell phone video shows the officer kneeling on top of Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes, with around four of those minutes with Floyd being unconscious.\n\nEven if Floyd did attempt to resist or escape, there was no reason to hold him down for eight minutes. What was the point of restraining him for so long? Why did the other officer not assist the primary officer with restraining Floyd so they could get him in the patrol unit quicker? Why did the primary officer continue to restrain Floyd by his neck after Floyd became unresponsive? Why can the officer be heard at some point asking Floyd if he is still a tough guy? I can only come up with one answer to all of these questions, and that was the primary officer, Chauvin, wanted to prove to Floyd that Floyd was not such a tough guy. I see an officer assaulting another human being, going beyond taking control of a suspect, using force as punishment and ultimately causing the death of another human being. I see a second officer who stood and watched and did nothing, despite knowing that what the first officer was doing was a violation of law and policy. I see officers who were trying to get back at Floyd for running his mouth and resisting an arrest by using force they KNEW could result in death or serious bodily injury in a situation which did not justify using deadly force.\n\nThis officer committed murder, plain and simple. This officer tarnished my badge and the badges of all police officers. Worst of all, this officer tortured his victim for eight minutes, imagine your last thoughts and memories being those of a police officer, a person who the public is supposed to be able to trust, placing his body weight on your neck, slowly asphyxiating you against hot asphalt while he asks you if you're still a tough guy. I hope this officer, and any officer who allowed this to happen, is tried and convicted. It's going to be some time before I can polish my badge back to a shine, in the mean time, a family is suffering, a community is burning, all because of one guy who should have never been an officer.\n\nWhat do I think? I think assholes like this make my job that much harder and damage the trust I work so hard for. I think assholes like this ruin peoples' lives and ruin families. I think assholes like these should be stuck in a prison with all of the people they ever arrested.",

            "I'm a former police officer, and so have had plenty of training in physical restraint of individuals being arrested.  \n\nThere is no police academy training officers to kneel on someone's neck to subdue them, That's how you kill a person. \n\n There is extensive training on how to avoid seriously injuring a person while restraining them, and I guarantee you every one of these officers was trained to never strike a person in the neck or choke them.\n\nThe officer who killed him is very clearly liable for manslaughter at the very least, and I think the other officers who stood by have some accountability as well because they knew damn well that was not how you handle a person, and should have stepped up.",
            "Absolutely sick to my stomach. \n\nI'm a lieutenant in my home town police department. I started my day by showing the video to my officers and making sure my people understood that this is murder, plain and simple. You never, outside of a life and death struggle, do anything like this. \n\nGeorge Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground. If he was still struggling badly enough that they felt a need to hold him down, there's a hundred ways to do it safely. Use of force should always be as measured and considered as possible. There will always be times where an officer sees danger and has to make a split second decision without the luxury of weighing the consequences. That clearly was not the case here. He had all the time in the world to think about what he was doing. He had multiple people there telling him to stop. And none of his fellow officers intervened. All of that is why I find this incident particularly disgusting. They had so many chances to do the right thing. \n\nLuckily, I have the fortune of working with good people who see this shit for what it is. Before the video was over, before I told them that George Floyd died because of this, my officers were muttering things like, \"What the fuck is he doing?\" \"You can't do that shit\" and \"He needs to get off the man's fucking neck!\" Made me way prouder to be their leader than any number of arrests they could make to see that their instincts were not to defend the officer. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm glad that they were fired. I've heard mention in this thread that one of the officers has been arrested, which is great if true. I hope they're all brought to justice. Their actions (and lack thereof) were completely unconscionable.",
            "Not a local, am a fed. 5 years into the job. George Floyd was murdered and it\u2019s fucking disgusting. \n\nWe\u2019re trained that anything involving the neck is a no-go and is considered deadly force. \n\nWe were also trained that if you make an arrest in a prone position, you search and then immediately move them onto their side or a seated position because the risk of asphyxiation is so great. If a suspect says they can\u2019t breathe, believe them and take measures to correct to it. \n\nThis training is reinforced at least twice a year in our use of force training. These \u201cofficers\u201d deserve to spend the rest of their lives in prison.",
            "Retired after 28 years. Nothing less than murder.  All the guys I worked with would never have considered doing something like that.  You treat combative in-custodies once they\u2019re secured as human beings. Nothing should be personal.  Once they\u2019ve been subdued and you are safe as an officer, you stand him up, pat him down and understand that your arrestee is at a low point in his life.  Give him some dignity and you\u2019ll generally get his respect.  It works 90+% of the time.  \n\nThat man was subdued and nobody should have been on him at that point.",
            "I\u2019m a police officer in California. I am absolutely disgusted by the officers\u2019 actions. When someone is in our custody you must treat them properly. I don\u2019t care if they are arrested for murder or forgery. They are a human with a story and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. I had tears streaming down my face watching the video of George Floyd. We swore to protect our communities and that\u2019s what we set out to do everyday. Putting a knee into the neck of a handcuffed man for an extended period of time isn\u2019t protecting. \n\nA man has lost his life due to the gross negligence of an evil person. May he Rest In Peace.",

Maybe not premeditated murder, but nonetheless murder.\n\nI will be ANGRY if those officers do not get indicted.",

I pray for the George's family and that justice is served. \n\nThrowaway for obvious reasons and yes I'm a white male.\n\nEdit: Wasn't expecting this to blowup as it has. Im responding to you guys when I can and I'm glad we can have a conversation about this. \n\nWe do not unionize in my state for Law Enforcement, and I see many comments about systemic protection and abuse.

            "Since we\u2019re tapping into the police community here, can someone please explain what, if anything, the bystanders could have done to help George Floyd? Call 911 and report police brutality? In all seriousness, what is the preventative action here since none of the police officers on the scene (4 of which were physically restraining him) reacted to his being murdered right in front of them?\n\nEdit: thank you u/murderbymodem for this link [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct). I\u2019m adding it to my post because I think others will appreciate it and I don\u2019t want it to get lost.\n\nEdit: In summary, some of the options proposed are below. I apologize if I omitted, misrepresented, or oversimplified anything. *The bystanders in this case did many of these things and they were a voice for George when he couldn\u2019t speak for himself.*\n\n1. Always record the incident (live streaming if possible) and inform the police they are being recorded. \n\n2. Involve other authorities when applicable such as police supervisors, state police, 911 (ask for supervisor and an ambulance to report immediately), ACLU, FBI(?). Tell the officers on site that you are involving other authorities. \n\n3. Deescalation: back any crowd or bystanders away from the scene and officers (while still being able to record the incident). Have one person (preferably a white person) attempt to approach the officer(s) as a medical professional or voice of reason to explain that it appears that medical treatment may be required and remind the officer(s) that their best interests (career, family, reputation etc) are to act responsibly. \n\n4. Create a diversion/distraction that requires the officers to release the hold (not custody) of anyone in imminent medical danger. \n\n5. Physically remove the threat imposed by the officer(s) by force (this includes exercising your right to carry and discharge a gun). I think everyone agrees that this option will most likely result in physical (potentially fatal) and legal ramifications for the individual(s) involved unless the group of bystanders are organized enough and outnumber the officers on the scene to the extent that they can safely take control without further harm. \n\n6. Systemic change: Vote (local and national) for people that value human life and will implement change to protect it (this is not an anti-gun sentiment - if you value your right to carry a gun then vote for people that support that). Be vocal in demanding justice when these incidents occur. Push for improved training, hiring practices, and accountability within the police force. I would imagine that this may also include increasing pay for the police force to attract more suitable individuals into the positions. Possibly implement a citizen based governing body to oversee the police force and their actions.",
            "Serious question to the police officers participating in this discussion, obviously there are a myriad of factors that possibly contributed to this incident, from poor training, to an officer being unfit for duty, etc.\n\nMy question is, how is it possible that the three other officers on the scene took no steps to intervene, or at the very least, check on the status of the victim? Is there any reason for their lack of awareness or decision to stand aside while they, along with many other bystanders, can clearly see the man dying in front of them? What justification, if any, is possible in this situation?",
            "Ah, a post I can finally answer!\n\nBased in Scotland, I'm a Police Officer with 5 years service, 2 of which I have been a part-time Officer safety instructor.\n\nDuring this training we go over retraining subjects and handcuff techniques that we use to a T.  This includes all safety aspects including where to apply handcuffs, how tight they should be, ensuring the technique is done correctly and that the subject is in a controlled but safe position.\n\nPositional asphyxia is a VITAL topic we cover and it is reiterated time and time again that if a subject ends up on the ground we never, and I reiterate again, NEVER, place any sort of weight on them. \nHell even when sitting in the back of our cars, we watch them and ensure they can breath and are in a comfortable position for transport.\n\nWhat these cops did was just plain stupid, disproportionate and frankly an embarrassment to Policing.  I'd also use disgusting if I'm honest. \n\nI just hope that people know we are not like this.\n\nEDIT: This is my first comment and it has received more attention that I could have imagined, which I thank you all for!\n\nTo address some points raised in the replies.  I appreciate I work in a far different environment but we still have to restrain subjects while cuffed and at no point has it resulted in an incident like this or even an Officer in the position shown in the video.\n\nI absolutely condemn his actions and this should never have happened.  As for what was going on his head, I have no idea whether it be \"red mist\" or he thought something else.  Either way he should lose his job and face the full consequences of his action.\n\nUnfortunately some hate, as expected, in some replies which I understand.  However one officer cannot be held accountable for another, so again I hope people understand that this a small minority of the job and the rest are always there to help.  Stay safe folks.",

            "Former police officer here. \n\nIt's honestly scary that things like this happen. In the academy (training varies state by state) they teach you PPCT (pressure point control tactics? can't remember). PPCT are pretty much techniques you can use to subdue someone without actually harming them permanently (pain compliance). \n\nAnytime you perform a technique to incapacitate someone - you cuff the, sit them up  and make sure they are physically ok and have suffered no damage.\n\n\nOne of the things I learned in the academy (2016) is that training between the 1900's to now is vastly different. Back then it was minimal training (could be a couple days, two weeks, etc) and when I went through it was about 600+ hours. Last I heard it was 850+.\n\nPost mandates x amount of training (while employed) per year to maintain your post license. If you have a police officer from the 1980's (example number) that graduated with 100 hours of training, he doesn't get the same training that you get today. He gets to keep working with his 100 hours + yearly acquired amount of training required by post.\n\nThere's no reason for this to have happen. To clarify, any time a police has ended someone's life - (most, if not all) departments suspend them with pay and investigate to see if it was justified and if the officer is ok after the event.\n\nMy condolences goes out to Floyd and his family.",

            "Former correctional officer.\nOnce they are in cuffs, as long as they're not spitting, flailing about, or otherwise being extremely aggressive, that's a no go.\nEven if they are doing the aforementioned, that's still a no go. Yes, restrain them, but humanely. Sit them down or lay them on their side, but NEVER apply deadly force once they're in cuffs. Doesn't matter if the individual is yelling threats, slander, or being an asshat. Don't do it.\nThat's textbook. Ya just don't do it. \nWhen I was in training, we studied the Use Of Force Continuum like it was scripture. Everyday was a scenario. Everyday there were \"pop quizzes\". Every day, we talked about it, discussed it, and made sure we ALL knew what it meant, what it was, and the proper techniques. \nOnce they're in cuffs, that's it. No strikes, holds, or anything more than maintaining contact.\n\nCharge em all, lock em up, throw away the key. Charge the department for lack of training. Launch a 3rd party IA investigation into what happened, as well as into the IA department. Chances are, there's a fuck ton of corruption. Size of the force shouldn't matter when it comes to proper training. End of story. \nDisgrace.",
            "My uncle is a retired police officer, and I called him about this:\n\nHe said that it's horrible that people like this exist. It's has a negative impact on both the police community and the black community. It stirs up animosity between the two, and they end up not trusting. What if a person in the african american community needs to call the police, but don't trust them/fear them?\n\n Not all police officers are like this, many are great people, but the growing number of cases is alarming. Another problem is that because of police unions, officer who should face serious reprecussions, aren't.",
            "Deputy sheriff here. I was horrified and couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. There\u2019s an arrest technique to have your foot up against the shoulder/neck with your knee is across the top of their back, but never on the neck. That\u2019s just to gain control until you cuff. Having your knee on someone\u2019s neck makes no sense at all, especially for that long. My department always has refresher training on positional asphyxiation and excited delirium. This should have never happened. He\u2019s cuffed, get him in the car and be done with it. \n\nIt\u2019s the cops that pull crap like this that make the job harder and harder. They deserve everything they got coming to them. We have an obligation to to protect life and they all failed. Some cops seriously take the job too seriously and do stupid things. I just want to go to work, go home, and feed my family.",
            "I will chime in here. I agree with the retired officer.  Policing in communities where there often is legitimate reasons to not trust the police, well, it\u2019s hard. You do a lot to not get in over your head. You need to be fair and human! As far as police brutality. Good cops who want to stay good need to buck up and report bad behavior in their fellow officers. You know what matters more than my job or career, the responsibility to the public! Once I responded to a call of a black male being belligerent in public. Turns out the male was younger, drunk, and trying to gain entry to his own residence. Sure, if you want a stat you can maybe get disorderly conduct, but that is unnecessary. The truth and discretion dictated an easy fix here. Another alpha male type officer showed up. He begins to rile up the drunk male. He is being aggressive to the male for no reason. It was totally immature. I turn around and when I go back I see the male is in handcuffs and then I see the alpha male cop picking the black male up by his neck about a foot off the ground. By his throat! Neighbors are watching, everyone has a camera. But beyond this you must be fair and moral. This officer was an idiot. I had to report it and the officer was disciplined and eventually fired I believe. I was a young officer and was nervous. You know you can make enemies even when you are right. Well I would do that all again. Bad behavior is not to be accepted. It\u2019s one reason I\u2019m not in policing now.",
            "At what point do citizens become empowered to do the right thing? As I watched this video, I got filled with so much hate. Not just for the officer with the knee on this throat, but also for the cop standing there doing nothing. Being a decent human being and tell your partner to chill the fuck out. Not only for the reason that we are being recorded, but because it's the right thing to do. \n\nGoing back to the empowered citizens. As I watched I just felt like someone should've done something. And not just something stupid, but as one human to another, the right thing. His death could've been avoided. And I know that if someone would've done something they too would've been arrested or worse for \"interfering with a police investigation\" that's their fuckin cop out. Pun not intended.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my comment and for replying. I did think about what most of you said before posting, but man with that video evidence, I\u2019m sure 30 days probation or something not as drastic would\u2019ve been the result and maybe a human life would\u2019ve been saved. Or it would have been much worse.",
            "I worked as an intern at a state police intelligence operations center. There was always TV's with the news on. I particularly remember when that UPS driver was caught in the crossfire of a needless firefight with police officers and runaways on the highway. Even in an instance like that the cops I worked with said the same old tropes, \"what happened before this.\" And \"the media only covers the bad stuff that happens with cops what about black on black crime.\" All the garbage you always hear after this happen right from the mouth of the horse in their state HQ. So to all the \"cops of reddit\" I see on this thread that are saying this is shameful and whenever it happens y'all are ashamed and find it disgusting. Then hold each other accountable because in the police HQ I worked at the culture that allows these things to happen was readily apparent. The experience I had at that internship made me drop any notion of a career in Intel and law enforcement because the culture was based on victimization of cops and racism. Do better.",
            "Those cops should be buried under the jail. I condemn all 4 of those officers actions and hope they get what they deserve.",
            "I am in Law Enforcement and I have yet to meet an officer that didn\u2019t cringe and wonder what the actual fuck was happening. Everyone I know in the law enforcement community not only feels terrible for this man and his family, but also feels discouraged and disheartened by how much fuel this adds to an already difficult to control fire of distrust in the community. There are officers that work day in and day out to try and fix the image and perception of policing because they care. These heinous abuses of power make their jobs harder. It\u2019s impossible to heal a wound that keeps getting ripped open. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take Law Enforcement training to know and understand that when you apply pressure to someone\u2019s neck, you\u2019re blocking off blood to their brain and air to their lungs. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a case of bad training. This was a case of lack of basic humanity.",
            "If I did this shit in Iraq I would have gone to Leavenworth\n\nThink about that",
            "Not a Peace Officer, but I work in a jail, for an SO in a different state. I\u2019m outraged. Not only at the dipshit who used a technique that even jailers are explicitly taught never to do, but also at the jackass who stood there and did nothing. We have a very strict Tap-Out Rule, when engaged in a Use of Force so that if you see someone losing control, or just blatantly disregarding training/SOP, you should tap them out of the situation. This didn\u2019t happen. He didn\u2019t even try. Neither did the other 2 who the video doesn\u2019t show. I really hope he gets charged and convicted. 2nd degree murder for Chauvin, misconduct of a public officer at a minimum for all 4, and the other 3 who\u2019s names I do not know should get whatever the accessory to murder equivalent is in MN. The accessory charges may not stick, but the charges should be filed as a statement\n\nI also think that the 3 Officers not stepping up points to an agency issue that needs to be addressed. In this job you should never feel that you can\u2019t voice a concern to a superior/more veteran officer/anyone. Administrative concerns have a method. Life saftey concerns should not. The Chief is fairly new, but is a long time MPD Officer and may not be able to fix the problem.",
            "Alternatively: cops of Reddit, when you see your colleagues and brothers in blue doing heinous shit, what do you do to intervene and take a stand, to get rid of the so-called bad apples?",
            "This may get buried by all the comments by non-police officers, but I am a US police officer in a decent-sized city (population of about 500,000).  I am proud of my career and my department. I think my department is lucky to have pretty strong support in our community. Support comes from trust that when a citizen has to come in contact with the police in some way, they will be treated with respect. \n\nRegardless of what kind of training those officers had or lacked, no one with common sense or good intentions would kneel on someone\u2019s neck, especially after they\u2019d been handcuffed, while they stated multiple times that they couldn\u2019t breathe. At no point in the academy was I taught that knee-to-the-neck was an appropriate hold for a suspect. In fact, I WAS taught about positional asphyxiation. And that a \u201cchoke hold\u201d or carotid restraint that cuts off circulation to the brain is deadly force. \n\nWhen a combative suspect is handcuffed and is no longer able to hurt you, you sit them up and call for medical if they were injured during the arrest. I have made and assisted with many, many arrests and nothing I saw in the George Floyd video is normal. I can\u2019t even fathom what that officer was thinking. \n\nAs far as the officers standing by, helping to hold Mr. Floyd down, and failing to intervene when he says he can\u2019t breathe... unacceptable. My department\u2019s policy says that officers shall intervene if they are witnessing a fellow officer using excessive force. Regardless of whether the officer using excessive force is a 30 year vet and the witness is a rookie. If it\u2019s a sergeant and the witness is his/her subordinate. These are people\u2019s lives at stake and police officers have too much power if we aren\u2019t willing to police each other. \n\nI rarely make judgments on fellow officers without knowing the whole story, but the video of George Floyd\u2019s arrest is enough. Mr. Floyd was murdered and those officers had every opportunity to change the outcome of that situation. They are not worthy of their badge. I\u2019m relieved that their department was decisive enough to immediately fire them and I fully expect they will be prosecuted. \n\nI\u2019ve seen many people commenting, \u201cWhy don\u2019t police officers speak up?\u201d and \u201cWhy do the police continue to participate in this corruption?\u201d We aren\u2019t \u2018participating\u2019. If we stop showing up to work and doing our jobs, violence and crime will rule. I haven\u2019t talked to a single officer who isn\u2019t disgusted by what happened in Minneapolis. I\u2019m incredibly angry because the actions of those cops put a target on every other cop\u2019s back - good cops who would never, ever do something like that. The law enforcement community as a whole is in agreement that George Floyd\u2019s death was completely unacceptable and unnecessary. \n\nIf anyone bothered to read this, please don\u2019t condemn all police because of the actions of those few. There\u2019s no excuse for it, but the vast majority of police officers are truly good people. And... rioting to the point that property is destroyed and people get hurt doesn\u2019t help anything."

For those of you who honestly dont think that you can buy good cookware for under $100 dollars I encourage you to temper your expectations of what \"good\" is and check out amazon right now. If you want a full blown set of decent pots and pans there is a ceramic set for around $85 dollars right now. Ceramic cookware is what I started learning to cook on.  Its not perfect but it's a lot better than any teflon or imitation teflon crap out there. If you prefer iron like I do, lodge is a great company and they have a 10 inch iron skillet on sale for $15 dollars right now. Pair that with a decent chef's knife from Mercer $45 (the brand I am currently using) then throw in a dutch oven (looks like you can get one from lodge for 40 dollars and it has a decent rating.) And you're good to go. Those three tools will last for life if taken care of and you can make so much with them. A shepherd's pie, pizza, fresh bread, soups and stews, stir fry..... I mean almost anything.  Pro tip, even if it says preseasoned, look up how to season it anyway. And never use soap on your iron.  Scrub it in the sink under hot water, heat it up on the stove to get the moisture off fast, when it cools off rub it down with any old cooking oils. Just a thin layer with a paper towel will do.",

A tub lasts 6+ months, so the cost/shave isn\u2019t crazy. \n\nA brush: these go from $10 to like a grand if you\u2019re into that. Mine was about $25 and seems to do the trick. The nicer ones have longer, softer bristles, but some prefer coarser bristles to exfoliate a bit. I\u2019m not sure that they really do much good there, but at any rate you can find a perfectly acceptable brush for $25 or so. \n\nAnd the kicker: a shaving scuttle, so you get a warm lather. \n\nIf you shop a bit that\u2019s under $100. Turns shaving from a chore into a really enjoyable part of the old morning routine.

            "I once was working at a Renaissance Festival in South Florida. I was just barely 21- had gone down there for the winter to help out a musician friend, and was living a very frugal lifestyle. I don't think I even had a debit card at that point, and my cell phone was pay-per-text at like $.10 a message. \n\nSo anyway- I would totally get paid for booth-sitting for some artists after the weekend- but by Friday, I was pretty broke. I had about $7 in gold dollar coins- because that's what I liked to keep on me at faire to give out as change. I had the remains of the $20 I'd taken in coins, and other than that, I didnt have any other cash. \n\nWe had a kid's day at faire- where schools bring kids on school trips, and so I needed to grab some food and get back to Deerfield Beach Park. So fully dressed in Renaissance garb, I ran into the Taco Bell.  I figured my cash would go the farthest there.  I ordered my food, and when I went to pay, the girl behind the counter LAUGHS and goes; \n\n\"Uh- no. I need REAL money.\" \n\nI looked at her, confused. \"These ARE real money, they are gold Sacajawea dollars...\" \n\n\"Yeah, we only take US cash here. I need actual money to pay for the food.\" \n\nNow the line behind me is getting antsy- but the girl at the register is getting really bitchy and I'm like - what the fuck do you do when a business WONT take your payment. It wasn't like I was trying to pay in nickels. I had $4.-- worth of food and tried giving her $5 in coins. \n\nI'm like, \"This is all I've got on me... I don't know what to tell you- but it IS legal US tender- see right here?\" And I'm trying to show her the coins- and shes yelling like im trying to pay her in monopoly money. \n\nThe guy behind me was like \"yeah, those are real coins\"- but I don't think he wanted her ire turned towards him- so he wasn't very forceful. I asked if she could get a manager and she was like, \"I ain't gonna waste his time with this bullshit. You either pay in real money, or leave\" and she's grabbed my bag of food so I can't go anywhere. \n\nI take out my wallet- remembering the two lucky $2 bills I had carried for YEARS- folded up in the back pocket. I unfolded those- and she takes one look at the $2 bills... And I'm sure you can predict what happened. She BLEW UP. \n\nNext thing I know- she's screaming for the staff to call the cops and telling ME not to go anywhere because I'm trying to rip her off and pass off all this \"fake money\" and she \"gon see my ass to jail!\" - meanwhile, I'm hungry, tired, and now very very irritated- and that's when a cop car pulls up. \n\nThey weren't responding to the call- I don't even know if the store HAD called. I was ready to walk out, nearly in tears - when the two cops come in and all eyes turn to them. There's about ten people now in line behind me- and everyone turns to look at the cops who very clearly have a \"wtf is going on- I just stopped to get food\" look on thier faces. \n\nThat's when the obnoxious register girl, and two co-workers she called over- start waving my money around (that was the best part- she took my money and was refusing to give it back OR to give me my food)- and the cops go to the counter to figure out what she's freaking out over. At this point, the manager heard the commotion and joins the two guys and the register girl. The three teenager employees are all going on and on about \"the girl in the costume trying to give them fake money tryna rip them off\"- and the cops VERY quickly put an end to that. \n\nThe one cop holds up the two $2 bills, and my gold dollar coins- and he tells the staff that BOTH are- indeed- actual REAL money. The girl is still protesting- saying\"yeah but it's not America money and we only take America money.\"- when the manager finally realized what happened and apologized- telling the teenagers - who look to be completely in disbelief - that yes, the coins AND bills are BOTH really, United States money. \n\nThe manager offers to personally remake my meal- and the cops as well - apologizing for everything. I'm REALLY late at this point, and I didn't really trust them to make my food, even if the manager was being really nice- but the cop said\"I tell you what- I'll come back and get your info while you make our food. How about that?\" - so he accompanied the manager back white he washed his hands and made our food. \n\nThe other cop gave me my money back, and took my info. As I was FINALLY leaving with my food- the guy behind me jokes with the cop \"I think I'm going to pay with a handful of half-dollars I've got in my car. What do you think?\" \n\nI was SO floored that anyone could be SO ignorant... And not just ignorant, but completely and utterly unwilling to realize or to recognize that they had made a mistake and were wrong. All she did was double down- insisting we were ALL wrong and I was just a thief. \n\nSO FRUSTRATING!",

For context, the prices at this place were a bit higher during the weekend because that was when they would pull out the bigger stuff, like prime rib. They ask for two dinners and two drinks, so I punch them into the register, and tell them the price - after tax, maybe $35US or so. They look a little apprehensive at the price, and ask if they can think about it. Well, there was no one else in the line waiting to eat in, so I say \"Sure! Just let me get this gentleman's to go order while you do.\" They're fine with it.\n\nSo I ring in the guy's to go order, and since the to go prices were determined by weight, if you got a reasonable amount of food for a human being getting to go was usually cheaper than dining in.

A while later, not exactly sure how much later off of the top of my head, they come back with like 5 or 6 fucking containers of food. All to go. I get them rung in and the price is at least $15-$20US more than if they had just paid and eaten in, and they came back the next day to get MORE. They paid at least $15US more every time they came in than they would if they had just eaten in and paid that fucking price for all the food! They really should've done some damn math.",
            "Here's my story. I apologize for the length, but it's worth it. Trust me...\n\nYears ago, I had to apply for some kind of government program. Can't remember what. Probably something to do with my kids' health insurance. But that's immaterial.\n\nI had just closed the doors on a dismally failed business, which was why I was applying for the program. They had me fax all of my earnings and bookkeeping paperwork... most of which had zeroes or negative numbers on them. The person on the phone was looking at the papers I faxed them the day before.\n\nFinally, the guy said, \"Sir, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you to our financial expert.\" He used that word...\"Financial Expert.\" (Remember that. It's important.)\n\nAfter a brief 40-or-so minutes on hold, I was talking to the \"Financial Expert.\" We went back and forth for a while and she was obviously confused AF. (My paperwork was as simple and basic as you can imagine, mind you. Like first-lesson-in-high-school-accounting simple) She sighed with frustration. Oh, really? YOU'RE frustrated, bitch?\n\nHere it comes:\n\nAfter 20 minutes or so, she asks me, \"What does 'Sooo' mean?\"\n\nI gets confused. I look everywhere. The word \"Sooo\" is nowhere on the papers. I say, \"Ma'am, you're looking at an exact copy of the papers I'm holding in front of me. The word 'Sooo' isn't on any of these pages.\"\n\nWell, to make a long story slightly less long, it took me another 10 minutes or so to realize that she, a supposed government agency \"FINANCIAL EXPERT,\" was mistaking the numeric designation for no money --- \"$0.00\" --- for the word \"Sooo.\"\n\nA Financial fucking Expert... didn't... know... what \"$0.00\"... meant. Financial expert.\n\nThat was the moment I realized that George Carlin was being generous when he said, \"Picture how stupid the average person is, then realize that half of them are even stupider than that.\"",

However, the (r)evolution was somewhat organic, and even though we experienced an economic downturn, the future looked bright.\n\nThe 10s were plastic. We let a reality TV show host become president. We realized the dystopian future that we read about in books and saw in movies. The boundaries of what is real have been stretched and shattered. The rich are living in a separate reality in their high rises and the poor are killing each other in the streets.

Hipsters and smart phones and gaming systems and trends and Facebook and Instagram, etc, etc. Millennials had the biggest cultural impact of this decade. \n\n* Obama/Trump. Obama was elected last decade, but most of his term was this decade. He got Bin Laden, passed healthcare, and triggered a whole bunch of people just because he was Black. Then Trump really popped up in 2015 for his presidential run (was it really that long ago?) and he's been at the forefront of news ever since. \n\n* Superhero everything. 20 MCU movies have been released this decade. Then there are the other Spider-Man movies, the DC universe movies (Nolan's and Snyder's), as well as countless other movies and shows. Last decade was zombies, this decade is superheroes.",

I am so lucky to have a good support system and I am okay.  I am safe.  I have thoughts but never plans because I do absolutely know my value.  I just wish people gave more credit to the mental health side of this experience; I value so greatly our responsibility to stop the spread, to stay home, to mask but I also want people to know it\u2019s okay to struggle through it, we aren\u2019t alone in it even when it feels lonely.",

            "Sorry for the long post, but here it goes:\n\n(Corrected spelling and added some new links and name for latest Tracktion version)\n\n[vstplanet.com](https://vstplanet.com) and [vst4free.com](https://vst4free.com) if you want to get loads of awesome Virtual Studio Technology instruments and effects. Also has lots of other downloads for freeware Digital Audio Workstations, Trackers, Editors, and other tools.\n\nTo make some great drum sounds, there is Stomper Hyperion (get the zip file version) [https://www.lysator.liu.se/\\~zap/stomper/stomper.zip](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~zap/stomper/stomper.zip) and Drumsynth:  [http://mda.smartelectronix.com/drumsynth.htm](http://mda.smartelectronix.com/drumsynth.htm)  though if you want to use Drumsynth on Windows 7 or Windows 10+, use the Oracle VM Virtualbox. There's a Windows XP virtual machine you can download and use to run Drumsynth properly. Make sure you use one of the older ones if you have a lower-end Windows 7 or 10+ machine or you won't be able to disable certain features that require something your graphics card just doesn't have.\n\nHere's the link for Oracle VM Virtualbox:  [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  \\- It might seem intimidating at first but it is pretty easy to set up. Here are some instructions:  [https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/how-to-set-up-a-windows-xp-virtual-machine-for-free/](https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/how-to-set-up-a-windows-xp-virtual-machine-for-free/)  which include a download link for a virtual Windows XP: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002)\n\nAnd for some awesome free DAWs, you can get the Buzz tracker, Psycle tracker, Linux Multimedia Studio, Cakewalk, and Tracktion. Tracktion Free is basically just an old version that the creators have decided to make freely available. They can all host VST Plugins, and most have their own native plugin instruments and effects. The trackers Buzz and Psycle can be a bit tricky if you are starting out, but a lot of fun once you know how to use them. Others that I like include Darkwave Studio (since it stopped using the OpenCandy installer) and OpenMPT (Modplug Tracker). They also are VST hosts.\n\nEdit: Traction is apparently now called Waveform. Kind of confusing but still great interface - especially for something you can get free.\n\nIf you want a simple recording software, look for Audacity of course, but there are other multitracks you can download that might be better. Also look up \"The Sonic Spot\" on google on the wayback machine. It's a long-defunct music software download site, but it still has working links if you can find it. Great place to look for great stuff. If you have a taste for oldschool mixing programs, look in the internet archive for Tuareg, Tunafish, and Moonfish. Used Tuareg a lot back in the late 90's and early 2000s.\n\nA few extra links:\n\nSampleradar:  [https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download) a website with loops and one-shot samples you can download and use for free. No need to pay royalties - just don't reupload them to your site or try to sell them in a sample set and you'll be fine.\n\n2,000 Free Soundfonds:  [https://hiphopmakers.com/over-2000-free-soundfonts-free-soundfont-player](https://hiphopmakers.com/over-2000-free-soundfonts-free-soundfont-player)  it has links to a lot of useful websites for soundfonts and for soundfont (sf2) players.\n\nPolyphone Soundfont Editor:  [https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/)  make your own sf2 files\n\nMod Archive Downloads:  [https://modarchive.org/index.php?faq-torrents-current](https://modarchive.org/index.php?faq-torrents-current) Lots of song files and the TMA Waveworld collection - filled with drum and other instrument one-shots. Kiarchive Woolyss chiptune samples are also worth a look.\n\nDrawing and Painting:\n\nFor those who want to get into art and are tired of GIMP (which to be honest doesn't respond well to the mouse but is a good photoediting software) I would recommend Artrage and Medibang Pro. Both are free, and last time I checked you can get everything you need with the free version of the Medibang Pro tablet app. (About all you're paying for is more palettes, which you may not really need). They are very responsive to mouse and stylus movement, and both have options to allow you to draw smoother lineart. Pixia and Pierha aren't too bad either, and there is also the old version of openCanvas.\n\nOldschool artists will probably like Flying Colors and Deluxe Paint 2. Flying Colors is an old Windows 95 256 colour program while Deluxe Paint 2 is a Dos program so you will need DOSBox.\n\nFor vector pics, Inkscape is probably your best bet right now. It's not the best vector editor around, but it's free and you can make some very good pictures with it. Heck, if you are skilled enough, you can make professional-quality pictures in MSPaint.",

            "MIT open courseware. (Only have experience with their Math classes.) It's better than taking the classes from your university professor. \n\nI am good at math, but I struggled in the university setting. I found myself learning all the material 2 weeks late. The lectures were to a class of 150-300 people, and their was almost always a language barrier preventing me from fully grasping the content until AFTER the test. When I was having difficulty in Calc III due to my heavily accented Russian professor who was only teaching the class because he had a minimum quota of classes to teach each year to stay employed for his research in number theory, my Teaching assistant helped a bit, but not enough.\n\nI found MIT open courseware, and although the teacher had a minor German accent, he wanted to teach. It made a world of difference, and if I missed anything, I could rewind 20 seconds and hear it again. Most importantly, these teachers are absolutely amazing at giving you what you need. The MIT staff are not there because they are super smart, (although they might also be that) but instead because they are the best teachers. I'm convinced anyone who wants to learn can from them.\n\nAfter that successful turning around of a grade, I used it again for Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. I Aced (100%) both finals for diffEQ and Linear algebra, despite being a C student for most of the semesters in the classes. My only regret is not watching each lecture during the semester, instead of all in a row before the Finals.\n\nTL;DR: you are almost better off watching the MIT open courseware lectures with headphones on a laptop while attending your math classes at a large University than paying attention to your professors.",

            "After the events of the seventh book, as part of therapy, Harry became proficient at bridge, the Muggle card game. He attended several tournaments wearing hats to hide his scar, but no one really cared. He would rent a hotel room for whole weekends. Ginny understood it was something Harry needed for himself, and the understanding was that there was to be no communication between them during his \"bridge-cations\".\n\nHe met an older woman at a tournament in Leeds and had a one night-stand with her. She ended up pregnant, which was a surprise for both of them. He brewed her an abortion potion but she refused to take it, promising Harry the baby would never interfere with his Wizard life. She ended up losing the child to a miscarriage in the third trimester. She never told Harry, or spoke to him ever again.  \n\n\nAfter the stress of the pregnancy, Harry never played competitive bridge again, but he'd get a Muggle paper delivered to his house in order to read the bridge column. Ginny saw him crying to himself one morning and desperately wanted to ask, but the rift between them was already unspeakably wide and she had secrets of her own.",

            "For some reason or another, my mother hated me. As a little girl I could never understand why she treated me so much worse than my 3 other siblings, and I would often go up to my Grandmother and ask her \"Why doesn't my momma love me?\" She never could give me a straight answer and would tell me \"Your momma loves you in the only way she knows how...\". That answer confused me because she loved my siblings just fine (Disclaimer: Her love was toxic AF, and she did a different type of damage to my other siblings.). \n\nNow when I say that my mother treated me badly, it started out with her picking fights with me. She would constantly nitpick at everything I  did, chastising me, and at the end of the day punishing me harshly for something that could have been a gentle scolding. When I got older, she started cussing at me, and calling me names. She would often ignore me for days on end, and when she would talk to me it would be to make me the butt end of a bad joke, or to tell me she hated me. \n\nYes, my mother looked me dead in my eyes and told me she hated me (Disclaimer #2: She was a drug addict and alcoholic, and she loves to claim all the emotional abuse she put me though as a child was the effects of the drugs, and it \"wasn't even that bad\"). It was things like that that really began to tear at me after awhile. All sorts of terrible things she did to me growing up, the terrible things she said, and how she ignored me constantly... All of it very different than how she treated my other three siblings.\n\nShe was very close with one of my brothers and my sister. She would spend time with them constantly, take them anywhere, buy them anything that they wanted and it made me resent them. My sister would sometimes rub it in my face that \"Mom loved her more\". It was her way of having power over me, and it was one of the things that made my rage bubble over on innocent people.\n\nI just wanted to be loved and accepted, I wanted to be cared for and cherished as a child should be, and when I didn't get that, I plotted on how I was going to get her love and affection. In my screwed up mind, I thought that if I got rid of my older brother and younger sister... I would be one of the only people left for her to love. \n\nI planned on killing my brother. How screwed up is that? It wasn't just some thought that passed through my head; it was a constant idea, a plan that I was putting into place to end his life so that I could make room in my mother's heart for me.\n\nI feel ashamed writing it out. It was a dark time in my life, and I was also incredibly mentally ill. \n\nMy brother was addicted to pain medications, and my parents were trying desperately to get him clean at the time. Ironically, at the same time he was going on a drug induced rampage, my sister had shattered her leg on a trampoline. She was on some pretty heavy pain pills, and while my mother was doing everything in her power to keep my brother away from the drugs, she would leave my sister (and her drugs) in my care. So one day, while my mother was out dealing with my brother and my sister was sleeping, I took the rest of her pills (my sister was super afraid of becoming addicted to drugs after watching what my mother and brother were going through, so there was a ton left) and I waited for my brother to come back. \n\nWhen I heard him come through his window (His room was next to mine) I went into the kitchen and made him a glass of juice. Earlier in the day I had crushed up the pills into a powder, and I mixed them into the juice. I went up to his room, knocked on the door, and offered him the cocktail of various prescription drugs. He took the juice, and right before he was about to drink it I had  thought.\n\n\"How could I do this to my own brother?\" \n\nI snatched the drink back, and it spilled all over the carpet. He was high and super pissed, but at least he was alive. \n\nI never tried anything like that again. It felt so sick, wrong, evil... I mean, what type of person thinks about killing their brother?  Besides, my brother dying wouldn't make my mother love me any more, she would have just resented me for living instead of him.\n\nSo thats' the sad, sick story of how I almost executed my brother. I didn't actually carry through with it, obviously, and I guess everyone lived happily ever after. My brother got clean and now has a happy family, I'm in college, my sisters leg healed up nicely, and my mom left us after awhile... (But thats' a story for another time).",
            "I have two sisters. One older, and one younger. My mom worked hard to make sure each of us felt special and loved. My dad? Not so much. He called my older sister *Princess* and my little sister was referred to as *Little Buddy*. For whatever reason, I got kind of forgotten about. I didn't mind most of the time. I found my dad annoying, demanding, and at times unreasonable. I hated the way he bullied my mom and would lash out about things that didn't make sense. Basically, I thought of my dad at a total brat. He'd have a bad day at work, and would find someone to take it out on. Usually, my mom and I. But I still tried. I'd try to cuddle up with him, feeling hurt when he'd shrug me off and tell me I need to shower. I made gifts for him. Got good grades, won poetry contests. Won awards through bible quiz. Never argued. But it never seemed to work. Before long, he'd find something to yell at me about. Things that usually didn't make sense. If my little sister and I fought, the whole thing was my fault. My feet turn in. I hated when my dad would come to my sporting events, because seeing me run with inturned feet seemed to be humiliating for him. One time I was running from one base to another, feeling exhilaration because *I'd done it*. *I'd hit a home run*. The smile died on my face when I heard my dad yell, \"Run with your feet straight! You look stupid!\"\n\nAs a teen, my mom really stepped up and started insisting that he was going to leave me alone. He was never physically abusive, but the way he talked to you made you feel like he was trying to say something that would break you. \n\nWhen I was 15, he was almost successful. I went through a couple of really bad months. A friend died, my dog died, we moved, and my mental health was tanking. A week after my friend died (car accident), my dad asked, \"So when are you going to get over it?\" It took me by surprise, because at that time, I wasn't crying or acting out. I was just sitting there, eating dinner with the family. My mom immediately reacted, gasping out a surprised, \"John!\" and the two of them began fighting again, over my dad's need to mess with me. I sat there, head down on the table, thinking, *I'm not allowed to be sad. I'm not allowed to feel happy. I can't get mad. I'm in pain, and he finds it annoying. Just leave me alone, dad. Leave me alone.*\n\nThat's when it clicked: my dad, for whatever reason, seemed to hate me. I could try to make him like me, but it wasn't going to work. As I got older, my goal became to avoid him, his seemed to be to forge a relationship with me with the sole purpose of having a target for his need to bully. We were never going to have a healthy father-daughter relationship\n\nThat's when it clicked: it's not me, it's him. My sisters could like and love him, but I didn't need to respect him. I was done trying to please him, trying to do the right things, trying to be the daughter that my dad seemed to want.\n\nFast forward almost ten years later. After the birth of my son, my dad had tried to begin a new relationship with me, because for whatever reason, he latched on to my kid. For the sake of my kid, I let my dad have a relationship with him, but I was always monitoring, waiting for my son to develop a personality that would change the way my dad saw him. There was no way I was going to let my dad do to my son what he did to me. \n\nFortunately, my dad died before the change could happen. I sat in the back at his funeral, dry eyed and satisfied. Of course my sisters were upset. They had good relationships. But for me and my mom, it kind of felt like the wicked witch was at long last dead. No more stress. No more unreasonable expectations. The egg shells we'd been walking on were swept away, and we could be content. \n\nI have an uncle in West Virginia that I started to see as my father-figure. At first, I jokingly would call him dad, testing the waters, waiting for him to remind me that he actually has kids, and doesn't need an adopted daughter. I go see him once a year. But I always felt like maybe, he sees my need to see him as a dad to be annoying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I asked him if he was coming up for Christmas. He said he couldn't. \n\nBut then he said, \"I love you, my daughter.\"\n\nSorry this was so long. I guess I needed to get that out.",

            "I didn't grow up with the best family. There was a long period of time where there was constant fighting, and things often went too far. I didn't feel safe in many different ways.\n\nIt all culminated to a point when I was 17, disowned, and about to get kicked out. But, my vindictive, defensive actions in the past made my mother know that kicking me out wasn't a good idea. I know the only reason I could have a roof over my head was becuase my mom isn't a citizen, and she knews I would have reported her for the crime of child abuse (which did happen) which would have put her residency in jeopardy.\n\nSo, I guess I had to threaten to burn the village in order to feel the warmth of safety.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are assuming my mother is illegal, but she's not. I'm not exactly sure the mechanism through which she can stay in the United States, but she married my dad (American) and they got divorced. She can live and work here but she doesn't have the full protection of the government like me.",
            "When I was a teenager living in rural Alabama, I did nooooot get along with my stepmother. She went out of her way to be as mean as she could to me.\n\nOnce when she left the house, she took the mouse for the family computer with her so I couldn't use it while she was gone. Well...I did her one better by taking a cord from the back, then locking myself in my bedroom until she got home.\n\nShe uses my little baby stepsister against me and tells her to tell me she has a present for me. \n\nAs soon as I unlocked the door, stepmother yanks it out of my hand and starts screaming at me about why the computer won't work.\n\nWell, let me tell you, on both sides of me I had a steel pole lying against the wall and a simple glass of water.\n\nI briefly entertained the notion of smashing her in the face with the pole. And instead just chucked the harmless water in her face.\n\nWhooo...I'm quite sure I avoided jail that night.",
            "I had a coworker at a non-commission based retail job where a coworker would repeatedly sabotage my sales so she could get a lot of credit apps and a high gsp (avg hr sales). She would overhear my pitch for cards (required) and then lie to the customer so they would apply. I would have to try and rectify what she said while she hovered over me. She did many other questionable things, and I reported her multiple times, as did my coworkers (and customers).\n\nNow, one time i got lucky and an 18 yo kid came in yo buy the most expensive desktop we have on display. 2.5k. she saw me do this sale, but i needed a manager to approve a tiny discount, but my radio was dead. Coworker was watching me the entire time, so i asked if she'd call for the mgr. She stone cold ignores me. I go for the mgr, she prints out paperwork on the computer and tries to sell it to him. When i return, she literally yells at me in front of the customer to give her the sale bc she worked too. I ignored her & didn't give her the sale.\n\nWhen i reported this (as did the customer, he was mortified), i was literally told by my boss \"ignore when she does that. She's a middle child, so she does stuff like that\" \n\nI was tired of the stupid lack of action, so i filed an HR complaint regarding her......and five of my managers for not addressing it. They all got reamed for it. Only one is still in a management position, the rest were eventually demoted or laid off.",

            "When I had been bullied constantly in seventh grade by three different kids/groups of kids and the school showed so little interest in helping me. I was physically bullied, verbally mocked, humiliated in front of the other kids, and not an eye was batted. When I finally took my mom's advice to make a scene the next time someone started throwing things at me, I did it. We were outside that day for P.E. and while we were all sitting in lines at the start of class a kid in the line next to me started throwing pebbles at me. I ignored it for a moment, then when he kept going I yelled at him to stop. I didn't care that people were staring, I wanted them to. I wanted them to see that this average-height, able-bodied boy was throwing things at me, a very small and disabled girl. The teacher came over and asked what happened. Kid told him they were only pebbles, he wasn't hurting me. The teacher agreed with him and told me if I ever disrupted his class like that again I was getting detention.\n\nI don't know what it is about some teachers but the second they get put in charge of more than one child they become absolutely blind to any kind of bullying, and if it gets pointed out to them, they think that particular incident exists in a vacuum and couldn't possibly be a sign of anything worse. I was 11 years old and suicidal because I felt so incredibly powerless. That teacher only solidified that feeling.",

He told me how worthless I was and that he would be doing me a favor by killing me. I didn't respond. I didn't move. I just waited for him to pull the trigger.\n\nHe didn't. He left my room and left the revolver on my dresser as he walked out. I took the revolver and went out. I walked around my hometown, sat by the river and thought about all the ways I could get back at him for all the misery he caused my mother, sister, and I.\n\nI also considered doing the ol' Kurt Cobain but that's not relevant.\n\nI took the weapon apart and threw it's pieces in the river. No one's asked me about the gun since. It's probably still there.\n\n\nEdit: holy shit, that blew up. Thanks for all the upvotes and awards, everyone!",
            "Dumped at the doorstep of a youth shelter after my mum was hospitalized and dad was in prison. I wasn't a super bright teenager, but had enough sense to spend my last $20 on pepper spray and padlocks for my stuff. Predictably, people's stuff went 'missing' all the time. \n\nI could write an essay on the issues in the public welfare system, ranging from the macro level (lack of funding) to the micro level (incompetent or burnt out staff). There was violence, substance use, and sexual assault in crisis accommodation, but what bothers me ten years later is the sheer *stupidity* of some adults who are meant to guide at-risk teenagers. I would ask my social worker questions like, are there places which can help me with food this week? How do I write a resume? And that social worker would vaguely shrug and offer relaxation techniques and mindfulness strategies. Look, three people got arrested at this shelter last week, no amount of 'relaxation techniques' are going to calm me down. \n\nI'm guilty of doing stupid and irresponsible things as a teenager, but eventually finished high school and then 3 university degrees. I actually work for the same system that I was and am disappointed in, and there are so many practical resources available. They're underutilized because staff don't even know they're out there. If I had just a single adult to help me with the most simple tasks as a kid, it would have been so much easier. When you're a kid you just don't know how university loan applications, taxes, budgeting, etc works. Or at least I didn't. And everybody assumes that you do, because *they* do. Like I had no idea that in my country, the Department of Housing can pay for your rental bond. I stayed in a homeless shelter for an extra 1-2 months to save up $900 to pay for the bond of a shitty apartment. Extra months of broken sleep, men trying to pick the lock to my door, residents hyped up on ice. \n\nLast year there was a 16 year old girl on the train, having a meltdown and making a public scene. She was clearly drunk and people were avoiding her. She started screaming that she missed her period and does anybody want to pay for her termination. She phrased it as a joke or a way to get money (which I did not give). But I guess she repeated it enough that I wondered if it was true. We got to talking and I referred her to a social service, downloaded a list of resources in her catchment area, and saved links and forms on her phone about how to arrange her own healthcare cards since she's over 15, so that she can visit a bulk-billing GP on her own and get tested. In my country, the pee test from a pharmacy is about $15 but a pregnancy blood test ordered by your GP is free. We discussed different options that her GP might outline and other things that might be helpful. \n\nI know as well as anyone else that it's not always that straight-forward - especially with 30 patients in your caseload and juggling them with a million other priorities. But in the biopsychosocial framework of health - where biological, psychological, and social factors are proposed to impact physical and mental health - we severely underestimate the impact of social circumstances. We let these kids down all the time, and it's preventable.",

There were many of us that existed on the outskirts, working so hard just to see the same few people get all the opportunities, even as far as being cast in lead roles after they graduated.\n\nAs I struggled with depression, anxiety, and undiagnosed ADHD, I worked tirelessly to keep up with my peers only to be told I needed to apply myself more. I saw people put in half the work some of us did and end up with higher grades. One professor actually gave arbitrary grades to the 4+hours of homework he assigned based on page counts and who he thought \"deserved a higher grade\".\n\nI tried so hard to get no support in return that I became incredibly suicidal and had to take a semester off to deal with my mental health. It only took two more years and another medical break before I finally was able to graduate.",

            "Dig in for a different kind of story than most in this thread. It's not about me, it's about someone I used to know.\n\n_______________\n\nGrowing up, I was part of a huge diverse friend group. People from different schools, different small towns. All walks of life. Something I feel really fortunate for. One of these guys, let's call him Big Bob, was part of our group for years and years. He came from a tough family, never had any money, but honestly, he brought the \"energy\" to the party. One of those guys. Always talking, bombastic, good with jokes and memes and references. So collectively, those of us who had the means found a way to help him along since we did enjoy his company. And this worked for YEARS. We'd drive him home, help sneak him into the movie theater, share food and alcohol  with him. \n\nHowever... As he got older, he started to develop sticky fingers. At first it was candy bars at the cash register. Then it was a odd piece of clothing from a store he'd stuff down his shorts. Then it was portable harddrives in the Best Buy bathroom. Eventually he got caught by the law, which seemed to stifle things... for a minute. \n\nBut then he moved to doing things where the law wouldn't catch up to him. You'd find games wouldn't be returned in a timely manner... Then eventually we found out he had sold an old xbox & games that someone had \"loaned\" him after they bought the new xbox 360. We wanted to have a big LAN party and wanted another system... and that's how we found out that he had sold it for petty cash. He never told anybody. \n\nThis continued. Little things would just go missing. Again, and again, and again. Eventually, I went off to college and he didn't... but those who also didn't go to college you would still hear stories from. Eventually it reached a boiling point and one of the friends in the group confronted Big Bob, one who had been stolen from. Bob denied it all to his face. And we ostracized him. \n\nI know he was in that place. He had a bit of a temper, and I've seen him lose it before and smash his phone on the concrete. I know for a fact he felt like burning the house down after that confrontation night. Nothing actually ever happened, but growing up with him for 10 years I'm sure it was a whirlwind that night.\n\nBut at the end of the day... it was deserved. We tried to make him part of the village. Or at least I hope I did.",
            "I grew up in a dysfunctional family, though feeling very loved cause I was the youngest. I\u2019m from a culture where you\u2019re not supposed to be gay. So I always knew that I was loved for the wrong reason and that the moment I\u2019d come out, everybody would hate me to the core. The facade I kept up with lasted into my mid 20s and then one day, I just exploded and updated my social media, coming out. My family hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then. It\u2019s been 6 years. I guess the fire is still burning!\n\nEdit: Wow. Thank you all for your kind words. It means a lot. I know a lot of you are concerned, but I have found my own family.

I get to speak to his children and he has changed my view from how I used to look at him. Growing up, he had a mental illness and in my family, we never believed in that either. And I feel terrible because remembering when I was a young teenager all the way until I turned 20, I used to be angry at him saying that I didn\u2019t believe in his \u201cattention seeking\u201d. It was taking a toll on the family and I was mad at him for a long time. I\u2019ve said stuff that I\u2019ll probably have to live with for the rest of my life. Whereas when I came out, he\u2019s the only who didn\u2019t stop talking to me. The \u201ccrazy\u201d (the way mentally ill people are viewed in the culture) family member is the only one who was there for me. I never mentioned that in my original post and I feel like it\u2019s something that should be mentioned. \nAnd today, I\u2019d put him above everyone else in my family, no matter if they\u2019d come around or not. \nAround after I came out, he got into one of his episodes and nobody cared to talk him into getting to the hospital to start his meds again. I was on phone with him from the other side of the world for three days until I convinced him to get into the hospital where they helped him. I like to think that he forgives me for the things I used to say nowadays because I\u2019m doing everything to make him know that I feel like there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with his mental illness.\n\nEdit 2: Okay, I just got my first ever silver.

            "I (F20) spent several months in a mental institution. \n\nI was a young teen when I was first admitted. The staff were extremely abusive to most patients, although certain ones were spared due to their meek behavior. One time, I was tricked into admitting to an infraction that I had never committed, and I was forced to stay in my room for several days on end. I attempted to file a complaint, but it never really went anywhere. The staff were typically very unkind, and they treated each patient as though they were a burden. I was very lonely, and I sank even deeper into depression. I kept my head down for several months until I was eventually released. \n\nAs an adult, those months in the ward still haunt me. I struggle with feeling worthwhile, and I criticize myself for the smallest things because the hospital conditioned me into nitpicking and punishing myself for not being perfect. I have picked up the phone numerous times, trying to work up the courage to call the head of the hospital and give him a piece of my mind, but I\u2019ve never been able to go through with it.",

Picture this setting; a farmhouse built in 1830, burlap walls in my bedroom, hundreds and hundreds of comic books, and wall to wall carpeting. Your standard tinderbox. Instead of using a bunson burner for my heat source get this...I used an empty plastic Margarine container. And instead of practicing any other safety protocol, I set the fuel on the carpet and lit it. Surprise, the plastic melted almost immediately and the fuel soaked the carpet. Before I \"knew\" what happened flames were licking the walls and furniture.\n\n  At this point I had the good sense to yell \"fire\" to my mother who was blissfully unawares in the kitchen.

A month passes by, I invite them all to see a movie. One by one, they flake during the week before the movie. I end up going to see it alone. Another month passes, and they've maintained radio silence. Over the next few months, I try to invite them to various events, and without fail, none of them end up being available. I ask them about doing something together, and no dice. All the while, I watch their Instagram posts of going to a lake and having a lake party, or having a new years eve party together.

            "I suppose I started the fire, actually. \n\nI was the only kid in my family to go to college. I'm from Ireland, so it wasn't a financial decision, I was just the only one who worked hard enough in school to have any chance. In my final two years of school I was studying every day, even during summer and winter holidays, from day 1. My other two siblings were at best, showing up for school, except one of them rarely did, and the other showed up high most of the time. \n\nThis was basically the way it went for my entire life, and during that time my parents had focused their attention on the \"problem children\", completely ignoring my needs wants or achievements. I was left alone to do my homework, or expected to help siblings with homework, even though one of them was older than me and was tackling coursework I hadn't even encountered yet. They weren't abusive parents, just bad ones - if my brother or sister got straight C's, we'd go out to dinner to celebrate. I scored in the top 5% for math scores in the country twice in a row, the second time I didn't even get a congratulations.\n\nSo along comes college, and with it exposure to new ideas. I come out as trans to my parents, which they ignore like most things I say. One sibling goes to work in hotels, and eventually around the world on charitourism, working to save turtles and teach kids English. The other eventually moves out of home, gets a job in a hotel he hates, and barely ever calls. I'm stuck at home (it's not common to move out in Ireland if you don't have to during college), and not able to work due to the high workload in college and the long commute (4 hours a day).\n\nSiblings end up back and forth of our family home, and we start to fight a lot. I'm not working, so I don't understand the real world (bare in mind I'd work 40 hours a week during the summer vacation). I'm not doing well in college anymore, so it's assumed I'm slacking off (I'm still in therapy and on medication for depression brought on by stress and neglect). \n\nI eventually go to the United States, where I meet my now wife for the first time. We spend a glorious couple of months together before I have to travel home because yet again, I've failed college. I had one class to make up, so I put my future on hold and return to Ireland, safe in the knowledge that at least my sister is still in China.\n\nExcept she surprises the whole family by coming home for good three days after I get back. \n\nTo cut an already long story short, I finish college, and am a week away from flying back to my now fiance. We're watching a science documentary together on the television. My sister is starts explaining something about it wrong to the youngest sibling (I now have 3, but they're much younger). I correct her, and she tells me I'm wrong. When I tell her I literally have a science degree, the entire reason I'm home at all, she tells me I didn't \"really\" graduate college because I didn't have to take another exam (I was allowed to make up my grade). \n\nI lose it. I curse her out for being an awful bitch who talks down to everyone at every available opportunity, who hasn't held a real job for 3 years and barely limped her out of high school. I yell at my Dad for enabling her shit for so many years, allowing her to walk over family members because she's loud. My mother asks me what's wrong, and I tell her she's raised a hateful, spiteful daughter. \n\nI spend the next week at a friends house before travelling home and packing up my things to load onto the airplane. The night before, my mother tells me she'll get up in the morning to wish my goodbye and goodluck as I start my new life in America.\n\nShe didn't. \n\nThe fire isn't really that warm.",

            "A possible fire was reported at my apartment and I just happened to be leaving when the fire department showed up.  I was stopped at the red light directly in front of my door as two fire trucks approached, one behind me and one in front.  The truck in front of me pointed to the sidewalk so I pulled up tight to the building across the street from my front door to give them room, tight up against a telephone pole in front of me, and both trucks pulled up beside me blocking me in.  I watched from the drivers seat as the firemen raised a ladder to the roof and began putting their equipment on.  I hopped out and asked one of them if this was serious because I had a pet in my unit.  He assured me this was a routine call as there was no visible smoke nor flames coming from anywhere.  \n\nI let out a sigh of relief and returned to wait by my car with my girlfriend and two of her friends.  A few minute later the front door of my apartment opened and 3 firemen emerged.  The back door to my unit was nailed shut when I moved in, with the doorknob removed.  We had placed a light bookshelf in front of it facing my TV.  For these men to exit my apartment from within could only mean they had kicked that door down, which they did.  It also meant both doors were now wide open and my 6 month old kitten could escape.  \n\nI ran into the building to find my living room in shambles, my bookshelf destroyed having shattered my TV in the process of toppling over, and my kitten nowhere in sight.  After a few minutes of flipping furniture and checking every nook and cranny I was distraught and left the apartment to start searching the surrounding area.  I lived on Commonwealth Ave. in Boston at the time in a busy neighborhood with people, cars, trains etc. all around.  This was no place for a kitten.  \n\nMy girlfriend, her fiends and I split up to searched the area, but after 20 minutes there was no sight of my little kitten.  With my girlfriend in tears, her friends heads hanging low, we retreated back to my car to collect ourselves, and that\u2019s when the village turned its coldest shoulder to me.  \u201cCan you believe that!?!?\u201d I heard from the window next to my car.  I looked up to see my neighbor pointing at the parking ticket on my windshield.  I had been given a ticket well over $100 for parking in the sidewalk, which I was instructed to do by the very firemen who had just destroyed my apartment and lost my pet.  \n\nI took my jacket off, picked up the ticket, and stormed across the street towards 2 policemen who were standing in front of my building.  As I approached them I yelled \u201cwhich one of you did this!?\u201d.  Taken aback the policemen pointed to the \u201cEMT\u201d badge on his shirt and explained that he was indeed not a policeman.  Even more enraged by my stupidity I turned to find an actual policeman to yell at, when I noticed a pack of 4 or 5 cops all standing together in the street.  Blinded by my rage I yelled \u201cI\u2019m going to knock a fucking cop out!\u201d as I stomped towards them.  \n\nThat\u2019s when a wise old villager decided to save me with a last minute embrace.  I felt a hand slap the back of my neck, squeezing hard, and spinning me around in the other direction.  Another hand ripped the ticket out of mine and a voice said \u201cJust shut the fuck up walk with me.\u201d  He was a police officer in his 50\u2019s and he just asked me what happened.  I explained and he ripped the ticket in half and said to forget about it, that someone had screwed up.  He told me to take a breath and calm down...and to never do that again.  He was right about that.  In hindsight it was a very dumb and immature thing for me to say and do, and I in fact was not going to knock out any cops because all of them were significantly bigger than I was and had weapons.  \n\nWhen all the drama died down and the cops and firemen departed, I parked my car legally and returned to my apartment to assess the damage with my girlfriend.  As we began picking up the rubble we heard a rustle and squeak from under our bed.  In a panic my kitten had decided to climb into a purse inside a duffle bag to hide from the firemen, a hiding spot so small and cozy that he decided to stay and take a nap the entire time we were searching for him.  The relief of still having him almost made up for the destroyed living room and the ass I had made of myself while barking at cops.  \n\nI\u2019m glad things ended the way they did.  I was more than prepared to *try* to burn the village down that day, however I sincerely doubt I was prepared to even manage a spark before the village put me in county lockup for the night.",

I was about halfway through freshman year (ninth grade) of high school.  It was really hard because it was a super intensive regimen-I was basically always in the hospital.  The longest I was ever home was two weeks; usually I would only get to be home for one week, with low white blood cells, then go back to the hospital for the next drug as soon as I recovered enough.\n\nI lost all my hair repeatedly; it never grew more than a couple centimeters. My face was all swollen like a balloon. I was incredibly pale. I developed a bunch of stretch marks from taking chemo that made me nauseated and unable to eat and losing fifteen pounds, and then gaining the same fifteen pounds back when they put me on Prednisone for two weeks and I had insatiable hunger. I ended up wheelchair bound because I didn't have the strength nor the dexterity to walk long distances (I had really bad drop foot--the muscles in the front of my foot are weaker, so it's harder for me to pick up the front of my foot when I walk, so I tend to trip and stumble a lot--it's way better now, I couldn't walk before).\n\nSo I get held back a year.  When I come back as a junior (eleventh grade), I don't have any friends.  I literally do not know a single person in any of my classes.  I had to bring a form to my PE teachers that said that I was physically disabled and I couldn't run and I certainly couldn't do the dancing part. My teacher tries to make me run a mile every week.  The popular boys sit in the bleachers every week and yell at me that I'm a dyke, just run thunder thighs, etc. \n\nI should mention that the entire time I was going through chemotherapy, there was radio silence from my school.  No one cared at all.  I didn't even get a get-well card from any of my teachers.\n\nSo this popular boy who's on the football team has a brain tumor and he just has surgery and that's the extent of his cancer treatment.  The school held a fucking assembly for everyone to go to in support of him! Everyone has to wear purple that day, because it's his favorite color!\n\n...And then there's me, cancer survivor, regularly made fun of for my appearance due to being a cancer survivor, who got told fuck-all by anyone in the school just two years ago.\n\nI'm sure most people who read this could imagine the rage I felt at the time lol.",

            "In middle school, I had a teacher who taught my favorite class, geography. I had maps in my room, I could recite all the countries and some capitals, and tell you a little bit about a lot of them. I was a starry, bright-eyed student looking to learn more and she, well, she was a bore. She was sexist, rude, dry, and took zero interest in teaching. She would dismiss my questions in class, give us stupid assignments, and test us on topics we didn't learn in class. To make a long story short, she was no longer working at the school at the end of the year thanks to me. Burn, Mrs. \\*\\*\\*\\*.",

            "My dad's side of the family.  \n\nAfter my mom divorced my dad when I was 7, I'd spend every other weekend at his house (like many divorce kids do), but I never felt really close to his family.  My aunt was a ratchet bitch in her own right, ruined god knows how many family events (including my wedding, the bitch), and she was the kindest because she was the only one that acknowledged my existence.  Once he passed, the shit. Hit. The. Fan.  All of a sudden my half sister (she and I had the same dad, diff moms) was convinced that dad had money, and that I was screwing her out of it.  Even after the probate judge reviewed all the paperwork and gave it a rubber stamp, she and his side of the family were convinced I was robbing them blind.   I guess I didn't answer the question correctly, because as soon as his estate was closed, I cut those limbs off my family tree, doused them with gasoline, and tossed a match with glee.  \n\nI see pictures from their annual family reunion every year on facebook, and I say fuck 'em.",
            "My last year in the Navy. I stopped working and basically did the absolute lowest possible minimum, the most microscopic step above doing absolutely nothing! I left early to lunch and came back late as shit. Some days I showed up to morning muster late on purpose.\n\nI was a Second Class (E-5, equivalent to a Sergeant in the Marines/Army), the only thing I gave a shit about was training my juniors. I tried to give as much training as I could before I left. \n\nI didn't notify my watch coordinator that they took me off the watch bill so I didn't stand a single watch in a year and a half. Deployment was fantastic without a watch! \n\nMy chain of command didn't give a flying fuck if I went the extra mile because the shop was being run smoothly, no overdue jobs, we were all qualified, and a very tight team. They sure as fuck noticed when I stopped giving a shit! They took away my supervisor responsibilities and gave them to another Second who was lower in rank to me by time in grade and I basically became an overpaid E-3. As if that was any kind of punishment. I was doing even LESS work. I had to sweep floors and clean the machines lol.\n\nI'm not proud of the way my career ended. I admit I could've been much more mature about it but I was in a really bad place mentally. I'm not an innocent victim, but I'm not the bad guy either.

            "I think this applies?  My family rejected me so then my closest friends become my family. You know like \"friends are the family you choose\".  And now my \"family\" is surprised they're not included in my future plans at all and I prioritize them less during holidays.",
            "This is like a novel...\nI did burn down the village and I'm not so proud of that part of my life. But it was middle school so \ud83e\udd37\n\nImagine going to school with the same people from grade 1-8...\n\n\n6th grade: I was a regular kid, sure I took some special Ed classes and had a crush on one of the marginally more popular guys... \n\n\nWell one of my \"friends\" told others who I liked and it escalated to a point where the entire grade knew, and kids are cruel. I got teased from the minute I stepped in the door till when I left by the popular kids. This went on for months. \n\n\n7th grade: I was still dealing with the blowback from the previous year, but they decided to add on my special Ed classes to that teasing making sure I knew I was not as smart as everyone else. Then a nerdy kid (nicest kid in the world) had a crush on me and he was teased about it and I was as well. I have a vivid memory of two kids talking in some other language about me and another kid they were pointing and then someone asked what they said in English, they replied with \"he's kinda smart but not really, she's stupid and slow\" \n\n\n8th grade: things died down, but I was making new friends and some old ones didn't like the new ones so they completely cut me out of their lives. Towards the end of the year things blew up and Everything in the past came back at full force, them bringing up things from elementary school and past years in middle School... \n\n\nSee, I was that quiet kid that sat there, watched and listened to other people's conversations. I was a fly on the wall, since I wasn't significant and didn't talk much they felt like they could talk around me. \n\n\nI knew a ton of things I probably shouldn't have known... I wrote notes to people confessing love to different kids for others, over exaggerating everything. I got kids in trouble with teachers. I made sure the people that betrayed me and hurt me got hurt back but in a way that wouldn't come back to bite me once I left... \n\n\nAfter all that happened I left and went to a technical high school where I wouldn't have to go to school with the same people again... I heard some stories of the fallout of what I did, I ruined some lives (temporarily) I hurt a lot of people, and lost a lot of friends. I don't regret burning any of those bridges, but the way I acted back then is what I regret. \n\n\nThis did teach me some important life lessons... Be sure who you keep around you is not just there to use you... Don't let others kick you while you're down, stand up for yourself. Don't accept abusive people into your life. When people act ugly, they're showing their true colors, believe it. And the most important thing.... Accept who you are and love yourself because there will always be terrible people trying to cut you down, there's no point in helping them.",
            "TLDR: the mental health system in the US is completely f-ed.\n\nOne day when I was 19, I was at work and suddenly a police officer was there to arrest me; he took me in cuffs to a local hospital psych ward. The doctor immediately told me to take this cocktail of drugs, that I could take them voluntarily or they'd get a court order to take them. I had no idea what was happening and complied. The drugs put me in some kinda comatose state where I felt loopy and had a hard time following anything, much less complicated court proceedings. I learned someone filed some paperwork against me, and they could hold me 72 hours, but since a weekend was in there it was really 5 days before I went to court to find out what the f was going on. The doctor never interviewed me, he went off what was in report and prescribed based on that. 5 days of unnecessary cocktail drugs, and being a naive 19 yrs old, idk what was happening nor what things meant in court. I was placed on a 6 month commitment and shipped off to some group home to live and be monitored. The doctor would change his diagnosis every 6 months, from one condition to another that made no sense, and anyone suffering from these afflictions would never have. But that's how the US system works, the doctor's theory is the gold standard no one questions. 6 months was extended to a year, a year to two and then eventually 3 years. When I was finally released I tucked my tail and ran, i didn't complain or risk any way of getting sucked back into their system.\n\nTurned out that my very strict Catholic parents filed a report that I was a danger to myself or others because at 19 I had rejected them and was rebellious entertaining Satanism. They told me they \"gave me to God when I was born\" and since I had rejected him I had to be very sick. Obviously they lied to ppl under their belief they were doing the right thing. I lost my job, my car, my apartment, all my belongings, and 3 years of my life. I had never committed any crimes nor shown any signs of violence, yet I was imprisoned for 3 years. And now, 20 years later the affects of being force fed a cocktail of unnecessary drugs has had longterm side effects on my health and body... yay thanks Mom and Dad...",

I wasn't struck, I wasn't sexually abused, but a lot of other bad stuff so I never felt like I could be myself (had to be different people for different people), I had no control, there was no joy or hope in my life... except my friends and adult siblings who tried to keep me sane.\n\nI was on some national merit scholar type radars, and I felt like I wouldn't be able to lie properly to the investigators without Googling their process, which would be recorded.

I eventually aged out and found happiness and success, so don't worry about me.\n\nSide note: I was born in Hawaii but the family moved on before I went to kindergarten. Still, when you're in Hawaii I'm told you're kind of everyone's baby. They ask to pick up the baby, pass around the baby, coo and smile at the baby, and that seemed to affect me deeply in a good way.

I begged him to take me home, take me to get tampons or pads, that my underwear and skirt had blood on them. But no, he was watching the game and he was drinking he can't drive now. Wait till later. I was soo frustrated. I went back to the truck and sat in the back for awhile. I thought of a great revenge plan. I would take out my tampon and hide it somewhere. It wouldn't take long to start to smell. Plus he leaves for work a week at a time. The whole truck would smell like rotted blood by the time he finds the tampon. But.. I never did because he would have hit me.\nI regret not doing it. He is a asshole",

            "I spent about a year infiltrating the flat Earth community on Instagram. I garnered a decent following with an account dedicated to flat earth travel photos (an intentionally absurd premise). In that time I learned a quite a bit about the community including how to discern the trolls from the real deal. The majority of legit flat earthers are extremely distrustful of anything the government says or does. These same people are 9/11 truthers, Holocaust deniers, and anti-vaxxers and they connect these conspiracies together. Many of them have also attached flat Earth theory to religion, magic, or mysticism. Before my infiltration I\u2019d always considered conspiracies fun. Like they were the fan fiction of real life. Now they mostly make me sad. For all the phony accounts like mine, there are still plenty of people out there willing to drop a couple of hundred dollars on a flat Earth convention.",

            "Not a flat earther. But I *was* a 9-11 \"truther\" I guess you could say--insofar as I thought it was an inside job. I was heavily influenced and believed in multiple conspiracies in the Zeitgeist film as well. There was a never ending source of dark, shadowy \"they's and them's\" controlling everything behind the scenes.\n\nI think there were a few factors that helped me escape that:\n\n* Losing my father. It was such a life changing event at that age that it made me reconsider everything in my life. \n\n* Some light training in evaluating information. I learned about how to vet sources, primary, whether something was actually news or just an opinion/editorial, etc.. Ironically, this education came *before* I was duped. After my dad died, suddenly this started to kick in more.\n\n* Lack of time/means to dig myself a deeper hole. I started college shortly after my father passed and that + a full time job took up all my time. I had none to buy further into the newest crazy bullshit. I had no Facebook/Twitter/IG/etc.. No smart phone or texting. My primary use of Reddit once I discovered it was for r/Naruto, r/Bleach, rage comics, and advice animals. \n\nSo all in all, I think the time away gave me time to detox. If I had been on social media as I discovered those things, I can only imagine I very well may have become a Q believer as well. Looking back I see how gullible I was in that moment, fooled by the onslaught of half truths and clever \"logic\" of the various theories. I know better now (and I should have known better then), but I've been humbled to the fact that everyone is vulnerable to this sort of stuff. To think otherwise is deluding yourself.",
            "Obviously there's a lot of memeing around here, but if the question was meant seriously we should understand what exactly Flat Earth belief is. As Dan from the channel Folding Ideas puts it in his excellent video [In Search Of A Flat Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44):\n\n> Nominally, Flat Earth is a belief that the Earth isn't a globe, but is actually flat, a fact that has been kept from Us, meaning normal people, by a nebulous, powerful Them for nefarious, inscrutable purposes. ... I think it's worth considering that the shape of the Earth might actually be the least important belief of Flat Earth. Flat Earth is a syncretic, biblical belief that is both evangelical and apocalyptic. ... The world is flat and They are hiding that fact from you because a flat Earth would be irrefutable proof that we live in a divine fishbowl and, thus, that God is real.\n\n> Flat Earthers are not otherwise empty vessels who believe one kooky thing. They believe that thing because it suits their purposes. Flat Earthers have an agenda. ... Their anxiety is that the world has become too complex, that too many things are changing, and that science and progressivism are actively malicious elements working to obstruct the true nature of God.  Most people don't actually believe Flat Earth because they were persuaded by shoddy evidence... they do so because it says something they already believe about the nature of the social world.",

            "Okay I get the question is funny and all but I actually did believe, for a time, that the earth was flat. I was raised in a very religious family, and basically came to the conclusion that the Bible declared the earth was flat, because since I believed the earth was created in seven days, the idea that God set the stars in the sky in one day made much more sense if the stars were simply points of light in a sort of snowglobe formation extrapolated onto a bigger scale. Otherwise, he took one day out of the seven to make a septillion or so balls of flaming gas, all with their own planets, and set each one into galaxies before breaking for lunch. It just didn't make sense to me that he would spend five days on one planet, and make the creation of the trillions of other stuff in the universe a little footnote. I was confronted about this belief a couple times, only one of which wasn't laughed off. That single person who engaged started a serious discussion, presenting much more evidence for the globe earth, and eventually told me to watch Carl Sagan. The Cosmos series was on YouTube, and once I watched it, I had to know more. Finally, a video from the channel MinutePhysics convinced me, in no uncertain terms, that the earth was round. All it took was one quote, which I still remember leaving chills down my spine: \"you should have put a serious tag on this question.\"",

We have voting on a Saturday and this year because of covid they're opening some of the voting places the Saturday prior also.\n\nFor 2 weeks leading up to the elections you can cast a special vote, so there are plenty of opportunities and no one has to miss out.\n\nIn fact this year, for the first time, you dont even have to be enrolled to vote. You can enrol and vote at the same time. \n\nI cant believe America has an election on a Tuesday. That's absolutely insane! Not only should it be a public holiday for you but companies should be legally required to release staff (if they are working) in order for them to be able to vote.",
            "At best it would be akin or Presidents day or Labor day. \n\nOffice and bank workers would probably have the day off but some Jackwagon would get it in their mind to start promoting \"Voting Day Sales\" so the majority of the retail workforce wouldn't get the time off and would probably reduce voter turnout.",

We still have to work 365 days a year. \n\nAnd the thing is many poor people work jobs that you don't get off for holidays. But schools would have off so they may have a harder time balancing work and finding a babysitter. And with people having the day off it may be even busier for stores and restaurants meaning less ability to let people get off early or get a break to go vote easily. \n\nThere is also an issue where it may give people the idea of yay a day off and instead of using it to vote they party, travel, do some type of activity or events and don't vote still lol",

            "What sucks a lot for non-celebrities and poorer people is the cost of therapy.  I don't currently have insurance and while I know I should go see a therapist about stuff, I can't afford it. I'm sure other people are in that boat.\n\nFor me it isn't so bad these days because I ended up meeting an awesome guy and getting engaged, but I've had a lot of extremely low points in my life where I could've used professional help.",
            "As someone who's struggled with suicidal thoughts and still do on occasion I'd like to advice against a trend I've noticed on reddit, and it's this thing about instantly linking to suicide prevention organizations. I personally understand that it's ment with good intent, but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you're being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem. More often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person, someone who will care or listen to them, of course I am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - I know it shouldn't be anyone elses responsibility, all I am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better, linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it, it's much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side.\n\nAgain, I don't want to come off as a dick here - I think it's great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help, but try to keep this in mind. That feeling of being pushed away or getting a predictable and generic answer often makes you feel more isolated and more depressed.",
            "By the way, I wish there was a suicide *chat*line and not a hotline. I don't like speaking out loud to a person about any issues I might be having.",
            "I attempted suicide at 19. I think the hardest thing for non-suicidal people to understand is that a lot of suicidal people don't want to kill themselves, they just want to stop existing. \n\nActually going through the steps of writing a note and taking the pills was extremely difficult and all I kept thinking the whole time was that it would be so much easier if I could just fall asleep and never wake up. It was *scary* to think that I was potentially killing myself whereas a death I couldn't control or had less control over would just...happen. Then there's everyone and everything else to consider. I also have caught myself wishing many times that the whole world would end so that I could stop existing but then neither myself nor my loved ones would have to deal with the pain or miss out on a good life. \n\nI found those things really hard to articulate at 19. It's how a lot of depressed people feel. ",
            "A person from my past reaching out to me, even for 5 minutes, does exceptionally more for my mental wellbeing than seeing 10,000 redditors spam the numbers for different suicide prevention hotlines. \n\nPlease, please reach out to the people in your life. You can keep it as light as you want. \n\nWe're social creatures, and even limited interaction goes a very long way. ",
            "I did not write this but have permission to share.\n\nJust saw this elsewhere on the internet in reference to recent events. For obvious reasons (at least, for anyone who has had to listen to me bitch about how much I hate winter), it really resonated with me...\n\n*****\nWhen you have depression it\u2019s like it snows every day.\n\nSome days it\u2019s only a couple of inches. It\u2019s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend\u2019s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home.  Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole.\n\nSome days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shoveling. You leave early because it\u2019s really coming down out there. Your boss notices.\n\nSome days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in bed. By the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are. You don\u2019t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling. Plus they don\u2019t get this much snow at their house so they don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still stuck at home. They just think you\u2019re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.\n\nSome weeks it\u2019s a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, it\u2019s to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. It\u2019s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave won\u2019t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You haven\u2019t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You\u2019re too cold to do anything except sleep.\n\nSometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it\u2019s death to stay here, but it\u2019s death to go out there too.\n\nThe thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don\u2019t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn\u2019t care, it\u2019s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.\n\nAlso, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can\u2019t shovel, sometimes places you can\u2019t even see. Maybe it\u2019s on the roof. Maybe it\u2019s on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, there\u2019s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done. The neighbors say it\u2019s a shame and they can\u2019t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling.\n\n-\n\nI don\u2019t know how it went down for Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade. It seems like they got hit by the avalanche, but it could\u2019ve been the long, slow winter. Maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling. Maybe they weren\u2019t. Sometimes, shoveling isn\u2019t enough anyway. It\u2019s hard to tell from the outside, but it\u2019s important to understand what it\u2019s like from the inside.\n\nI firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action. It\u2019s important to understand what depression is, how it feels, what it\u2019s like to live with it, so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis. I\u2019m not putting heavy shit out here to make your Friday morning suck. I know it feels gross to read it, and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it, that\u2019s why people pull away.\n\nI don\u2019t have a message for people with depression like \u201ckeep shoveling.\" It\u2019s asinine.  Of course you\u2019re going to keep shoveling the best you can, until you physically can\u2019t, because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house? We know what the stakes are. My message is to everyone else. Grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor. Slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood. Petition the city council to buy more salt trucks, so to speak.  \n\nDepression is blind chemistry and physics, like snow. And like the weather, it is a mindless process, powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm. But like climate change, that doesn\u2019t mean we are helpless. If we want to stop losing so many people to this disease, it will require action at every level.\n\nEdit: Feel free to share this with anyone or anywhere you think it might help. We aren't alone. Even when there's warm bodies around when we are cold we still shiver. Offer a blanket.\n\nEdit 2: I just want to say thank you and you're welcome to everyone who is commenting and can relate. You're not alone. Not just me, but many of us truly understand how you feel. But I won't tell you what to do. We who suffer have been told time and again what to do. But if someone offers you a blanket sometimes the warmth can help.  \n\nEdit 3: I'm trying to comment on everyone that is posting and thanking me for sharing. I think it's important that everyone is acknowledged that took the time to share their thoughts. Everyone matters. \n\n***Thank you to whomever (whoever?) gave me my first gold.

            "I bought a dog. \n\nI have a very busy life, so people ask me if I regret having her, since dogs are all high maintenance. I need to walk her a few times a day, feed her, keep her entertained, clean up after her, remove dog hair from everything including myself with an unending supply of lint rollers. \n\nI don't regret it. I got her for one purpose that I won't tell them. Because I'm lonely. Because when I'm at my loneliest, I don't have anyone to turn to, no-one to go see, to talk to, despite my best efforts. I have her because I know if I died, something would miss me, so I can't leave her. \n\nI left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip, earlier this week. I found myself calling for her, and she wouldn't come. For the first time in years, I just cried. I missed her. I wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves. Fortunately, I could just grab her the next day. But it reminded me how important she is to my mental health. \n\nI recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where I would have even less familial and friend support. I would have been traveling most of the year, so I would have to give up my dog. I'm glad I did. I had one friend tell me to \"absolutely not take the job\"; he said if I took it, he gave me 6 months before I jumped off a bridge. I can't say he would be wrong. \n\nI used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years, which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that I was close to. And then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he's trying to fire me. I have the CEO and President behind me, so he can't touch me; they know what I did for the company, my sacrifice, my skill, my dedication and loyalty. I now have much less responsibilities, so I can relax. \n\nNow, I'm here, with my dog, trying to decompress from my job, make more friends, actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying. Things are starting to look better. \n\nHere's to better days. ",

            "I\u2019m the mother of a toddler who died of cancer. There is nothing anyone could do to prevent me from killing myself- besides listening and being present. I didn\u2019t reach out to anyone. Being suicidal means you want to die- no one could have talked me out of it. My family knew I was struggling and they took shifts watching me. \n\nThey bought me my favorite foods, watched Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race with me for weeks (seriously.. for some reason it was the only thing I could watch.) They listened to me cry and didn\u2019t try to give me solutions. They just said \u201cI know\u201d. We had a code word- potato. If I said potato, that meant that I needed someone to be physically present with me.. quickly. \n\nThere was always a plan for the next day- \u201cTomorrow we\u2019re going to have lunch at that Mexican place, ok?\u201d \u201cTomorrow let\u2019s look for a special garden marker for Miles.\u201d I think that was a big part of it- having a plan for the next day meant I had to keep going.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost four months since my 3 year old died and I\u2019m still living. That\u2019s pretty fucking amazing. ",
            "My brother committed suicide when I was 8. He was 15. My dad has been abusive but my brother suffered the most from him. He was my hero. I looked up to him and wanted to be like him. He\u2019d take the fall for me when I did something that would cause my dad to punish me. I remember that morning vividly. I got back from school the previous day and went to go hang out with him in his room but his door was locked. I kept coming back but he wouldn\u2019t answer the door. My parents weren\u2019t worried because my brother usually kept to himself like that. When it was time for bed I told my dad to see if he could get the door open and he told me not to bother my brother again. After my brother didn\u2019t come down for breakfast my father broke his door and we found him hanging from the ceiling. I wish I didn\u2019t see that. I screamed the entire time and wouldn\u2019t left go of his hand. It felt cold and my mother had to peel me away. He left a suicide note and a hand written will. He left me his favourite book. I miss you Jeff. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much everyone for the love. \n\nEdit 2: My dad kept repeating \u201cwhy Jeffery? Why? and tried to get him down from the fan. I was screaming PLEASE JEFF! and pulling his hand and when my mom couldn\u2019t separate our hands she pulled me away. She was crying so hard. I remember kicking my legs in the air and screaming \u201cyou should have opened his door for me\u201d\n\nEdit 3: The book is Animal farm by George Orwell. I always carry it with me now. Whenever he\u2019d read it to me I\u2019d make fun of how the big words sounded funny and we\u2019d laugh. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much in his will. He left me the book and his game boy. He left my mom his wrist watch. My dad didn\u2019t get anything in the will. \n\nEdit 4: Wow I woke up to a ton of supportive messages and so much love. Thank you for all your kind words. I\u2019ve never spoken about the details before and I pray this helps someone who is struggling. To all the Jeff\u2019s, I know it\u2019s hard but please be strong. You don\u2019t want to have your family calling your name and you not answering. It\u2019s the most painful thing ever. For years I had nightmares of trying to save him but each time I\u2019d get there too late. \n\nIn his note he said he was really sorry and didn\u2019t mean to hurt any of us but he just couldn\u2019t bear the pain anymore. He said he hoped it would make my dad stop being disappointed in him and called me his best bud in the world. He told my mom he loved her and hoped she\u2019d find the courage he didn\u2019t have. \n\nThanks to all the gold x 4!",
            "I wish this was up last week. A very close friend of mine committed suicide in the 2nd. She was only 19 and could light up a room when she came in. The worst thing is feeling like I could have stopped her. After work the day before she asked me if I wanted to go out. I didn't because I was tired and had to clean. \n\nMy heart hurts. Her memorial was yesterday. Its still such a raw wound. \n\nI'm sorry I had to get this off my chest.\n\nEdit: thank you all who've messaged me or replied with support and their own experiences. I know logically it wasn't my fault but emotionally it hurts. I'm slowly starting to accept what happened but it will be a while before I'll be back to normal. \n\nAlso to the asshat that messaged me and told me it was my fault, go fuck yourself.",
            "Almost exactly a year ago one of my best mates called drunk in the middle of the night telling me that he was going to end it, and he wanted to apologize for doing this and thank me for being the only one to support him. I got so fucking scared and started calling people that had been on the same party that he attended earlier and managed to find him nearby walking alone towards the rail tracks. I ran towards him and stopped him, we talked for almost 5 hours straight that night. We agreed for him to try therapy.\n\nIt worked. Atleast for him, and now he is on his way back up pursuing a career in graphic design.\n\nI urge everyone who feel depressed atleast try to talk to someone, your family, friends or a therapist/hotline as it might help more than you think.",
            "My mom killed herself on April 22nd of this year. My dad found her naked, fallen off the side of the bed, with three empty pill bottles, two knives, and a razor. She was covered in vomit. \n\nThe ambulance came, but she was unresponsive. They waited until I arrived to ask if they could stop resuscitation attempts, which they tried to do for over an hour. \n\nWe went in when they stopped. She was half covered with a sheet, there was a lot of blood and vomit. Her ribs were broken from resuscitation attempts. She was just...gone.  \n\nMy dad and I are totally lost. \n\nLast December I checked into a psych ward instead of killing myself.\n\nFuck depression. ",
            "Currently suicidal person here, lived a kind of shit life. Abusive parents, bobbed through foster care. Mother is a schizophrenic with psychosis.

Because my mother was a living nightmare. ",

            "When I was a teenager I had bad problems with depression and anxiety that led to very self-destructive behavior. There were many times I imagined killing myself and one night I was set on doing it. Came home drunk and sad and started cutting myself, which was one of my methods for dealing with my emotions. I sat in my bed crying, trying to find the courage to cut deeper and end it. Then my dog Snoopy hopped up on the bed and put his head on my lap. Thanks to him I realized that I just couldn't do that to him or to my parents and friends. He saved my life that night. The next day I decided to open up to my parents and ask them to help me find some help, which was a huge step forward. Sometimes all it takes is a reminder that someone loves you to help you start trying to love yourself.",
            "This will get buried but until just recently my major depressive disorder was in remission. Something happened about 2 months ago that turned my life upside down and as a result, I\u2019ve recently been struggling with suicidal thoughts. They\u2019ve been escalating, inch by inch.\n\nI read through maybe 30 responses on this thread and am nearly in tears at my desk. I needed to be reminded that I am not alone and that the metaphorical demon that is depression haunts so many people on this earth. I cannot give up or give in. \n\nI needed this today to motivate me to stay the course. I beat this once, I can do it again. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes is by Winston Churchill:\n\nWHEN YOU\u2019RE GOING THROUGH HELL, KEEP GOING.\n\nThank you to everyone contributing to this thread.\n\n",
            "My mum took her life when I was 12, a year after my parents had separated. Afterwards I lived with my dad and my little sister, and took a big role in raising her while battling my own depression and self harm. \n\n10 years later, just when I was starting to get in good place emotionally, my sister jumped off a bridge. She was 18 years old. \n\nIt's been a few years since she took her life, and what I've learned is that no matter how much better you think your family would be without you, that's just not true. I miss my mum, and I miss having a mum. My sister was my best friend, and even after all the tough things she put me through over the years (drug addiction, stealing, etc.), it was so worth it to have her around. I think about her every day and would do anything to have her back. ",
            "I don't talk about suicide much, because it is a very painful subject for me... perhaps, in part, because the shadow of it stalks me sometimes, waiting to catch me when I'm down.\n\nBut 11 years ago, I was desperate enough to believe that everyone who knew me would be better off without me. I believed that the scales weighed heavily against me - that I caused more harm than good - and that if I simply didn't exist, it would make things better for everyone.\n\nSo I started counting my pills. I'd been seeking treatment for depression for five months, but nothing was working. The meds made me worse, or they made me so apathetic that I found no joy in life, or they gave me such bad side effects that I could barely stay lucid. I thought there was no way out. So I was counting my pills, trying to figure out how many would cause an overdose so I could take them, lie down in bed, and die.\n\nI'd arranged them all nicely, counted out every single one. I'd positioned my glass of water next to them all, and I stood staring at the scene, feeling *so* overwhelmed because the intensity and duration of my suffering had been so drawn out, and it just wasn't getting better. It had been years. *Years*. A slow decline until a breakdown, and then I was in so deep I couldn't see a way out.\n\nThen the phone rang. It was a friend of mine, a Catholic priest, who said he felt moved to call me and see how I was doing in case things were bad. I lied to him; I told him that I was fine, that I was receiving treatment and that I was hopeful that things would start looking up. But I didn't think I had any fight left in me. He told me that he believed I did, and that he hoped I could hang on awhile longer.\n\nI hung up the phone and burst into tears - ugly, inconsolable crying, snot dripping out my nose, curled up in a ball. But my friend had planted a seed of hope. *Someone* believed in me, even if I couldn't. And I guess I felt that I owed it to him - and to my family - to try.\n\nI managed to get an appointment at the emergency psychiatry clinic awhile later, and there I met the psychiatrist who prescribed the drug that saved my life. I got into a daily outpatient program at the hospital. I met other people who were like me, and I found myself believing in them - believing that they could fight, that they could get better, even though I didn't believe I could. Somehow, they said they believed in me, too. And so for a second time, I saw that other people believed in me, even if I didn't. And I felt again that I should try.\n\nSo I tried. I got into weekly therapy with a psychiatrist, and I was in her care for seven years. She adjusted my meds as needed and we began the long, arduous process of untangling the mess that was my mind. She never gave up on me. (I'm in a country where she doesn't make money off me. She gets a flat salary.) \n\nNow, it's 11 years later, and things *have* gotten better. I am better now than I ever have been. It took awhile after my rock bottom moment to find that spark of hope within myself, but I did find it, and that is what kept me going. It made me look for anything I could to keep me hanging on, and even now, it's the small things in life that keep me here. When the moon shines through my window at night and pools on my pillow. When the white blossoms on that weird bush in the backyard finally bloom for one week every year, and I can smell them on the wind. When my dog wakes up in the morning and comes to get me because he is happy I am awake. When the sun shines just right, or the wind sends petals filtering down through the trees, or the world is silent and glittery after a fresh snowfall.\n\nI find those moments, and I \"keep\" them. I commit them to memory so that when things get bad again, I can remember what I love about this life, and remind myself to keep hanging on. \n\nI still get low.Two years ago, I had been fired from my job and was certain I would never become a fully functional adult and I would always have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in society. I stood on a subway platform and listened to the rattle of the trains and tried to convince myself not to jump. The tracks were hypnotising, almost. I looked up and found myself staring at a poster for suicide prevention, and the irony was not lost on me. It broke the trance. I stepped back from the yellow line and went home. I stayed.\n\nLast month, I got slapped in the face with a bout of severe depression out of nowhere, and then my dog passed away, which made it worse. (Dogs immensely improve my mental health.) But I stayed.\n\nYou can stay, too. \n\nTake it day by day. For those of us with severe mental health issues, that's all we can do - take it day by day, see how we feel, see if there are any little joys we can find and savour them. You have to cultivate the ability to find them, and it might not be easy at first. (I'm a stubborn ass and was originally so intent on believing that there was nothing good in the world that it took me a couple years to learn how to look closer.) But eventually, you'll have a breakthrough. Maybe you'll see a toddler get pegged by a ball and you'll fall over laughing. Maybe you'll hear the cicadas buzz in the heat of August and remember how awesome summers felt as a kid. Maybe you'll find an indie game on Steam that has a really compelling story and you'll find that you can't WAIT to get back to it and find out what happens next. You never know.\n\nBut you can stay. Just take it day by day. And you can see what happens.\n\n\n",

            "I've been dealing with depression for years now but I did try to commit suicide in high school. I hit rock bottom when a family member falsely accused me of raping them. The police, my family, everyone in my life seemed to take their side. The judge ruled that I couldn't stay at my house during the investigation because my little sisters where there and they seemed me a danger to them. I ended up being put up in a shitty hotel for a month while my attorney fought to have any kind of medical exam done to try to prove my innocence. Being shunned by everyone I've cared for got to be too much and I decided I'd had enough. I managed to get ahold of a bunch of pain pills and a fifth of Jack and took them all and went to bed. I woke up the next morning in a pool of vomit. In the end though, I'm glad I survived my attempt, things got better. My accuser couldn't keep their story straight and ended up confessing to making it up in court. My life has started to stabilize and I met the woman of my dreams who has helped me work through my issues. I still deal with depression but I've got a pretty good treatment regimen right now.

            "My brother committed suicide at the age of 15 - I was 16 at the time. One piece of advice that I can give to those who have been effected by suicide is to talk to someone, I mean *talk* to someone; whether it be a friend, parent or hell even your dog, just talk. I'm almost 26 now and for years and directly after, I buried all of my emotions and refused to talk to anyone, even my family, about it.  It has really messed me up both emotionally and with my relationship with people and the world in the long run - and only in the last year have I realized this. So, please, just talk to someone, don't be like me. ",

Because every day, is a fresh start.\n\nAnd to the kind stranger on here who has talked to me and helped me, if you ever read this, thank you so much. You have helped more than you\u2019ll ever know.

            "Please be mindful that most suicidal people are well aware of the existence of suicide hotlines, that many of them are also well-versed in the kinds of pith advice people want to dish out so liberally (well intentioned as it is) and that many of them **do not *want* to die.** \n\nThey just do not know what else to do. \n\nSome are truly devastatingly depressed or mentally ill. But this is not uniformly true. Many many people who are suicidal are genuinely not \"mentally ill.\" \n\nSpeaking of myself a long time ago now and others I have known - there are people out there whose suicidal ideation is a \"logical\" analytic response to essentially impossible life pressures and situations and - right or wrong - it can feel very hurtful, even offensive, and unhelpful to tell them their thinking is clouded. \n\nI and others I have known used the same basically functional working (but very very stressed) analytic mind to **choose* not to commit suicide.  \n\nAs I moved through that place and eventually out of it, I had to hold onto the \"option\" in my mind and make the choice -- albeit increasingly more easily -- many times before it was gone. \n\nAll that and this too - please don't turn people into messages or PSAs. Suicide is absolutely horrible - I have been affected by its aftermath more times than I care to share, very directly and less intimately as well. It is probably almost never the right thing to do (save terminal illness, etc) but its important to honor lives as more than their ending. ",

            "In 2015 I was fresh off a wonderful honeymoon with my amazing wife when I hit a little low. I'm manic depressive and am used to the ups and downs, but this low didn't go away. I thought I was stronger than my depression but it just kept going. After about 6 months my spouse was just barely able to hang in there and was spending a lot of time at her mother's in another town because I was just such a fucking asshole and was losing myself. Christmas night that year, wife was at her family's celebration, I sat in our guest bedroom alone and had my 9mm in my hand. I struggled and was crying and angry and a fucking nightmare was unfolding in my head. I couldn't do it though. I let my dog in and be jumped on me and was licking me and wagging his tail, so I hung out with him for a while and put the gun away. I promised my wife I would try to make the changes necessary to recover and fast forward to today, we're halfway through her pregnancy with our first! It's a boy! I'm very physically active and I have things to work towards, and now a son coming that deserves a great set of parents. My wife is incredible and she stuck with me through times where I would have left myself... She did what she could when she could, considering how much I was pushing everyone away during that time. I can never repay her for being loyal to me when I don't think I deserved loyalty, I just hope I can give her and my son the best husband and dad possible for the rest of our lives. \n\nEdit: at the time, I was planning to make everyone hate me so no one would miss me when I finally killed myself. It was a dark pattern that made me lose who I was. I am a different person today and I have learned to recognize the signs and not ignore my \"small lows\". I never miss a chance to tell my wife how wonderful she is.

            "People try to reach out and say \"I'll help you, I'll talk to you, if you need me\", but it's not enough. If you had a massive issue that you couldn't even pinpoint what it was, how would you go about telling someone about it, and asking for help? Or even when you do tell them you are having issues, and they shrug it off because they aren't in your place and they can't understand. What do you do? Nothing, you're alone.\n\nI was depressed for a little over a year, and that year felt like an eternity. I felt like a prisoner in my own mind. Depression feels like.. being stuck in a dark, cramped, windowless room. You can't see anything, you can't move, you're suffocating. You're panicking. There are people on the outside telling you that they will figure out a way to get you out. That they are with you. But in truth they have no idea what to do and you're not even sure if they are trying, or if they even care.  \n\nPeople who care will actually do something about it. They will drag you out of bed, kicking and screaming to get you to a hospital, or a mental institute, or a appointment with a therapist, or psychologist. And the only reason I ever got better was because someone physically forced me to leave my house and see a doctor. And even after being denied and confused about where to find help, he spent the entire day with me, driving around town to different hospital locations to find me a psychologist. Because that's what good friends fucking do. So stop telling people that you are there just to talk, and instead actually take action to help them. People who have depression are so enclosed within their room that they can't reach out to people, and that is why people are dying from suicide. \n\nMy two friends who both died at such an early age to depression, they were two of the most beautiful, kind, popular, and loving people I have ever met, and I always feels so FUCKING heart broken that I didn't know what to do until it was too late.

            "I got a dog here. If I didn't come home one day, he'd never stop sitting by the door waiting for me. He'd never stop missing my smell and my voice. He'd never stop wishing for one more walk, one more game of chasing the laser with me, one more high-five for a treat. He'd never stop jumping to peek out the window when he heard somebody coming up the sidewalk, and letting his heart be filled with a moment's joyful hope. No matter how many times that hope was dashed, he'd never let go of it. He's kind of a doofus that way.\n\nAnybody else in my life might eventually get over it. You can explain to them what happened and they'd at least be able to understand if not accept it. But my little brown dog would sit forever wondering why I didn't come home. And he's had a hard enough life so far. I was his only friend when he had nobody, and he was mine.\n\nNo matter what I'm going through in life, putting him through that sort of suffering is not something my soul would ever let me do. Otherwise, I probably would have done it already. \n\nLife is random. There's no fate. There's no karma. \"The Secret\" doesn't actually work, except for making the people who wrote those books rich. There's no magic Santa Claus in the sky making sure all the good people are blessed and the bad people are punished. Maybe God exists, but he sure doesn't interfere. I've been praying for decades for some sort of help, or at least guidance so I can help myself. No response. No answers either. For example, why did a loving God let such an abusive monster come into my mom's life when I was a kid, turning me into an emotional cripple who can't deal with any sort of stress without crumbling? Why does child abuse happen every single day in this world? No response.\n\nSo a sane person can only conclude that it's all just random. \n\nThat can be scary. But it can also be liberating. It means that the sheer law of averages will save your ass at some point. It can't all be bad forever. That breaks the laws of the universe. At some point something randomly good will happen. The scales will eventually balance. There's no intelligence behind it. It's just chaos that's part good and part bad. Accept it. Fighting it won't change anything.\n\nOne thing's for sure, though. Those who are prepared for the random things that come their way will have a better time dealing with them. Sit exactly on the middle line between optimism and pessimism. Prepare for emergencies so that they don't destroy you, and enjoy the good things to the fullest when they do come. But overall, just wait and watch, knowing and accepting that nothing can be good forever, but neither can anything be bad forever. ",

Everyone treated me like I had some sort of contagious disease.\n\nEvery time a public figure dies by suicide, I always feel sick to my stomach. In the US, the mentally ill are disproportionately ignored and stigmatized. \n\nI really wish nobody ever had to go through a loss like this. Suicide is 100% preventable, yet nobody cares. ",
            "I tried to kill myself 15 years ago due to chronic shooting pain in my head that no one could diagnose. Luckily I failed and eventually they went away on their own. I have a good life and a great family right now. \n\nMy son was recently diagnosed with chronic headaches and I\u2019ve never been more terrified that once he gets tired of living in pain he\u2019s going to follow in my footsteps. He is in therapy but I am just so scared. ",
            "People who are suicidal feel like they can't talk about it with anyone because they will be committed, drugged and stigmatized. We need to have a better outlet for suicide to be discussed without judgment or immediate hospitalization because that is not always the answer. ",
            "All of my life my dad would attempt suicide, I couldn't even give a rough guess how many times!\nOne of my earliest memories was finding my mum crying in her bedroom holding a noose that she had found in the loft. (I didn't understand at the time). It took me a long time to realise that - actually, its not normal for a parent to drink themselves into oblivion and take a handful of drugs or slit their wrists! He was later diagnosed with bipolar. \n\nFast forward when I was a teenager my parents had split up, dad was steeply declining in his mental health, still drinking heavily. Still attempting/threatening suicide almost weekly.\nHe would attempt to run into walls with knives against his stomach until I'd grab him, constantly overdose. Cut himself.\n\nMy mum then remarried. I always felt a responsibility to keep my dad happy and safe so left my mums wedding early to meet my dad to make sure he was holding up OK. Of course we met in the pub, still in my bridesmaid dress, my dad walked over to me very wobbly - I assumed he was drunk. He flopped his arm around me and told me he was going to get another drink as he walked away my dress was completely covered in blood  across my waist. He had slit his wrist in a zig zag from inner elbow to his hand.\nI told the barman what had happened, walked out the door, burst into tears and ran 2 miles home.\nAt this stage I had completely had enough, I remember vividly thinking \"I just wish he would get it over and done with so I don't have to deal with it!\"\n But still I went up every day to make sure he was eating, taking his meds and generally keeping him company. \nAt 15 I hadn't been up in around a week, my best friend and I had planned a girls night around our mutual friends house and popped in to see my dad on the way over. \nAs soon as I walked into the communal corridor I smelt it. I knew. \nFound him led on his living room floor, flat on his back with his eyes open. Flies crawling on his arms. \nCalled for an ambulance (silly - I know, I was 15 and thought they could save him) \nI don't think anyone realises the physical pain of being told \"I'm sorry he's been gone for some time, there's nothing we can do) until they go through it, it feels like a knife to the chest. \nThe aftermath of so many 'I didn't think he would ever actually do it's' was astounding. \n\nPlease, if ever somebody tells you somebody self harms for attention, take them damn seriously. There are only so many cries of help people can give! \n\n",

            "My brother killed himself in 2010. No one saw it coming. This is someone who had a very bright future ahead of him. He was all set to take over the family business. He was a quarter back in high school and also rode dirt bikes, and he was really good at both. He loved to fish and hunt, he was passionate about a lot of things in life, especially his 2 year old daughter. He had a beautiful and infectious smile. Anyway, he caught his girlfriend cheating on him one night, and apparently she was sending him pictures of her with the guy. He was heartbroken. They had a baby together, and lived together. I remember him telling me all he wanted was his family back. She moved out and shortly after he saw her at a bar with her new boyfriend, the bar where both my step sister and step brother worked and one that she knew my brother frequented. Why she chose to go to that bar with him is beyond me. My brother got shitfaced and showed up at her new apartment. He pointed the gun at her new boyfriend and when his ex got on the phone with the police, he turned it on himself. I remember vividly going over there two day after to pick up my niece, and the blood stain was still there in the breezeway. \n\nMy dad got a knock on his door at 3am, it was two state troopers telling him his only son was gone. I remember the phone call, my sister telling me he shot himself, and it didn\u2019t even fully register. All I could do was mutter \u201cis he alive?\u201d. I remember sitting around my kitchen table with my family, all of us just quietly crying. My dad almost sold his boat because they would fish together, and it was too painful to take it out anymore. I\u2019m happy to say that 8 years later my dad just went to Lake Erie, by himself, and he said he felt like my brother was on the lake with him. It almost gets harder as time goes on because you start to remember less and less about them, and the memories are all you have. My niece is the spitting image of him, having her around is like having a piece of him with us, she\u2019s very special to us! \n\nWhat his suicide did to me personally is a whole different story. He was my best friend, and after he died I went down a very dark path. I self medicated and became addicted. At one point the only thing that was keeping me from hanging myself from a pipe in my basement was that I couldn\u2019t imagine putting my dad through the pain of losing another child. The following 5 years after his death I put my family through hell all over again, i was still alive but actively trying to kill myself with drugs. I have been sober for 4 years, have a beautiful son now, and I am set to graduate college this December. Life is pretty good! We miss him every day and the pain of losing him will never go away, but where there is life, there is hope. There is never someone who is too far gone or that can\u2019t turn things around, I am proof. The only reason I\u2019m still here is because I finally surrendered, and got the help I needed. I wish my brother had done the same. None of us had any idea what he was going through mentally. \n\nIf you suspect someone is struggling reach out to them! I\u2019m sorry to everyone who lost someone to suicide, I know your pain, and to those fighting the good fight, keep pushing \ud83d\udc4a ",
            "A few years ago my dad attempted suicide. He and my mom had divorced, and he wasn\u2019t coping well. Drinking a lot, punching holes in the walls (though never any violence beyond that). He messaged me one night while I was getting McDonald\u2019s with my then-boyfriend (I distinctly remember the fries being perfectly hot and salty for some reason). His message said, \u201cI love you\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014...\u201d for about 20 lines on my phone. I panicked and said we needed to go home. When I arrived, my grandfather was there, along with the police and an ambulance. I was 100% sure he had died. No one would let me into the house or let me see what had happened. Moments later, a few police officers walked him out of the house, helping to carry him since he was so drunk. He was taken to the hospital.\n\nWhen he called me the next morning, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy I was to wake up today. I\u2019m so glad I failed.\u201d",

            "I\u2019ve attempted suicide three times in my life. The first I was attempting to slit my wrists and I was stopped by my childhood friend. The second I had a gun in mouth and I heard my nephew laugh from across the house & I couldn\u2019t have him see that. The third I had accrued a gun, picked my location to go out to in a field, went to close all of my bank accounts to leave my money for my family. My sister found my note, told my dad (who is a cop) and his fellow officers picked me up at work and I was hospitalized. \n\nMental illness needs to be addressed. As someone that suffers from it, I know how hard it is to talk about let alone live with. I spent years being silent about my illness. I was ashamed. I thought it was my fault & I should be able to handle it. I was wrong. It cost me jobs, friends, & partners. It very nearly cost me my life. Once I was hospitalized I was finally able to receive the help I desperately needed. I\u2019m still rebuilding. I still struggle. But I can now see a light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nTo everyone that suffers from mental illness: I see you, I\u2019m here for you, and you are not alone. The world may seem empty. Everything may lose its luster. Just know that there are those who genuinely care for & support you. Even if you can\u2019t always see or feel it.",
            "Please don't use the saying \"It's a permanent solution to a temerapy problem.\n\nThis might be true for someone who suffers from situational depression. The depression that goes away.\n\nFor someone with chronic depression it never truly goes away. It is not a temporary problem. It can be managed. You can be better. You can learn to live almost normally. \n\nBut when a person has been suffering for years, barely living, barely able to get out of bed most morning, it's not a temporary problem.\n\nWhen I was in my worst depressed state and I heard that saying for the first time, what I heard was: \"It's a permanent solution to a permanent problem\" And you know what? That was comforting. It was encouraging in the wrong way. I wanted to just cease to exist. Not have to worry about waking up the next morning. \n\nWhat got me through was knowing that I would destroy my children's lives. I knew they would blame themselves. Even if I thought they were better off without me there and that I was damaging them. If I took my life it would be much worse for them.\n\nI started therapy. And that was the hardest thing I have ever done. Just finding a therapist was way harder than it should have been. I decided to show my kids that even though I was damaged and broken I could be strong.\n\nI started being selfish in a good way. I started taking care of myself. If I couldn't get out of bed one day I didn't. I only did the bare minimum of what needed to be done. I dropped the kids off at school and came home and slept or just watched tv. I picked up the kids from school and ordered pizza.\n\nBut I only gave myself one day. My therapist called it my isolation day. The next morning I got up. I set goals for my self. One a week. Something simple. When I accomplished that goal I celebrated. Then set a new one for the next week.\n\nMy first goal was just going to the hardware store and picking out the paint for a furniture refab I wanted to do. When I say my therapist next I showed her a picture of my finished project. She was so proud of me she hugged me.\n\nIt's been a long hard journey and it will never end but I have learned to find joy in my life. I will never be cured and I will always have bad episodes but that's ok. I know they will end and I can get back to living.\n\nThere's an organization called \"Always keep fighting\" I've chosen to live by those words. When things are bad I take a sharpie and under my watch band write the letters AKF. I can just look at it remember that I am strong and I can get through this.",
            "My mom was about to commit suicide after getting diagnosed with depression and nothing seemed to help. Before she could go through with it,  she walked by the room my sister and I shared, and saw us laughing (we were watching Inside Out, I remember), and she realised how we'll be crying instead of laughing if she goes through with it, so she didn't do it. She hit a rough patch, but she tried ketamine and it really seemed to work her her. She's doing a lot better now. ",

            "Yesterday I was drying off in the shower when my wife came home, so I stayed quiet and hid.  I heard her go from room to room looking and calling for me for several minutes, even going outside twice, before finally finding me in the bathroom.  I asked \"Where you worried something happened to me?\" and she said \"I was afraid I would find you hanging from the ceiling in the garage.\"  \n\nI still don't really think I have a problem.  Everyone gets down sometimes, but if someone that close to me is legitimately worried about me, I guess I should probably be worried about me too.",
            "Man. This is not a good thread to read through if you're struggling with suicidal ideation. \n\nThe...temptation of suicide is ever present once it's blossomed, I think. The idea abates but lingers, biding its time. You can still have so many things to be happy for, so many things to be Pollyanna-GLAD about, and still, the sticky sweet singsong of, \"but you could be done. You could be over it and not struggling any more. You could REST.\" chirps persistently in your ear. \n\nMany times friends say, \"come, talk to me when you feel this way.\" Therapists ask you to be open with them - \"are you feeling suicidal right now?\" At first, you want to trust them. But - almost always - with friends, you end up having to reassure THEM that you aren't going to ACTUALLY go through with it. The emotional toll of reassuring someone else when you are already feeling drained and fragile is a lodestone around the neck, cement shoes on a river during the first freeze. And therapists, bless their hearts (and I do mean that in the very Southernist way I can manage), tend to react and report you rather than listening. \n\nSay you end up in the hospital because you chose to check yourself in instead of follow through with your plan. You may also - as low income - end up in a facility with heavy drug users and addicts and other lost little puppies such as yourself, and you'll get so heavily medicated you walk around in an apathetic fog, still struggling to breath in enough air to not die in a way that feels more like murder. Group therapy will become the bane of your existence. \"Here, rip open your wounds in the company of strangers. You're safe here!\" a perky fresh-out-of-college or drained dead-around-the-eyes doctor will say. Nurses chat cherrily with patients. \"Oh, you'll be back! They always are.\" \n\nSo you withdraw more. You tuck away the horror you feel at the prospect of trudging through more struggles, bill roulette and day after day, week after week, of trudging through the motions at work. You hide your loneliness,  which at times threatens to overwhelm you with a black tidal wave of nothingness, under a veneer of cheerfulness and compassion and empathy. You learn to make your smile reach your eyes and body language when you want to weep for how much you long to be able to hold out your arms to someone - anyone - and say, \"help me! I just want to belong, to fit in, to have a place that feels like the Home I've read of in the stories.\" But you can't, and so you go about your days smiling but still hearing the quiet weeping of a small child tucked into a corner in the back room of your mind. \n\nAnd sometimes the weeping abates, and sometimes the beauty and joy around you slip in, like glorious little snapshots in a world full of dark gray. And you feel content. Warm, even. Happiness. And then, not right away, but eventually the crying of the small child is audible again. And you have to play the game of, \"reasons - what reasons do I have to stay. What reasons do I have that prevent me from leaving.\" \n\nYeah. Suicide can be seen as selfish. You like to think you own a piece of those who you love just as you give pieces of yourself to them to cherish as well. But sometimes - sometimes - on the days and nights when the weeping is the loudest, an inky black ocean of sorrow lapping at your feet as the tide threatens to come up and fully overwhelm you at last, as the storm clouds in your mind darken, and the apathy threatens to steal your very last sliver of breath from your very lips, then yes. I can understand - much better than I ever wished to - why the siren song of suicide could overcome a person, no matter how hard they tried to fight it. \n\nAnd hopefully, HOPEFULLY, if you didn't before, you can now too.

            "I attempted suicide by overdose when I was a junior in high school I\u2019m about 22 now so it\u2019s been 6 years.  I took in the whole 100 count bottle of acetaminophen and I said some \u201coff\u201d things (my goodbyes) to my friends and they noticed and rushed over at midnight to tell my parents something was very wrong and called the ambulance.  I wouldn\u2019t fess up to what I did but they knew from my eyes that I wasn\u2019t okay either so they took me to the hospital and made me ingest the absolutely horrifying liquid charcoal.  I threw it up all over myself in the middle of the night but when I woke up at one point i saw my mom turned over praying and crying and I\u2019ll never forget it.  The other sight that stops me from it all now is my dad crying when they checked me into the ward.  In all of my life I had never seen him cry except for that one day.  \n\nPeople out there love you.  Even if you don\u2019t have family that supports you, friends are there.  Around two years after that I got pet bunnies and I love them to death.  I can\u2019t imagine leaving my pets behind and when I get emotionally distressed I go over and pet them in silence and it helps me calm down a little more and straighten myself out.  It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s something.      Therapy helped me and my family open up to each other about things that I kept in that caused me to go over the edge.  Now, especially being someone who knows first hand what that dark void feels like I push to help my friends around me if I feel like they\u2019re going through the same thing.  \n\n",

My parents were having troubles in their marriage and my Dad would head over to the factory and work twelve hour shifts.\n\nI remember her crying a lot and feeling alone. I remember her striking a matchstick and pouring kerosene over her body. I remember crying and asking her to stop and then trying to fill a bucket of water in vain hoping to douse the flames that would soon engulf the apartment. \n\nI managed to get out of the house and I took my little sister with me.

She was crying, I knew what had happened. My mother and he were very close and during this time I became a support for my mother as well as my other family members. I was so worried about them that I feel I barely processed his death even to this day.\n\nAt his funeral I knew that I had to speak, he was the closest thing to an older brother I had and I wanted to say that I loved him. When I spoke everyone knew who I was. I didn't know how, but I came to find out that he had told all of the people in his life who I was, how I was growing, and the person I was turning into. It was too much for me to handle and for the first time since finding out about his death I cried. I cried through the words I spoke about how I wish he knew how much I enjoyed hanging out with him, how much I loved spending my birthdays with him or walking through rivers together. I wish I had given him a call to tell him that I loved him. \n\nI don't know if anyone will read this; please if you love someone in your life or know someone who is hurting from depression or anything, give them a hug, call them and tell them you love them.

They would all be miserable. The note wouldn\u2019t explain it well enough, no matter how many times I rewrote it in my head I couldn\u2019t get it so that people would understand. My mother, she would never understand, ever. \n\nSo, I thought about it. Most of the shit I\u2019m worried about, it\u2019s just shit I\u2019m worried about. If I just stopped caring about it, it would no longer be shit I\u2019m worried about. I mean killing myself is the end, There is nothing worse that can happen to you at that point, the game is over. Maybe I just needed to start a new game, one where I was free from the shit holding me down in this one. \n\nI decided I would try one more time. I\u2019ve already lost this life. I\u2019m here, about to kill myself tomorrow, I\u2019ve lost, but I can start a new game, one more fucking try. This way I can restart my life without ruining the lives of others. I mean me taking my life would ruin the lives of so many around me. I can\u2019t do that, I just want to end mine. \n\nSo I did, I ended it by deciding to try again cause fuck it, what worse thing could I do that I haven\u2019t already done? The only thing is kill myself, so if I don\u2019t do that, this new life will be better than the last one. I decided to play the game, one more time. \n\nSince then I still think about suicide, but not multiple times a day. I don\u2019t harp on it and dream everyone would be better off without me, cause they wouldn\u2019t. My parents would be crushed. My siblings would be crushed. I would have traded my broken ass self for breaking a piece in each of them. \n\nSo anyway, one more time, can\u2019t hurt any more than it did this time right? One more time, and if I fuck up this one, it will probably be one more time again. ",
            "I have that suicidal ideation. I feel it deeply, and often, and I can honestly and openly say that I wish I wasn\u2019t alive most of the time.\n\nI also feel that \u201creaching out and getting help\u201d will only lead to more debt, which will exaggerate a lot of my problems. I foresee that debt in the form of paying for a service to try and make me feel better or even the cost of depresssion medication. Then god only knows what side effects would come with that, etc.\n\nI feel trapped most of the time. I owe more than my salary in student loans, which means I\u2019ll likely never be able to marry or own a home or really make any decision at all that is bigger than buying a video game or two.\n\nI also can\u2019t even imagine a job exists that wouldn\u2019t be a total chore to get myself to. I work midlevel IT and make nearly $60k so technically I have it better than most. I don\u2019t mind what I do but I\u2019ll never be excited to do it. Then I spend my evenings anxious as fuck because my life is basically making sure others can access the internet, or intranet resources, or whatever.\n\nI don\u2019t own myself. I couldn\u2019t choose to walk away without putting myself in a worse situation. I\u2019m literally a hamster in a wheel and there\u2019s no way to break that loop. I want to die.",
            "I attempted suicide when I was 16. I was depressed, and untreated because mental illness just wasn't something that was recognized in my family. \n\nI cut my wrists and held them under water. The only thing that stopped me was the thought that my 5 year old niece would be the one to find me. I didn't want that. So I bandaged up, cleaned up, and went to lay down to re-evaluate my life. Probably should have had stitches but I wasn't ready to admit I had \"problems\". \n\nI'm 26 now. I still struggle with my depression. I was medicated for a while, but I hated the side effects. \n\nI'm happily married, bought a house this year, and have a wonderful goddaughter who is an absolute ray of sunshine in my life. So the depression is there. But the suicidal thoughts aren't. Any time it even crosses my mind randomly, I remind myself why I'm still here. But my life is important to me. I want to live to enjoy the good times and fight through the bad. I will survive. \n\nPlease, anyone that reads this. If you need help, get help. Your life is worth it. There's a lot of love and support out there if you need it. ",
            "I\u2019m 19 years old and last week I took a fatal amount of prescription drugs hoping to end my life along with a sleeping aid so I wouldn\u2019t be awake through it. I woke up violently vomiting and extremely upset because I shouldn\u2019t be here. I still think about suicide every day, but not in a really depressed way. I feel more like I\u2019m a background character just going with the flow not doing anything to differentiate myself from others. ",
            "I'm in my mid twenties (male) and I've had anxiety all my life and depression since I finished high school, never gone to a doctor about those two tho. I don't think I could ever kill myself while my parents are alive I just couldn't bare doing that to them, they don't understand why I always play games don't go out on the weekends or do things that people my age usually do. I haven't talked to them about it.\n\nVideo games for me are an escape, while playing I don't think about anything else and time just go by fast. I'm a loner, I know many people but they're all just acquaintances nothing more, I don't get invited to any events or contacted other than if someone needs something, my social anxiety has prevented me from gaining any experience with the opposite sex.  This all just adds to my depression, the sheer loneliness of my life.\n\nPeople will often say I'm funny or great to be around or I'm always smiling but that's just  me trying to hide the pain and maybe make someone else's day better, usually the people who are always smiling are the ones that are hurting the most. I finished college a few months ago and I could care less I have zero motivation. I daydream a lot and it helps me, I daydream about a normal life of having a girlfriend, travelling the world with her, a life without anxiety and depression and what that would be like, I don't think I've ever been in a social interaction without my axiety going through the roof I'm just always anxious about something, sometimes I'll stop and ask myself why is my heart racing what am I suppose to be anxious about then I'll remember that's it's something I have to do in a few days.\n\nI don't know what the next few years have in store for me nor where my life will take, I don't know if this is even appropriate to post here I'm second guessing myself but I'll do it anyway, I'm anxious on how someone will respond that's even going on in my head. I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest, this is actually the first time in my life I've ever expressed myself in any form on this topic. I could probably write 10 pages in detail on this.",

            "It's my birthday today. Been struggling for five, ten years now with severe depression.

            "I have a question as someone who has struggled with suicidal ideation in the past. For the record I\u2019m doing really well right now and have no depression or suicidal ideation.\n\nCan someone tell me what I should expect to happen if I am feeling suicidal and I call a suicide helpline? Will they somehow track me down and call the police? When I have been at my lowest I have fortunately never been close to attempting but I have made plans and the last time even went so far as to gather important documents, write up a sheet of info for my husband about important accounts, passwords, etc. If I get to that point again, what would be the benefit of calling a helpline? Is there anything I can do now to prepare myself in case I\u2019m faced with that again? When I\u2019m in a good place I am able to see the value of a helpline but when I\u2019m at my lowest I keep it very hidden because I don\u2019t want anyone to get a clue and call the police or have me committed. What can I do to actually get myself help when I\u2019m in that kind of place, mentally speaking? \n\nOr what can my husband do? I have been very candid with him when I\u2019m not depressed and tell him how seriously he should take it if he ever hears me talk about ending my life. If we got to that point again, what should he do?",
            "I planned to hang myself when I was eighteen. I had the logistics of the entire event thought out. Today I don't even remember what exactly I was going through that made me feel so desperate. The only reason it didn't happen is a very good friend of mine and my brother died, and I felt like I needed to be there for my brother during such a vulnerable time. I still struggle with depression periodically, and my anxiety has gotten way way worse, but I haven't thought about suicide like that in a long long time. I certainly have a much better support system now than I did six years ago, and I'm almost certain that's what keeps me alive. ",
            "It's been one year and a week where I went through severe depression along with a scheduled suicide and I didn't plan on being here past the first week of June '17.  \n\nMy plans were so detailed, so foolproof that it was just a matter of counting down the days, mainly because I wanted to get past my Kid's 5th birthday on 5/18 (for a final photo-op for her) and then make it out before the middle of June.  Starting from March '17, it was such a bleak time that I couldn't see past June. It was a wall that I was speeding towards and I didn't have any brakes and the fear and panic of living were consuming me so much that I just drowned in depression. \n\nI made my rounds, had my 'final' moments with friends (they didn't know) and then had a final talk with my therapist. All of this between May 28th and the first week of June. The closer it got to the end of the first week in June, the calmer I became, knowing it would be all over. I'd finally be at peace\n\nThen in one unidentifiable moment, it all changed. Suddenly there was no impending doom. I made it into the second week, and then the third week of June and while I still was depressed, it wasn't this end-all-be-all ultimatum that my brain concocted. The days came and went one at a time and I was still around. \n\nHere I am, almost a year to the day of my scheduled demise, and I can't fathom how on earth I could have left my wife and daughter alone. I've had so many great moments and made so many memories that now I have a crippling fear of dying. \n\nThe pendulum has swung. I called my brother from another mother and I mentioned this to my last visit with my therapist: Suicidal thoughts, when it's occurring, seems like the only possible way out - once you pass that threshold (if you can) you'll see that it was a terrible, horrible trick of the mind (sorry, it's the only way I can explain it.)\n\nIf you're suicidal, let someone know. If you're depressed, get into some CBT classes, or therapy groups, tell your story, listen to others and realize that you're not alone and that your problem isn't as bad as those other people's. Someone always has it worse than you and they're still around - fighting. \n\nWaking up out of that fog is such a \"lost in a forest' feeling that you spend some time feeling your way around living. Then you realize that after a fair amount of time passes by that suicide\n\nI'm fortunate that my wife has a good health plan that affords me to go to a great therapist. I know others don't have that luxury. If you're one of the other, there are resources online, support chat room, even walk-in clinics. Just ask someone, go to the ER if you have to and just ASK. \n\nFight to live. Battles are hard fought, but make sure you are armed to win the war on life.  Help is out there, you just have to realize you need it and accept it.\n\nBe strong. Keep Living.\n",
            "Wow I have the best worst luck in the world , worst day in my life that im seriously thinking about suicide a suicide prevention thread pops up\n\n\nJust wow\n\n\nEdit: wow five minutes in an I got a lot of kind words frm all of you , I am very thankful, I cant express it ,thank you so much ,I realize that suicide is not the anwser , I am only 19 , I have my entire life ahead of me,im gonna try to calm down and think rationally ill try not to kill myself by the end of this day , ill do my best to be rational , I know ill solve very little with suicide so ill try to think with my head rather than my emotions , ill update this comment tomorrow and explain the situation to the best of my ability, because ill do my best to calm down and be objective about what happened , again  thank you all so much youre such amazing people I love you I genuinely do <3\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit numeros dos ( I dont speak spanish , but my gf does so shush up!): for whom it may concern I am alive hooray! Rejoice like all 5 of you who will read this , im joking of course I am thankful for your concern of course , first of all ill say I am from Serbia just for context and our system on everything is just kinda fucked , second of all my yesterdays reaction wasnt really a sudden outburst  but rather an amalgamation of everything for the past year or two from minor things too majour stuff im not gonna get into it since I dont really have a week to waste and I assume  neither do you so with out further ado lets start\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all id like to say im better now  ( ive been listening to Powerwold , Dethklok and metallica all day so that helps) so heres the basic jist of it I failed one of my finals , and even if I pass the other two I have to wait until August to retake it which probably means I wont get into the collage of my choice hooray, so id have to wait a year before  doing it , basically waste a year, I felt so shit about failing that I didnt eat or drink anything all day ( and considering it was 30+ degrees outside well says something) I felt so disappointed in myself that I failed just so shit , my dad was disappointed and was like \" wtf can I even tell you youre not your brother you understand what happened so see you can do , you should've went to school to see if you can fix it \" which  is reasonable , an hour or so later I pick up a bagels to eat , like rather small ones  so I eat one and take a bite out of the other and my mum walk in . Now before I continue I love my mother but shes just .... how can I describe it think of Lois from malcom in the middle but more neurotic,like the day I dont have to fear her screaming at me its gonna be fucking Nirvana , ill probably emulate Corpsegrinders Vermilion scream. Anyway she walks in and askes me \" Are you fucking insane  , do you realize that literally no one failed their finals in 40 years youre literally the only idiot who failed \" ( im not 3 people in my class  alone failed) \" How could you  fail ?!  Do you realize how embarrassed I am that you failed , what am I supposed to tell.everyone when they ask me about you! \"  now I try to tell her that I feel fucking horrid that I just wanna die all day  , and her response is basically \" HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL I HAVENT EATEN OR DRANK ANYTHING ALL DAY \" and insert  like a solid minute of yelling before I broke down in tears in front of her to which she responds \" STOP ACTING LIKE A NINE YEAR OLD  TAKE RESPONSIBILITY ARE YOU GONNA CRY WHEN YOU MAKE A GIRL PREGNANT TOMORROW\" and im just historically sobbing and she leaves to prepare for the gym while still yelling at me and I ask her \" please just leave me alone  \" I repeated that a few times and her response was \" OR WHAT YOURE GONNA HIT ME \" ( I have never raised my hand on any of my family with the intent to hurt , I have never hit my mom or dad nor intended or tried to the most ive gotten I playful fighting with my dad when I was younger , ill hit anyone who has intent to hurt me or kill me but I will not hit someone out of the blue, the last time I was in a fight was 5 years ago against my bully)and im just sobbing on the kitchen counter ans tell her ,that in not gonna hit her ,im not threatening her or anything simply asking her to stop, my dad walks in talks to me a bit and gives me honey and some water saying.\" Take some honey and water youll get a fucking stroke\" so I pick up the spoon my hand is shaking like so much its insane and I drink the water ( my first water today!) And try to calm down  and before my mum goes to the gym she comes she comes to talk to me again\" I dont know what your problem with me is ,but I have your best interest in mind,and you're an addict to your phone, you have a problem you're an addict all you do is play games all day, you should've studied more , and prepared more instead of palying games \" at which point what am I supposed to say , anythinf denying is just gonna confirm it in her mind and I just tell her take me to the therapist if you think that's true snd she just packs and leaves \n\n\n\n\nIn hindsight I should've studied and the fact that I failed is 150% on me , I felt confident enough that I could pass the same 5 subjects that ive been studying for 4 years , I have seemingly been proven wrong , that is no ones failure but my own , I can make excuses as to why it happened such as me.being scared shitless because the first two questions were something ive never seen , but even then that's on me . On the other hand I dont think calling me an addict is something adequate  , I have 4 games on my phone and.play 1,5 of them ( probably more but I fire up the GBA emulator once ina blue moon sooo) I really am not doing anything most of my time is spent reading , manga and books , sometimes comics ! And talking to my gf and friends ( of course take everything I say with a grain of salt since youre getting my perspective only and I might be terribly wrong with out realization) , I genuinely dont believe im too attached to my phone , if I had the ability to talk to my friends and gf another way that was just as accessible I do it ffs man I have messager installed  but not FB , I genuinely dont need it beyond updates for my school ,I literally use the easiest and cheapest way to talk to the people I like . For Christ's sake I regularly leave my phone behind when I go to my grannies and I dont have a second thought about , the thing I have on my mind is getting two.whiny old ladies of my back , but whatever maybe im just proving her point that im an addict by ranting so much about it so like who I have no idea \n\n\nAnd for the epilogue  : Twilight of the thunder god is an amazing Amon Amarth album\n\n\nAnyway shout out to everyone here who cares to message me , leave a kind comment or show their care , and shout out to my  probably best friend for cheering me up and getting chocolate ice cream over her white dress , youre the real MVP youll be an amazing doctor <3",

            "In 2010,after my car accident, I decided I would give my all to recover, and if I didn't, I would kill myself. After hospital time and rehab I finally went home. Pain and loneliness was too much and I decided I wanted to die. One lonely night, I loaded up my shotgun and put the barrel in my mouth, finger on the trigger. I was a hair a away from pulling that trigger. I closed my eyes and thought of my fiance (wife now) mom, dad, sister etc, and I put it down. I have thought of that night everyday, along with other intrusive thoughts every single day for 7 years . Last year I decided to seek help. I was medicated, which led me to open up to my wife, who had NO IDEA what I was experiencing for 7 years! Since medication and opening up to my wife and psychiatrist, i feel 100% better. I no longer think(obsess) over that day or have intrusive thoughts for MONTHS now. Life is SO much better. Stay strong, get help. I think the most therapeutic part for me was telling someone, I was embarrassed, I sobbed like Baby thinking my wife would think less of me, but I feel so amazing now. There is a stigma but we have to overcome it. As a 6'4\"/250 lb man, it was extremely hard to show my ultimate weakness, but I did it and don't regret anything.

            "I had struggled with mild depression and anxiety for a while, but it was never overwhelming. Then the day after Thanksgiving, 2016, I moved 5 hours away from my family and fianc\u00e9e to take a job at a tv station.\n\nThe town was depressing in and of itself, with some of the highest heroin overdose and poverty rates in the state. Couple that with a shitty work situation and being just 23, I hit rock bottom.\n\nI was keeping it mostly under control, and actually started seeing a therapist who helped quite a bit. But one day came where it was too much, and I was so stressed and broken from the thought of having to go to work and throw myself into a job that was so draining that I decided I was going to drive myself into a tree on the way over. I never self-harmed, I still could laugh and joke with friends, but I simply didn\u2019t see the point of going on any longer.\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t tell my fianc\u00e9e, she could tell something was wrong, and called my therapist. My therapist immediately sent someone from the services over, who helped talk me down. She called into my job to tell them I wouldn\u2019t be coming in to work that day. \n\nThat I was thankful for enough, but it was the reactions of those around me that moved me. When he heard what happened, my roommate (who worked at the same station and whom I had only met a few months before) rushed home immediately to make sure I was okay.\n\nThat night, my fianc\u00e9e drove five hours in a snow storm to get to me, and spent a week with me, and got to meet my coworkers.\n\nI ended up leaving the job two months or so later - a year ago since this past Tuesday. I moved back home with my parents for a few months, and now I\u2019m back in the town where I went to college, working as an admissions counselor for my alma mater.\n\nI married my wife last December, and she has been my saving grace.

I entirely credit her with saving my life, and I never can tell her enough how much I love her.\n\nPeople care about you. You just have to let them in.",
            "Hey I don't know if people will see this but I've been in a deep black hole for a while. It started two years ago, when my best and only friend moved away. I was lonely but it was bearable. Soon I began to like my isolation and would push away any possible friends before they could get close. My inner voice became my friend. But she was a bitch. What started out as little comments on my weight and looks, became worse. It happened so gradually that I never even noticed. I soon lost my love for art; my one passion and flunked my degree. My parents were so angry and disappointed, they thought I was lazy, because I never wanted to get out of bed, I stopped caring for my looks and gained weight. Soon I contemplated suicide. It started out as whispers \"they'd be better off without you\", \"no one cares\", \"you're a disappointment\". I nearly did one night. I sat on the bed with a packet of pills and stared, my parents were on holiday and I was alone. The only thing that stopped me was my mum. Years earlier my biological dad killed himself in front of my mum and she told me how the pain never goes that the suicide victim feels, it just gets passed on to the people they leave behind. I couldn't do that to her or my dad or my family and best friend. Eventually I broke down to my mum. Both my parents and elder brother were amazing, I got so much support and help. \nNow 6 months on I've finished therapy. I'm still on antidepressants but life is looking up. I've started gaining back my confidence and I've got new friends and old ones who have stuck by me.\nI'm hear to say that you can get out that hole. It is possible. It's a bumpy journey with lots of stops and diversions but the same destination-You're happiness. I know not everyone is as lucky as me with supportive parents and friends, but if ANYONE, needs help and support from someone who understands, message me please. You are worth it, you just need to realise it.\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "To be honest, I think about killing myself everyday. The only things stopping me are my husband and dog. \n\nNobody is going to read this since i'm so late  to the post but here it is anyways. I'm sick of having borderline personality disorder. I'm sick of my identity shifting from one day to the next. I'm sick of not being able to follow through with anything. I'm sick of being able to sleep for 24 plus hours straight. I'm sick of people who live full lives and who have never suffered  from mental illness telling me it's going to get better. Because it really hasn't. And even if it does for a little bit it's just going to get worse again. The lows make my life. The highs are extremely rare. There is no neutral. There is no middle of the road. \n\nSometimes I think it's my right to take my own life. I'm the one who has to live it and I honestly don't want to anymore. \n\nThis post is a nice gesture, but in my opinion, I actually think it's near impossible to tell when somebody is truly planning suicide. That's why news like this hit us like a ton of bricks. ",
            "So I\u2019m a big Dungeons and Dragons guy and I belong to a 5th edition Facebook group. One guy posted asking us, \u201cMy DM recently died from suicide, please put him in your games.\u201d So I did. I was wtiting a short game at the time and I named it after this other DM. \nBut I went a step further and I designed a dungeon whose every aspect, every chamber, represented a different mental illness or a mental health challenge. From the kobolds in my village being shunned (the way some people with mental illness are shunned) to the first room needing to be completed in a certain pattern (to represent OCD) to having my players run through a room full of traps (to represent the long, tedious, full-of-bullshit path some people must walk to even access mental health services), it was all about mental health. \n\nI named almost every NPC after classmates/friends I\u2019ve lost to suicide, and simply remembering these people, some for the first time in years, brought tears to my eyes. Siro and Colleen and Nat and Julian and Preston and Nick and more.\n\nIf I could talk to them again, I\u2019d say \u201cEven if we barely knew each other, if you get another go-around and you have these troubles again, come find me and I will listen.\u201d And to all of you now who need it I say PM me and I\u2019ll listen. \n\nI will not report you to the cops or to mental health professionals who\u2019ll just hold you and then slap you with a hospital bill you cannot repay.\n\nI am not a licensed mental health professional.\n\nI HAVE done mental health first aid training. \n\nI AM available 24/7\n",
            "I'm 40 and don't know how to hang on any longer. I've been depressed for almost my entire life, tried every medication out there, therapy, hospitals--nothing has worked and I've lost everything that mattered. I quit my job today because I just can't anymore. It's not so much that I /want/ to kill myself, more that I don't want to be alive, and haven't wanted to be for a very, very long time.\n\nEdit: Want to thank you all for the responses. Too depressed to respond to each one, guess I mostly just wanted to stand up and be counted before leaving. \n\n",
            "So, I'm working my ass off, and barely making ends meet. I have no spare time, no friends, no joy. I live hoping to \"make it.\" It's what keeps the suicidal thoughts at bay. \n\nNow, it seems there's so many successful people committing suicide. It's incredibly discouraging. It's like, even if I get ahead in life, it might still not be worth living. ",
            "I needed this right now. I\u2019m high key suicidal and just feel so alone. I want to reach out, but my mom just throws homeopathic remedies and herbal supplements at me and tells me I have nothing to be sad about because my life is good. I had no idea where to turn for help but this is so useful and I feel ready to talk about it. Cutting this short before I go too deep into my mind, but thank you OP. I needed this. ",
            "I just wanted to add my story to the pile as sometimes its nice to know that things can get better.\n\nThe last three years I've been battling with my suicidal tendencies since being diagnosed with severe Major Depression Disorder. It has been a battle that many people fail to notice when I meet with them or talk to them so I always encourage others to approach their loved ones if there is an inkling of an idea that something is up; people may never answer you but knowing that there is that potential support can sometimes be what a person needs.\n\nContinuing on, April 1st I attempted suicide after another spiraling episode of intrusive thoughts wanting me to kill myself. I thought I had them under control all week and then I just broke and told myself, \"this is the day I die\". I prepared everything, cleaned my room, headed back home, left a note, and a final message in my family group chat and went out into the woods to die. I can't tell you why I did not go through with it, I think it was because I knew that there was always going to be a way to push through what was happening, that sometimes the irrational thoughts are like a stranglehold on your mind. I decided on a hill, next to my house where I used to play in as a kid, that I would not give in to this disease. I waited till my family started calling my name, since that would be the moment I knew the cops would be coming, and walked down to wait to be petitioned into the hospital.\n\nMy time there was aggravating, humiliating, but utterly essential to my survival. I was able for 8 days to unpack my life and see what I had, what I lost, and where I wanted to go. I could finally take a second to breathe. That's what depression has always felt like to me, taking one long breathe and hoping you can last long enough to get through the run. I got help, proper medication, and took a long hard look at myself and realized what needed to happen.\n\nTwo months later after I tried to play a sick april fool's joke on myself I'm at a study abroad program on scholarship, I successfully finished the most difficult portion of my biochemistry degree this year, and when I arrive back into the states I'll have enough money to adopt a dog, which is something I've wanted since I was a kid.\n\nI have lapses, just had one this week actually to be quite honest, but the world gets a little brighter, a little lighter, and a little less tiring when you start listening to yourself and tell yourself, \"I deserve to give myself another chance. I deserve to keep trying\". I'm not a romantic when it comes to these things, I stared at the abyss just the same as many people who will have read this. Hell I don't expect many people to even read this fully. But if you did, be strong friend, be ferocious in your fervor for life. do not fail, do not tire, do not falter. This life will always be yours for the taking, go  find your peace in this world and your piece of this world. \n\nGo forth and conquer my friends\n\nTL;DR : The demons of our minds are scary, but even they will learn to fear your resolve.",

            "Honestly everyone, this thread timing could not possible have been better for me.\n\nI've been having fallouts with my mother for too long now, on issues we just can't simply agree on. Problem is, even though I am working constantly and trying to find a better job to move out, it just isn't enough and it gets to me.\n\nI had to walk to work today because they took my keys, and I honestly have been thinking about the best points in town to jump from. Seeing this helped me realize just now that a lot of people, strangers even, will still care. It makes me a bit more determined to push through this and not give up...",
            "Shitty child and my parents divorce gave me depression before I knew what it was. I remember being like 6 and telling my mom I wanted to be dead and didn\u2019t really want to be here anymore. She told me that life is full of ups and downs and that I should never want to give up and then I remember her saying that once you\u2019re gone, there is no coming back, people will cry and will be heart broken, they will always remember you but they will have to continue with their lives and move on. It was a dark reality as a child bot knowing why was scary. I was suicidal for years, not caring about myself. I had a pistol in my mouth more than I\u2019d like to admit. I was the most fun guy at all the parties but dying inside. Sometimes cutting myself to feel something. \nThen it happened, a few years after high school my best friend, after being accepted at a big 10 college and getting scholarships, he washed his truck, cleaned his room and went and bought a box of hunting shells and blew his head off in a park a few miles from his house. No reason. No note. After They police asked if I knew who\u2019s phone number was in his pocket. It was my new cell number. I was devastated and confused,hurt, mad and just sad. I still, to this day would will never forget that he could have just called me and talked. My depression got worse through out the years after loosing both my parents to cancer and my sister to an overdose 3 years ago. BUT I WILL NEVER GIVE UP. I WILL NEVER DO THAT WHICH WAS DONE TO ME. Get help, talk to your friends, talk to a counselor, BUT ALSO be a good listener and a good friend. Someone just might need your help without straight out asking for it. Be there for each other. Never give up. ",
            "19 years ago I had my suicide planned out and had everything ready to follow through. Date and time picked out and everything.  I was in a place so dark that even the concept of light and joy were inconceivable to me. \n\nI was absolutely and utterly convinced that my family was going to be better off without me. That the world would be better off without me. If I had known a way to go back in time to ensure I had never existed I would have. \n\nMy grandmother told me from a very young age that my birth was a mistake and that I was unwanted.  She told me I was unlovable and that if anyone ever told me they loved me it would be to use me.  This is something i still struggle with now even knowing it is absolute bullshit.  \n\nI then reported my grandfather, her husband, for sexual and physical abuse at the age of 14.  I never lied about this or anything else that happened. I know now that this was the right choice. However, it tore my family and my world apart at that time.  My parents were great and supportive.  My father was absolutely crushed that his father was doing what he was. My mother was distraught that she had missed the signs. My grandmother called me an attention seeking whore and told anyone who would listen that I was a slut who had seduced him.  \n\nAunts and uncles tore me apart for airing family business and not allowing family to take care of it.  My brother was too young to understand what was going on and was very close to the grandparents so he believed my grandmother when she said I lied about all of it. \n\nI was 19 yrs old and planned to die on my 20th birthday. Figured it would save my parents some money if they got a head stone with fewer characters to engrave. \n\nI was killing a lot of time on the internet, chatting with strangers, taking stupid quizzes etc when I met a stranger who lived 3000 miles away from me through one of those quizzes. We started talking.  He asked how I was and how my days were, what I had done and what my plans were.  \n\nA complete stranger took an interest in what I was doing and how I was doing.  I found myself sharing my story with him and he listened without judgment. I told him things I hadn't told anyone else and he listened without judgment.  I was never going to meet him so it didn't matter what he said. \n\nThese conversations started to crack the shell of darkness around me and I began to see light again.  The thought of my impending suicide didn't bring as much comfort as it once had.  These conversations changed my perspective.  I was able to see that I was not the villain or the bad guy. I was able to see the pain and anguish these 5 years had put my parents and sister through. I could suddenly see the fear and anger and hatred (towards herself and her husband) that drove my grandmother's narrative.  \n\nI should be clear that my immediate family were checking on me and were worried about me. They were expressing interest and concern but I couldn't see it. My depression was too deep. I know it would have caused a lot of pain and sorrow had I died then but in that place I couldn't see that. I thought my death would bring relief and peace.  I know better now.  \n\nI met that internet stranger 4 months after we started communicating online. Married him 6 months after that. We're still married and have a 15 year old son.  Life isn't always easy and it would be a lie to say that suicide never occurred to me now. There are moments when I'm driving home and I think how easy it would be to drive off the road. I don't actually want to and wouldn't follow through but it happens. \n\nIf you are still reading this, I guess my message is to reach out to strangers. Say hello. Ask them how they are and mean it. Be willing to be a friend or a shoulder if you find someone in need.  You never know if your hello will be the crack in their shell that lets the light back in.  I chose life because of a stranger's kindness. \n\nTL:DR: I planned to commit suicide on my 20th birthday due to some fucked up events in my life and terrible self image. An internet stranger asked me how I was doing and meant it. Saved my life. Now he's stuck with me. I chose life. Hardest choice of my life but I'm so glad I made the choice I did. ",

            "I recently had one of my best friends end his life when he went to college.  I really do think about him every day.  He affected everyone in our hometown.  I'm not saying it just to say it, he was truly the person that got along with everyone.  The only person I knew that had everyone's sense of humor, no matter the person.  I looked up to him, and my brother, who was also very close with him, always concurred with me when he would come up in conversation and one of us would say that we could see him being famous, or being the president.  When his college friends found him, he was unconscious but he still had a pulse.  He was airlifted from his campus to the hospital and we were told he was in a coma due to the amount of oxygen he lost after hanging himself.  He never woke up from his coma.  But the doctors told us he could hear us, something in his brain was being monitored and it responded to his mother talking to him.  All of his closest friends got together on his final night before the parents would sign off to having him taken off life support.  It didn't feel real.  We were 10 hours away, but we we're lucky to have been able to FaceTime his mother as she put the phone up to his ear, and we all sais our goodbyes.  My heart sank when it was my turn, I hadn't planned on doing that for another 60 years.  I had to say goodbye to one of my closest friends on FaceTime.  Noone should ever have to do that.  After the call ended, we all just sat in silence.  I got a text the next day from my friend, who is very close with the mother of my friend who passed.  She wanted to tell us all that as we were saying our goodbyes, a tear went down his face and she couldn't get the words out to tell us on the call.  Something from a movie right? I like to believe that he knew how much we loved him when he passed.  It's still so surreal even to think about it.  It truly can be anyone, even if that person brings a smile to everyone else's face, please, I beg you to look out for the people around you.  The pain still won't stop.  I still think about him everyday.  I'll never stop thinking about him.  When I turn 18, I will get a tattoo in memory of him.  But for right now, I do this thing where I write down a memory I shared with him every time I think of a new one.  I have little journal with his name on it.  A lot of the time it's memories that the only the two of us shared, but since he's gone I must write them down and keep them alive.   Memories fade, but not when they're written down.   Please be good to each other.  ",
            "I think a major thing to realize about depression is when you're stuck in that black hole it's so incredibly difficult to reach out for help, even if you logically know it's there. You tell yourself it won't help, that no one really wants to listen to you, or you're too tired, that you'll be judged, a million reasons to talk yourself out of it. \n\nSo while I think the flood of \"if anyone ever wants to talk, my Facebook messages/DMs/whatever are open\" are well-intentioned, and maybe some people will be spurred to reach out, in most cases people who are caught in depression need people to reach out directly to them. \n\nKnowing the signs for depression, being on the look out, and reaching out directly to friends and acquaintances to check on them is much more effective in this case than waving a flag and saying \"I'm here to talk,\" as kind of a gesture as it may be.

We were working on our relationship after a breakup and we starting doing better, she found work, we both started working out, we both stopped drinking.

Also I did not feel the same love from her as before. She basically said go fix yourself then we can talk. I have almost never felt more alone despite people telling me that it's better off this way. I just want to give up. I'm sure no one wants to here this. Blah blah relationship bullshit.\n\nEdit: I asked her for help multiple times. She said she doesn't think she can help me or offer me what i need.. I just wanted love and support.\n\nEdit 2: I want to thank everyone for all the amazing responses and support.

He and his brother have been my best friends since I was 5 (now 24), and despite how close we both were to him, he never gave us a chance to help. None of us saw it coming - in fact, we all thought of him as the last person to do such a thing. The fact that he never once spoke to anyone, not even his own brother - his biggest confidant his whole life - about how he was feeling is still torturing me to this day. He was always the life of the party, and always knew how to brighten your mood.. and it kills me inside to know that he felt he couldn\u2019t share this with any of us, or that he couldn\u2019t express how he truly felt. I just wish I could have talked to him.

            "No disrespect to this thread, but these websites do not help the problem at all. Such as most suicide hotlines, if you reach rock bottom in life and call them for help to talk about it they will track your location down and police will take you to a mental hospital without your consent, when you get out, slam you with medical bills many people can't pay, put you on a presceiption plan for pills, and assume you're treated. This is a huge problem in the mental health community- people with suicidal tendencies  are not calling for help out of fear of this.\n\n There are newer, safer numbers you can contact if you seriously need to talk that have a strict policy that they cannot call the police on you.

            "These threads are helpful - but only to a point.\n\nWhat needs to change is how we view and talk about suicide and WHY it's done.  We need to learn how to handle when someone is reaching out for help or talking about it.  Even in the main thread, there's lots of talk around how folks who are in this place 'should talk to someone' or 'there should have been a sign'.\n\nThat's the problem.  Lots of people who are in this place DO try to talk to people.  THERE ARE SIGNS.  \n\nI'm one of those people.  \n\nYou know what happens when I try to talk to folks about my feelings of suicide when Im in that place?  \"Oh, you're being dramatic\".  Or I'm told \"things can't be that bad\".  Or they just flat out recoil in horror when I  say something along the lines that I don't want to live anymore.  I/folks like me then spend more time assuring the other person that things are ok - regardless of the fact that we're still hurting.\n\nAll of the hotlines in the world won't make a lick of difference until we, as a society, learn how to talk about this without gaslighting or flipping the fuck out at people who desperately need the help.\n\nI'm fortunate.  I have a very small handful of people in my life that would drop anything they were doing and come just BE with me if I needed them to.  But it's only because I've been honest with them about my struggles and they've taken time to learn how to respond in a constructive way.\n\nBut if those folks ever disappear?  This will be me.

It gives you the tools to understand and cope with your problem, but the execution is up to you.\n\nNot going to lie, that shit is WAY harder than anyone thinks it is. To change a mindset ingrained into you from childhood from abuse or trauma is incredibly difficult, but once you start it gets addictive. The first time I went to gym in years, the first time I looked at a sunrise and REALLY knew what people meant when they said they loved them. Nothing in my life had ever compared to that.\n\nThings get better, no matter where you are.

            "I have lost 2 people in my life to suicide. My cousin and my best friend. My cousin went downhill very fast, he began taking drugs and his girlfriend had had enough and told him she was leaving and packed her bags. A few hours after leaving my cousin ended his own life and was found by his youngest daughter who refused to leave with her mother.\n\nMy best friend had turned his life around. In school he had weight problems and by the second year of college had lost over 70lbs. But it wasnt enough, he still struggled and it became too much. I blame myself every day for his death because I didn't reach out to him, we hadn't spoken in over a year but still considered him best friend. The reason we hadn't spoken or seen each other was because we were suffering with social anxiety. I was in the middle of of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) when I got the news and my world kind of fell apart as I intended on getting him out to have a drink once I was done. I have 2 tattoos on my wrists that are dedicated to him. Both of them are the names of our favourite songs from the same band. We always fought over which was better. ",
            "My mom commit suicide when I was 12. I\u2019m still very upset about it. I feel like it is a thing that needs to be noticed more than it is, and I\u2019d like to thank you for the Megathread.",

I was walking between campus buildings, saw a car drive down the street, and thought about walking out in the middle of the road. Another time, I looked at a roof access door and wondered if it was locked, thinking \"it would be so easy.\" I'm a lot better now.\n\nWhat scares me looking back is the difference from then to now. Now I would think those things and immediately shake it off. At the time, the thought just sat there. That was the darkest place I've ever been, and the closest I've ever come. I thank my lucky stars it's never been as close as some. Take care of yourselves folks. This version of \"normal\" doesn't have to be the norm.",

Bourdain is one of my biggest role models in life, so needless to say today is rough, but this end doesn\u2019t have to be for everybody. When you feel like imploding, that\u2019s the time to scream for help because there are countless people who are ready willing and prepared to hear you.

            "Don't let your friends slip through the cracks. Sometimes when people stop reaching out it's easy to think that their busy, that life is just getting in the way, that they will come to you if they need something. Don't make that mistake, understand that the deeper into that hole you fall, the harder it is to become to reach out. Don't pressure them to talk about their problems, but remind them that you are there if they need you, that you well and truly care. But most importantly it's not enough to say it once, remind them. Annoy them with how much you care. Don't let them ever fucking forget it.\n\nHumans are social creatures, we NEED to feel a sense of community, to feel connected, to feel loved. And as far as going beyond your friend group; be kind to strangers, help that random person struggling on the street, smile at the guy standing by himself on the subway. \nThe hardest thing to do when you're struggling is to reach out to others, so we need to reach out to them. Give people a reason to want to be alive. \n\nEdit: everyone has their own capacity for hardship. The person that just lost their job could be struggling more than the person that watched their mother die in front of them. It doesn't matter what they are going through, what matters is how they feel. ",
            "I have dealt with depressions and suicidal thoughts most of my life. I\u2019ve had an ex and several friends through out my life commit suicide. I\u2019ve always been told it\u2019s genetic. My fathers 3 aunts committed  suicide when he was young.  He has also had issues with depression throughout his life. One day he could tell I was in a dark place and drove to my house just to sit with me for 4 hours and talk.\n\nDuring that time he gave me some of the best advice that I continue to use everyday. \n\n1.When you are in a dark place make a sort of pros and cons list about how you\u2019re feeling. Do not cheat yourself, be honest. It can\u2019t all be cons. There are plenty of amazing things you have done, witnessed, or enjoyed as a pro. \n2. Cry! I joke that I cry twice a year. I\u2019ve never been super emotional. But when I\u2019m \u201cgoing dark\u201d I cry some but then feel weak. Don\u2019t! Crying helps us to deal with all of the emotions that get bottled up. It helps so much to release your fears, worries, and sadness with a good cry.\n3. Create a story/narrative to think about when these thoughts enter your mind. Maybe it\u2019s a memory that you like to replay. Mine is a mix of memory and fantasy. Become the hero of this narrative. When it is grounded in reality, your more likely to pay attention to it and in turn yourself. \n4. This is my saving grace and happened by accident. I rescued a small dog a few years back during all of this. He is my constant companion. The one I look forward to coming home to. He makes me laugh and love in a way I never thought I could.\n5. Lastly, and lately one of this biggest pieces of advice I come back to is look at what is going on in your life at that time. Stress and anxiety only add to your sense of uselessness and lack of control. When financially, school, work, or relationships are not panning our the way you thought they should it pushes you back into the worst version of yourself if you deal with depression. I am a control freak, when things don\u2019t work out the way I thought they should I stop trying. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. Stop. Think. Plan. If those things are not going in your favor, how do you change it? Plan out how you can help those things improve. Acknowledge that some of it will be out of your control. That\u2019s fine. Focus instead on the parts you can control. \n\nThis advice has helped me change my outlook on life and the way I think. Anytime, no matter how big or small, I come back to this list and feel a sense of control and peace. Anyone dealing with depression gives up because we loose our sense of purpose and control. Continue to remind yourself everyday what you are capable of. \n\nThis quote always resonates with me and I hope it will for everyone who reads this post because it reminds me how I feel during those times and why it\u2019s not worth it: \n\n\u201cThere is a very specific kind of person whose relieved when death finally comes. The stress of try over and over again; trying to get it right, is a lot. Too much sometimes.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need to get it right every time. Live, love, and enjoy the people, things, and events in your life!! Cliche, but you are loved! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
            "When I was just stepping into double-digit years, I was already deeply depressed. My home life was tough, and my social life was non-existent. I was too shy to make friends or tell the boy I liked that I had a crush on him.\n\nThis boy was so cool, I thought. Gothic, wore Tripp pants, knew everything about DBZ. He cut himself and courted death. I was too afraid to follow suit, so we just amplified each other's depressions. I started thinking about suicide a lot.\n\nThen, my uncle shot himself in the head. He left a note, but I couldn't read it. It made me think - What would I write in mine? If I was dying, what would I tell everyone in my life? I wrote a note. I would never have acted on it, had my parents not found it, read all of my personal writing, and put me on medication. My brother told me, \"it doesn't matter what happens to you. In my eyes, you're already dead anyway.\"\n\nOn medication, I stopped being afraid. I started cutting, picked up an eating disorder, and started stashing pills to OD. My only outlet, writing, wasn't safe anymore. When I finally opened up to my friends about what the meds were doing to me (shortly after my cousin hung himself), they told my mother, who locked me in a mental institution. When she finally took me out, she said if I ever showed negative emotion or talked about my depression again, she'd send me right back.\n\nI did get switched to a new psychiatrist, which helped. I eventually started flushing my pills. My mother, when she found out, told me I owe her money for what I hadn't taken. A small price to pay for happiness. I had to stop going to therapy when my mother refused to take me or help me pay for it anymore (I was seventeen, just getting into a relationship that almost got me raped).\n\nNow that I'm older, I see suicide much differently. I could never do it to my dad, my bother, my friends, or my kitty. Saying I live for a D&D party and a pet might sound silly, but it's more than I had then. They're important to me, and I feel important to them. I don't think I could put them through what my family went through when my uncle went, you know?",

            "As a psychiatrist I get to witness the thought process of a lot of suicidal people. One theme that comes up again and again is, \"my family will be better off without me.\" It's a cruel trick the depressed mind plays on itself. I also get to see the aftermath of suicide, and I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, they are NOT better off without you. If you ever have that thought, take it as a flaming red flag that you need to get to a doctor, ASAP. Don't think about it, just go. ",
            "I nearly threw myself off Multnomah Falls about five years ago. My then-wife was cheating on me with my best friend and had taken off w/our kids to the east coast. I'd visited that place with her the year before. A little kid gave me 'a magic stick' on the way up to 'help my journey'. Still not sure what stopped me, but I remember crying in the parking lot for an hour before driving around OR aimlessly and calling a friend.\n\nI ended up in Venice a few years later and texted that friend w/a photo to tell them I was really happy I didn't die.

You've got to start moving; you might still be soaked and have no clue where to go but anything you do is better than sitting in the rain.

            "I never believed \"It gets better\". For a decade of my life I would hear this phrase without seeing results. At two points in my life I prepared to kill myself.

I now have too many hobbies for a 24hr day, I'm in a top tier graduate school (amazing considering my shit grades in college), I have a super healthy long term relationship, and I live 90&#37; of my days content/happy.\n\nObviously everyone is different, but I thought I'd share the lifestyle changes that helped me the most:\n\n1. I moved to a new large community that is more accepting of my lifestyle and have learned to be unapologetically me. I no longer live to please people who don't love me or fit in to groups that aren't me. As I've become comfortable in my own skin, people with a similar nature have been attracted to me and i've made more better friends.\n2. I learned the value of being honest and communicating my feelings and abilities. For example, too many friends have been lost by mistaking my absence as a rejection. Now, if I need alone time and someone wants to hang, I'll just say \"I need to recharge and have some alone time tonight\" rather than ignoring the text or avoiding them. People are much more understanding and often lend support instead of retracting. Additionally, this includes being honest with myself about my abilities/sleep requirements/etc.\n3. I force myself to leave my apartment and walk \\>1mile every day.\n4. I take time to know myself. For a while I didn't know what triggered suicidal thoughts, what made me feel better when I was down, or how to predict how I will feel in certain situations. Through a combination of self reflection, mindfulness, and reading I can now sense the early signs of a depressive period and try different strategies to arrest it.\n5.

            "I'm sure this will get buried but I will contribute. I struggle with suicidal thoughts pretty frequently, mostly due to bipolar disorder and crippling depression. It takes a lot of courage to be open about it to someone but I do daily to keep myself safe and honest. My husband is my biggest support and reminds me that there are always more reasons to stay than there are to go. My best friend knows that if I get distant, it's time for her to get on my ass and remind me that I am more than what my thoughts claim. Just remember that suicidal thoughts are in your head and your head isn't always a place of reality. The first step is accepting what's rational and what isn't. In the time, it feels like the only choice but it isn't. It's a selfish path that only hurts people who care about you, whether you are aware that they do or not. Be courageous and live. Stick it to the man, prove statistics wrong, do whatever you have to so that you don't contribute even more heartbreak in a world that is already sad. \n\nAs for suicide prevention for those who do not suffer from these debilitating thoughts - be kind to one another. Make sure those you care about know that you do and why they mean so much to you. It could literally be life or death if you don't. You never know just how big an impact your words make until that impact you made can no longer be altered. \n\nSidenote: Pressing post is terrifying. ",
            "My best friend shot himself in the head eight years ago, when we were 22 and just about to finish college. I found him. \n\nWe\u2019d known each other really well, and as anyone who knew him well would tell you, he was a very passionate and emotional guy \u2014 but he was also a tough guy, a bit of a warrior. He was an advanced martial artist, and I don\u2019t mean he had a black belt, I mean he had belts... he loved the discipline and rules. \n\nHe approached everything that way. He was a wizard at Halo and pretty much any game we played, because he would go into maps alone and practice angles and jumps. He cleaned meticulously. He was well-groomed, and stayed up to date on fashion. \n\nI guess he was a perfectionist, but then again, most of our circle was. He had expectations for his life, and as far as I could tell they were falling into place: he had a loving girlfriend, funding and mentors for the martial arts school he wanted to apply his degree towards, and a gorgeous car. Ostensibly, he had it all. \n\nI look back on that day and for some reason don\u2019t feel the responsibility or guilt a lot of people do; he gave no indicators at all, and we talked deeply and often. It wasn\u2019t premeditated, and that might have something to do with it. \n\nYou see, Chris and I were supposed to hang out the next morning. Smoke a joint, play video games, enjoy our Christmas break on a Saturday. Apparently the night before, he\u2019d gone to his girlfriend\u2019s choir party \u2014 he wasn\u2019t looking forward to it, because these were adults who liked to sing in late gatherings and that\u2019s not Chris. I knew he wasn\u2019t happy about going, so he fortified himself with beer. His girlfriend texted me to tell me they\u2019d gotten into a fight and he\u2019d left, and that she was worried about him driving. I texted him, and knew that he\u2019d gotten home because his xbox was logged into and he\u2019d read my message. \n\nI called and texted him the next morning, waiting for him to swing by and scoop me up. He never responded, so I got worried. I was afraid he\u2019d gone out and DWI\u2019d himself into some mess, so I went over to his house. His car was there, but he wasn\u2019t answering the door, so I figured he\u2019d gotten blackout drunk and was out of it. I snagged his key from the hiding place and let myself in. \n\nI knew something was wrong instantly. There were a bunch of holes in the hallway, and I knew him well enough to know that he\u2019d punched them. One hole stood out, because it was much smaller than the others. I rounded the corner and there he was, me realizing the small hole was a bullet hole that had exited. \n\nIt hurts me so badly, still. ",
            "I appreciate the intention going in to a thread like this, and all the various people sharing their own issues - but I can't help but feel like as usual we aren't addressing one of the biggest issues here. Why are people getting depressed to begin with? Why are people getting to the point where they feel like they have no alternative? Hotlines, websites and therapists are perhaps a solution to the problem once it already has arisen but they don't *prevent* the years of built up issues people carry with them. \n\nNobody commits suicide because one thing went wrong. They get to that point because of a thousands of little cuts that wore away at them until eventually they couldn't manage to go any further, until eventually they weren't able to simply bare the weight, to 'deal with it'. \n\nWe've all implicitly agreed upon a society in which needs, desires and expectations are often far greater, higher and more complicated than they need to be. A society in which millions of people struggle daily to survive, let alone to find satisfaction or fulfillment in their day to day. A society of stress, worry, anxiety, social pressures, economic issues and constant gnawing monotonous nonsense that no one wants to deal with. We live in a society in which someone who is wealthy, successful, has a child and at several points had a loving relationship, a wide circle of friends, high social standing, a career most would envy and more wonderful experiences than many people will ever come close to having came to the conclusion that he needed to kill himself. That despite all the good in his life he couldn't bare the weight of living. A lot of people struggle with that, that someone could have so much and yet still not be able to pull through - but it's not what he had, it's what he thought. \n\nThe same goes for any of us - there are a select few on this rock capable of being content and satisfied with what they have, but they got that way either through blind luck or purposeful determination. We all know we ought to be at the very least content with what we have, knowing full well how many others have far less, but that's never really enough, is it? That knowledge never changes the way you treat the world around you, even if you want it to. Everybody wants to seize the day until they remember they have to save their pay check to cover x,y,z and they can't travel this year because of unexpected costs and their mother is getting worse in health and their hours at work got cut back and their car needs new break pads and their child needs braces and on, and on, and on. Even the richest and most privileged among us are dealing with similar issues, and they fall prey to it all the same. Sooner or later that becomes too much for some people. We've *all* thought about it, at one point or another. Some have tried and failed and come out the other side a better person for it. Some have tried and succeeded, and as for them we'll never know. \n\nPeople want to blame depression, or mental illness or any number of other single factors, but I think we need to accept that the world we've made is not very conducive to happiness, for a great many different reasons. We need to change that. I don't know how...",
            "I'm not willing to open up on reddit about it, but I am seeing a therapist who seems to care about my wellbeing. I did want to bring up on this topic- why is the media (and reddit, heavily) publicizing the suicide of Avicii, Spade, and Bourdain? It's been shown that when they publicize suicide, suicide rates go up (see [Robin Williams](http://time.com/5137194/robin-williams-suicide-rate/)). \"Everyday people\" don't get this much media attention over it, they usually censor it for a reason. It's almost worse, in that spiraling line of depressed thinking \"This person had all these things, money, fame, love, success, and they still aren't happy- what reason do I have?\" and they may lose a significant amount of hope that things will ever get better, or are even able to get better. I get that those things don't make a person truly happy nor can counteract clinical depression/anxiety/PTSD, but when you get into one of those funks, it's very hard to think clearly. My friend's aunt who has a long history of depression and suicidal ideation was saying almost this exact thing when they were playing Avicii on the news repeatedly, and my friend was so worried she sat outside her door while she took a bath to make sure she was washing in there.\n\nI guess there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it (publicize) but it's really seeming to be saturated currently.",

Sleeping pills, my prescriptions (antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers), and on the last attempt was a benzo, Ativan. A couple months after my 14th birthday. The attempts started when I was 12 and I never really knew why I wanted to do it. I\u2019m not depressed. I don\u2019t really hate myself.

About halfway through the school year, I went from the honor roll to failing a good portion of my classes. It wasn't long after that I took a razor to my wrists. I'm still not sure anyone noticed. It was the failing grades that got my parents to care and I was taken to my doctor. First, they tried Prozac which only made me worse, then Welbutrin which did nothing, finally they gave me Effexor. It helped. \n\nMaybe if I just stopped there this wouldn't be as bad, but my life got worse. In my senior year of high school, there was a car crash and it killed 3 out of 4 of my friends. Once again I fell through the cracks of my own family and the system. No one was there for me, no one noticed how lost I was. Because by this time I became damn good at hiding my pain and problems. I learned from the last time. If my grades suffer, people will notice, so my grades didn't suffer this time. I just bottled everything up and dealt with none of it. \n\nEventually, I graduated college and got married. This second decision was probably the worst one of my life. I married an abuser. It took 8 years for me to break away. By this time I had learned the value of getting help. I found a new shrink. (The old one from my teens and 20s retired.) She diagnosed me with PTSD, depression, GAD, Panic Disorder, and ADHD. \n\nI trained my dog to be a service dog. I told both my MD shrink and my PhD shrink everything. I worked on getting better. Between the three of us, the last time I got suicidal was talked through and my medication adjusted. I didn't actually attempt anything. \n\nI'm now training a new service dog since my other is too old. I'm alive. Some days I even resemble happy. I can see a light at the end of this very very shitty tunnel and for once it isn't death. ",

            "I don\u2019t honestly remember a time when I *haven\u2019t* wanted to die in some capacity. It\u2019s not the sort of thing you can just bring up in polite company and at this point I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019d be like without those impulses. I had a friend kill himself when I was eighteen, though, and I haven\u2019t been able to make another attempt without thinking of the way his little brother just....crumpled and broke down sobbing in the middle of giving his eulogy. \n\nI\u2019ve never been able to figure out if I\u2019m a little bit grateful to him for that or not, as awful as that sounds.",
            "Suicide is something I've been thinking about for about 2-3 years now. Anyone close to me I have ever tried to reach out to has never even attempted to listen. I've been told by friends or family members that I just need to \"cheer up\" more times than I can count. Most often, the people I spoke to would change the subject or tell me I'm just being a downer and need to \"wake up\" and be an adult. \n\nWhen I was finally able to get professional help aboout a year ago, I felt a little better because I at least had someone to talk to even though I had to pay them to do it. Felt like I had at least one person who was on my side and the medication was starting to even me out. Thing is, I don't need a friend or family to \"help\" me, I just want someone to take me seriously. I've learned people who don't have depression or anxiety are never really going to understand and that's okay. As long someone is still willing to be around after a bad day. \n\nNow though, I was laid off from work after a company merger and have not been able to afford medication nor a therapist in months, and I'm about to lose my housing with no where to really turn. All the friends I used to have left around the time I was seeking professional help. The only reason I'm still here right now is because I don't want to leave my cats alone. And as for work, I've had more interviews than I can count but absolutely no job offers. I've been trying but well, that doesn't seem to do much of anything but drain me of energy.\n\nThis is the first time I've been able to even let anything like this out because where the fuck else would I even try? I don't have anyone in my life anymore who would care and the internet sure doesn't give a shit. \n\nFor those people who want to help anyone with depression or anxiety, all you really need to do is listen; *show* you're listening. We know you can't really understand because you've never had it, but just being around helps. \n\nAs for me, I still don't know what to do. ",
            "There's all this talk about how hard it is to tell when another person is suicidal, or approaching it...but how do you tell when YOU'RE approaching suicidal?  I've never attempted, or really considered it, but the fact that it now feels in the realm of *possibility* now worries me.  \n\nI'm afraid to talk to friends and family, because they're probably going to panic, over react, patronize or treat me like a \"patient.\"  I don't want any of that.  I guess I need to talk with others who may have...been there?  I guess?  I don't know...",

            "My sisters best friend committed suicide just over a year ago. He was bullied most of his life and basically disowned by his dad for being gay. I got a call from my sister saying \"Steve killed himself.\" Once she calmed down, she explained that he slit his wrists and then jumped off of [this bridge](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7cb80f32e212a57004a4b659101b674c95f7456/c=169-0-2751-1941&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/2014/12/04/635532813109155115-Zilwaukee-Bridge.jpg). He was flamboyant and I loved him to death. He taught me to drive a manual trans car when I was 15. He was my nephews \"other godmother\" and was just a happy guy. He had fought with depression for years and was being medicated. He had just seen my sister the week prior as they were working on remodeling her kitchen. It came as a total shock to us and my sister is still having some serious lingering pain from it. She is  RN, he was a LPN and she was under the impression his current cocktail of anti depressants were working. :( ",
            "Actually, I\u2019ve always wanted to ask: if someone is feeling suicidal, should they go to the emergency room? \n\nLike, where is the best place to go to get immediate treatment?",
            "Please understand that many cannot understand the suicidal pain. The \"get a dog\" and \"go get some fresh air\" advice is a temporary fix. But most people have temporary or situational depression so these tips are said in sincereity, because it works for them. They aren't brushing off your pain. They simply can't fathom it. That is why professional help is important. Good luck.  ",
            "On May 24th 2010 I was barefoot standing on the edge of a bridge over a river in winter. It was around 3 AM. No one else around. It looked really appealing, being in that cold water. It felt like a minute of panic followed by peace forever. \n\nI was far away from home, failing school, failing at a relationship and failing myself. I had failed so much that I was tired of myself. I had substance abuse issues and (I was pretty sure) undiagnosed mental health issues that ran in my family. I didn't want to be around anymore. \n\nIt wasn't the thought of my family, or the thought of my (now ex) girlfriend that stopped me. It was a very small, very quiet thought that held my bare feet in place. \n\n\"You're better than this.\"\n\nI'm happy I listened to that thought. I had no reason to at the time. Everything was wrong but I listened anyway and walked away from that river. I moved back home - found a temporary job - went to 4 different therapists until I found someone who clicked with me. I tackled my substance abuse issues, changed my major, went back to school. I got diagnosed as bipolar and went on medication routines and to support groups. My relationship didn't work out, too much damage, and I'll always regret how I was back then... But I found someone else who understands me and the journey I've been through, someone ready to listen, ready to respect me when I deserve it and to remind me when I don't. I got a job - I got an apartment - I got a life. I'm off prescription meds and holding together with diet, lifestyle and mindfulness.\n\nI'm happy I listened to myself. Please, for everyone out there in pain who feels like there's no other way out... It's worth it to stick around, to discover how much joy could be waiting around the bend. Life is so short and so transient. It's worth it. You are loved. \n\nHave a gorgeous day everyone.",
            "As a teenager, I can understand if my story is not taken as seriously because \"I have only felt the tip of the dick that is life\". But I really want to share my story.\n\nI come from an ethnic family, so there was the obvious problem of racism since I was very young. It's much better now, but I can still feel people silently judging me because of the colour of my skin. I've had it pretty tough, being called things like \"n**ger\" and \"mudskin\". I mean, I was once even encouraged to commit suicide so there would be, and I quote, \"less of your people in the world\". Along with recent breakups and heartbreaking deaths, I was really pushed over the edge.\n\nThe straw that broke the proverbial camel's back for me was the death of my best friend. He went through some tough things in life and decided one day that it was enough. Before he jumped, he texted me saying he couldn't do this anymore. Me, being the wonderful person I am /s, told him to \"f*** off and stop disturbing me, I'm trying to revise\". I remember that afternoon every single night when I get into bed, and it will haunt me for the rest of my life. See, he'd already mentioned multiple times he wanted to die over the course of our friendship but, for lack of a better term, he chickened out every single. At that point, I was so sure he wouldn't do it. So sure he wouldn't go to the bridge. So sure he wouldn't think about how even his best friend had abandoned him. So sure he wouldn't jump.\n\nI was wrong. \n\nI pass that bridge every single day as I go to school, and every single day I see him standing there. I hear him ask me why I didn't stop him. Every. Single. Day.\n\nAround a month after he died(this was some time in 2013 btw), I was done with life. I honestly thought I had nothing to live for. I starved myself and started cutting, hanging out with bad crowds. I watched the most scariest things I could find just to make myself feel something. Anything. I couldn't.\n\nAround June-July time, I was ready to join my mate. I thought of the different ways I could end myself, and ended up googling quick painless ways of death. I would read articles for hours and hours. I had reached the lowest point of my life. \n\nNow I'm a massive fan of Youtube and go on it without fail every single day. I had become obsessed with the videos of one particular channel called iiSuperwomanii. On this day, I was feeling incredibly low and was ready to end it all. I watched some videos on Youtube and saw that Superwoman(a.k.a Lilly) had uploaded a video called \"Draw My Life\". That video revealed a lot of personal stuff about Lilly, but the bit that caught me was that she had also been through depression. The video, most importantly, inspired me to not give up just yet. I became determined to turn my life around, because if Superwoman could then so could I.\n\nIt took me a couple of days, but I finally built up the courage to talk to my parents about everything. They were in tears and hugging me, comforting me. I requested some help and they said they'd always be there, but I said that I meant therapy. \n\nIt took a long, LONG time because you can never just get rid of your past, but I have changed completely as a person in those 5 years. I've made so many strong friendships, been in relationships and had my heart broken, found the perfect girl who I've been with for a year and 3 months. It will never truly go away, but I've learnt to live with that and live in the present.\n\nMy advice to anyone going through depression, suicidal thoughts and just feeling pretty damn low is that it really does get better. That's not just some generic clich\u00e9 everyone says to \"sad\" people to make them feel better, it does. You can either give life one more chance and make some awesome memories, or be at the bottom of a bridge having lived a life so unsatisfied. Please please please seek out some help. Talk to family, friends, the people who love you and care about you. You have to look after yourself, because no one else in this world will. \n\nMy inbox is always open for anyone who needs to talk. I wish you all find a rainbow at the end of the tunnel, and the happiest and healthiest life possible.",
            "I came from a shattered home. My mother died when I was 16 months and my father was an abusive alcoholic. My \"replacement\" mother was 14 years old when she started dating my father. I believe she was my babysitter. She raised my half sisters to hate me and envy me the same way she does. I had many, many trials and hardships throughout my adolescence.\n\nSuicide had always been a back burner option for me as I struggled through poverty, misguidance, family deaths and drama, bullying, puberty, and feelings of inadequacy. \n\nThe reason I haven't left yet is because I still feel that I have something to contribute. I still want to make this world a better place. I want my son and everyone's children to have joy and peace in their lives. I want them to know the greatest thing of all and that is love. \n\nLove each other and love yourself most of all. When they're telling you you don't matter, when jealousy says you don't deserve, when you're heart aches from loneliness you have to love yourself. YOU can make the world a better place! You can!

            "My best friends brother committed suicide when we were 5, he was 15. We didn\u2019t truly grasp it at that time. Seven years later her father also took his own life. It was a quiet Tuesday morning when the nurse came in to our middle school social studies and they told her. I just remember her looking back at me with the most lost look in her eyes. It\u2019s been more than 20 years and I still remember it vividly. Her dad was like a second dad to me, I cherished him because he did things that my (single) dad could never do because he was always working. A\u2019s dad taught me to love classic cars, to be brave when I was outdoors (he told me if I can\u2019t see anything, there isn\u2019t anything there to see me when outside playing in the woods), and to enjoy the simple things like sitting at their roadside fruit and vegetable stand and enjoying a juicy peach on a warm summers day. Just because.\n\nI will always always love and remember A\u2019s dad. The sadness inside of him was never obvious to me. I learned from him to never think I truly know what\u2019s going on inside of a person just because they are smiling and laughing with me and I also learned to seek out help when the darkness seems to be everywhere. His death taught me to never hide my sadness. \n\nMiss him every single day \ud83d\udc95",

            "My brother died by suicide late last year. It was devastating for my whole family. I'm still devastated. What was the worst was that we were all actively trying to help him, my parents did everything in their power to help him, but he still left. \n\nOne thing I learned was that depression cannot be fixed by external forces. All of the power to live or die lies with the sufferer. They must choose to get help, they must choose to take medication, they must choose to work at therapy, they must choose to hope, they must choose to live and they must choose to try to change their mindset. Unfortunately, many, like my brother (and myself in the past) are convinced that happiness will come if only this or that changes, or if this or that person would only... but when this or that does change, they still are unhappy and they look for more \"perfection\". It never comes. Never. The only person who can bring happiness is yourself and even if it feels like that is impossible to grasp, it is not if you get help. You can be happy where you are right now, despite everything.\n\nAs a sufferer of depression myself, with a few suicide attempts behind me, my brother's death finally made me realize that I cannot rely on anything external to fix me. (And that I do not have the power  to fix my mother's depression.) I am the only one who can change and that may mean I have to do things that I think won't help and I must tell myself that they WILL help. I must take antidepressants to get me going, do CBT with all my energy even if it feels like nothing is different, eat right and exercise as though my life depends on it, because it does. \n\nIf there's one thing I've learned it's that no circumstances can make me happy. I had EVERYTHING I could ever want, and I was still depressed, still looking for more, still beating myself up constantly. It wasn't until I really internalized therapy, til I started working a 12 step program, til I realized that the truth was that I was telling myself unconciously to be unhappy, that I began to really feel free of depression.\n\nI suggest the book \"Man's Search for Happiness\" to anyone who likes reading and maybe wants to understand this concept a little more, as well as \"Feeling Good\" and then talk to your doctor, or several doctors, talk to a therapist or several therapists. Keep trying to get help. Sometimes depression is not fixable, but please don't do what I did and tell yourself that's certainly true for your case. It wasn't true for me. It probably isn't true for you. Keep trying, you can figure it out too. ",

I'm not excited to tell her how bad it got but at the same time maybe it's her insight into how fucked depression can be.  I love her but when you fall into the void it's like the world washes away.  Maybe she can see that I'm healthier now but maybe it's too late.  I guess as long as I don't just start crying when I see her it will be ok.    \n\n\nI describe my depression like this.  I fell out of the boat and was trying so hard to swim but I was drowning in the worst storm ever.  Everyone is like \"get in the boat\" and \"I'm like the storm is too bad just go and let me go\".  What I didn't realize is the storm was just inside me and I was the one suffering the most not the ones in the boat.  They just wanted me to come with them.  I felt like a burden for needing to be saved and just wanted everyone else to get out of the storm.  It hurt me to see them hurt from watching me spiral down.    \n\n\nI now know that when I go down that path I need help to get in the boat and I need to do whatever I have to do to get it.  I'm a 40 something international tech executive with homes in multiple cities so I'm supposed to be the one in charge.  I'm like a little kid sometimes and need someone to take care of me when I can't.  That's goddam hard to do.  Fuck depression, it's brutal.",

            "I am nearing 40 and have been depressed since the age of 12.  In the fourth grade my biological father gave my sister and I up for adoption to my stepdad. When I turned 18 I started seeing my bio father again, we had a pretty cool relationship.  Two weeks after I turned 20 He  blew his head off with a shotgun. I was using drugs at that time and I got extremely bad on them. I was self medicating. I eventually quit drugs and just wanted my depression fixed. I couldn't be treated, I tried every SSRI out there, you name it I was on it. I always just wanted to die.\nIn 2013 I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and that almost put the nail in my coffin. \n\n27 months ago I had ketamine infusion therapy and it changed my life totally in 2 weeks (Actually in 2 days I was amazingly better). \nI had never understood what it felt like to be genuinely happy, undepressed, have energy etcetra...\n I cried tears of Joy every day for weeks. \nI lived almost an entire life wanting to die but I always had just enough hope to keep me going.\nMiracles do happen everyone, they might be medical miracles but I know without some type of divine guidance pushing me through my crazy life I would not have heard of the treatments let alone have been able to get them.  \nI thank God for my life and everything I have every morning when I wake up.\nI had never believed in God before all of this.\n\nThe ketamine infusion treatments have about an 80% success rate with untreatable depression and are also used to treat chronic pain.

            "Check on your 'strong' friend. ",
            "Checking in as someone who was bullied for years, not only bu given group but by total strangers on the street, from 14 to 16 and I still get random offensive comments from strangers occasionally at 22.\n\nReason being I have a very underdeveloped weak chin, ears that stick out, and I'm pretty thin so not that intimidating. Top it off with my mother being diagnosed with depression and my father with depression and anger issues, and both refuse to get help.\n\nI was on the verge of suicide by 14, got forced into therapy, and personally my experience with therapy was horrible, my therapist didn't connect with me, made me admit being suicidal to my parents, and made things overall worse. I had no friends and no family to support me, had to go through this on my own.\n\nSo, what helped? Steer clear from depressing songs. Cut them off altogether. Read a lot, learn a lot, and get a hobby, one hobby that makes you feel in the moment and be you. Drawing does that for me and a lot of people even though I draw worse than a 2 year old. Dive into that topic when you find it, learn everything about it. So if you like drawing consider getting into digital art, maybe 3D art or 2D conceptual art. Then maybe you get interested in game development. Whatever makes you tick and feel like you have a porpuse, chase it. Breathe, dream, and live that hobby. Nothing else matters.\n\nSelf-help books did help me quite a bit. \"Get off Your Butt\" being one of them. Searching \"self respect quotes\" and everything related to that also helped me. Eventually do go outside for a run, become active. If you can get a few audiobooks related to your hobby and you let your mind go off into them, great! Fight Club, book and movie, helped me a lot. I most likely owe that movie my life. Watched it over 10 times when I was under.\n\nI don't know a step by step process into what happened. It's just gone.I just know I have so much fun on a daily basis it's unreal. You go through this kind of shit, I guarantee whatever people say to you simply will not matter. Rejection means nothing to me. Mean comments mean nothing to me. I am free. I am free to engage into whatever conversation or activity I want that makes me feel happy as long as I feel I am not directly hurting someone else's happiness. \n\nCheck out your self pity too. It's a dangerous drug. You simply do not have the right to feel sorry for yourself. And that is a choice. It is also a choice to accept other people's opinions as a global truth.\n\nLearn to be assertive and aggressive when needed. This is part of loving and respecting yourself and your space. If someone mocks you in your face, react and answer. Otherwise just learn to project your voice and make yourself heard even on little things. Someone skips you in line at the store? No man, I will not stand for that. Excuse me, I was here first, please return to your place behind me. You don't need to scream or swear or be impolite. Remain calm and collected, but still loud. Also, in these situations a polite, calm, and assertive person is much more scary and intimidating than some insecure person screaming and waving their arms. If you keep your head down constantly, you will feel much worse\n\nPersonally, what is life like right now? Stable social life, as in I have a close group of friends I hang out with regularly who share my interests, then one or two secondary groups I hang out with once in a while. I travel regularly to unwind, whether by car, bike, or on foot, and make it a habit to get out of way to talk to and take interest in strangers and help them when I can.\n\nDating life is meh. I have people asking me out but insecurities do still get on the way. I've been in one very short relationship so far, and this inexperience is what does more damage. Eventually when you start to become close to someone, it pulls you back. A little voice starts saying that they will be able to tell you are not experienced and that will ruin everything and they will never talk to you again. You become increasingly needy and ruin it all. This has happened at least 4 times since I stopped being depressed.\n\nYou do learn to live and enjoy life despite this. The thrill of meeting new people and having amazing experiences, the pride of accomplishing awesome things once you master any given hobby, the joy when you have a heartfelt conversation or someone thanks you with a big smile for being kind to them.\n\nLife is amazing, even if some given part of it is not. There is so much in this world to enjoy.\n\nFinal piece of advice more specific to underage people. If you are living in a toxic home and feel increasingly suicidal, check to see if you can check in into a local hospital. In Portugal they are required to hold suicidal people for 48 hours free of charge and start treatment. They have extra measures for kids in place. Screw the consequences, we are going for broke anyway.\n\nRegardless of whether you check into a hospital or get a therapist or any other professional, and you get that sense that you don't like or trust them or they are not making good arguments, run. Run as quickly as you can. Walk away in the middle of a session if you feel like it. It cost me a lot of money and over 2 months of therapy as well as causing permanent damage to my family only to have that fucker say in the last session \"Oh wait so this is actually happening? I was diagnosing paranoia\" because my parents witnessed the last bullying section. He thought I was making it all up.\n\nFuck that dude man, seriously.",
            "I attempted suicide on October 2012. Right when I started going to community college after I had just graduated high school. I had wanted to kill myself by slamming my car into a wall. Or just prayed for an accident to happen. But that was so stupid of me. So I decided to go off the road and not hurt anyone with me. \n\nFast forward to 2017, just last year, I hadn\u2019t even known what true depression was until then. I had been the LONELIEST I had ever been. And it\u2019s an understatement. I didn\u2019t have any friends to really talk to, I didn\u2019t have my family with me, I moved to an unfamiliar state and it felt like hell. It felt horrible each breath I took. Like as if pins were stuck inside my lungs every time I breathed. I finally went back to school to finish my degree in Statistics and I\u2019m working full time. I wanted to do something for myself and do everything I can to make myself \u201clook\u201d better or seem like I\u2019m doing fine. But what did that matter if I felt like shit all the time? \n\nI didn\u2019t care about what I was doing. I only cared about ceasing to exist. I didn\u2019t want to actually die because I lived with a roommate and I was more terrified of her finding my body in my room. But even then, we weren\u2019t on good terms. And you would think relationships would make depression go away, but it doesn\u2019t. I have a wonderful boyfriend, but of course, I only found a little light inside. But it would be enveloped by this huge cloud of depression once I went back home to my bed. \n\nI kept working and working. I kept studying and studying. To the point where I just was about to hang myself. I was trying to find something in my room and it was unbearable. But I stopped myself. I decided to use the services in school. It\u2019s called CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services). If you\u2019re in the US and you go to college, check out if you have these at your school because they\u2019re free and they totally help. But anyway, I finally went and they require you to do a phone interview and then a survey. They gave me a call and I just told them the honest truth. Pretty much what I had just said prior. And they said I needed to come in ASAP. I took the survey they had in there and waited. \n\nOnce they called me, I just didn\u2019t know how to feel going in the room. But the counselor there felt like a mom to me. Someone I didn\u2019t have for a while since my mom was part of the Navy/Merchant Marines and I didn\u2019t see her often growing up. It was so comforting. And my counselor told me that this was a really bad case of depression. So bad that she told me that she wanted to tell me the statistics of where I stand from the survey I just took. Apparently I had been in the 100th percentile of being depressed. Literally statistically significant. And I was honestly shocked because I thought my depression was mild. Something I can just get over. But it wasn\u2019t. She told me this was an emergency and that we had to get myself checked into the hospital. \n\nI agreed and I was checked into a psych ward. But you want to know something? I\u2019ve got a quote that the social worker said to me right when I walked in the psych ward.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. People from the outside really think you need to be mentally insane to be in here. You don\u2019t. Times have changed and we all go through it. We\u2019re glad you\u2019re here and that you\u2019ll recover.\u201d\n\nThat guy was the nicest person ever and I won\u2019t ever forget it. It made me feel so much better and actually, the psych ward wasn\u2019t bad. It feels surreal there but I made so many friends and met so many people there who went through the same struggles as me. Some even accomplishing so much, but still struggling. \n\nI swear to you. Please get help. You can\u2019t do this alone. Have your friends go with you to the hospital or a therapist. Anything. I swear. It helps. I haven\u2019t thought about killing my self since that day. I told my new mom-counselor about it and she started crying. I thanked her so much because I think if it were not for that, I\u2019d probably be dead. \n\nI\u2019m just happy that there are places to get help. Don\u2019t ever do things alone. I have for a while, and it\u2019s never worth it. ",
            "I attempted suicide this year on February 13th. \n\n\nI wasn\u2019t thinking about how other people will take my death, or how my parents would feel about finding out that their 25 year old daughter couldn\u2019t continue living. \n\n\nI just wanted to disappear and stop feeling disappointed in myself. I have never felt so alone in that very moment. \n\n\nI texted a friend of mine and said \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to do something stupid\u201d but quickly just ended texting him only because I felt like a burden. \n\n\nThe hardest thing about depression is you can\u2019t just \u201cseek\u201d help, sometimes it\u2019s too hard to even attend to yourself you can\u2019t really push yourself to look for help. \n\n\nMy boyfriend found me as soon as I drank two bottles of liquid Tylenol and rushed me to the emergency room. I was throwing up all night and had to stay. One thing that irritated me while I was there was nurses asking me \u201cso why\u2019d you do it?\u201d It\u2019s kind of a loaded question and it can\u2019t be summarized. Sometimes people don\u2019t even have an answer to the question or it can be something as mundane as \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to live.\u201d \n\n\nI was then admitted to a mental health home to be supervised. I met so many people who have attempted but failed, and people who were there for other reasons. \n\n\nI was talking to an older woman about our reasons for being there. She said she was contemplating suicide for a while, \u201cdo I just walk into traffic? Should I jump off a bridge?\u201d I told her how I went about it and she replied with \u201cyou are very brave\u201d almost as if she was looking up to me for trying. At that very moment I realized that attempting doesn\u2019t make you brave, seeking for the help you need and overcoming your anxiety makes you brave. \n\n\nThe day I was discharged and was able to feel the sun and breathe the outside air for the first time in a week was surreal. I felt like I had a second chance. \n\n\nOf course it took me time to get over my depression, it didn\u2019t just go away after but all it took was seeing things in a new perspective. \n\n\nA quote I tell myself when I\u2019m having a bad day or feeling out of sync with people is \u201cIf you don\u2019t change in the direction you\u2019re going, you will end up where you are headed\u201d in which I change the direction of my thought process. \n\n\nYou are in charge of your depression, you are I charge of your fate, not your depression. No matter how hard it seems please just seek help. Don\u2019t listen to your mind when it tells you \u201cthey don\u2019t care\u201d because we do. \n\n\nTLDR; Suicide is serious and most of the time if you ask someone \u201cwhy?\u201d It\u2019s a loaded question, they can\u2019t summarize it in one sentence. Sorry but I don\u2019t have a TLDR version of this. ",
            "Ive suffered with depression and anxiety on and off my entire adult life. I read somewhere else in the thread that they never really planned for their future and that is how I can pretty much describe my adult life. Never have had any goals or trying to achieve much. Four years ago my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and three years ago she lost that battle. Three months before she passed a  cousin of mine committed suicide. \n\nWhen those two deaths happened I was devastated but I had a great partner at the time. She provided a lot of support and I started to set some goals and try to do something better with my life. Well end of last year she left me because she was tired of my neediness. I thought at the time I was doing ok but in reality I was just leaning on her and I didnt really see it until after she left.\n\nThe deaths and her leaving made me see how truly depressed I was. I quit working and doing anything I enjoyed. Ive thought about suicide everyday for awhile now. I dont think I will ever go through with it because of my Mom. Even though shes not here anymore I owe her for all her sacrifices. So a few weeks ago I started a new job and have slowly begun to do other things. Im by no means happy but I dont sit and cry every moment of the day and I also don't just lay in bed everyday anymore. ",
            "I am 54 years old, so Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade hit close to home.  I have had chronic depression since I was a child, due to physical, mental and sexual abuse by my mother.  I made suicide attempts in my teen years, twenties and early thirties. I loathed myself.  I reached the end of my rope when I was thirty years old.  I had a baby and was working full time.  My job was extremely stressful, the baby had colic, I had postpartum depression, and I hated my baby's daycare.  I felt like a failure as a mother and a person.  I loved my daughter more than life, but I felt like I didn't deserve her and I was terrified that I would lose her because I didn't deserve her.  My daughter was being neglected at the daycare, but my sister-in-law had her kids there and thought the daycare was fine.  I felt pressured to keep my job, even though I was being run ragged.  Nothing helped my daughter's colic, she finally outgrew it by ten months old.  So one night I made a plan to end my life, and hang myself before my husband came home from work.  I had a noose tied to a ceiling hook and suddenly decided to call a suicide hotline.  I ended up in a psych hospital for two weeks, was put on antidepressants, and continued with therapy for years later.  Antidepressants and therapy saved my life; I felt like a veil was lifted from my eyes about what life could really be like, how I could live up to my potential and that I deserved good things in life.  I had one last suicide attempt when I was in my early thirties and had to go off antidepressants due to insurance issues.  I've been on antidepressants since and continue to take them, and will take them for the rest of my life.  It controls the demons, keeps them at bay.",

            "I tried to kill myself when I was 19. Took a whole bottle of sleeping pills and about 7 shots of vodka rapid-fire, then just went to sleep. Woke up in the hospital. Since then the depression comes and goes. I\u2019ve accepted it as a fact of my life that sometimes I\u2019m going to feel fine and sometimes I\u2019m gonna feel like absolute worthless trash. I deal with it by telling myself that this is just how my life is. I can deal with the bad because I know the good times are going to come around again, and it\u2019s worth it to stick around through the bad times for those good times because oh man are they good.\n\nBut it\u2019s a lot easier said than done.

            "I developed depression in high school and began to have thoughts of suicide by the third year. I was always shy and awkward and it wasn't that I didn't make friends, it was that every 'friend' I made seemed only vaguely interested in me and ended up sidelining me after a couple of months.\n\nIt even went so far that I had made a plan. Sometime in the summer I was going to go somewhere quiet, down a bunch of anti anxiety pills I had and wash them down with alcohol. Looking back it was probably more likely to just make me sick than actually kill me. I even walked around and found a place where I wanted to do it, but then the strangest thing happened.\n\nI went there a couple of times and just laid in the sun with my eyes closed and that's when it hit me - I was okay. I forgot about everything that was making me feel so horrible and just laying there in the sun, listening to music, that was all I needed. It's something a lot of people say, but that was the first time I didn't feel like I had to get someone to like me or for people to see me a certain way to be happy. A quiet spot and some sunshine was all I needed.\n\nI went there plenty more times that summer and read a few books. I started going out by myself as well. Even now, whenever I'm struggling with something, I like to go for a walk to some place quiet and just relax for a while. It really helps shift my perspective on whatever is going on in my life at that time.\n\nThe second thing which greatly helped, even before this realization, is that I reconnected with someone who is now my best friend. We began to talk a lot and eventually I confessed to him that I was feeling suicidal, to which he replied 'me too'. I can't quite describe it, but the connection that we made at that time was something incredibly unique, and probably the way a lot of people think about their family. We were able to be brutally honest with each other about what we were feeling and support each other through it. I will forever be greatful to him. ",
            "I tried to commit suicide two years ago via overdosing on whatever pills I could find.  I had been on Lifeline online chat because in the past it had brought  me some stability and prevented me from attempting in the past, but this time I had truly believed it was the end and that I couldn't go on. I remember feeling worse because I had involved a poor Lifeline person in this, I just wanted to go quietly. \n\nWell, they saved my life by tracking my IP, so by the time I had collected all my pills and whatever alcohol I had, and written up a short will (I also remember feeling bad if I left my roommates in the lurch about rent so I left them my savings) the police showed up at my door, and an ambulance arrived soon after. I was put in a ward for a month and then had a year of counselling with therapists and a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression at 11 and anxiety at 18 (I'm 23). It's chronic for me, this is my normal, but that doesn't mean it's normal/easy to live with.  It fucking sucks, but I just have to deal with it. The hardest part is knowing whatever I do, whatever I accomplish, whatever I learn, I will never feel truly happy; most of the time I don't feel satisfaction from achieving something, no pride,  but that's something else I just need to accept.\n\nThat being said... it does get better. I think an important distinction to make is that I'm not 'cured', but that I am in a much more stable place than I was. I'm in a better place, but there's no avoiding depression downswings, and my ability to recover and take care of myself has become stronger. It happens, but I think each time... it's a little easier. I also think the main reason I lived through many dark times was because I reached out for help from counsellors, lifeline, doctors; anyone that was there to help. Also, I have plenty of things I like, and I have a strong sense of awe and appreciation for life/nature, so that helps. I've always been someone that appreciated simple pleasures, like some hot tea or a book. Or playing Stardew Valley for so long I'm surprised I didn't get RSI.\n\nThat's not to say I don't have suicide ideation, it's alluring to just consider all the pain and fatigue disappearing, but I have no active want to do it anymore, and I haven't for a long time. \n\nAlso, my paramedic told me that paracetamol overdose is a truly terrible way to go. Apparently it's agonising and takes some time. Really really grateful to the Lifeline person for saving me from that. I hope that person has a wonderful life with people that appreciate them. ",

            "I'm no longer actively suicidal, but this past winter I was. After my mom found out I was cutting, she took my tools and so I had no outlet for my feelings. As January progressed I felt more and more like I needed to end my life. Finally, on Tuesday, January 30, I decided that I'd had enough. I went to school and did everything normally, just how I'd wanted it. I laughed and joked with my friends like normal. I even turned in my homework. To this day I don't know why. I got home and played with my cat, who did not leave me for the entire night. I think she knew something was wrong. I ate dinner and started writing my notes. There were two; one for my mom, one for my best friend. I cleaned my room (I was going to have my best friend come over and take the things I wanted her to have so I wanted my room to look nice) and set out some of my possessions so they'd be easier to find. Then I texted my best friend, but I didn't tell her what I was going to do. She had no idea I planned on ending my life that night. I just let out all of my feelings about life, and she was concerned for me. It was enough to make me realize I shouldn't die. I didn't want to hurt her, and in any case she made me promise I wouldn't do anything stupid. I do credit her with saving my life. Now, over five months later, I still have bad days, days I ask myself, \"Should I live?\" The difference is that now, unlike that cold day in January, my answer is yes.",
            "My uncle had a mental disorder and had to live with his parents (my grandparents) for his whole life. You'd never guess it though, when he was on his medicine he was normal as everybody else. But once every couple of years I'd hear some story about my grandmother coming home to blood all over their walls and other crazy stuff. I still can't even imagine him having a breakdown, I've only ever seen him completely relaxed and normal. It was all self inflicted though, he never hurt anybody or anything.\n\nHe was younger than my mother by a little bit, and would always get me games and video game stuff for christmas and my birthday which I always loved. I still remember when he got me the WoW Cataclysm collectors edition that was like sold out everywhere for christmas one year. He was super into comics and games and sci fi and all the same stuff I was, but I only ever saw him or talked to him when he was around for the holidays. He was also really into photography and I was only starting to get into it when he passed, but he loved his camera and loved taking pictures and sharing them with us. And even though he couldn't live on his own, he would often go out with his friends for several days and just go hiking in the mountains or on a spontaneous road trip.\n\nThe day my mother called me, I could immediately tell something was wrong. She was trying to keep it together, but I kept asking her what was wrong and I was prepared for the worst. It could've been anything. When she told me what happened, I just couldn't believe it.\n\nHe walked out to the living room and told my grandfather he was sorry he was such a burden to them, which according to them wasn't terribly unusual on its own. My grandfather reinforced that they love him so much, and it's not a burden at all. He wasn't just my grandmothers son either, he was her best friend. They did almost everything together. I could tell how happy and proud of him she was, and it was always great hearing her tell stories of stuff they'd do together like go visit the theme parks, or go to the movies, or dinner, or play video games. He made her feel young. Anyway, after my grandfather talked to him, he walked out back to the shed which he had set up as a clubhouse of sorts. He had a table and chairs and a boom box along with all sorts of stuff. But then they didn't hear from him for a couple of days. My grandparents thought he just went off with his friends for a couple of days, as he would do that from time to time unannounced. Just disappear and come back a few days later with some story and pictures of going out to the mountains in the carolinas and just exploring trails and stuff. But he wasn't answering his cell phone, which was odd. The next morning, the people who take care of their lawn were mowing and weed whacking and one of them screamed and came running inside, visibly shaking. He didn't speak english, but asked my grandfather to follow him. He took him out back around the shed, where they found his body.\n\nHe gouged his wrists and bled out behind the shed. We never found a note or anything. I work in IT and scoured his laptop and iPhone for days with no luck. Check all external drives and discs where he normally kept photos. My grandparents wanted a note so bad, for closure obviously.\n\nJust like with any death that affects anybody, I wish I could go back and get to know him more. He was into the same stuff as I was. Video games, comics, sci fi, photography. But except for a couple of instances, I never really went out of my way to ask him like what his gamertag was or what his steam name was, so I could play some games with him and get to know him more than the 2-3 times a year I saw him at family gatherings for holidays. He was seriously one of the most chill, laid back, loving, and fun people I had ever met. And I don't know or pretend to even comprehend what personal demons he was dealing with. I just hope wherever he is, whatever he's doing, whatever happens in the afterlife, if there is one, he's in a better place. Maybe we'll meet again sometime. Who knows.\n\nAs the computer guy in the family, and since my grandparents now live alone, I'm over there way more often to help them with computer trouble. I could fix most of their problems remotely, especially since they live an hour away, but I'd much rather deal with the crazy traffic and see them in person and hang out for a couple of hours and chat. But every time I log onto my grandmothers laptop, her wallpaper is a portrait of my uncle, and it makes me so happy and sad at the same time.\n\nAnyway, that's the gist of it. This went on wayyyy longer than I thought it would. And there's so much more I could talk about, but I'm going to stop here lol.\n\nPlease, talk to somebody. It feels so good to just vent and let your emotions pour out of you. I do not mind at all being a shoulder to lean on, even to complete strangers on the internet. Sometimes it's better that way because you don't want people you interact with daily to know your struggles and don't want them to worry about you. Please message me if you just want to vent. I was in your shoes at one point. I remember being 15 and getting expelled from high school for something I didn't do. That was the final straw with a billion other things going on in my life, and I remember sitting on my bed with my fathers handgun in one hand thinking \"I could just end it all right here right now. No more worries.\" but I'm glad I didn't. I couldn't do that to people I know worry about me, and care about me. They don't deserve that. I'm much better now after venting to a complete stranger in an online game I was playing at the time. That person let me message them for like 4 hours straight and talked me through everything, from a different perspective, and if anything just TALKING about it helped me so much.\n\nSo please, message me if you just want to chat. Vent. Whatever. I'm all ears. Let's play some games on Steam or something. Or nothing at all. Up to you.",

            "A few years ago, I was stuck in a job that I hated. I had been hired for a whole other job but my bosses would systematically assign all the shitty tasks nobody wanted to me. I was also morally harassed by shitty co-workers. Every time I  would call my bosses out, they would drown me with false promises of improvement. As I would bust my ass at work, I could see some other colleagues receive promotions or special treatments. I never could figure out why. Today I stopped to try. But at that time, the injustice was eating me inside. \n\n\nWhat truely got me was the thought that the more I stayed at this post, the less I was improving my skills in the field, lessening my chances to be hired elsewhere. As a career person,succeeding in that field was a life long dream. But being a junior and because there was no opportunity in my home country, I had no other choice but to suck with it, an ocean apart from my family and friends.\n\n\nMy then boyfriend and I separated. For a long time, I used to go home and cry. Go to work and cry. Panic attacks. Pure restless despair. Two years inside this nightmare, going through a burnout which then ended into a depression, lacking of any hope in a better future, I was totally ready to kill myself. I had thought about it and planned for month.\n\nI used to drink more and more. So one day I decided to drunk myself enough to jump out the window. For two hours, there I was, leaning out of my balcony, gathering all the motivation I had to jump out. I just... couldn't. Ironically that was such a big life decision that I didn't feel the strength to take it. Which was awful because that was the only thing I wanted in the godamn world. \n\n\nMonths of struggling and therapy passed and one day I decided to fucking quit my job. \nBeing unemployed and alone in a foreign country was suddenly a far better option than staying into that toxic working environment. Half a year later and out of nowhere I got a job from a friend in Japan. Went there, had the time of my life. Sure, quality of life is nice there but most of all, everytime I reminded myself about my shitty bosses and the blinding pain, I would start to cry... of fucking joy. \n\nI always wondered why they say that life will get better and better after a depression. But it's not because suddenly everything will lighten up around you. It's more the fact that you won't give a damned fuck about toxic people and environment trying to getting you down anymore. The better I feel, the less I try to fix everything around me. Broken? I deserve to let it go and move on. \n\n",

            "I was really depressed and self harming after my first serious girlfriend cheated on me. I reached out to my parents and they told me to just stop cutting and go out and do things, and I would be fine. It was heartbreaking to get that response when I reached out for help. \n\nLuckily I had an amazing group of friends and ended up meeting another girl a year later who really helped me. I stopped cutting, but that relationship ended up turning abusive and I eventually left after 2 years. \n\nAnd I was right back where I was before. All that time, I had made no progress. I was never really suicidal before, I had always believed it got better. Not anymore though. I was tired of being a burden on my friends, tired of struggling, tired of existing. I started cutting again and now seriously considered suicide.  I no longer believed that it would get better. I was constantly thinking that hopefully I would just die in a car accident or something so it would be easier for people to deal with. \n\nI ended up getting a dog. I can honestly say he's saved my life. I've had him for nine months now, and when I pick up the knife every once in a while, I see him laying at the end of my bed, and there's no way I could do that to him. He depends on me.

I can still remember the cold muzzle pressing against my temple. I pulled the trigger. Click. I panicked for a good minute, realizing what I just tried to do. Once I was somewhat calm, I cleared the chamber and saw a bad round. I sat down and cried. Like, hard. I never cried like that before. After that, I did more coke to forget what i tried to do.

Hell, I didn't even *know* him and I felt so personally touched by all the outpouring of grief that I - pretty much a stranger - felt compelled to attend his memorial service at the school. And I guess a lot of other people felt the same way I did, because the auditorium was *packed* - 500 people came, easy; and it was all a mix of friends, family, classmates, teachers, faculty, *rival sports teams*, and so on. A room packed full of people with all natures of connections to this one kid, all trying not to disrupt the service with sobbing. \n\nMy friend became overwhelmed at one point and we had to go into the parking lot so she could let it out. *She* didn't know him well either, but I guess she just couldn't handle the tragedy of it all, because she said this to me:\n\n> Maybe he thought that no one cared, but would he still have done it if he had known how many people *do* care?\n\nI guess my parting advice would be... let the people that you care about *know* that you care.

Brush your hair and your teeth.  Take a shower.  \nAccomplish one thing.  On my worst days, I set a goal to accomplish one thing.  Clean one drawer or one shelf.  Take out the trash.  Change your sheets.  Just one thing.\nDo something for someone else.  Go volunteer at a soup kitchen.  Run an errand for someone.  Do a chore for someone.  Pick a friend, relative, co-worker and go the social media platform of your choice and like, share, and up-vote all their stuff.  \nThank three people for something.  A clerk, your parents, waiter, co-worker, someone who held open the door for you\u2026. Doesn't matter.  Thank them and mean it.\nPet an animal.  Find a dog or cat or something to love on.  If you don't have one, go to the animal shelter.  \nFind a scent that you like.  Scents are amazing things.  I'm not even talking about aroma therapy or essential oils.  Take a whiff of a bottle of vanilla.  Walk into a bakery or a car showroom.  \nEat something spicy.  Maybe that's just me, but some good hot sauce or a good curry\u2026\u2026 yumm.  \nDo something today to make tomorrow a little bit better, even if it's just spending more time reading this thread.

It's like a church with traditions, but where everyone is trying to choke each other in stylish pajamas.  \n\n* It's great for the mind. BJJ gives you confidence, but at the same time it is a good ego-killer, and it seriously teaches discipline, consistency, comradery, and for some, it's also a good outlet 2-3x times a week. \n\n* You learn some actual self-defense. Jiu-Jitsu is one of the main martial arts in MMA. It revolves around grappling and taking people to the ground, where striking becomes way less effective. Of course, it's not going to save your ass from a group fight or someone with a knife, but it helps. \n\n* It gives you something to strive for, for a very long time / for life. A black belt takes 10+ years. And even if you get it, there is still an almost limitless amount of things you can still learn (and teach!).",

            "I was at a lecture a couple of years ago, performed by two doctors who\u2019d undergone treatment for breast cancer and written a book about it together.\n\nI remember her talking about her diagnosis. She was a breast cancer surgeon herself, you couldn\u2019t make it up. She walked into the room, saw her own scans with the doctor and her heart dropped, she barely heard a word he said because she couldn\u2019t stop the flood of information she was getting. Looking at the scan she knew if she\u2019d need surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, how long it would be, what her estimated survival was.\n\nI don\u2019t think they discussed it like a group project, but I suppose she couldn\u2019t stop herself from listening to her own internal monologue since it was her own field. I remember her saying she\u2019d found it, in hindsight, an incredible learning opportunity regarding how to interact with patients, and that she thought about it a lot.",
            "It depends on what I'm going in for. As a background, I'm an oncologist so I've trained in internal medicine before. For most internal medicine type stuff, I don't bother going in unless I need something that I can't easily get for myself (e.g. labs or images). For specialty stuff I wasn't trained in, I go in and try to give them the best history I can, but let them do their own thing.",
            "I dont get involved in the management. I let the Doctor seeing me lead that, unless they missed something huge and i would just double check.\n\nThe main difference is i can present the whole history and relevant info in about 30 seconds flat and the doctor with that info can just give me the management plan in about the same time.\n\nFastest consultations ever. Very methodical.",
            "Doctor here (neurologist)\n\nI'm not good at going to the doctor. I don't go often but when I do I usually just STFU, especially if it's a field of medicine I have no idea about (like say...derm). That being said, the doctor usually knows I'm a physician as well, and so the language terms to be more technical. I also find that we practice less defensively with each other since we can be more open (\"We could do ABC tests  but honestly what you probably have is X so take this and if it doesn't get better then we can do ABC\").",
            "My mom's a gp and she usually just self diagnoses most of the time but will sometimes get a second opinion. She doesn't really go to another doctor, just calls them to ask about stuff. Her contacts are filled with all kinds of doctors. Its like a secret underground community.\n\nFor stuff like getting ultrasounds etc, then yes they do discuss stuff like its a group project.",
            "I hope you get some doctors in here to give personal answers. Paul Kalanithi did address this a bit in his book When Breath Becomes Air. At first in his cancer treatment he was very involved in the decision making and the way he described the conversation with his oncologist was more like a collaboration. Later, she reminded him that he didn't have to participate in the decision making and that he could just let her be the doctor and focus on himself. He ended up taking her up on this offer. So even between the same patient and doctor, the relationship varied.",
            "I'm an ER doctor, and sometimes I have other doctors as patients.\n\nFor the most part they're pretty good patients because they can give a good description of their symptoms in a way that's useful the me.  They usually ask good questions and are well equipped to have an informed discussion about their diagnosis and treatment.  Sometimes it's hard for me to dial back my \"patient talk\" where I simplify medical terms for laypeople.  Sometimes it's challenging if their area of expertise is totally unrelated to the issue at hand and they don't recognize their limited understanding.\n\nThe worst patients are those who have just a little medical knowledge and think they know everything.  Some version of: \"My aunt is a nurse, and she said a need a whole body MRI for this runny nose...\"\n\nAs far as self diagnosing, I usually deal with my own minor medical issues.  If I noticed signs of something more serious, I would go to someone else.",
            "Doctor here (family medicine). I self diagnose most things, but for my 1 year old daughter I decided a while ago that I don't want to do that for her. So her pediatrician doesn't know I'm a doctor - I never told her. I want her to treat me like any other parent, and explain everything to me like I'm 5 years old. I'm afraid of of being too nonchalant with my daughter's health that I'll miss something (or the doctor assuming I know more than I really do). \n\nIt's actually a strategy I've adopted since on myself- if I go to a doctor (say a gynecologist for a routine check up) I sometimes just don't say what I do so I can legitimacy ask dumb questions about things that I should really know- or so that the other doctor won't leave out important info that they assume I know for fear of insulting me. \n\nOn the other hand, my regular doctors do know, such as the gynecologist who saw me through my pregnancies, and that enables more complex and nuanced disscusions about health decisions- as in debating questions and giving me options that he wouldn't necessarily do with it he patients, bc he can be sure I understand the medical pros and cons well once I'm given a basic explanation.",
            "Dr here - it is a bit dependent on the field of medicine involved. For example I don't know much about neurological issues so if I went to see a neurologist I certainly wouldn't be chipping in. For more generic conditions I have previously offered my thoughts to my doctor about what it could be. Ultimately I still go to the doctor as they can prescribe drugs/order tests for me that would be difficult/questionable for me to do myself.",
            "Doctor here.  In general, we are not good about going to the doctor.  For me it\u2019s physicals about half as often as recommended and that time I had strep a year and a half ago that didn\u2019t resolve with \u201cwhatever antibiotics I had in my medicine cabinet\u201d.  When we do go in, it is like a group project.  We usually hash things out together but ultimately I am going to defer to someone with more expertise than me in that area who can make an objective decision.",
            "I was sat in in a consultation between two doctors with one needing an ultrasound. They knew each other through work already so it was very friendly and casual between the both of them.

            "Just wanted to say thank you for one of the more original AskReddit questions I've seen in quite a while. Really interesting subject.",
            "The pace and density of the conversations is different, I'm sure.  I'm an emergency physician who has over time treated various physicians in my community including internists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, some from my hospital and some not.  Keep in mind that each specialty is quite different from the others.  The Rad Onc, for example, thinks and speak differently than the Ortho Surgeon, and I felt like my treatment of each of them was really quite similar to treating a professor of engineering.  Academically minded people tend to ask lots of questions and research stuff while you're out of the room, as compared to populations that request a more paternalistic bent and just want you to tell them what to do so they can get on with their day.  \n\nI'm careful to credit that the number of hours that went into my Family Physician's training are the same as mine; simply a different topic.  She knows tons of stuff about management and screening for chronic disease that I don't, and I ... well I know how to intubate people, manage a bad LSD trip, or use a jar of bubbles to distinguish between kids that are scared and kids that are head injured.",
            "I always go to someone who don\u2019t know me, and I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m a doctor as well. On the other hand, my SO is a doctor too, and whenever we feel something we do discuss it like a group project in which he always refuse any treatment until his symptoms got to the very worst",
            "Both my parents are doctors, and they see each other as their doctors. For their situation, they don\u2019t make appointments for anything, so if I or they get like the flu they just write a prescription. If they need specialists, they usually tell them they are doctors and they get better treatment like skipping lines or whatever, or they know each other already so it\u2019s chill. I\u2019m sorry this kinda sounds spoiled, but it\u2019s my experience.",
            "Obligatory not a doctor, but spouse of a doctor. I thought I might have a ganglion cyst in my wrist because I could feel something inside that was causing pain when I moved my wrist so I scheduled an appt with a orthopedic surgeon/hand specialist. I had my husband come along (interventional radiologist) in case there were questions I wouldn\u2019t have thought of asking or something I needed more explanation on later. \n\nThe ortho/hand surgeon was friendly and used layman terms with me but technical jargon with my husband. It was funny to hear the switch between \u201cyour wrist bones/tendons\u201d and \u201cblah blah anterior blah blah medial blah\u201d whatever he said to my husband.\n\nAt one point they did an ultrasound on my wrist to determine if it might be a cyst or if I should get a more detailed MRI, and the surgeon asked my husband if he wanted to take over the ultrasound (since my husband trained in diagnostic radiology as well) and he totally did! Weird to have your husband moving the ultrasound wand and pointing to random blobs of static. They both agreed it was a cyst, even though it looked like a whole lot of static and nothingness to me. So it was interesting to see my husband defer to the surgeon for his specialty and vice versa!\n\nEdit:\nJust remembered that time we took our cat in for an X-ray because she was developing arthritis and we weren\u2019t sure how severe it was or if her bones were deteriorating. My husband actually took her X-ray in and had an attending in radiology read it and they were both convinced our cat had bone spurs or little bone growths around her spine near her hip. He was about 80% convinced that our cat\u2019s spine was absolutely wrecked. The vet wasn\u2019t worried and said that cat bones just look like that and it wasn\u2019t hurting her and was nothing to worry about. He ended up doing some research on feline anatomy to make sure our (very knowledgeable) vet wasn\u2019t just talking out of her ass. She wasn\u2019t.\n\nAnyway, moral of the story is that he went to med school to study human anatomy, not feline anatomy, so he had to learn to take a step back and defer to the expert. \ud83d\ude04",
            "I try to act like any other patient.\n\nMedical people can very much sabotage their own care by taking shortcuts or perhaps declining to approach their own problems the way other patients do.  It\u2019s a mistake.  I have seen harm done that way.\n\nI don\u2019t come in for trivial things like self-limiting infections or things that are harmless because I know that they are. But I do go see my regular doctor for problems that really bother me or for routine exams like anyone else.\n\nIt can be weirdly stressful to be the doctor or the patient in this kind of interaction. I\u2019ve learned to not let it bother me when I am the doctor seeing other doctors. It can be harmful to the doctor as a patient, if you let that kind of interaction get to you. I try not to generate stress for other doctors who see me and know what I am. That could be detrimental to me.",

            "As an ER dr, when I go to my PCP all decisions are made in tandem and I do have more input on my treatment plan than a layperson. But I second what others have said when I\u2019m seeing another physician like a specialist I am more capable at making informed decisions than a layperson but will always defer to their experience and knowledge. Two examples \n1) Had a PCP that said jokingly to a medical student in front of me \u201cHow the hell could he even sue me, he\u2019s a doctor\u201d Promptly found a new PCP. It\u2019s okay to not like a doctor, even doctors dislike other doctors.\n2) I\u2019m a doctor with literally tens of thousands of hours of experience and knowledge saving peoples lives and even I know that I don\u2019t know 0.1% of what Fauci knows. Wear your goddamn mask it\u2019s not a debate doctors are having, just morons.",
            "Had a relative who was an old-fashioned veterinarian and prolly the worst patient because of it. This guy would argue with his doctors about his prescriptions and then order the meds through the vet pharmacy cuz they were (significantly) cheaper. Which makes sense, I guess. Why pay $50 for a particular med when he can source the exact same thing for $5? \n\nBut still, it looked kinda funny when he was in his 80s hobbling around with heart meds that had FOR DOGS ONLY in big print on the bottle.\n\nEdit: clarify vet = veterinarian",
            "Doctor here. Like someone else said, if I'm seeing a specialist of a particular field then I'm unlikely to have anywhere near as much knowledge as them so I would consult with them just like any other patient. If it's something more general and I'm seeing a GP, for example, I will tell them I'm a doctor so that they don't go into lengthy layman's explanations, but generally will try to have a 'normal' doctor-patient relationship. I might throw in an opinion on what I think, but ultimately I try to shut up and respect that they are a professional and not tell them how to do their job. It's hard to be objective, too, when the patient is yourself or a family member - having someone give their unbiased opinion is often more useful than self-diagnosing, or at least might add some more knowledge or insight that you may not have yourself.",

AND, if they refuse to give you reasonable answers outside of \"bc I said so\" then you should be asking for 2nd opinions on your project. Just bc there's someone spearheading the endeavor doesn't mean you should let yourself be apathetic to your care, that's a dangerous level of trust for anyone.

If I want to see a subspecialist, I text or call them and I'm in their clinic the next morning. No waiting, no referral, usually not billed and often not even documented. If I have questions after the appointment, I usually send them a text and get an answer pretty quickly. When I see other docs as patients, they generally get in much quicker and have much more access to followup and direct communication than other nonphysician patients.\n\nIn the actual visit things are different. I generally know the format docs like to hear info in, so tend to \"present\" my case in that format. Things generally move a lot quicker. Because I have at least some knowledge going in, generally the treating doc asks me for my opinion.\n\nAnother aspect is sometimes we don't get \"standard of care\", both for good and bad. An example I had is when I had a surgery a couple years back, the standard would have been to wait it out and see if things improved naturally. Instead, I got an MRI that day was in the OR in a matter of hours. I also didn't follow the typical rehab protocol such as physical therapy, because based on my field I already was equipped to provide my own therapy.\n\nIts strange, because you are blending aspects of patient-doctor, professional, and often personal relationships into a single visit. The same doc I am being seen by now probably might have met me for dinner and drinks a week ago."

            "Look. this post is old. It's outdated. it's honestly shit. I do not know why I keep getting awards. so listen here fuckers. I no longer condone [playemulator.com](https://playemulator.com). Instead, go to [https://www.retroarch.com/](https://www.retroarch.com/) and download the installer. I'm going to teach you how to play all the games you would have played on playemulator much better on something that doesn't reek. Do not worry about computer specs. my shitty surface pro 5 can run it. it's fine\n\ninstall retroarch, then open it up and click load cores. It should be the first option you see. Select download a core, then choose a core for the system you want. Wanna play pokemon? grab a GBA core. Mega man? get an NES core. Final fantasy VII? we'll come back to that one\n\nInstall the core and you're ready to play a game; but first, you'll need a game! I don't believe I'm allowed to link to it directly, but check out a website called Vimm's lair if you want to accquire some illegal roms the safe way\n\nDownload the game files and move them to a cozy safe folder. Don't forget to unzip them! some of them, mainly playstation games, will require 7zip to open. You should really have 7zip anyway so install it if you don't. when your roms are all nice and snug, open up retroarch and scroll down on the left sidebar until you find an option labelled \"import content.\" Select \"import from directory\" and select your snugg little rom folder as the directory. Any folders inside that folder will be scanned if they also have game files in them, so keep that in mind! now, if you did that right, you should see your games organised by console underneath the import content option. Now, you can play them! wonder of wonders! hook up a controller or map the buttons to keys on your computer if you hate fun. You can also map hotkeys to speed up or pause the game! woo! if you wanna play ps1 games, you'll need bios; that's basically the playstation's soul! I'll cover that in just a second!\n\nOh, and if you want to emulate DS games: Don't! Use melonds or dsmume instead! the full versions, not the cores on retroarch! Retroarch has a fit when you emulate a touch screen, and is generally slower when playing ds games!\n\nSince you motherfuckers insist on continually giving me rewards, I'll tell you how to emulate PS1 Games on retroarch. You'll need a core. I like duckstation myself. To make it work you'll need ps1 bios! You can find downloads pretty easily online, but not all of them are safe! If you ever download a .exe file from a site claiming to offer downloads of ROMS or BIOSes delete it quick! Once you've got the ps1 bioses you need (they should be multiple files) you need to find your retroarch folder. It'll be in the folder you installed it to; I installed to my desktop, but if you installed it like a normal person it'll be in your program files folders, which you can get to from \"this pc.\" don't touch the system folder, you'll break things. when you've found the retroarch folder, open it up and go to the folder called system. this is different from the system folder I told you not to touch! don't get them mixed up or you'll REALLY break things! put the bios files into the system folder (the one inside the retroarch folder.) That's it! You don't need to do anything else, retroarch automatically takes the bios from that folder when you launch duckstation. Add your ps1 games the way you would any other game, then launch them! I really *really* reccomend a controller to play ps1 games.\n\nUnder no circumstances are you to attempt to play n64 games on retroarch. You should use project 64. It's as simple as can be, just download it and open a game and you are playing it. the complicated stuff is the plugins and configuration to make certain games work.\n\nTwo more of you FUCKERS gave me awards just now. Fuck you. here's how to emulate ps2 games\n\nPCSX2 is the only emulator you'll want for this. I reccomend the portable version, since it makes it easier to find the folders where you might want to put things. like bios for instance. you still need to give this thing a piece of a real ps2's soul, don't forget. Legally speaking you're meant to steal it from your own ps2 but you won't have trouble finding it online. When you first launch it, it should ask you to select a bios; when you see that window, look inside the PCSX2 folder; you should see a bios folder has been created. Put your bios in there and select it in the window. most downloads will include multiple bioses; this is good! this will allow you to play games from other regions! just select the most updated US bios in the window for now. There's a lot of tweaking and fiddling you can do with PCSX2 to make it run games on potatoes or use the power of super ultra mega gaming pcs to run these 20 year old games in 4K, but as it is now, you should be able to play PS2 games on it, believe it or not.\n\nThree years. It has been three years. how do people keep finding this post. Fuck you. If you want to play modified ROMS such as hacks or translations in retroarch you need to click on import content, click manual scan. Click content directory to find the folder containing your altered rom. Click System Name and choose the console it's for. click file extensions and choose the type of file your game is. Usually it'll be an abbreviated name of the console (GBA, SFC, MD, etc.) If it's a disc-based console like the PS1, you'll want to use the CUE file extension. When you've sorted that out click Star Scan. Now go fuck you'reselves\n\nI have nothing more to teach you my children.  \nSO STOP GIVING ME AWARDS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Tutorial is over. Below this point is the old comment, which is what actually got me most of those awards in the first place.**\n\n[Playemulator.com](https://Playemulator.com) has almost every game from NES era to NDS era. Most of the pokemon games, the good sonic games, several N64 classics and countless hidden gems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: It is also browser based, so no downloadEdit 2: yes, it saves and loads saves great\n\nIt's been a year please stop giving me awards\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still get awards for on this comment. it has been 2 years. Please. Please stop. I don't even reccomend this website anymore, retroarch is so much better stop this\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone just gave me another wholesome award. I'm serious stop. Please. this isn't even a good site for emulators. This was 2 years ago. I've moved on. you should all move on. how are people even finding this post anymore. fuck.",

Thanks to me, the world will be in a near constant state of blissful relief and post-nut clarity. I suspect the world will make huge strides in technological advancements, as well as find unity among races and religions. Civil strife will be a thing of the past when you watch a Jizz Roll and let your stuff blast.\n\nOh sure, even in my old age, people will want my celebrity for personal hire. Some may call them masochists, but I see these elites rich enough to afford an in person pewing as just regular folk trying to ascend to a sexual nirvana. I'd pin them against the wall, or they would do so themselves as their legs won't be doing them much good for much long, as I relentlessly pew them into oblivion. I'd pew them stupid if that's what they want. I'd pew them until their genitals are tender and throbbing from overuse, bright red like a piece of steel hammered hot by a master blacksmyth. As they sit there, blathering incoherently, giggling and lost on a different plane of conscious existence, I'll shoot 'em one more pew for the road. If they die they die.\n\nThat's what I was hired for and that's the power I've been blessed with.",

            "It's not often I get to talk about my profession, but here goes: I was working at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center and had a client come in who was a self proclaimed \"drug lord\".

Included in this history was how he got to where he was currently at. \n\nDuring the conversation, this man admitted to selling his sister into sex slavery, forcibly injecting her with several sedatives and narcotics, and having several people \"teach her a lesson\" (what this meant, he never shared). He told this story with a blank face, smiling only when he recalled the \"good times\", which he referred to as times when he had enough heroin to get through the day. \n\nI'm not sure where he is at now, but this man inspired me to work with victims of sex trafficking, because not only do they deal with the stigma of \"selling their bodies\", they often manage drug addictions.

It\u2019s how we know that murdering people is wrong. \n\nSo when a convicted pedophile client told me, \u201cnothing gets me going like a pair of little girl\u2019s worn panties\u201d, you better believe I judged the fuck out of him. I continued to work with him and I treated him with compassion and respect because he\u2019s a human being worthy of both; I did my job because I\u2019m a professional. But I can\u2019t honestly say that I didn\u2019t judge him. I judged that he should never be around children. I judged that he is not yet ready for change. I judged that his access to his own daughter should be closely supervised. That\u2019s a lot of judgements. \n\nUnderstanding your own inherent biases and how they influence your work is a very important part of training and practice.",

            "Lots of people discussing pedophilia as an example of the toughest stuff to not judge despite our training. I haven\u2019t yet treated a pedophile thankfully. At least not an identified one. \n\nI did run a men\u2019s anger management group though, and some of those men had done some terrible things to women. Most of them I found ways to like and admire for their positive aspects, but there were two guys in that group I just could never find \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d for. One guy basically never spoke in group. He would give one word answers and occasionally just discuss how unfair the \u201csystem\u201d was to him. I worked really hard to open him up and find things to connect over but he never opened up to me or the group. He left the group after he strangled his girlfriend and went to jail. She survived thankfully. \n\nThe other left group early routinely, showed up late, participated minimally and similarly never wanted to open up honestly. He left early one group after we had discussed him staying to the end and threatened me when I told him he wasn\u2019t going to get credit for attendance (something the court required). Oddly, I eventually moved into the apartment below him (completely without knowledge) and listened to him scream at his girlfriend and break shit while I called the cops. \n\nI judge these men. They\u2019re shitty. Maybe they\u2019re redeemable, but redemption requires self-exploration and they both refused to do so. It\u2019s worth noting how differently I felt about them than so many others in the group; men I found ways to help and admire and respect even in spite of their awful behavior in the past.",

I tried to be objective about his experience but I just thought... what a cunt.\n\nI work in inpatient services so it can be hard to challenge myself at times - individuals with diagnosis of personality disorder, for example, can do things that in isolation make you think they\u2019re just being bratty or manipulative, but to think of the experiences that shaped them to react like that in a given situation can help to clear my judgment and find compassion. \n\n...harder when someone bites me or hits me with one of our fabulously detachable anti ligature curtain poles, though.",
            "I work with youth and adolescents who have anxiety, trauma, and/or depression. Some of the kids I worked with had some pretty severe attachment issues. Regardless of this, I never thought I'd have to seriously explain:\n\n\n1. \"You can't just buy a straitjacket for your kid.\" \n\n\n2. \"Feeding your kid ultra Spicy Ramen each night instead of the meal everyone else is eating isn't specifically defined as abuse, but you have to understand the emotional abuse that this causes.\"\n\n\n3. \"Your kid isn't trying to kill you because they stand in your doorway at night crying. Thats likely because they're scared of their traumatic nightmares, but feel like you will just yell at them if they wake you up.\" \n\nEdit: removed a phrase \n\n\nEdit2:\n\n Thank you all for your questions and support. This case has really helped to shape my approach to therapy, and has highlighted the importance of healthy communication between parents and kids. \n\nMy number 1 tip: Don't let someone else tell you how you feel/think. If someone says, \"You're angry with me!\" Or something to that effect, ask yourself if you really are. If you're not actually angry, then don't spend a second more on it. A lot of kids/family members get hung up on trying to justify their own actions according to someone else's perception.\n\n\nEdit 3: fixed straitjacket spelling. No its not a jacket for sexual orientations.",
            "Therapist here. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever judged clients. My job is to understand them and their experiences and help them make the improvements they are ready to make. \n\nBut I have very directly made my thoughts clear about choices, especially choices parents make for/about their kids. This probably comes off as judgement depending on the clients insecurity about the topic. \n\nOne example was telling parents of a child I was working with with a severe mood disorder (that had made both suicidal and homicidal threats and attempts) that it did not seem like a good idea to buy the young kid a gun, especially the week after the mother spent the session sharing her fears that the child would murder her.",

This means my clients are usually involves in legal proceedings (family court, juvenile court, criminal court, etc.) My job is usually to evaluate or provide treatment. I'm not there to judge, that's the judges job, but of course I have my thoughts.\n\nI am usually impressed by the justifications people make for shitty behavior. The one that irks me the most is when parents manipulate their child against the other parent. I've had to do therapy for a 5yo who said she doesn't want to see a parent because they haven't paid child support. Excuse me? What 5yo knows, understand, or needs to be worried about child support.",
            "Opposite side, if that's accepted too?\n\nI was assigned to see the lead psychologist of the local hospital as I was severely depressed and had become suicidal.\n\nShe literally rolled her eyes at me, told me to grow up and said she could be having appointments with people who were actually about to kill themselves, not me who was already working with the team.\n\nThis sent me absolutely spinning, bottling everything up, thinking I didn't deserve help and ended up in hospital 2 years later after an attempt.\n\nWhen they looked at my records the hospital suddenly became very interested in any psychological experts I'd previously spoken to, informed them of the above incident, they asked if I knew the name and I said I didn't, but they had a strong accent, they immediately looked like they were about to burst out crying, apologised excessively then informed me they had been fired a year ago.\n\nNo idea how many people were affected by that therapist.",
            "OP, you mentioned you're getting ready to start therapy. I know we're different, but therapy was one of the best decisions I ever made for myself. It's good to have a neutral 3rd party weigh in on what troubles you. \n\nAnd remember, you dont have to stay with a therapist if you dont want. Therapy, like any psychological treatment, is often more about trial and error to find what works for the individual than anything.  Also, you'll get out of it what you put in, so be upfront, Frank and honest with your therapist. That will help them work with you on determining the best therapy course for you. \n\nI wish you the best of luck.",
            "When I was under age, I got caught with a drink on bourbon street and got a minor in possession.\n\nI was telling my therapist about it, and said that the police caught me with a \"hand grenade\" in New Orleans. He didn't realize that a hand grenade was a type of drink, and it was funny to watch him try to process that his patient might have just casually told him that he had been caught with a fragmentation grenade. He took a big long pause, and said, \"where did you even find a grenade?\"\n\nI realized the misunderstanding quickly and corrected him. But for a moment he definitely was thinking \"holy shit how do I deal with this?\"",

I think he may have lost a child before.  I described watching my aunt grieve over her son's body. I felt so much pain losing him, but was explaining how watching my aunt was dramatically worse. The details about her is what made him lose it. I could tell he was reliving something inside his own head.",
            "When you as a therapist get to that point, it's time to start thinking of referrals.\n\nBe genuine with your client.  And then refer out.  You have to have unconditional positive regard or you'll never achieve therapeutic rapport.  \n\nI think for me, the one that comes to mind is a frequent caller to the suicide hotlines.  He'd call in and say he's not providing his phone number or name, he would just say that you had 10 seconds to convince him not to kill himself over the phone, or he'd blow his brains out and it'd be your fault.  Then he'd count down from 10 to 1 while you're on the phone talking.  At one, he'd hang up.\n\nI'm sure the whole point was to make me feel bad or prove some point, I don't know, I have insufficient information to make an assessment with just that.

I know people don't take that stuff seriously, but it was so bad that i was later diagnosed with PTSD from a psychiatrist.\nAnywho, my abusive parents and i got in a verbal fight in the car. My stepdad stopped the car and told me \"get out we're leaving you on the highway\".

I refused to get back in the car after the attack, so my stepdad got out, dragged me by the hair, called me a \"bipolar bitch\", and threw me in.\nThey made me see a therapist, they told her that i jumped out of a moving car and then i attacked my mom when she was trying to help. This therapist didn't believe anything i said and tried getting me to take bipolar meds. I knew i wasn't bipolar, i was being abused and i knew that the anger and sadness i felt was normal for my situation. She glared at me and said \"you're not nearly as smart as you think you are\". I refused to say a word in any of our therapy sessions after that, i would just go in, sit down, and she'd make snarky sarcastic remarks for a few minutes then dismiss me. She wasn't trying to help me, she was trying to help my parents.\nI moved out when i was 18, went to college all on my own with no financial help from my family, got a job and left the country to be as far from them as possible. I'm on antidepressants for my PTSD and luckily the therapists ive had since my teenage years have been nothing like that horrible woman, but it still upsets me deeply thinking about it.",
            "Not a licensed therapist but a behavioral health technician (basically, means I got a psych degree). I was trained in behavioral intervention techniques for children and was off helping coach parents to support children with behavior disorders. \n\nI'll say this, I rarely encountered a child that had a clear mental illness in the same way as when I worked with adults with serious mental illness. In many ways, they were visibly confused or lonely. Given that most of their parents were suffering from poverty, alleviating the burdens of being poor would have likely mitigated the most severe symptoms of many of the children. Advocating for affordable childcare and livable minimum wages is mental health advocacy.\n\nI found myself judging, not the children, but their parents. Some parents would drop the kids off with me and peace out with a, \"fix my kid\" attitude. As a parent, now, I get some of it; exhaustion and burnout are real. But the best I could do in that situation was provide that kid with an hour long vision of what it looks like to live in a loving, structured environment. Those kids were the ones I could tell who were much more likely to be subject to the \"system\" for the duration of their lives. Either cycles of institutionalization and homelessness or prison.\n\nWhen a concerned parent showed up and asked, \"how do I help my kid?\" I practically jumped for joy for the child because they had someone who loved them and was fighting for them.",
            "I work in mental health and have worked in acute and crisis settings for the majority of my career. The most notable event I experienced was when a young person had presented with significant ongoing suicidal ideation who was dealing with a lot of shit. I spent a lot of time with them mostly deescalation and working out what the plan should be moving forward. \n\nOne of their parents came in a little while later and I had the opportunity to speak to them about where their child was and what had been going on, with their consent of course. Midway through me trying to explain some of the psychological constructs and ways the parent could help they said to me, \"is this going to take much longer I have a show to go and watch\".\n\nAll I can say is, I never judge my patients, I have never walked their path or viewed the world through their eyes. But the people around them who perpetuate the suffering of the people I work with through ignorance, malice and selfishness, I judge them.\n\nEdit and a shameless one. I've tried to reply to as much as I could, I've enjoyed some of what I would assume is trolling and talking about some other people's experiences as it's given me a chance to reflect on some of my own stuff. But I must go to bed. \n\nI'd like to ask one thing of anyone who reads this, remember that you can help, even just by asking how someone is or wishing them well. People who you think may be struggling and even people who aren't. This year has been hard on us all, and I appreciate all of you who have said that those in care services have difficult jobs, but we have all struggled this year. Please be as kind as you can to each other and I hope we can all look forward to a good December and even better new year.\n\nEdit 2. My use of the word 'judge' needs some clarification, I do judge in some ways, it's hard not to with what I see, who I work with and the situations they experience or have experienced. What I mean by not judging is that I do not allow my judgements to distort what I am seeing or how I am working. Which will normally be to the benefit of the patient and those around them trying to help them achieve their goals and meet their needs.\n\nFinal edit. I didn't think this post would get as big as it has. And I cannot respond to every comment individually by any means. I'm sure the post will be getting less attention moving forward but I just wanted to clarify some things.\n\nThis parent, who many people have made multiple assumptions about, was not trying to redirect, deflect or remove themselves from the situation by stating they had a show to watch. The show being something else people have assumed was a TV show. Remember I've made the comment above in the context of a situation that lasted around 5 to 6 hours for me, but took you a few minutes to read.\n\nWith everything that's going on right now I wanted to make this post to let people know, those working in mental health have heard a lot, we don't judge you for how or what you're feeling and we want to work with you to help you. I simply wanted to help in some way with a comment on the Internet that I wrote in one go about an experience I have had. I know that the response to this has been overwhelmingly positive but I would also like to say I did not mean to cause any offence or upset to anyone or claim that I am some sort of unachievable goal of non-judgement. \n\nAnyway, I'm going to try and forget about this now.",
            "Therapist here, \n\nTo piggy back on what others have said, it is highly unlikely for me to have moments where I judge my clients. It happens sometimes, but I\u2019m able to shut down those thoughts quickly in my head and return to being present for the people I see. People are so incredibly complex that my judgment wouldn\u2019t have any meaning anyway and it doesn\u2019t have a place in our work together. \n\nI will admit though, something that does get me feeling a little salty is when I have a client\u2019s parent that attempts to sabotage the therapeutic relationship I have with their child, or pulling them out of therapy entirely when some of the things we talk about challenges some potentially unhealthy family dynamics. I don\u2019t feel anger toward the parents, mostly I feel bad for the kid.\n\nEdit: Wow. All I have to say is that I am incredibly humbled by all of you that have shared your stories. Even though these moments are so steeped in pain, what hits me is the incredible amount of strength present in spite of the upbringing and parents many of you have had.",
            "Patient side here. I had been seeing a therapist for a few months to help with chronic depression and self harm with some pretty intense suicidal ideation. I had tried Suprax in the past, didnt like the side effects and put it down, but I was ready to try something new to supplement therapy. Everyone within earshot was calling Wellbutrin a miracle and life saver, so I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nSince my therapist couldn't prescribe drugs, I got an appointment with a psychiatrist. My first appointment, I explain what I've got going on, what I'm doing to work on it, and what I'm looking for in seeing him.\n\nI do a pretty good job holding myself together in public. I dress myself, I hold down jobs, at that point I lived on my own (now living with my partner); all in all, I've got a well-polished mask. I guess it's too good, because pretty early in our session he looked at me and said, \"I don't think you're depressed.\"\n\nBro.

Could you see that person as another human being that needed help, or were your personal feelings about the abhorrent behaviour too strong? \nThis factor lead some people to not continue my course on to the next level, but it really illustrates the level of non judgement needed in this field. We all have our own personal feelings, of course, but these get talked about in supervision.\n\n\nEdit: Wow thanks for the awards.

            "I'm a dude. I was brutally raped multiple times between the ages of 7 and 10. My one and only attempt at try to get help from a therapist was one of the most awful experiences of my life. I attempted to get help in my early 20s. Upon first going in I was asked what had happened to me, after explaining a basic outline of the abuse. I could already see that she was very dismissive and seemed not to really believe me. She then asked about my relationship status. At the time I was in a long term relationship with a woman who had 2 kids (boys). Upon finding this out she immediately demanded the names and address of my girlfriend, names of the kids and said she would be immediately getting in touch with social services to ensure that I wasn't abusing them... I can't put into words just how much that destroyed me mentally, that she could obviously see something in me that I couldn't see! That somehow she was certain that I would be an abuser! I started to cry... She told me to pull myself together. I also can't put into words the pathological visceral HATRED I have for paedophiles and rapists!! If I could get away with murdering them i would! I would NEVER NEVER EVER inflict the absolute nightmare I went through on any child. \n\nI got up and left, i came very VERY close to the edge of suicide that day. I also immediately ended the relationship because I couldn't deal with the thought that the kids might be at risk because of me. It's now 21 years later and I'm tearing up typing this. Because of that experience I have never sought therapist help again. I survive mentally, but its not good survival.\n\nEdit :- Wow! Just wow! I am absolutely blown away by the Internet strangers who are sending love and care to me. I am currently alone, in the dark, in tears, reading all these replies. To answer a few questions. I'm in the UK. I heard she was fired a few years later after a patient of hers committed suicide and mentioned her 'therapy' in the note he left. I am in a position where currently I'm in such a fragile (very heavily medicated) mental state that If I saw another therapist and got the same reaction that I know my mind would break and I'd take my own life. Every day is a struggle to find reasons to stay alive. I'm sure I have ptsd as I feel the need to be armed with a knife constantly (despite being a big dude, 6'4\", 110kg) i sleep with a knife under my pillow. I often wake up screaming. I tend to be 'stand offish' with everyone, deliberately keeping people at a distance. I know I'm a broken person... I've even avoided relationships with women with kids because I don't want my broken mental state to somehow effect those kids in any way. I have attempted suicide twice and both times I survived. I just want there to be a pill or operation where I could completely wipe out the past, even wipe me out, wake up and just have a new me, minus the depression, anxiety, fear, ptsd, crushing hatred of myself, it would be nice to wake up one day and actually be able to see some value in myself. I'd love to br married and be a dad but currently I'm in a state where I can't ever see or allow that to  happen. I'm too scared that my mental state would fuck up my wife and kids lives. I can't allow that.",
            "Not a judgment - you kind of train your brain not to judge, because you are seeking to understand and help.  When you do those things, you can\u2019t simultaneously judge.

I do feel concerned about this recent phenomenon of young people I worked with self-diagnosing, sharing, and identifying very closely with mental illness; as if the pendulum quickly swung from \u201cnever, ever share your feelings\u201d to \u201cOMG, you\u2019re depressed? All of us are too!\u201d  Life\u2019s challenges can be tough and they don\u2019t need a scientific-sounding label to be valid and real.  You are not your diagnosis.

            "Two contexts come to mind. I often work with people in abusive relationships and it is incredibly common for people to go back to their abusive partners after leaving. Some studies show the average number of times someone goes back before leaving for good is 7 times. I know why people go back and I get that it's often a combination of manipulation, financial control, gaslighting, love, low self-esteem, fear, etc. But, man, it is hard to watch and appear neutral. I can say I am worried about their safety but I can't yell \"for fuck's sake, stop going back!! What is it going to take?!\" Like I want to. \n\nThe other situation isn't really judging the person it's more judging OCD. But OCD is weird. The infinitely weird ways it can show up are so funny and bizarre. Again, I would never judge a person for having the intrusive thoughts they have or doing the compulsions that are somehow linked in their mind to those obsessions, but I absolutely judge OCD and constantly marvel at how creative and weird the human brain can be.",

And they'll talk about themselves as if everyone on earth is better than them, as if their accomplishments are worthless.

But then there are the ones who are there because there is no safer place for them to be, and you're usually lucky to see them because they spend most of their time isolated and doped.  \n\nWell, I was lucky enough to meet one of them right before he got doped and isolated.  He was such a nice guy that I assumed he was an attempter, like me.  You tend to find a lot of the best qualities in people after they've tried to end their life.  With this gentleman, that was very much the case; I saw the best in him.  \"Can I take your plate for you?\" (We have to tell him no, you're not supposed to be anything except self-sufficient on the ward.) \n\n\"Can I do your laundry for you?\"\n\n\"Can I wash these dishes before we send them back to the cafeteria?\"\n\nA lot of this was going on, and after 3 days of it, it was definitely becoming apparent that his typical concoction of meds had fully worn off and he was getting snippy about it.

I'm a little tense and would love a conversation to get my mind off of it.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, B.  I'm gonna finish this pudding and put a show on, what would you like to watch?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.  Hey have you ever tried to hurt yourself?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I have, it's why I'm in here.\"\n\n\"Why didn't it work?\"\n\n\"Well, I stopped myself and drove here after I caught a glimpse of what it would do to my dad if he found me.\"\n\n\"I see.  Well, they won't let me have anything in my room but watch this.\" *He hands me the end of a long strand of toilet paper* \"You hold that end and just watch.\"\n\nNow as I'm holding it I already have this idea in my head that this guy is actively trying to hurt himself, so I'm a bit curious to see what he's doing, but I'm also a bit paranoid that he may have given up on hurting himself and is now targeting someone else.  But as I sit there watching him twist this toilet paper and fold it in on itself, I recognize what he's created as the start of a noose and it dawns on me.  *He's trying to teach me how to hang myself.* \n\nI still think about that guy.  I wonder what he's like day-to-day when he's \"regular.\"  All I ever saw was this overly exuberant bubbly personality which was tailored to make people think he wasn't as crazy as he really was.

Honestly, my holy shit moments have more to do with how pervasive our tendency to judge is. No matter how accomplished or resilient someone is, s/he has the capacity to judge themselves harshly, and often do. The funny thing is, we often judge ourselves much more harshly than others. So I'm often amazed at how blind people can be to their achievements and strengths and how unkind they can be to themselves. My role in those scenarios is to help them seem themselves with compassion and to help them treat themselves as they would treat a loved one. It's a simple but not easy task, and I love every minute of it. \n\nI doubt this response is what the OP was looking to hear, but that's what comes to mind. Judgements are simple things - labels of something (a person, an idea, an object) as good or bad. They are ubiquitous in everyday life. They are painfully easy to make, and the problem lies in that we believe them. Judgment are just thoughts, and like all thoughts, they're not necessarily true.

As a therapist your role is to remain as objective. This is the whole reason people go to a therapist. This doesn\u2019t mean I haven\u2019t had a lot of moments where I think \u201cHOLY SHIT THIS IS WILD,\u201d but that\u2019s different than judgment. \n\nIt\u2019s such a weird/awesome job. There\u2019s also a difference between judging and expressing your concern - it needs to be very delicately worded as to not make someone feel like they\u2019re being judged, because then you\u2019ve lost their trust and willingness to be vulnerable with you. If you\u2019re finding yourself having trouble not judging a client and can\u2019t work your own reasons out, that\u2019s when you refer them out to someone who can be more beneficial to them.",
            "Therapist here. I am a registered Psychologist. This is an important part of our training.

That\u2019s a bullshit answer as no matter what we are humans too who have feelings, emotions, responses, and reactions just like anyone else. My answer was that I would struggle to work with someone who willingly and purposely tortures and kills animals for pleasure. I admitted to my panel of three that it would be difficult for my one biases to not pass judgment on an animal abuser.

I expected the same reaction that men showing their emotions and vulnerabilities get. But she never did. Never even acted like it wasn't an option. She just talked me through it, never acting like my thoughts or feelings were invalid. \n\nSorry, not exactly the point of the question, but if fear of being judged or anything is holding you back from going, please go.

            "Child therapist here.\n\nI had a mother report that her child was having bathroom accidents suddenly, and at home only.

Training tells us this could be a variety of things, such as abuse/neglect, anxiety, PTSD, etc. \n\nUntil I spoke with his in-home behavioral specialist (a clinician that helps behavioral/mental health issues inside the home to help create healthy family routines to cope). She called me and told me the real story.\n\nThe boy was becoming very angry and spiteful with his parents for making him go back to school after full COVID quarantine had been lifted.

            "It\u2019s never the things people suspect they\u2019re being judged for.

I don\u2019t remember ALL the fact, but what I do remember is still wild.\nBasically the parents were indifferent to the children, and ignored the 1st child\u2019s depression and other problems. After the death, they maintained that indifferent attitude and never acknowledged any underlying issues. And they continued to ignore their 2nd child and his developing mental health problems.

            "Therapist here.\n\nHonestly, I have never had a moment where I\u2019ve internally criticized someone for their past. Not even the current decisions they are making. Therapy doesn\u2019t work that way and I can\u2019t do my job properly if I\u2019m being full of myself and intentionally project.\n\nThat said, I *do* sometimes have reactions to people\u2019s stories. And I suppose there is an argument for \u201cthat\u2019s judging.\u201d However, I\u2019d disagree. The way OP phrased their question, I\u2019m inclined to think they meant straight-up \u201cgeez, what\u2019s wrong with you\u201d kind of judgement.\n\nBut I can\u2019t ignore my reactions to people. The whole \u201ccheck your emotions at the door\u201d shit just doesn\u2019t fly in therapy. If you EVER meet a therapist that tells you they can be completely objective, run. That\u2019s just not how people work.\n\nFor example, am I supposed to suppress my pity when a girl comes into my office and tells me she isn\u2019t sad when she tells me her mom died? What about when parents of a handicapped child are *relieved* when their kid dies? Am I \u201cjudging\u201d them in the critical way? HELL NO! Do I reactively feel pity/sad? HELL YES.\n\nWhat about when I feel frustrated because a guy I work with is SO CLOSE to understanding that his partner\u2019s anxiety has little to do with him? Am I gonna get pissed at the guy? NO.\n\nBut part of RESPONSIBLE and competent therapy is that I acknowledge that part of me that instinctively reacts to others\u2019 stories. If I just push it down, it will come up in other ways, and THEN it could damage the work I do.\n\nAs a therapist, I need to be mindful of how I\u2019m reacting to what I\u2019m working with. If necessary, I can consult with colleagues (in an ethical, confidential, de-identifying way, of course). Then, once I process any feelings I may have, I can go back to do what I do.\n\nI love the process of change. And being honest with myself is definitely a challenge. But I would HATE to find myself critical of someone who is doing the best with what they have.",

            "Back when I was 10 there was a competition for schoolkids to write a treatment for an episode of Doctor Who, with the best one being developed into an full episode in the next series and the winner receiving a writing credit. I was a huge fan of DW at the time and the competition was actually run through schools, so my teacher made the entire class do it, but I was very excited.\n\nI began writing a story about the Doctor landing on a planet full of defective cybermen, who's programming had gone a wry and had been left on this asylum planet to rot. The Doctor lands there in response to a mysterious distress call from a woman and attempts to find and save her while avoiding the dangerous dysfunctional cybermen and the looming threat of planetary destruction at the hands of the normal cybermen. I finished my short treatment and gave it to my teacher to submit. Unfortunately it turned out the competition was very strict about the formatting of submissions and mine was returned because I had used the wrong formatting in some way, it seemed like a weird reason. I was a bit disappointed and that was the end of that.\n\nBut then, a year or two later, there was an episode of DW called Asylum of the Daleks, which seemed incredibly similar to my story except with Daleks. So incredibly, eerily, similar in fact, that to this day I am absolutely convinced that Steven Moffat saw my script and came up with a formatting excuse so that he could remove me from the competition, steal my story, change the bad guys and claim it as his own. I have zero evidence, I don't even still have the treatment I wrote, or any letter from the BBC about my submission, and yet I know in my bones that Steven Moffat stole his script from 10 yr old me.",

            "I'm quietly convinced I made a bestselling mystery novelist change the way he writes because I criticised him on Reddit.\n\nThe novelist in question is Chris Carter; the books are the [Robert Hunter](https://www.goodreads.com/series/67232-robert-hunter) series. (Yes, the guy who has built a career on looking for serial killers is named Hunter. He works for the LAPD's Ultra-Violent Crime Unit. It's not a series that's overburdened by subtlety, is what I'm saying.) They are as schlocky a bunch of thrillers as you could ever hope to find, but for some reason I can't get enough of them, despite the fact that they're... very much not great. They lean pretty damn heavy on ridiculous tropes, and I've never seen a more Mary Sue lead than I have in this series, but the biggest complaint I have with them is that the same line appears almost literally word for word in the first nine books. I [made a comment about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/al2fp8/who_is_your_favorite_terrible_author/) on Reddit on an /r/books thread about your favourite terrible authors, and I went back through all of the books published so far just to prove my point:\n\n>***The Crucifix Killer:*** The famous line doesn't actually appear in this book as far as I could find, but Hunter *does* drink Scotch near-constantly as the defining trait of his character. 'Across the room a stylish glass bar looked totally out of place. It was the only piece of furniture Hunter had purchased brand new and from a trendy shop. It held several bottles of Hunter\u2019s biggest passion \u2013 single malt Scotch whisky. The bottles were arranged in a peculiar way that only he understood.' And so it begins.\n\n>***The Executioner***: 'Single-malt Scotch whiskey was Hunter\u2019s biggest passion. But **unlike most people, he knew how to appreciate it instead of simply getting drunk on it.**' Note that in this one and the next Carter doesn't even use the Scottish spelling ('whisky', rather than 'whiskey'), despite the fact that this is *literally Hunter's only character trait*.\n\n>***The Night Stalker***: 'Hunter\u2019s biggest passion was single malt Scotch whiskey, but **unlike most, he knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality instead of simply getting drunk on it.'**\n\n>***The Death Sculptor***: 'Hunter sat at the bar and ordered a double dose of 12-year-old GlenDronach with two cubes of ice. Single-malt Scotch whisky was his biggest passion, and though he had overdone it a few times **he knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality instead of simply getting drunk on it.**'\n\n>***The Hunter***: 'Hunter\u2019s father had a passion for single malt Scotch whisky. A passion that, frankly, Hunter had never understood. He found whisky, any type of whisky, way too overwhelming for his palate.' (I actually quite like this one; it's a prequel novella, so this one is a nice little meta throwback. It gets a pass from me.)\n\n>***One By One***: 'Hunter would never consider himself an expert, but **he knew how to appreciate the flavor and robustness of single malts, instead of simply getting hammered on them.** Though, sometimes, getting hammered worked just fine.' This is also the first appearance of the '... but sometimes getting drunk works just fine, am I right?' addendum. It's nice to see Carter branching out a little, but after this he never looks back.\n\n>***An Evil Mind***: 'Single-malt Scotch whisky was Hunter\u2019s biggest passion. Unlike so many, **he knew how to appreciate its palate instead of just getting drunk on it.** Though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.'\n\n>***I Am Death***: 'Back in the living room, wrapped in a white towel, Hunter switched on a floor lamp and dimmed its intensity to \u2018medium\u2019. That done, he approached his drinks cabinet, which was small but held an impressive collection of single malt Scotch whisky, which was probably his biggest passion. Though he had overdone it a few times, **Hunter sure knew how to appreciate the flavor and quality of a good single malt, instead of simply getting drunk on it.**'\n\n>***The Caller***: 'Hunter\u2019s biggest passion was single malt Scotch whisky. Back in his apartment, tucked in a corner of his living room, an old-fashioned drinks cabinet held a small but impressive collection of single malts that would probably satisfy the palate of most connoisseurs. Hunter would never consider himself an expert on whisky but, unlike so many, **he at least knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality, instead of simply getting drunk on it**, though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.' *The Caller* also gets double points for helpfully informing us that women just don't *get* the subtle nuances of Scotch: 'Hunter tried not to frown at her again, but he was sincerely intrigued. Women in general weren\u2019t very fond of Scotch whisky, which wasn\u2019t at all surprising. Whisky was undoubtedly an acquired taste, one that at first would certainly overpower anyone\u2019s palate and knock the air out of their lungs in the process. Hunter knew that only too well. The trick was to persist, to keep trying, to keep sipping it until one day it finally made sense. Women usually weren\u2019t that patient with drinks. They either liked it at first sip or they didn\u2019t.' This, by the by, is how we know that the woman in question is trustworthy, because... reasons?\n\n>***Gallery of the Dead***: 'Back in his apartment, Hunter had a small but impressive collection of Scotch that would probably satisfy the palate of most connoisseurs. He would never consider himself an expert, but unlike so many of his friends, who also claimed to enjoy single malt Scotch whisky, **he knew how to appreciate the flavors and robustness of the malts, instead of simply getting drunk on them**. Though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.'\n\nThat post was made in January of 2019; in April, his book *Hunting Evil* came out, and the line was nowhere to be seen.

He keeps giving her dreams, and convinced her to burn the Masters at Astapor and take the Unsullied with fire and blood. The other dragons are freaking put during the scene, but he's perfectly calm. He was also staring her down the night before when she woke from her dream.\n\nThe Valyrian Empire was built for the dragons. The dragons told the men what to do, empowered them with wisdom and magic, and built an empire of flame and lava and obsidian.\n\nAnd the eggs begged the Targaryens to hatch them. It's why they had their dragon dreams. It's why so many Targaryens looked to be reborn as a dragon and were driven mad. Aerion Brightflame thought he was a dragon trapped inside a man, and died drinking wildfire. Aerys the Mad King wanted to burn them all and be reborn as a dragon. Baelor the Blessed would pray over his dragon egg to make it hatch. They heard a dragon's voice reaching into their thoughts, and some mistook them for their own thoughts. Dany had a miscarriage but wakes to only think of her eggs, and is found crawling toward them.\n\nAnd all of this can be explained logically. But I know in my bones that there's more going on here.",
            "I believe I am responsible for Alex Rodriguez turning around his horrible season in 2009. Yes, I know that many sports fans think they can influence a player or team, but I really did it, folks. Allow me to explain.\n\nLike many Yankees fans, I was frustrated with ARod. He was always a bit of a dick, and he choked in high pressure situations. It seemed he'd only get the big play when the Yankees were already clinched to win a game, but never when we really needed that hit.\n\nSo, ARod started off the season abysmally. By the time the Yankees came to Atlanta, his average was at .213. You see, I live in Atlanta, so I bought the whole series. It's only 1 out of every 6 years that my boys visit Atlanta, so I get the series every time they do. Another thing is Yankees fans are really good at taking over stadiums. And the Braves are a fair weather team. So we were able to chant and cheer, and basically drown out the Braves fans. We even were able to Yankee role call games 2 and 3. I'm sure you guys think that's super disrespectful, but whatever, Go Yanks!\n\nSo we lose game 1 and ARod goes 0 for 4. He gets booed a few times because were getting fed up with this. Game 2 Joba gives up a HR to Frenchy in the 5th and we're losing 1-0. Cervelli ties it in the 6th and then Jeter and Damon get on base. ARod is up and we need a clutch hit. But ARod never gets a clutch hit. People were already starting to boo him. So I made a decision. If I can get him to be cheered on the road, maybe it'll fire a spark and get him out of this slump. So I start going crazy with \"Let's go, ARod.\" [Clap, clap, clapclapclap]. It picks up steam. The Yankee boos start to quiet and Yankee fans around me pick up my chant. After all, we need a clutch hit, so why not? It spreads as ARod's at bat continues. Within about a minute, Turner Field is booming with an ARod chant. I think it's the first one I've heard in months, and it's while they're playing on the road. ARod crushes a liner to deep center and drives in both runs. Hell yeah, I still don't like you, ARod, but attaboy. We end up winning 8-4.\n\nSo game 3, and I decided I'm chanting ARod all game. It's my personal goal to get him out of this slump. So every at bat, \"Let's go, ARod.\" [Clap, clap, clapclapclap]. First inning, he hits a 2 run homer. We all erupt. 2nd inning, the chant is louder, and he drives in Jeets with a single. 4th inning, we're even louder and he reached on an error. 5th inning, ARod walks. 7th inning, he drives in Jeets and Damon with a single. And finally he strikes out in the 8th. But all in all, ARod went 3 for 5 with 4 RBIs. And he had Yankee fan support the entire game. Support that I hadn't seen in months.\n\nARod went on to play the Mets and have solid outings. Steadily his batting average went up though from the .213 it was when he arrived in Atlanta to .286 by the end of the regular season. Then he absolutely crushed it during the post season.\n\nSo, yeah, I contributed to that. I know players can get hyped by the fans, so I figured I'd show him some support because even though I didn't particularly like him, we needed his bat to perform. I've actually changed my mind on him since he's retired. As a commentator now, he's actually really likeable. And he clearly knows his shit. So, ARod, you're good folk.\n\nAnd for proof, here's the game logs for the Yankees 2009 season - https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=rodrial01&t=b&year=2009",

I had kids, got busy with work, wanted out of the suburbs, got some land in the country, and started planting stuff. Years later I have what I call a food forest. I have replaced lawns with fruit trees, bushes, vines, flowers, all woven together to mimic a natural forest - except everything in it is edible.\n\nIt has changed my life completely. \n\nI just think there's something about being outside in the sun, feet on soil, hands in dirt, planting shit. Watching it grow in the background of your life. Going out and checking on it and watching how much bigger it is getting. Watching life find it, and now you get to live WITH the natural world, not isolated from it. \n\nBirds making nests in your trees, frogs making home in your ponds, seeing bees all around your flowers, butterflies everywhere. Rabbits and squirrels moving in, then owls moving in to eat those. It's this wonderful trophic cascade that you started, and it's incredibly rewarding.\n\nPlus, being able to just walk outside and get chemical-free nutrient-rich dinner is amazing. You can see my food forest in my post history if anyone is interested in seeing what I'm doing.\n\nI actually think a big reason depression is such a big thing these days is because we have all become so disconnected from the life that we evolved in for the last 6 million years. We evolved walking around savannahs and forests, pulling food off bushes and trees, out in the sun, feet in the soil, hands in the dirt. We couldn't be further from that, living inside our isolated homes, cars and offices. It's no wonder we're all so depressed.\n\nI think gardening is the secret to happiness.\n\nEdit: okay wow this blew up quickly. I will try to answer as many questions as I can, mini AMA style.",

Body scanning is a solid one, just imagine a ray of sunlight slowly going over you from your toes to your head, and relax your muscles as the \"sunlight\" goes over them. I hope that makes sense - there's a lot of guided meditations on YouTube that can walk you through it. I also pick a category and try to name one thing in that category for every letter of the alphabet (ex. fruits: Apple, Banana, Cantaloupe, zzzzzzz). And finally I sometimes imagine walking down to the beach near my house and taking a nap there, although I rarely make it far enough to take a nap now. \n\nNone of this stuff works right away, but even one can make a huge difference with some commitment, so just  give it a bit of time :)\n\nEdit to add: KEEP! YOUR! ROOM! COLD!!!! This one actually worked for me a bit more quickly because I had/have issues with nightmares (to the point where my husband literally can calm me down in his sleep), and I saw a major correlation between that and the heat of my room.

As an added bonus, keeping my hair braided stops it from wrapping around my neck and throttling me while I sleep.\n\n* I use a very heavy blanket.

There's this sort of wave of sleepiness that hits me at night, and if I get in bed ~20 minutes of that happening, I pass out almost immediately.  (If I miss that window, I get an adrenaline rush and will be up forever.)\n\n* I try to do soothing, repetitive things at night before bed.  Knitting, folding laundry, etc.\n\n* Sometimes I wear blue-light filtering glasses because that is supposed to help your body properly produce sleep hormones.  And if it doesn't, well, the placebo affect's pretty powerful too.\n\n* If nothing else works, I take melatonin and slowly drink a cup of tea while reading *Calvin and Hobbes.*  (I've got ADHD, caffeine relaxes me.)",

            "I'd be opposed to the extra hour. But not the activities \n\nSchool was already an 8 hour a day thing, pushing it up to 9 hours means it actually becomes  longer than a full time job. And that's before you get to homework and shit like that",
            "They do it already. It's called life skills here.\n\nEdit: 8 hours! It's only 6 here and we get it done. Wtf you wasting 3 hours on every day?",
            "Schools have these already and the kids in them don't care. It's not immediately relevant to their lives so they don't pay attention. Sorta like if I were to talk to you about the do's and don'ts of denture cream. You say, \"eh, I'll figure it out later when I need to know it\" and stop paying attention.\n\nI've taught in several schools that have tried to teach social skills, kindness, meditation, financial literacy, etc. In every case, the kids did not care. It was their least favorite part of the day because it felt like a waste of time.\n\nThe point of education is to teach thinking, not doing. A well-educated student can teach themselves these things. A quick Google search can teach you how to file taxes, cook, etc. But you can't Google how to do Algebra 2 and expect to understand what you read without some background in the subject matter.\n\nEdit: I got upvotes? Now I'm mad with power, so I'll say this: \n\nI hear arguments like this post all the time, and I think the real issue is people not taking responsibility. \"I can't cook? That must be the school's fault! We need education reform!\" No, it's not the school's fault. It's your fault. You could literally Google a recipe in 20 seconds. Stop blaming other people for your problems.\n\nPeople don't realize that the point of education isn't to teach facts, but the change your brain. For example, physics and math majors earn the highest scores in the MCAT, GMAT, and LSAT. It's not because they learned those things in class, but because their curriculum emphasizes logical thinking. When students slack in schoolwork, they're not just missing out on the opportunity to know stuff; they're missing out on the opportunity to be smarter.",
            "My public school had classes that teach these things. I graduated high school a decade ago...\n\nI took home economics and learned how to cook. \nI took financial literacy to learn about taxes and budgeting and investing. \n\nIs Utah just waaaay ahead of the other states or is this a made up issue? I\u2019ve seen people THAT TOOK THESE CLASSES AT MY SCHOOL post memes about not learning how to pay taxes and shit. I wonder if the real problem is that nobody remembers this stuff cuz they teach it to you when it isn\u2019t relevant to your life.",

            "Your grandparents had home economics classes for the girls and shop (trades) classes for the boys. Every once in a while a member of the opposite sex would sign up for and take the \"wrong\" class, to much humor. They don't teach home ec or have shop classes anymore?",
            "I think that they already waste enough time and it would be worse for kids whose parents already taught them that stuff. Washing clothes is really a 20 minute lesson, and cooking/taxes have their own elective classes already.",
            "Washing clothes? So you put the clothes in, some detergent, push a button, then dryer, then a hanger? If you can't figure out washing clothes or cooking on your own, definitely shouldn't be allowed to drive. Taxes, debt and personal finance is something that should be taught.",
            "It's so funny how many of you think that kids will actually be interested in learning about taxes, stocks, etc. In what world do you think high schoolers would be attentive in a class about budgeting/taxes? Have any of you met high school kids before?",
            "This used to be called home ec and most schools had it. Then boomers did away with it because it cost too much. Now they make fun of young people for not knowing things they would have learned in home ec.",
            "I am opposed to it. There's no reason parents can't teach these things to their kids WHILE DOING SAID TASKS. School isn't responsible for every single thing. Also, with the internet, if a parent doesn't know (changing a tire, for example), they can easily learn.",
            "This is all stuff anyone would be able to get info online or ask somebody at home \"Hey, mom, how do you write a check? Boil an egg? Change a tire? Get your prescriptions filled?\" It boggles the mind that kids would be willing to sit their ass in a chair at school for hours to passively listen to this, while \"adulting\" simly means that you take the time to look it up yourself and learn on your own. Since you are \"adulting\", you get to decide how much time you want to spend on any of these things.\n\nLearning to cook does not mean you have to become a chef, it just means you can feed yourself reasonably nutritious food that you enjoy eating. You can go all out and learn to bake a fancy quiche if you enjoy it, or just learn to fry a couple of eggs in two minutes. You decide, and have the power over how you want to feed yourself.\n\nIt's ok if you don't want to learn to do your taxes, although if you only have one job and don't have properties or business, it can be so straightforward that it's probably worth learning to do on your own in a couple of hours.\n\nThere's no need to buy a sewing machine to alter your clothes unless you think you would enjoy it as a permanent hobby, but anyone can spend a couple of dollars on a cheap sewing kit and look up how to sew a button, because it only takes a few minutes and it does come in handy. Totally fine to wait until your button falls off.\n\nThere are no prescribed items you must know to be an adult, you just have to do the best you can with what you have, and that often means learning something new on your own when needed, and you get to decide how to do it.",

            "These are things that can be learned independently by simply doing them. Taxes are damned near idiot proof in most cases because they are designed to be. Washing clothes, follow the instruction manual. Cooking? Watch YouTube, follow a recipe. What these all have in common is that you need a solid grasp on numeracy and literacy. These are things that must be explicitly taught. These are the core skills that underpin almost everything. People who complain about not being taught how to do their taxes tend to have shitty numeracy skills. People who struggle to fill out a form tend to have shitty literacy. Can't read instructions? Literacy issue. You can make education as practical as possible but the fact is: many don't want to learn, until it's too late. I say this as a teacher: we really do a lot to make education as relevant to real-world needs as possible but there is not getting around the fact that a person must learn to be fluent in both reading and writing, as well as be able to think mathematically to cope in the \"real world\". The rest of what we do is for the purpose of teaching you how to learn effectively, how to think in different ways, how to adapt to unfamiliar challenges and how to deal with abstract ideas. We don't teach the model of the atom because you need to know where the elections go. We teach you so that you can learn how to grasp concepts that are not directly observable, make logical conclusions from them and apply abstract ideas to real-world phenomena. The actual topics are just vehicles for these skills",

I had that and it was stupid as shit. We in the course of 5 months made shit cookies, and a ginger bread house, no really that is it. Literally OCT to DEC was a ginger bread house. I have no clue how, but it is true.",
            "Definitely not. The school day is long enough already and it would be very costly to add another hour. Some sort of home economics should be available as an elective class. But there are lots of kids that learn the basic skills from their parents. For kids who have been doing laundry, cooking and so on for years as regular chores, it would be so frustrating and wasteful to sit through a mandatory class on that. I do agree that some basic money management skills should be taught but that can be done in math class - I remember calculating interest and keeping a pretend budget as homework.",

Today there is Youtube and such as well. I'm not sure why people can't do laundry or cook if they can read. \nI'm thinking also....my kids all took Home Economics, Sewing, etc so isn't it already there?\nSo my first thought is it would be a really boring class for some that don't need it but an easy credit and helpful for those that do. An extra hour of their time everyday adds up though and not worth it if not needed.\nI'm also thinking since we moved to a different state the education here is shockingly terrible. We've been blown away at the lack of education and efforts to push kids through the system at all costs.\nMy son came home laughing on his first day because tests here aren't actually tests; the teacher shares the answers when someone raises their hand.\nIt's crazy. \nMy daughter had an assignment on her 3rd day here regarding a subject she had no knowledge of because she entered mid term and should have failed or had to redo it after studying because she only got a 56 on it. The teacher  gave her a B+ with some story about knowing half of it anyway. That's not right, she doesn't learn the subject if she's being pushed through. \nSomething needs to be done but I don't have any answers.

            "How about teaching financial literacy and media literacy? \n\nIn today's world it would do wonders for society if the next generation could avoid taking on too much debt and buying into garbage \"news\" and conspiracy theories. Just imagine!",
            "Repost by somebody else. \n\nI see this \"We should have learned real life skills in school\" thing quite a bit and I want to take a moment to address it. The following is not an attack on you, but rather on the sentiment you expressed.\n\n\u200b\n\nI think you did learn accounting and budgeting for a house in 1st grade when you learned how to add and subtract. Surely by 6th grade you'd mastered 4 digit addition and subtraction which, for most of us, is quite enough to construct a budget. If you wanted to extrapolate your monthly income to yearly goals, surely the multiplication you learned by 7th grade would do the trick. If you wanted to get super-fancy and figure out how much interest your savings account will accrue, that same multiplication applied with a little understanding of fractions would fit the bill.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhat school can't teach you, though, is the willpower to actually sit down and write out a budget and stick to it. School tries to instill this lesson indirectly what with points and grades and earning and such, but it's not a lesson that easily transfers for some.\n\n\u200b\n\nLet's move on to the next one: how to build credit. I suppose school could have taught you the formula for calculating your FICO score, but you'd have to use quite a bit of that math you learned in Algebra II to really do it well. By the way, carrying large balances relative to the maximum amount you can borrow, applying for a lot of credit in a short time, and not paying your bills on time all hurts your credit. Applying for limited credit, spaced out, using that credit, and then paying it off on time builds your credit. Now what are we going to do with the remaining 45 minutes of the period?\n\nAgain, schools try to help you practice these skills. Kind of kid who turns in work late all the time? Bad grade (credit score). Kind of kid who's dog always eats the homework? No one is going to believe you when the dog really eats your homework. Kind of student who makes a good faith effort to learn and participate? You might find that 79 turning into an 80. Doing good earns you credit. Doing bad burns your credit.\n\nTaxes. I love this one. Schools could have better prepared you to do your own taxes if they had placed more emphasis on making the instructions for every assignment more difficult to read and written in the most obtuse way possible. They could have compounded the lesson by ensuring that completing any assignment required for you to locate and properly fill out 4 separate forms, two of which you would require you dig through piles of your old work in order to complete. I'm sure no one would have complained about that.\n\n\u200b\n\nHow to apply for a loan. Step 1: Call the lending institution of your choice. Step 2: Declare that you would like to borrow some money. Step 3: Answer a bunch of questions, including what your SS# is and your total yearly income. Step 4: Get approved or declined.\n\nNo one reads your resume. It's a page and most employers know it's bullshit. Cover letter isn't much better. But even if they had a great deal of weight. . .cover letters (and resumes for that matter) are best as documents tailored to their specific workplace. Tailoring your writing to a specific audience/task one of the chief skills English class is trying to teach you.\n\nHere's the bottom line: You are right. Everything important in your life you do have to learn on your own. School cannot be the place to give you all the knowledge you'll ever need. Especially in a world moving as quickly as ours is. The best school can do is to help you train your brain to deal with complex, abstract concepts and apply those skills to specific tasks. School can teach you how to learn. The algebra and the literary analysis is the substance of how that is done. It's not really important to be able to list off the major character flaws of Macbeth--far more important to be able to take an obtuse document (Shakespeare = tax code?) and make sense of it. Far more important for you to be able to think about this guy who got everything he wanted, and still wasn't happy and what that means for your life.",

I don\u2019t have to put up with you this way any longer. I\u2019m going home.\u201d \n\nAnd walked out. \n\nMost liberating moment of my life.",
            "Well, this might be a long one.\n\nI grew up around a mother with dissociative disorder as well as narcissism. She was addicted to opiates as far back as I can remember, and would do anything to get them, and I mean anything.\n\nGrowing up, it wasn't rare for her to have a tantrum during one of her highs and beat the shit out of me, break me down by picking apart every little thing she knew I was afraid or self-conscious of, and actively sabotage my relationship with my father and siblings.\n\nShe would be up for days at a time, pass out standing up with her eyes glassed over and back hunched, and when she festered once again start moving and otherwise destroying everything in the house.\n\nThere were times where I'd leave and the house would be clean, and come home and it would look as though a pissed off tornado had run through the house i.e. broken glass, animal feces, dirty clothes, roaches, empty pill bottles, ground-up pill residue, and other miscellaneous things littering the house. On particularly bad nights she would hallucinate, and during those times it wouldn't be uncommon to find pools of her blood on the ground from running through glass.\n\nI remember being up for days at a time because her and my father would scream at each other for days at a time without stopping; actively trying to get me to pick one side or the other even if it meant barging into my room at 4 am to begin their screaming match where I could watch.\n\nShe manipulated me, abandoned me at times in the middle of nowhere when she'd meet up with her various sugar daddies (she was still with my dad during this), and never once apologized during her brief moments of mental clarity. If anything, she would blame everything but herself. In her mind she was infallible.\n\nMoney was always a big issue since she couldn't work in such a state. She sold some of her pills, yes, but ultimately those funds were used to buy more drugs anyway. Because of this, we were homeless frequently, without power and water for literally years at a time, and barely ever had any food. It was almost every night I went to sleep with the only thing I'd have eaten that day being a school lunch. On weekends, sometimes I didn't eat at all.\n\nThe rest of my family had no clue this was happening. During the summer when I was 16, my aunt whom I hadn't talked much with since I was a lot younger got in touch. She asked if I'd like to come to stay with them in Texas for a few weeks during the summer.\n\nOf course I said yes, and I was absolutely ecstatic. I didn't bother asking my parents since I'd be very much surprised if they even noticed I was gone so they were unaware. My aunt drove up all the way to Iowa and stayed the afternoon with us.\n\nMy parents seemed to lack the cognition to recognize she was even there out of the blue so they didn't come out of their room. As I stated before would happen frequently, when she arrived our house was fairly clean. We left for a bit to go get food, and when we returned the tornado had already passed.\n\nAs she told me when we were on our way to Texas: the thing that bothered her the most wasn't that our house had suddenly gone to hell, it was that I didn't even react to it. Instead, I tiptoed around the debris and started packing my things without a word.\n\nThis deeply unsettled her, and ultimately she asked me if I was safe where I lived. I said yes, as it was all I had ever known. She told me that what she saw frightened her, and she wanted me to come live with her in Texas. Thinking that she was joking, I brushed it off. After a few days down there though, I knew I had to do it. They showed me love, compassion, and care that I'd never even known existed prior to this and it shook me to my core.\n\nSo we decided, I was going to get emancipated from my parents and move in with them. Ultimately, this involved sitting in a courthouse across from my parents and their lawyer.\n\nThe judge asked why I wanted to leave, and I explained the above.

Is it because of their financial situation? It looks as though you're attached to the perks of living in a family that makes a reasonable amount of money, and not that you want to leave because they're unfit parents.\"\n\nMy mother and father joined in, hooting and hollering actively trying to break me down as they have so many times before.\n\nI let him speak, I let them speak, and I held my tongue until it was my turn. They tried to goad me on, tried to break me as they had so many times before, but I wouldn't let them.\n\nFinally, the judge asked me to speak.\n\nWith as level a stare as I could muster, I looked at mother, my father, and their lawyer across from me and said \"If you're asking me if I have no respect for my parents, then you are correct. However, to say it's simply financially motivated is incorrect. I no longer have respect for them because they have-\"\n\nAs I was nearly finished, my mother, as she had so many times in the past began to squirm and scream at me from across the table. \"HE'S LYING THE LITTLE BASTARD IS JUS-\"\n\nUntil the Judge slammed his gavel down and cut the room; my mother staring up at him in complete and utter disbelief.\n\nI looked at her, keeping the tears I knew were right behind the corner at bay and said, \"For once in your life; for once in my life, behave as an adult. You can't stop me by simply yelling over me anymore, you have nothing to hold over me now. You can do nothing.\"\n\nAs I spoke, the judge motioned to his officer who moved towards my mother. Her expression still frozen in complete bewilderment as the officer aggressively told her to get up out of her chair and escorted her out of the room.\n\nThe judge looked to me, my aunt, my father, and his lawyer with one sweeping glance and then spoke.\n\n\"I am sorry that you have had to deal with this for so long young man. There's nothing more that you or anyone else needs to say. You deserve to live a normal life as a normal kid and it's obvious to me now that your parents are unfit to produce that kind of environment. You will go back to Texas with your Aunt, and we will regularly have our social workers in touch to check in on how you are doing. Make the most of this second chance, good luck young man. Adjourned.\"\n\nThough the bang of his gavel was the only noise that permeated the room, all I could hear was the ringing in my ears. My father and his lawyer were escorted out of the room and the tears I had held back all this time came gushing out like a tidal wave.\n\nIt's been 7 years since that day and I am happy to say that I've managed to grow up and become a well-adjusted adult. I have a great career, great friends, and an amazing girlfriend.

Father kind of just went with the flow and didn't really do much. Aunt came down to take me to Texas, saw how shit everything was and asked me if I wanted to live with them. After some time I said yes, went to court against my parents under the pretense of emancipation, and got to stare them down and layout all the trauma, pain, and fear they've caused me. My mother was escorted out of the room when she tried to cut over me, and the judge sided with us and I was emancipated. Now I'm doing really well.",

That night, both moms called my personal cell to scream at me (our numbers are listed in the online scheduling tool so employees can find shift covers more easily).

One deputy in particular came up time and time again for this kind of thing.\n\nI was asked to interview this deputy for a defense attorney. Deputy had some of the worse report writing skills I've ever seen. Riddled with grammar and spelling errors. Quite often, deputy wouldn't even include the reason he pulls people over in his reports. \n\nSo I go to interview the guy. As part of the process, there's a senior sheriff's rep there that basically is suppose to protect deputies from people like me and keep them from saying things they shouldn't. \n\nWe sit down and I pull out his report he wrote on the stop he made on my client's defendant.  I've already marked it up, English teacher style with a red pen and start with, \"I had some trouble understanding your report.\" I proceeded to go error by error for the purpose of \"clarifying\" the report. He's getting redder and redder. I then go into trying to determine why he pulled over the defendant because it's unclear in the report. He's not able to give a definitive response.\n\nAll the while, the sherriff's rep, whom I've worked with a lot and who I have seen be very vocal protecting deputies in interviews like this in the past, is silent.

The Sergeant Major heard the commotion and comes over and tears the young lieutenant a new asshole.\n\nIt was very satisfying to watch and I learned that day that even though a 2nd lieutenant outranks a sergeant major, it really doesn't matter because the sergeant major had been in for 20 years and didn't put up with any bullshit.",
            "A few years ago a guy stopped me in the hardware store and asked if I was a painter. I looked down at my painters whites and said, yeah I do historical restoration work. He asked how much I charge per hour, and when I told him, he immediately told me I was too expensive and dropped my rate by 25%. I had already given him my number, but he kept belittling me, and saying I wasn't worth it. I just told him that I already had a full time job, and this would be in my off hours, so it needed to be worth my while. He finally let me leave the store, then called me 3 or 4 times, each time hemming and hawing over if he wanted to actually use me or not, he's got a bunch of properties, it would be a sweet gig, but not at those prices. And I just kept telling him that's fine, don't use me if you don't want to. Eventually I recognized his number and stopped picking up. \n\nHe really thought he had some sort of power over me, and I'd jump at the opportunity. Luckily I didn't have to take the work, I was making good enough money as it was. He would have nitpicked absolutely everything, and probably not paid me at the end anyway. But he was so certain he'd have power in the situation, that he didn't seem able to comprehend me not wanting to barter with him.",

            "Worked in a cellphone store, both selling devices and service contracts in the UK. Some kid (19-ish maybe) came in with a much shorter man who I later learned was his dad - for whatever reason (I forget what now) he wanted to cancel out of a contract he was partway through. Now I could already tell from the way the kid explained it in exasperated terms that he knew he couldn't cancel out of it, but his Dad wasn't taking his word for it and had dragged him in to try and 'sort it out' for him.\n\nThe contracts clearly state you can't cancel prematurely without paying off the rest of your dues, which I explained, and his father just went full Boomer Rage mode on me. Spitting, frothing, hurling vitriol - this guy clearly thought this was how you got things done. I stared him down, waited for him to finish, and repeated the contractual terms as stated. He hit me back with 'I'll report you for violating the Sale of Goods act!'\n\nSucks to be him because I had that bitch memorized. I made a point of it, infact, after the first few customers in my early days tried to bring it up to get their own way (*some chode on the internet had made posts about how you could sling the term around and usually scare retailers into doing what you want because 'they don't know it either' so it happened a lot even when there was absolutely no call for it*).\n\nI just looked at him and said 'Sure. Go ahead. You can even use our phone.' and pointed at the store phone right next to him. I knew he didn't have a leg to stand on and any trade commissioner listening to his claim would laugh him off the line.\n\nHe clearly had absolutely no idea how to proceed. After a moment of blank staring he just turned and stormed out with his son rolling his eyes so far back into his head he could probably see his own brain in embarrassment at his Dad's tantrum.",

            "Probably watching a few Texas DPS Officers realize they couldn't shut down a whole airport.\n\nI was working as a flight instructor at small airport on a Saturday afternoon.  We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were \"locking it down\" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.\n\nThe airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said \"I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere\", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said \"it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.\n\nI was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said \"you need to be careful\" and the cop quickly retorted \"AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?\" and he said \"because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller\" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.\n\nI walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said \"you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!\"  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said \"have a nice flight AjaxBU!\" \n\nYou could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.\n\nWe had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",

            "I was a salesman at a wire and cable place. I got a call Friday morning from a tow truck driver freaking out. He needed a replacement cable for his truck ASAP because the weekends were the big business days for him, bragging about the big money in people who leave their cars somewhere overnight because they're too drunk to drive home. He was shitty and rude the whole time we were on the phone. He demanded that the cable be cut and shipped immediately, sent next day air, saturday delivery (pretty expensive). I rushed his order, ran back to the warehouse to hand it to the manager myself to make sure it could jump in line and get cut before the next day air guy showed up. But we did it, rushed every part of it and got it shipped out in time. Every person involved prioritized this order to get it out to him on time.\n\n\nTow truck dude calls me back later that afternoon saying he got the truck working and no longer needs the cable. He asks to cancel the order and get a refund. I explain to him that because he had it cut to a specific length, if we were to take it back, there would be a restock fee (because we're not going to be able to resell it until someone needs that exact specific length). I also explain that I can't refund the shipping costs because the order has already been shipped the way he demanded it be sent out.\n\n\nDude loses his mind.

            "I had a rough childhood with a drug addict father. My mom struggled to make ends meet and my first job was paying for the mortgage. After several months of working (again at my first job) I finally had some money to spend on myself and decided to get a computer and a decent internet connection. At the time the best internet I could buy as part of a dish combo package. I bought a dish and brought it home to install on the house. During this time my dad was still living at home with us but he was hardly there and my parents had all but separated at that point. My dad promptly asked me what I was doing putting a dish on his house. I let him know that I pay the mortgage now and I make the decisions on what we do with the house.\n\nI was young but it was a very empowering moment for me.\n\nEdit: I didn't expect to see all this when I checked reddit again. I'll try to answer questions and things below. I like the jokes, probably a coping mechanism LOL!\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of people talking about the deed and wanted to say something about that. I'm not sure which of my parent's names were on the deed but what I did know is that if I didn't pay it, it was going to foreclosure. We already had warnings and it wasn't the first time that had happened. I was young when this all happened and probably didn't even know what a deed or title was at that time. If I stopped paying, we no longer had a house. A constant argument from parents to their kids is that they pay for the roof over your head so you'll do what they tell you. They rarely say I own the deed, you do what I tell you.",
            "I was working a lab assistant shift(I'm a tech) receiving specimens and such, when a doctor phoned the lab. He was very upset that there was a test that was taking far too long in his opinion. I said okay, let's look at it, and asked what the test was. A fungal culture....\n\nA fungal culture takes at least two weeks to see if anything grows. The patient was in the ER. I politely told him the test was a send out and they generally take about about two weeks or longer depending on the fungus.\n\nHe got all huffy and asked why it took so long and is there a way to speed up the process since he wants to discharge the patient. I chuckled a little because this is a common problem with cultures, we're literally waiting for stuff to grow, we can't just make them grow faster. I told him we don't have magical wands that make fungus grow really fast.\n\nHe then asked for a lab tech because I was just a lab assistant. I then let him know I was in fact a lab tech with experience in microbiology and I can tell him from first hand experience that fungal cultures are some of the slowest cultures, right up there was AFBs, and assured him that if anything comes of it, we'll let ER know. \n\nHe didn't really like that, but said fine and hung up.",
            "My ex was a narcissist and I had learned to basically walk on eggshells in our relationship to try to keep the peace.

One of the tactics I used with our kids was counting to three when they were behaving badly, and if they hadn't shaped up they would go to time out.\n\nCue forward to our divorce; she had manipulated the courts into granting her educational decision making for our kids and enrolled them in a school far from me and close to her. I began volunteering at the school to help in class to give me more time with our kids. She called to tell me that she had made the executive decision that I couldn't do that anymore. I told her she had no right to make that decision. She pulled out the education decision making card, and I told her that gave her no right to tell me what to do on my own time. She started ranting and wouldn't let it go; she had grown accustomed to me just giving in and I wasn't doing that anymore.\n\nShe started getting really angry and yelling. Without even thinking about it, I just said, \"One...\"\n\nShe paused for a moment and then started into it again. I said, \"Two...\"\n\nBy that point she got what I was doing I think, because she took a breath and started a bit more calmly, but then she got to yelling again and I said, \"Three.\" And I hung up the phone.\n\nShe immediately called me back and I ignored the call. She kept trying and I kept ignoring it. Ten minutes later I called her back and we started talking again.

            "In highschool, one of the teachers who I didn't get along with was being condescending to me in the hall outside of the classroom. I had gone to the principal the day before to complain about the teacher's attitude towards myself and two girls that were in the same class. Micromanaging us, singling us out and making comments about us to the other students (example: study well. Lest you end up looking like r/Commander_Prism. And nobody wants to look like him.)\n\nFor the record, I got good grades. But teacher would always try to dock points for the smallest mistakes. Missing a period, can't read your chicken scratch (I contemplated murder at that one), paragraphs too big or too small, etc.\n\nSo I complained about it to the principal, who then had a few extra hands look over my assignments (and the assignments of the two girls) and concluded that the teacher was being a general nuisance.\n\nTeacher got a warning, but I was pulled out into the hall so she could talk down to me for snitching.

Before I got there, a doctor from the same region had stopped to lend a hand. She was from the similar region as those involved in the crash and I had assumed she was the eighth person in the van. She started to try to order me around and tell me I only needed to know certain information about the patient she was with. It went something like this.

I gave her my best look of trying to be nice but their feet are fine right now. When doctors or nurses show up on scene, they ultimately can trump EMS.

The plant manager would not accept a meeting and I finally found him up at the water cooler.

One day during gym, he threw a basketball while my back was turned and hit me square in the small of the back. It hurt like a bitch and I'd had enough. I assumed starting a blatant fight in front of a teacher would get me whooped by a teacher, suspended, or honestly expelled.\n\nI didn't care, as I was a dumb kid and was seeing red.

That same smirk returned to his face as the coach walked me out of the gym.\n\nThe coach took me to the office and I was in sheer panic, I knew I was fucked. He handed me a stack of papers, the school's daily announcements for each classroom and told me to pass them out. I did and was back in that same PE class before the end of the period. The look of shock on the bully's face when he saw me is something I cherish to this day.\n\nHe asked me \"didn't they punish you, aren't you suspended?\" and I responded with \"Yeah, they made me pass out the annoucements. I really learned a lesson today,\" with the biggest shit eating grin I've ever worn. He stopped picking on me after that, but not anyone else.",
            "happened not to me, but around me.\n\nI have a coworker/friend in a hospitality company that was pretty huuuuge. My coworker brought a lot of experience and skills to the table so many executives and bosses want him working on their projects in their departments in their umbrella of the company. When it was time for him to ask for a raise, our manager, director, and executive director turned him down and low balled him with a counter offer so insultingly low he started looking for jobs outside of the company.\n\nCFO, and other senior VPs heard about said move and reached out to him to get him to stay, and they worked it out amongst each other so they can share him in their special projects along with a hefty compensation package.\n\nCoworker being respectful puts in a request to transfer that has to be approved by the current manager, director, and executive director which they promptly turned down. To make matters worse, they go ahead and write him up for \"attendance\" problems from a couple of months ago... We're all salary, and for the most part project based.\n\nThroughout all of this, I am a fly on the wall since we shared an office, here I am laughing with him while he was in phone calls with the literal people who ran the company. He was told to ignore all that, they apologized to him, they got VP of Human Relations in on the meeting explained the situation which then launched an internal investigation unbeknownst to the 3 clowns.\n\nthe ensuing shit storm that came down onto the 3 clowns is more than enough to make this story awesome, but the cherry on top, is that he is now their boss...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: \"management\" team tries to screw over an employee who ends up being their boss.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**: thank you for the award, and as a thank you, I will share the rest of the tea, sorry for the delay. \n\nthe way it would've worked before all this went down, is that, said executive director was gonna be promoted into a VP position and move into the big player's lounge in our main office, director which is clown#2 would've taken EXECdir spot, and clown#3 which was manager would've taken director job. \n\nThe powers that may be, CFO, senior VPs that were working behind the scenes took this opportunity to let the clowns dig a hole for themselves.  and to everybody's delight, they did. \n\nI'm going to start with the matter at hand, CFO and senior VPs told my coworker to sit tight, and they will make sure that he is taken care of, and that he from then on will be only taking instructions from them, with the VP of HR on the phone, the process of re-routing him up the chain of command went super fast. I mean why wouldn't it, the bosses who would've reviewed and approved all this have been working behind the scenes to make it happen and they are all on the phone now. My coworker was told that by the next business day he just had to fill in the proper paperwork and to send it straight to VP of HR, and formal announcements will be made to the rest of the company by the end of the week. My coworker then asked the bosses to use some of his newly granted compensation for a vacation week, just to avoid the drama.  \n\nTHIS WEEK was glorious. The clowns were busy calling my coworker, blowing up his phone. LOVING the drama that was going on, I was texting him updates. Since clown #1,2, and 3 always relied on us salaried grunts to take care of everything for them, their incompetence kept showing in their \"BIG\" projects. Projects that have to be submitted to the same CFO and senior VPs that caused all this for them. Every one of our internal clients (other departments, execs, and bosses within the company) was looking for my coworker, the incompetency of the clowns have spread across at the management level, they are all now bypassing them and going straight to us to get things done. \n\nHR was prompted by the VP of HR to start investigations in the background and we were all interviewed and sworn to secrecy. \n\nThe end of the week comes, and my coworker comes in, brand new suit, sits on his desk, and we start our usual banter.  This is supposed to be the day of the big announcement. Clown #3 calls my coworker into the office to write him up for as many things as clown #3 can. \\*\\*\\*\\*THIS I CANNOT CONFIRM because I'm only hearing this from my coworker\\*\\*\\*\\* but apparently clown#3 was putting the book down on him, and threatened termination due to the number of offenses (they wouldn't have fired him, they needed him that much)\n\nMy coworker has a habit of giving a deadpan face and just shrugging through everything that is not interesting to him, so apparently that's what he did. \n\nWhat I can confirm is that after this meeting, he showed me an email of said clown#3 scheduling a meeting with him and clown #2, and #1. WHICHHHH HE DECLINES IN FRONT OF ME...he laughs, looks at me, says watch this,  he walks out, and after some time comes back into the building with the Senior VP straight to clown#1's office Exec Dir.\n\nsome time passes and it was fun to watch Clown #2 Director, and Clown #3 Manager rush to the same office. \n\nThey were all passed over for the promotions, were not granted their raises, and now all their projects go to my coworker for approval. \n\nI no longer work for the company, after some more drama I have moved on as well. I'm still in touch with my coworker, the last update I have heard is that clown #1 and #2 exec director and director would be retiring this year after so long with the company. \n\nI heard that #3 burnt the team to the ground due to sheer incompetence, and is on the way out as well. #3 started the team with a total of 9 direct reports now down to 2.",

            "My homeroom teacher in 10th grade, Mrs. Isaac, was awful. Among other things, she had a curious habbit of making cheerful little comments to people about how they're going to hell, will die alone in the street, and other lovely things of this nature. She somehow also got management backing to do pretty much whatever she wanted - giving punishments, changing schedules without asking anyone, and so on.\n\nShe had this going for several months, until she made one big mistake. According to what I heard, at least, she chirped to the resident math teacher that \"married women who do not cover their hair go to hell\". Said math teacher, of course, was a married woman who did not cover her hair, and did not appreciate this comment.\n\nAbout a week later, Mrs. Isaac decided she is pulling her class from all other classes for a bible prep marathon. Now, to be fair, there WAS a big exam coming, but you could say that about most of the other classes, too.\n\nShe sent a random 7th grader to our English classroom, to tell the teacher that we're being called for a prep marathon.\n\n\"Who is calling?\".\n\n\"Mrs. Isaac.\"\n\n\"Oh. In that case, it's a no.\"\n\nWe were utterly shocked, and amused, because... That's not a thing teachers did? \n\nShe made a few other attempts, but it seems all of the teachers decided they had enough, and flat out refused to send us to her little prep marathon.\n\nThe best part came on Thursday the same week. She sent in yet another 7th grader to call us. Except this time - it was Math class.\n\n\"Who's calling them?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Isaac.\"\n\n\"So it doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"But Mrs. Isaac said-\".\n\n\"I know. I don't care.\"",

Eventually the company wen't to court and got a court enforced ban for his vehicle. Basically he was banned from entering the car park and if he stepped foot on it they would get arrested for trespassing.  \n\nWell he kept ignoring the ban and police kept being called but they're always too slow and he would've left by the time police arrived so the company applied to have the vehicle towed.  \n\nWe had a tow truck on standby around the corner and waited for his vehicle to ping up on the ANPR system. DING! His number plate flags up and i text the tow truck. We wait for him to leave the car and along comes this truck. Within seconds the truck has deployed the crane, locked the wheels and lifted the car on to the bed. Driver starts strapping the car down as the owner arrives. My manager and I stand there explaining that his car has been towed for trespassing and abandoning the vehicle etc... Police are on the way and the tow truck is leaving. He starts to kick off about how it's a public car park etc... Wrong! With a few sheets of paper we show him the law, rules and court rulings against him that he had ignored and also served him (Once the police arrived) the court county judgement against him forcing him to pay well in excess \u00a37,000 all because he thought private car park companies we're illegal and how Facebook was his source of \"facts\"  \n\nHis vehicle was left unclaimed due to the high cost of recovery/storage which allowed the company to claim the logbook and auction the vehicle off to recover the unpaid tickets.  \n\nThe guy got a good kick in the teeth that day.

Shortly after the in-person interview, they call me and say they absolutely loved me and that I would be a great fit at the company. However, they thought I was \"a little too green\" (implying I was inexperienced) for the senior-level position, but lucky for me they have an opening for the junior-level position (at a salary decrease). \n\nI kindly told them that the reason I applied to their job posting in the first place was because it was a senior-level position and that I wasn't going to take a step backwards in my career by taking a junior-level position since I had both the appropriate experience and the work history. I also let them know that trying to trick someone with senior-level experience into taking a junior-level position by stringing them along through interviews and a job offer was deceptive and unethical.\n\nThere was silence over the phone for a moment and then the interviewer said in an offended tone, \"Well we've all had to make sacrifices for [company name]!\" To which I replied, \"You may have had to, but I don't make sacrifices for anyone.\"\n\nStunned silence. \n\nThen the interviewer, who was so appalled that they didn't know what to say, replies, \"Well ... Maybe you can think about it and I'll call you tomorrow to check in ...\"\n\nI said, \"No thank you and please don't call me.\" and hung up the phone.\n\nThey do this a lot to young ~~females~~ people like myself in a variety of industries.

It was packed. (It was a corner lot so there were multiple beds on two sides of the house.) When we asked her wtf she was doing, she said she had just planted them to make the house look nicer while it was listed for sale & that she really liked them & didn't want to have to but more for her new house.

I hated her. I couldn't really do anything about what she spoke because the HR was not even taking sexual harassment complaints seriously, let alone this one. \n\nAlso it turned out, my apartment's owner was friends with this woman and she had a spare key to my apartment that she stored on behalf of the owner who lived abroad. If she found out that I was in a relationship with someone not from my caste, then she could tell the owner and they could have kicked me out for being sinful in their house.\n\nIn few months, I found a better job and I gave my notice at that workplace. I was also getting married in few weeks, so I was moving out of that house.

So not only was it hot out and we\u2019re all in tuxes serving a shit-ton of people, the family of the bride who are funding this affair are some of the rudest and most-demanding people imaginable, so it was not the most fun gig in general. \n\nWell, one of the aunts on the bride\u2019s turned out to be the rudest of the bunch and kept trying to pull the \u201cI\u2019m related to the bride so give me give me give me\u201d-act (even though she wasn\u2019t even in the fucking wedding party), and was just making the lives of any one of us who came in contact with her even more of a living hell than what we were experiencing, including the owner of the company, who was lead bartender at the main bar. \n\nNow that point is key because, by some grace of whatever higher power/force/fate/kismet or whatever you call it, I was also working that same bar, which gave me the opportunity to bear witness to the most beautifully constructed instance of comeuppance to which I had ever seen to that point, and don\u2019t expect to ever see it bettered again: the nightmare bitch aunt is in young bossman\u2019s bar line, and loudly complaining the whole time how long it\u2019s taking, and she shouldn\u2019t even have to be waiting in a line anyway because she\u2019s whatever-the-bride\u2019s name\u2019s aunt, blah-blah-blah, just making a huge stink.

I want to talk to your manager or the owner or someone who\u2019s an adult who can get you out of here and get the job done right.\u201d To which a huge shit-ass-eating grin washed over his face as he replied, \u201cHi!

I tell the fellow behind the desk that this should be for 24 hours, and he says it is not in the system and it is spoken for already after we return it for another rental. I ask if there is anything we can do at which time the owner comes over to see what the issue is.\n\nI explain it to him and he proceeds to chastise me, saying we must not have ordered it correctly, if we need it so long why are we 35 minutes late, and a bunch of other down talk. By this time my father comes in to see why I have not come out, and also gets talked down to which upsets me internally. I tell the owner that we need to move at least the big things, so if we only have 3 hours we will make it work the best we can (then rent another truck elsewhere during the week) but he keeps chewing up more time arguing then says the kicker. He will look up the call recording to see who is right. I have absolute trust in my father when he says he did something, so I agree and wait.\n\nTurns out the owner was the one that took the call and he gets smug. \"I have done this for 20 some years and I don't make mistakes.\" Five minutes later, sounding defeated, he is asking us to bring it back early so we don't mess up another person's move (guilting us for his mistake that he never makes). On the call you clearly hear my father asking for the 24 hour rental with multiple confirmations from the owner throughout the call. Guy was a real jerk, never even apologized for anything.

            "At the old courthouse I worked at, the stairs leading to the courtroom were often crowded. As I was trying to squeeze by everyone after stopping downstairs, some guy towards the top of the staircase intentionally stepped in my way and refused to move. After asking him to politely move twice, he made a comment under his breath (but purposefully loud enough so I heard it) that I should essentially go screw myself and that lawyers are entitled assholes and should wait in line like everyone else (which they actually do). He didn\u2019t move so I said sorry and quietly waited behind him for a few minutes. \n\n20 minutes later, I call him out of the courtroom to plea bargain and got the satisfaction of seeing his face when he realized I was the prosecutor",

            "I worked a summer at a drug store as a supervisor for the 2-10pm shift while going to university. All the managers went home at 5pm, so I had acting manager powers as soon as they went home, because it made more sense for me to make the call than it was to call or text one of the managers and wait for their approval.  \n\n\nNow, at the end of the summer, starting in mid July, we started to put a lot of our summer items on markdown. Things like toy balls branded with Paw Patrol or the like, water bottles, various water guns, etc. We also had variants of each item with our store's no name brand equivalent.  \n\n\nIt was about 9:30pm one night, and I was covering the till for one of the cashiers because she was doing her end of shift paperwork - counting bills, etc. A woman comes in, spends about twenty minutes going through our clearance aisle. We were a 24hr store, and I was getting replaced soon so I didn't really care about rushing her to finish her transaction before my replacement arrived. Still, she managed to go through everything and finish about 9:45, and came up to my till.  \n\n\nShe had a few things, nothing particularly of note, and some water bottles from our clearance section. One was a Paw Patrol one, the other a no name. Naturally, the no name was marked down for 50 cents because corporate didn't particularly care by this point, and was just trying to milk it for what it was worth. The Paw Patrol one, being the last of our stock, was marked down for $1, since its base price was about $5 higher than the no name.  \n\n\nI ring her up, think nothing of it when-  \n\n\n\"Um, excuse me?\" I respond with a plastered customer service smile and my usual routine of how I could help her. She goes- \"This water bottle is more expensive than this one.\"  \n\n\nI won't lie, her comment temporarily broke me. It was like inputting your own answer to an interaction with a Skyrim NPC. This isn't in the script, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Yes, different things cost different amounts of money, that's usually how it works.  \n\n\nI try to ask her to elaborate, to which she says: \"I got them from the same shelf. They should be the same price.\"  \n\n\nNow, in normal stores with normal full-price items, you will also have multiple items on the same shelf that cost different amounts, but I'm 15mins until the end of my shift, and I'm barely functioning as it is. I explain that there's a sign on the shelf that says the clearance items are marked per item via a sticker on the object, and show her the differing price stickers on the bottles as proof. She demands that I show her the sign but I can't leave the till unattended, since we had a pretty strict policy as being a 24hr store, we were at a higher risk for being robbed. I explain that she can go get the sign and I'll walk her through reading it, and I can tell that this woman just Does. Not. Care. She demands that the second bottle be marked down for the same price as the first, saving her a WHOLE FIFTY CENTS, to which I go \"absolutely not.\"  \n\n\nOf course, this is where she demands to speak to a manager, which is like music to my EARS. I have two minutes left until the end of my shift at this point, and I just lean over the counter, clasp my hands before me, and go: *Hi, I'm the manager. How can I help you?*  \n\n\nShe just paid for the bottles in full after that, and I never saw her again.",

            "College job. Retail. I usually did stock/warehouse stuff but I could run register if needed. I was doing this one day in a surge and towards the end the lines were gone (three other registers operating) so I put up the little chain in front of the checkout lane and turned off the register light while taking care of a last customer with a bunch of cat food cans (time consuming). With the rush gone I wanted to head back and check in on the warehouse and relieve anyone for a break if necessary. Plus there were other cashiers.\n\nThis Sam Elliott wannabe-looking dude walks on up while I'm finishing and just unhooks the chain and plops his shit down. Doesn't ask me about anything. Doesn't even make eye contact. And listen; in most cases I bent over backwards for customers but his disregard and the fact that I was heading back to college in a couple days led me to finish the cat-can dude and then just walk away and said, over my shoulder, \"hey can you put the chain back up on your way out?\"\n\nIf he'd just asked I would have helped him out but if you've worked service jobs you have extra sensitivity for people treating other service workers like they're nothing.",

So growing up my mother, who over always suspected of having OCD (particularly since I was diagnosed with OCD), would INSIST on clothes being folded a certain way. Especially towels. Towels had to folded a particular way or she would have a full blown fit. \n\nSo about 3 years ago when came to stay with us to help with the new baby since we were first time parents. One day we sat down to fold laundry, which included a big basket of towels. She started folding them when I stopped her;\n\n\"Mom, that's not how I fold my towels. They need to be folded like this.\"\n\n\"That's not how i fold them\"\n\n\"*making some hard eye contact* Well, my home my rules.\"\n\nShe was soooooo pissed but knew she had nothing to hold her argument.

            "I found out my parents wanted to send me to a different secondary school from all my friends, for several reasons that made sense to them, but little lonely me who didn't have many friends was not happy AT ALL to be losing those I had. And then, I found out that not only would I have to start all over again, but this school had lessons...on SATURDAYS.\n\nWell, fuck that. I hated school at that age, weekends were my refuge, and now I was even losing some of  that? Nope. I cried, I begged, pleaded...but their minds were set.\n\nAnd then...and then someone let slip that this school had an entrance exam. It wasn't difficult, I was pretty sure I could pass it, but my parents clearly assumed it was a given, clearly having forgotten that I had free will, or assuming that I was so used to doing what I was told that I'd just do it.\n\nWRONG.\n\nIn my very first act of childhood rebellion (aged 11), I went and told them that if they made me do it, I would fail the entrance exam on purpose.\n\nYou could see that it had not even occurred to them that this could happen. I still remember the moment of pure, unadulterated surprised Pikachu face before the sputtering, shouting, threatening (not violence, just grounding, loss of privileges etc) began. My favourite exchange involved my Mum telling me that I WOULD pass that exam and me responding, \"No I won't. You can't MAKE me,\" and rendering her, for one of the first times in our relationship, speechless.\n\nThe whole thing was as revelatory for them, especially my Mum, as it was for me. I learned to stand up for myself, and that I had free will, and they learned that I wasn't some obedient little girl who would participate without question and was not just always going to meekly fall in line. \n\nThe change of school thing was dropped. I didn't really even get punished too much, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong and my parents (who may have come off sounding terrible but were in fact wonderful, just unaware of the stubbornness they'd gifted their daughter) felt uneasy about teaching me that exercising free will was wrong, particularly as my mum was a teacher. I wasn't allowed a riding lesson that week, and that was it. \n\nFunnily enough, I now think I probably would have been better off changing schools. The reason I didn't have many friends was that I was bullied at school - quiet, academic, wore THE MOST ridiculous glasses (adult-sized, on a 7yo's face, because my sight was so shit that they didn't make lenses the strength I needed in child sizes in the 80s \ud83d\ude44) - so a new start in a new school where no one knew me would have been an opportunity to start over. But the fact that I'd been bullied made that seem like a horror instead of a good thing and I didn't have many friends but those friendships were hard won and close because we were all the outcasts for various reasons (kids SUCK). That school (despite the Saturday lessons) catered for more of my interests and favourite subjects too.\n\nThing is, if my parents had sat me down and talked to me about it, pointing out the positives of a new start and that the school had a curriculum that I'd love, and reassuring me they probably could have talked me into it. The mistake they made was simply trying to steamroller me and ignore my feelings and thoughts. So there's a parenting tip for you.\n\nIf this story ever comes up, my parents deny it, or say I'm misremembering or embellishing it, but I'm honestly not. It was such a moment of revelation to me, such a formative experience that it's imprinted on my memory, the day I learned that I had free will even if it contradicted my parents."

            "A lot of people underestimate this question, they think the worst that'll happen is whatever is going on now you have to wait 8 years to experience again but no. Think about the butterfly effect, if you do one tiny thing differently in  those 8 years you could end up not meeting a dear friend, girlfriend, wife, etc. You could end up completely changing the course of your life not necessarily for the better. Think about all of the good memories over the last 8 years that would evaporate when you eventually make that first different decision. Remember, this isn't a video game, you have to remember exactly what you did over 8 years if you want any sense of normalcy, and trying to do that with a mindset 8 years ahead? Forget about it. You could try to avert one bad thing that happened to you and end up in a worse situation down the line.

They told me there was one open in my town, but it didn\u2019t work out that way. It was great money and I was newly married. To sweeten the deal and not lose me, they offered me a furnished room in the building and it was only Monday through Thursday. Some of the best times of my 20\u2019s were had there. Wii bowling every night, big dinners, movie nights... the whole 9 yards.

He loved telling old war stories and I enjoyed hearing them he was good at telling them.\n\nBut the dementia ward would ruin that every night.

I remember one had gotten out, kind little old lady in her pajamas I found her on the side of the road trying to hitch hike to the mall.

            "Currently living with one elderly relative who has been experiencing increasinly severe dementia for the past 5 years, I would say no absolutely not.\n\nHe is depressed because there is nothing to remember and nothing to look forward to. He has not been able to articulate his needs for at least 3 years. He gets angry when asked to put on pants. Poops himself regularly, and gets angry about that too. Sometimes he tries to hit housemates. Sometimes he lifts up my skirt because he believes I am hiding something.\n\nHe was living independently and driving before moving in with the family. He was a great man, and still tries to be polite to others when he isn't afraid/ashamed. Cognitive decline takes away more and more of a person, until there is not much left. Early dementia can damage a person's ability to feel enjoyment by physically damaging their brain. \n\nIt takes serious mental effort to be able to respond with understanding and compassion every day with no end in sight.",

            "No. While I have volunteered and done entertainment at retirement / nursing homes, I wouldn't want to live there.\n\nWhile it's nice to talk to the people living there and hear their stories, it's also as depressing as it is insightful. These people have seen so much death and lost so many people compared to a 20-30 year old that a lot of them treat it as normal to bring up in a conversation.\n\nAnother aspect is the high death rate. The people in retirement / nursing homes aren't young anymore and in most cases also very ill. Then there's dementia. Seeing people slowly loose their identity is an extremely harrowing experience. And having to see this over and over and over again, every single day sounds like an absolute nightmare.",
            "No. A few hours a day is a lot of time. When you\u2019re working it not only gives you income, it gives career experience, which is so important when you\u2019re young. I also think living in a retirement or nursing community would feel very awkward to me.

No one cared.\n\nI had to deal with angry mean staff who took any criticism very harsh, I did not feel I had proper privacy... There were also a few old men with sexual urges who had no idea how to manage them too. It was a big issue they were struggling with.\n\nThen there were the people dying around you. in those 6 weeks about 4 people died. Then a few days later someone else was in there room. \n\nIt is not a place I would ever go willingly too. Going back is one of my fears. You need to be a certain type of person to handle it... So many sad people, so many lost people and so many people who would cry because their family would not visit.\n\nThe visitors only saw the happy parts because when they came the elderly were happy.

She has a house, a workshop/office and a handful of out buildings for utilities and storage. You cannot see any of her land from a road. \n\n\nShe is older but still vital and full of life. One of the most active people I know, she is always busy and has something on the go. Her battles with multiple cancers over the years have left her battle scared, missing part of her lungs, and her bone density is low. \n\n\nI live with her to keep her company, help share the cooking/cleaning and to help around the home/property. I pay a small rent in the summer, in the winter I live rent free as long as I shovel snow off the paths and roof. Winter is remote and lonely here, it takes a certain person to live through it alone. I have my own bathroom, bedroom, and small office room; the most space I've ever had entirely to myself.\n\n\nShe has become one of my best friends. We are very different people but I respect everything she has been through. She is a great conversationalist, an avid reader, and enjoys conversations about almost everything. Ive learned a lot from her. She is a way better housemate than most of the people I lived with in university.\n\n\nOlder people can be super awesome. People of many different ages have lots to offer one another, you just have to be open to the opportunity",
            "Definitely. Old people always seem to like me from the start. And I seem to get along better with them than with most people my age.",
            "No. \n\nThat's an important point in your life for psychological growth and exploration. Living in such an environment is going to forever change how you see the world: it will always be through the lens of the inevitable death and suffering you will witness... daily. \n\nThis isn't a good or bad thing, it's just a very strong thing.

            "That\u2019s a wonderful idea!! Most older folks I\u2019ve met enjoy being around young people and talking to them. And I love old people games like cribbage, hearts, spades, whist, etc",
            "I think the Netherlands tried this with students. Rent free and in exchange they\u2019d bring 30 hours a month with the elderly. Going to get coffe, walks. Etc.",

            "I worked in a nursing home in my 20's.  Thy were some of the most fascinating people I've ever met.  Nurses who worked before antibiotics, old moonshiners talking about out running the cops, people who survived the depression.\n\nNot all old people are great, assholes are assholes, young or old.  However I heard more great stories and really enjoyed the people I met.",

            "Selling panties online. \n\nI've seen a couple posts about how someone could exploit desperate dudes on Craigslist by buying women's panties, spritzing them with perfume, and then selling them online. Were it so easy!\n\nNowadays, buyers want to see photos of a real woman in the exact pair they'll be buying, or proof in the form of being Pantytrust certified. They'll want extras or special requests for their order (plenty of fetishes to go around), and the vast majority of them will drop off the face of the earth when it comes time to actually pay. You'll have to sift through hundreds of responses to your ad, knowing most of them will be time-wasters just trying to get a little dirty talk or some photos. \n\nMy advice? Don't bother. Leave it to the camgirls who make some side cash off selling their panties, because there's always going to be someone willing to go a step further than you, and they will be the one to make the sale.",

            "Writing a long story.\n\nI'm about to finish wrapping up my first ever seriously long form piece of writing. It's going to about about 160K all told. You may think to yourself, _'That's not too long, I can read a book that length in an afternoon.\"_, or _'I can knock that out in a month or two, just writing a couple thousand words a day.'_, or _'You just tell a story and it all leaps out fully formed.'_\n\nAnd you'd be wrong.\n\nWriting, as enjoyable as it can be for author and audience, is a lot of work you just don't see. Yeah, you see the finished product, but what you don't see are things like drafts, discarded scenes, variant writings, conversations with editors, freewriting exercises, and all the just sheer ideas that come up and don't make it. I'd estimateI have easily spent more than a million words behind the scenes making this project happen.\n\nIt sound easy: you have a plot and you make it happen, starting at page 1, and do through to the back cover. A lot of my writing is somewhat out of order; starting from page 1 is honestly a snoozefest and chore -- I don't want to read the part of the fantasy story that's Farm Boy baling hay, and nobody really likes that part either unless they're a medievalist and the book goes full Tolkien about how that works. I have probably deleted 75% of all the words I've ever spawned for the product.\n\nBeyond spewing words, there's tone to mind, characters to track, continuity, foreshadowing, building, managing tension, avoiding forcing cliches or stupidity, making imagery, dialogue that's nice to read and also you can imagine being spoken... And this has to all be managed under a word count that's enough for your reader to get the point without boring them or wearing your fingers to nubs.\n\nWant to know how long it's taken me to write this thing? 2 fucking years. I've loved it, but hot damn, it was way harder than it looks when you just see the finished product and can just think I sat down one day and make it all come to life without complication.\n\nWriting a novel length piece of fiction is tough. I plan to do more, but I no longer have the idea I'll be able to just pump out a piece every couple months like clockwork at a couple thousand words a day.",

Our emotions, our feelings, our hatred, all defined by our history and surroundings. It has defined our past, it defines our present. However, when I see these flightless aviarians, I see not a faulted species, but a mirror of ourselves. We have only known this conflict, but we shall not be defined by it. Neither of our species can fly. But with peace as a possibility, perhaps we can both soar...",

The machine guns are a foreign concept, you got to understand- they run and hit and stuff but can't shoot, can't comprehend that something can move that fast. There was a human raid on their peaceful community a week ago, and now emu-nationalists call for the ethnic cleansing of all of the human minorities living in Krikitititikitikiti and the surrounding cities of Krok and Pkaa'apkpk, where most humans live.

Simply put, we believe it\u2019s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result.

To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected.

Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.\n\nWith all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.\n\nWe ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you\u2019re able.

            "We need an end goal. \n\nIt's not enough to say we want change. We need specific demands that until met the protests won't stop. \n\nI just dont know how we come up with that.",
            "I'm not American but I can see this cycle happening again and again. Something happens, people get angry, riot, promises made, things settle down, nothing happens until something happens and it starts all over again. Seems to have been happening decade after decade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm curious on what solid reforms and changes that need to start the day after protests/riots stop from the view of minorities? What are those things that you've been waiting decades?",
            "I saw a live stream from Charleston where they were organizing and getting ready to march. The police were right next to the protesters and the two parties were talking and working with each other about what needs to be done so that everyone involved can go home safely after. It was very civil and honestly uplifting to see black protesters working with white police officers in this political climate, and in a way that makes sure no one gets hurt, innocent people don't lose homes or business.\n\nAnother protester got up and said that he talked to the neighborhood association asking permission to use certain streets and how they need to be respectful of the property because destroying it isn't going to help anyone.\n\nBUT THEN!! some stupid little white kid got up, and I quote, \"they want us to be peaceful... we need to fuck everything up to get our point across!\" He was met with boos and blank stairs.\n\nThe whole stream was a great example on how the peaceful people in the crowd protesting are the ones who want real change and the rioters dont care about the cause, they just want to watch this country burn. Literally and metaphorically.",
            "I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied \u201ctoo\u201d at the end. I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less. Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people. \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically. I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore.\n\nModern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!). It\u2019s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas. It\u2019s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division. It\u2019s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths & potential. It\u2019s enforcing laws in school that don\u2019t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is \u201cunprofessional\u201d and a \u201cdistraction\u201d to other students. It\u2019s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a \u201cdemographic\u201d without money & thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us. It\u2019s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline. It\u2019s fashion companies & movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what \u201cblack people\u201d are to others across the world (imagine you\u2019re from a place with no black people- if all the movies & shows portray us a certain way, you\u2019ll assume that must be true).\n\nWhen  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes. He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was. How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at \u201cone of them tech companies\u201d. I hugged him & told him  thank you. When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out.  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn\u2019t  have a chance. And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them. I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff. But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn\u2019t  have to deal with?\n\nSo please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we\u2019re asking for is change. Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety. That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin. That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die. I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don\u2019t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don\u2019t have to pass down that generational trauma.\n\nIf you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate. This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart. Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don\u2019t hear others.\n\nEDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston & its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow! All love & hugs from me, thank you for making a girl feel heard",

            "To all the people ITT who don\u2019t understand what race has to do with it: fine, take race out of the equation. Are you ok with cops kneeling on people\u2019s necks? Breaking down people\u2019s doors and shooting them when they aren\u2019t even in the right house? Do temperamental, easily frightened, trigger happy frat boys who fancy themselves a super secret brotherhood sound like quality law enforcement to you? When an authoritative group is allowed to act with impunity, too many give in to cruel, animalistic treatment of people they have hidden (or not so hidden) prejudice against: sex workers, drug addicts, the poor, the mentally ill, victims of domestic violence, and YES, PEOPLE OF COLOR. Too many give in and not enough stand up to it. We NEED police reform. This is not acceptable.",
            "I want to go on record saying I attended a protest in a small Tennessee town tonight, for a short while, and while I was there it was \\*not\\* the protesters who got violent.  They were very kind to me when I asked if I could take  and document, when I explained that I would not post them under my own name out of respect for the tragic event, and as I set up my camera. All they did was give me their blessing, nod, and go back to yelling \"Fuck Racism! Fuck the KKK!\", \u201cWhat do we want? Justice!\u201d, \u201cWhat was his name?

            "I am a white conservative-leaning male. As a white conservative-leaning male, I can't say that I understand what black people go through but I hear you. George Floyd was murdered by a man and a group of 3 other men that watched it all happen and did nothing. All of them swore an oath to protect and serve and simply didn't.\n\nThe protestors who are peaceful are getting drowned by the looters and I hate it. I haven't gone out to protest because I'm terrified of things getting out of hand and the virus. I personally lost my childhood best friend and my mom's best friend who was like another mother me to this virus and I'm still shook. I can't bring myself to large gatherings yet, it will take me a while.\n\nAs a white conservative-leaning male, I believe both sides aren't doing anything. What I believe the people simply want is justice and equality. We need to call on both sides of the aisle and ask for accountability among law enforcement. How is it that a man with a tarnished record was able to carry on his duty as a police officer? There needs to be put forth a law stating that those who protect and serve should be held to a higher standard and potentially make it standard to wear a body camera so when there are altercations, we have a witness. I know there is no one solution to all this but we can start somewhere.\n\nNow will that end all the racism? Absolutely not. We all have to join in the effort of stopping racism in our everyday lives no matter your skin color. We need to teach our next generation that there is no black, white, yellow or brown races; there is the human race. If you pass by somebody of color, simply smile or wave. Start up a conversation with someone you normally wouldn't with a simple \"Hi my name is (name), and you are? Well it's nice to meet you  How are you? How is your day?\" That alone might make someone's day and start to ease some of your own bias.\n\nSomething I haven't mentioned yet is my profession.

So I can dab them up and let them know I am here for them. It's hard to convey that message over zoom. It's hard to take class time to talk about their feelings. I'd do anything to get that all back.\n\nSo as a white conservative-leaning male, I'm with you all and I hope for a brighter future with fairness and equality. I pray for a brighter and more fair future. I promise that I will always be in support of the human race.",

            "Progression? Well, I was quite surprised when I had seen Joe Biden's recent speech, as he called for a special independent force to investigate officer involved crimes. A solution that, I often wondered why, was not the pivotal demand of protestors. \n\nContrary to what some people think, the police are not who make the decision to charge someone with a crime. Police do wield tremendous investigatory and persuasive power, but the decision of whether or not to officially charge a person with a crime lies with the prosecutor, who will be the local district attorney if you are charged with a state-level crime, or the U.S. District Attorney if you are charged with a federal crime.\n\nThere is an inherent conflict of interest in the American justice system arising out of the intimate police-prosecutor relationship that has evolved in the United States over the last forty years. While police and prosecutors formerly operated as independent units, a concerted effort to join forces has resulted in close working relationships. These relationships have increasingly led law enforcement to employ perjury and unethical tactics to obtain unjust convictions against criminal defendants. In addition, they have allowed law enforcement to commit atrocious acts without fear of punishment. And, because police and prosecutors enjoy immunity under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for almost any conduct, victims and their families are often left without recourse in either a criminal or civil forum\u2014even when law enforcement officials commit criminal, malicious, or bad faith acts against them. \n\n> \u201cProsecutors work with police day in, day out, and typically they\u2019re reluctant to criticise them or investigate them,\u201d said Prof Samuel Walker of the University of Nebraska. Describing Lugod\u2019s case as a cause for concern, Walker said: \u201cA major change in our standard legal practice, and the structure of our criminal justice system, is required.\u201d\n\n> Among the 95% of district attorneys who are elected, many like Kleine receive valuable donations and public endorsements from police unions for their campaigns. The alternative, a \u201csoft on crime\u201d denunciation, can be electorally toxic. These unions frequently go on to provide legal representation for officers in fatal shootings handled by the same prosecutor.\n\n> The consequences of falling out of favour with the police lobby can be dire. In Texas, Dallas County DA Craig Watkins was unseated by challenger Susan Hawk this year after police unions ploughed tens of thousands of dollars into Hawk\u2019s campaign, and officers took to the streets to knock on doors for her. Their intervention followed the indictment of four police officers by grand juries under Watkins\u2019 oversight in 2014. \n\n -[Ties that bind: how the bond between police and prosecutors impedes justice](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/ties-that-bind-conflicts-of-interest-police-killings)\n\n Friendships, donations, fear of powerful police unions, fear of losing cases and being forced to face the repercussions. These are the hurdles that a prosecutor must overcome before criminally charging their police counterpart. It creates an apparent conflict of interest that often leads to an abnormally large margin of dismissed cases. \n\n[Charging officers with crimes is still difficult for prosecutors](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2020/05/29/charging-cops-with-crimes-is-still-difficult-prosecutors/%3foutputType=amp)",

It is time to bring an end to the criminalization of black skin, time to hold those terrorizing our communities ACCOUNTABLE. This is a human rights issue, not a political one.",

When can we stop giving meaning to the word \"race\" when it genuinely doesn't even exist?

            "Earlier this week I saw a post regarding the black lives matter movement that completely changed my point of view on it. I was one of those all lives matter type of people. The post I saw had a very good way of visualizing the movement. The post said something along the lines of if a house is on fire in your neighborhood they dont go around spraying every single house with water. Does that mean they dont cared about your house? No. It means that they are stopping the spread and damage the house on fire is causing therefore saving you and everyone else's homes. \nThe burning building is POC community and people in it. The fire is this racism and hate the world is facing... \nWe need to stop the blaze in its tracks... that doesnt mean that no one cares about all live or police or anyone for that matter. We just need to stop the hate in its tracks. That is why black lives matter. Not because they are the only ones that matter but because they are the ones who need the help.\n\n\nAnother thing I wanted to mention is that I've always felt like there is a \"white privilege\" but I absolutely hate that term. A privilege is something you earn... feeling safe walking down the street is not a privilege. Enjoying life and freedom is not a privilege. Feeling like you belong is not a privilege. These things are a right... we did not earn anything because of the color of our skin, and I'm hoping for a day when \"white privilege\" becomes human right. \n\n\nTLDR; just because black lives matter doesnt mean all lives dont.\n\nPrivilege is earned. White people did not earn their \"privileges\"",

I saved up money to go and see my boyfriend.\n\nDuring the year I applied for new courses at university. However, in the ultimate act of humility I ended up going to continue the same degree at a much lower class university. I still had a good time.\n\nThere people didn't think much of me. I was overweight and still quite emotionally unstable. I was having symptoms from the trauma that affected me in a really bad public way. But I knew I was going somewhere.\n\nI kept my head down and ran. Through all the humiliation and some bullying, I did my degree, even though my concentration was so bad from the trauma that I had to work all night every night and had no social life whatsoever. I went to more therapy. And when it went south, I went to more.\n\nI finished that degree seemingly unable to live alone. However I found the subject I was truly passionate about and this motivated me to persevere. Instead of moving in back home, I proceeded to do TWO master's degrees. And by the way, I continued to have many public and humiliating symptoms and I nearly got kicked out of uni a couple of times cos they didn't like it and refused to understand but I kept on going.\n\nFive years after dropping out I have two MSc's. I just landed my first job after 132 applications. I continued to attend therapy throughout the two Master's and I am doing do much better. I am still a bit curvy, but really, there are worse things in life, and it's kind of adorable.\n\nEdit: getting over sexual trauma is one of the hardest things you can ever do, especially if it happened to you as a child.

            "I was diagnosed with a pretty crippling bout of peripheral neuropathy onset as of 2 years ago.

I spent more than a fair share of nights sitting on subway steps until my body finally released shakily. A few times I did in fact crawl or drag my way down my hall from the elevator to my apartment. Thank everything I was actually living with an amazing roommate, my twin sibling.   \n\n\nNow, two and a half years later, I am graduated with a job in my field, and although I have as little of an idea now as I did back then about the cause of my medical stuff, I DO know that I graduated with almost a 4.0 in my nationally accredited program, am on track to be a licensed practitioner, and my medicine helps me as much as it can.

We had just moved to a new city and I had just started a new job that was very stressful and time-consuming, and I didn\u2019t notice the signs soon enough before she fell into a deep depression.

I knew I would burn out before the end, but figured I could cruise the second half since I wasn't  racing that day.\n\nDay of  the marathon comes and I wake up with the flu.  I couldn't drop  out as my mate needed me to guide,  and I figured I'd probably DNF (did not finish) at the half way point.\n\nFirst half goes ok and I pass my mate off to his other guide runner and settle in for the grind, because I wanted to finish now having run halfway already.\n\nAnyone whose ever run a marathon will tell you the last 6 miles/10km us the hardest... for me that day it was murder on two  feet. \n\nMy pace went from flying at the start, to running in the middle, to walking at the 20 mile/32km mark to crawling pace at the end. \n\nMy blind mate missed his PR/PB time by 30 secs in the end, and I was an hour slower than mine!",

            "Just my life, I guess. This probably will get buried lol\n\nI was emotionally (and very rarely physically) abused by my dad for as long as I can remember. He\u2019d regularly tear into me, call me stupid and lazy and so on until I started to cry, then scream at me more for crying. I flinched every time I heard the garage door opening because I knew that meant he was home from work. I never knew what would set him off. As I got older, he shifted to accusing me of not loving him and using him for money.\n\nAt school, my \u201cbest friend\u201d regularly insulted and threatened me. At church, all of a sudden my friends decided I was \u201cold fashioned\u201d and abandoned me. On Sundays I would hide under the stairwell by the janitor\u2019s closet and read until my mom was ready to go home.\n\nWhen I was 12, I got really depressed. Going to a new school with a 1.5 hour one-way commute as well as being on the track team meant I didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep, so I fell asleep in class, so I fell behind on what we were learning. I was tired and miserable all the time. I pulled out my hair until I was half bald; some kids thought I had cancer. I started wanting to kill myself. When my dad found out he yelled at me for being suicidal.\n\nWhen I was 13 or so, my dad started really digging in on my appearance. He yelled at me a lot for being short; he\u2019d yell at me for not doing jumping jacks, not drinking three cups of milk a day, because he thought it\u2019d make me taller. He said I would end up on the street without a job if I was ugly. I was a skinny kid until age 10 or so, then started gaining a bunch of weight; I was never overweight, but I was definitely pudgy. That, plus issues with my body I was having anyway (periods, boobs, people are calling me a woman now???) made me hate myself a lot more. I already hated myself for being stupid, especially since I\u2019d been in advanced academic programming since first grade so I was surrounded by geniuses. I hated myself for being ugly and fat too. And when I had the words for it, I hated that I was stuck in a girl\u2019s body.\n\nI made a few attempts at dieting, but the weight never stayed off. I didn\u2019t know about calorie counting or energy balance. When I did finally learn, I lost weight, but it spiraled into full on anorexia. I got yelled at a lot by my parents for not eating. My dad would force me to binge. My mom once threw a plate at the wall... When I was 16, I was forcibly hospitalized at 69 pounds (I know, funny sex number). \n\nEating disorder treatment always sucks. The aides yell at you until you cry if you\u2019re having difficulty eating. You have to eat large amounts of food (I was eventually on a 4000 calorie a day plan) in 20 minutes per meal. At my specific treatment center, occasionally the food was moldy and the aides would let weight loss ads play on the radio while we ate. And I hated myself and felt disgusted with my body. Being skinny had finally given me something that I was better at than other people, something I knew I could control... and I didn\u2019t look like a girl anymore, either. While in treatment, my dad repeatedly told me I had to lose stomach fat. I wanted to kill myself. I had to miss school, which was bad - I knew since kindergarten I wanted to go to a specific dual degree program at a prestigious university, and I needed any advantage I could get. Plus, working was the only way I knew how to keep myself from getting really depressed again. When I found out I wouldn\u2019t be able to take a certain AP course due to being hospitalized, I made plans to kill myself... which my parents found on my phone and caused a whole mess over at the treatment center.\n\nI got out, but I was suicidal again. Every day from the beginning of my junior year to a month before entering college, I thought about killing myself. Every morning on the subway platform I thought about throwing myself in front of the next train. I broke down crying at least two times a week. I didn\u2019t do anything for fun, every waking moment was studying. I kept living as a girl because I looked like a girl anyway, I\u2019d never be a boy let alone a good looking boy, and every time someone called me \u201cshe\u201d it felt like physical pain. And all this time, I kept losing weight because I couldn\u2019t bear to make myself eat anymore, then waterloading and carb-loading and hiding weights in my underwear to hide it from my parents and the doctors.\n\nI also tried to go to my counselor to try to be declared an independent student for financial aid purposes. I told him about the worst instances: my dad throwing my dog into the road with oncoming cars, him once forcing me to strip, him once pointing a knife at me and threatening to kill me. Instead of helping with financial aid, he called CPS. And before I got to talk with them my dad ranted at me about how I\u2019d get taken away and foster kids would beat me and bully me. So I lied to CPS, they bought it, and now my home life was even worse. \n\nWhen I went off to college, I lost weight again (of course I did), back to my low weight of 69 lbs and a body fat % of about 10% (got DEXA scanned when I was a few lbs heavier). My parents made me go to the doctor, who said that if I didn\u2019t go to the ER they would call the cops to drag me there. (Once I was there, they had to let me sign out against medical advice as no one could declare me mentally unfit). Meanwhile, I was trying really hard to make friends but years of social isolation left me socially stunted. I\u2019d message and text and make plans and be turned down or ghosted every time. It made me think I was just an unpleasant person, and that no one liked being around me.\n\nMaybe it was the isolation, maybe it was the starvation. I started binge eating. I tried to fast or exercise it all off, but then I\u2019d just binge again. I started having insomnia, too; I couldn\u2019t sleep more than 2-3 hours a night. This lasted for about a year. Every single day, again, I was suicidal. When I finally got medication for depression and insomnia, I started having horrible nightmares almost every night. Someone trying to kill me, dying, torture, reality caving in around me. Sometimes I\u2019d wake up and still think I was dreaming, because I couldn\u2019t be sure anymore.\n\nAnd when the insomnia, the binging, the nightmares, and the suicidal thoughts finally started to go away, I was stuck in a body I hated. Again. And external issues came up. Pain so bad that some days I couldn\u2019t walk. My grandma\u2019s dementia getting so bad she no longer recognizes any of her family. Getting scammed and phished. Then the pandemic, being stuck at home with my dad, got hit by a car...\n\nI dunno. I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m the most mentally stable I\u2019ve been in my entire life, which is really sad because I still really don\u2019t like myself. I have a whopping total of five friends. I\u2019ll be turning 21 this year. When I was a kid I thought I\u2019d be dead by now.",

            "Edit: This quickly went from a quick little post to what feels like an autobiography. Sorry! \n\nTL;DR Retired vet took me under his wing when he found out I was homeless. I was dating his daughter, who also didn't know. Had no GED. He tutored me for a year, paid for my GED, first semester of college, and helped me get out of debt. I ended up back in debt after he passed. Discovered a podcast he used to listen to from recognizing the intro tune. Now working to get back out of debt and to excel financially. Married his daughter, we now have a beautiful 2 year old.\n\nAfter I passed the 6th grade my parents found out that I wanted to join the military. I wanted to follow the steps of my two half-brothers. They were both successful, had houses, and a family they supported. From my position, I lived with my parents who were terrible with money. We were being evicted every 6-8 months and I was never happy during times I should be; like birthday or christmas. My gifts would always end up in a pawn shop.\n\n\"We work hard and we play hard.\" said my dad, while they spent money on alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nAfter they discovered that I wanted to join the military they took me out of school and said they were \"homeschooling\" me, but they never did. Instead of homeschooling me I was forced to work for my parents while my dad did web development. He was making a ton of money, at least $6,000 a month. He bought guitars on ebay and sold them to places where the seller wouldn't ship; often for less than he bought them for.\n\nFast forward to me turning 19 yrs old. I've had my first job for about 8 months at this time and my parents forged my signature on a few credit card offers that I received in the mail, shortly after receiving them they were maxed out. By the time I turned 20 yrs old I was approximately $38,000 in debt, had no GED, and was working a job making $7.25 per hour.\n\nAfter I met my girlfriend (Married as of 10 yrs now) her dad found out that I was homeless and had no education. He found out because he saw me sleeping under a bridge on a road he drove often after he recognized me. He told me to get in the truck and that I would be living with him and their family. This man made me promise myself myself that I would change my family tree from this moment onward.\n\nHe began tutoring me every day, 7 days a week, for the entire year.  He drove me to a highschool to test for my GED. It was about an hour drive away each way, and it was over 2 days. He paid for my test and waited outside each day until I was done. After this, he paid for my first semester of college.\n\nWhile going to college he had me work for some other retired veterans, all of which paid me $18 per hour to do things like yard work, hauling stuff to recycle centers and cleaning pools/painting houses/fences. Before I finished my first semester of college my debt was clear.\n\nShortly after this, the father-figure I never had passed on to unnatural causes. The same man who addressed me as his son-in-law to everyone he talked to, but yet his daughter and I never even spoke about marriage. He always bragged to his friends and family how I was making insane progress. I lost the only father-figure I've ever had only just a few short years after meeting him.\n\nI wanted to give this backstory because not only is this entire story a story about me moving forward, but he did the same. Every single day this retired veteran took time out of his day to tutor a homeless young adult who was dating his daughter.\n\nHis daughter and myself are now married. He never got to see us get married or have our own beautiful baby girl. I ended up buying a car after my first semester; financing it. $21,000 in total. One day I was browsing youtube and I ran across an AD for a guy who I didn't know the name of, but I remembered the intro tune for his podcast. It was a financial guy... Dave Ramsey. My father-in-law always had his podcast playing when we drove anywhere. I started listening to him and eventually started his plan; Financial Peace university.\n\nSince then, I got a job paying $18.43 an hour with what feels like unlimited overtime. I've dropped my debt down to $4,200 and we're going to start saving up a full fledge 6 month emergency fund. Out of the last approximate 120 days, I've only taken 2 days off. I keep myself moving forward, no matter how hard it gets. \n\nI do it because a retired veteran who had no real reason to go out of his way to help a young adult change his life made me promise myself. Still, to this day, he is the only person who has ever taken several hours a day to help someone else. He is the only person who canceled lunch gatherings with his friends just to help me, or turned off the T.V. just to ask how I feel about my own progress.\n\nKeep moving forward, and if you ever see someone who isn't doing so hot; Give them a push start.",
            "There was a time when the only reason I left my bed ever was to pick up my friend from the train station. \n\nI had just flunked out of college, and was dealing with untreated anxiety and depression as well as mistreated ADHD. I was suicidal in the sense that I wanted everything to stop happening, not that i was going to do anything. I would stay in bed all day every day, either messing around on my phone or staring at nothing. I would stay up until 6 am, and sleep until 4 in the afternoon\n\nMy friend was going to college. She still lived at home, and couldn't drive. Her school was a few towns over, so she would ride the train home. Then, since her mom was kind of an ass, she would have to walk home from the train station. This walk was multiple miles, with no sidewalks, and required that she crossed some extremely busy roads. She had been doing this for a while, which I didn't know.\n\nSo we were texting one day, while she was riding the train home, and she mentioned that she was going to have to walk home. I knew that day was over 100\u00b0 F and she had no water. So I told her fuck that, I would pick her up and drive her home. She fought back on it (I love her but it infuriates me that she is scared of accepting help. Not mad at her, obviously, I'm just mad at the people who taught her that), but by the time her train got in I was there. From then on, I picked her up every single day. It was the only thing I left my house for other than therapy appointments, and unlike the appointments I was always on time.\n\nAfter a while, I realized that once I left my house to go get her, I could also do some of the things I had been neglecting, such as picking up my medication or running to the store. I was able to complete more tasks, and get my life a bit more stable. It also got me outside everyday, which was a massive boost to my mental health.\n\nEventually, with the progress I made, I felt capable of getting and keeping a job. My friend helped me get a job at the same fast food place as her. I started volunteering with organizations that I was passionate about, found what I wanted to do with my life, and started working towards that. I started taking classes again, and this semester (my first one back after 2 years) I got straight A's.\n\nI couldn't do anything for myself, so I did something small for someone else",

            "Welp I'm a Greek woman and I'm doing my masters in history, and have done a paper on the music about the fall of Constantinople. In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.\n\nEdit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O\nEdit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event.

            "While a tragedy in terms of the last Christian strong hold in the east, there are many who would argue that the fall of Constantinople was one of the major sparking points to the renaissance. Without those Who fled the distraction of the city we might never have had the return of Greek and Roman knowledge held by the Byzantines as the true heirs of Rome. In reality there was not much holding the remnants of the Byzantine Empire alive once the farmland in Anatolia had been conquered realistically the city would only be able to survive for so long. In addition the Ottomans raising taxes on trade would block off connections to China and India which would help to encourage the Spaniards and Portuguese as well as the Dutch later on in their maritime shipping interests. Truly the fall of Constantinople and in turn the Eastern Roman Empire was a sad but important event to propel us into the early modern age.",

I read through a couple of articles to develop some sort of understanding and opinion - I hope some woman with some more background will be able to provide an even better and more thorough answer, and I hope someone will tell me if I've said anything incorrect.\n\nThe City of Constantinople was the capital of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire for a very long time - over 1000 years, and had survived many attacks up until this point. It had these extremely thick walls, and an army would have had to attack by both land and sea to even try to take it. However, some of these sieges over the years had decimated the population (400k in the 12th century and 40k-50k in the 1450's). Also, they were also losing their diplomatic power - the Popes/Roman Catholic Europe were not happy that they would not form a union with them, so no significant help could be expected.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ottoman Turks had been extending their control over the Balkans and Anatolia, even several Byzantine cities. They had tried to capture Constantinople before (had to suppress an uprising elsewhere) and the new sultan, Mehmed II, had been preparing to try again.\n\nThe defenders were very weak at this point - only fewer than 5k men, which could not cover the city's walls. And technology had moved on - these walls were impenetrable up until that point, but this time, the attackers had cannons (large and heavy ones, and smaller ones that could fire more often), as well as 60k-80k men, as per modern historians. Constantine resisted for about 6 weeks, which was impressive! Though near to the end, chaos reigned - women and children were defending the walls, some of the defenders went back to defend their own families, many killed themselves rather than be subjected to the destruction that came immediately after and then after that.\n\nThe Hagia Sophia was converted into a Mosque, Constantinople became the new capital of the Ottoman Empire, and the city was repopulated with people from a multitude of faiths and backgrounds. The East had gained quite a bit of power over Christendom, and humanity had moved from the middle ages into the Renaissance.\n\nWell, it happens. They had it coming for a while. I'm not sure what preventative measures they could have taken to keep this from happening, or how that would have impacted things.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/event/Fall-of-Constantinople-1453](https://www.britannica.com/event/Fall-of-Constantinople-1453)\n\n[https://www.ancient.eu/article/1180/1453-the-fall-of-constantinople/](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1180/1453-the-fall-of-constantinople/)",

            "FINALLY! I can answer this.\n\nMehmed the II, I believe, tried to live up to his GrandFather, and Father's deeds. This blinded him during the long sieges on Constantinople.  Once he decided to use artillery in a way that had never been used before, there was no turning back. The Wolf and her cubs (Orban) not only provided drive for the exhausted troops, but also a distraction for the Turks inside the walls.  After suffering wounds himself, Mehmed and his advisors (who knows exactly whose idea it was first) decided to circumvent the Golden Horn, pull the boats out of the water, and place them back in on the other side of the boom chain.  The gig was up!  Morale fell inside the walls, and the best fighters knew it was over.\n\n\" He rode immediately to the Hagia Sophia, He ordered to be protected. He transformed it into a Muslim Mosque, solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.\"\n\nMehmed completed his Grandfather and father's wish. He didn't stop there!  He successfully defended Constantinople  and led conquests throughout the surrounding lands. Morea, Trebizond,  I liked reading about the Ottoman-Venetian War.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, what I think about it.  Throughout history we see large significant battles and huge stories to go with it.  I like that I can really get to the Micro history of Mehmed himself. I sorely wish I could travel back and be a fly on the wall during these times.

They only had a connection through sea so they had to get a land connection. Also, the Byzantium there was getting solideres from Europe to attack several parts of the Ottomans, that way it had become the most important job for them. Many sultans before Mehmed II tried it but failed. Mehmed II was 17years old when he got a Sultan and was successful on taking in Constantinople with 21years. \nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong somewhere, I read some books but still I\u2019m not a machine lol.",

            "Am a man, but the fall of Constantinople closed off Europe's trade routes with Asia (specifically China and India). The Ottomans charged enormous taxes on goods passing through their territory, if they even let goods through at all. This led to Europeans looking for new trade routes. The Portuguese were already a pretty navally focused kingdom and were geographically situated the best to begin naval exploration. So they started trading down the West coast of Africa, eventually rounding the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Sea. These expeditions allowed the Portuguese to develop their naval technology to the point where they could start venturing out into the Atlantic, beyond the sight of land and still reliably navigate. This led to the discovery of the Azores, which sparked a lot of interest in Europe. It was the first time in living memory new lands had been discovered.\n\nPortugal's new trade wealth sparked competition with their newly united rival and Iberian peninsula neighbors, the Spanish Kingdoms. The Spanish began funding their own trade voyages to try to compete with Portugal, including, famously, a Genoese explorer named Christopher Columbus.\n\nMore than half a millennia later people descended from Europeans who colonized the lands Columbus \"discovered\" for Europe elected an orange fascist president. So I personally blame Mehmed II for Trump's election.",

            "I made a presentation in my Public Speaking class in college about how anti-depressants were bad and you should seek other methods of treating depression.  This was dumb for a few reasons:\n\n1. I just had a bad experience with anti-depressants in high school but apparently could only see my own perspective.\n2. It was just a class to teach public speaking methods and I did not need to pick such a heavy topic.\n3. Somehow I was so self-absorbed I could not register the weird looks I was getting from people, and when a classmate said \"well that was ballsy\" to me after class I did not understand.\n4. I was a Psychology major and I should know better (and I do now).\n\nAnyway that one stabs at me.  I also made a presentation in my sociology class while semi-high which was supposed to be about myself and my relationship to society and I included a bunch of weird \"modeling\" pictures and stuff about my \"eclectic\" music taste.  Oh I'm so special I like Missy Elliott *and* Tom Waits.  Is that what this is about?   Anyway I am going to bury my own head now.",
            "When I was in fifth grade, our teacher said a joke in front of the class and everyone laughed including myself. After the laughter died down, a girl looked up at me and said. \"You have a really damn disgusting laugh, ew.\"\n\nI became so self conscious about laughter since that specific, day, and after years I have trouble actually laughing. My brain kinda made it a habit to just smile or slightly chuckle at something, even if it is really funny.\n\nEdit: The girls' last name, when translated from my native language to English, is \"Cock\". \nHave a nice day.",
            "Yes. When I was in high school we had to give in feedback forms about our teachers. I was just going to submit mine totally blank, but the teacher in charge at the time told me that I had to write something for every teacher. Stupidly, I decided to be completely honest and to write exactly what I thought of them. It was all nice, except for one teacher's which was just 'X miss is very scary but she's a good teacher'. I meant both of those but it didn't matter. The teacher was seriously hurt by it, although she pretended it was nbd at first. Then as the weeks went by she would mention it once a week, gradually seeming more and more upset. Until one day, when another student mentioned being scared to ask her about something, she shouted at him for an entire period. She also mentioned me a bunch, saying she would never forget what I said but could forgive me.\n\nAnyways, she was the type of teacher to really consider her students to be her own kids and I guess me being scared of her hurt her. I do regret that.",
            "Freshman year of high school. It was one of those days before school starts and you meet your teacher and your parents are there. My teacher was handing me a piece of paper and I didn't see the paper so I shook his hand. He said \"oh\" and my mom said \"Ummm?\" and I panicked and said \"I just wanted to be polite!\" \n\nSo I still want to die when I think of that.....",
            "When I was 11, it was my first day at a new school and all the other students were also new. The Maths teacher started our first class by asking each of us about our education background (what school we came from, what they taught in our last year's Maths class etc.), just trying to get a general idea of what kind of students he was dealing with.\n\nThing is, I was so nervous that I spaced out for a bit and got lost in my overthinking mind, so I didn't hear the teacher's questions to my classmates. When it got to my turn, the teacher just said \"Now tell me about you\", assuming I understood what kind of information he was expecting. I just went straight into a monologue that started with \"So I was born in the South Zone of the city, but my mom decided to move to our current neighborhood a few months after divorcing my dad...\" And went on and on giving some very specific details about my short life. Everyone had a really confused look on their faces and as soon as I realized the teacher was also completely lost I stopped talking and went instantly red.\n\nThe teacher then said \"that's all really great, but I was only interested in what happened last year, not the last 10...\", and everyone started laughing. \n\nNext day nobody remembered it anymore, but 12 years later it still comes to mind in pretty random moments.\n\nEdit: a typo.",
            "This happened back when I was 6th or 7th grade.\n\nMe and a couple of friends were browsing the neighborhood our school was in after the school day was over. We happen on a bus stop with couple of girls seemingly our age. We stopped and tried to chat them up, but their bus came soon after and they had to go.\n\nWe see their bus stop at a traffic light not 20 metres away and one of us says \"Let's run to the next stop\". Nobody thought to ask \"Then what?\" and off we were, sprinting madly behind the bus.\n\nSurprisingly enough, we somehow made it to the next stop just as the bus was arriving. Then the doors opened, the girls sat there giggling and...\n.\n.\n.\nWe did nothing. Literally. I even remember it like the bus driver held the doors a bit longer, but I might as well might be imagining it as the memory is so old. We just sat there, trying to catch our breaths as my lungs burned. \n\nAnd then the doors closed and the bus went off to the next stop. And none of us said anything. We just walked it off, went on to the next stupid shit we would do. \n\nI don't know about any of the other guys, but this still haunts me as one of the cringiest moments of my life so far.",

And well, sure enough, I couldn't hold it any longer and there's bullying for the next six months. Literally shakes me in bed about how I have never felt that low before.\n\nSOMEHOW I managed to live through it though lol. We all got flaws. Mine is a bladder that urinates prematurely.",

Of course, all of that is difficult to explain as a mature adult, let alone a 17-year-old girl, so I just laughed.\n\nI think about it sometimes and think to myself about how ridiculous the whole situation was and I wish I could go back and explain it to my ex-coworker...but I can't even remember his first name.",

He was not a nice man(not boy, he was an adult and I was a teen) and he often belittled me and often called me a 'slut.' He would also show me messages/emails that this girl would send him about me and was basically her begging him to dump me. I understand now that for her, she was just being a friend to her friend based on whatever he told her about me - and him, he showed me those messages to further isolate me from my peers.",

As I'm walking up, I sneeze and a long trail of snot flies out, just dangling out of my face.

So I just mentioned our boss had been asking when she'd be back to work incase she needed someone to cover for her. This sent her through the fucking roof!

I don't believe breaking this rule should result in a ban, but rather a removal of the post, with the bot issuing the user a notice of and of why their post was removed. However, if it's clear a user is continually posting obvious non-discussion generating topics for the purpose of spam, then a suspension can be issued, followed by a topic-posting ban if the behavior persists.\n\nBut it's important to make it *crystal* clear as to what exactly defines a non-discussion generating topic, so that there is no leeway for any possible misunderstanding. The rule should be written and posted as clearly and precisely as possible -- as if you were telling it to a three year old. I also believe that any action taken by a mod regarding this rule should be peer-reviewed by all mods for a month after this rule is set in place.\n\nMany Reddit subforums have a lot of issues regarding unclear rules, sudden rule changing, insufficient notice or clarity when a rule is created, and mods taking advantage of their position by twisting a rule to take disciplinary action against someone they disagree with or are upset with.

            "That's five years of time travel, hear me out:\n\nLets say you keep a journal of everything that happens to you online, along with a record of all the outcomes. By being able to look five years into the future, you are able to see everything that's happened in your life, especially where you went wrong. With the knowledge that you're doing something different, your future message history changes.. Two versions of you have now lived five years, and the internet reflects that. To go any further, first, we need to talk about parallel universes, which I'll explain with Schrodinger's cat.\n\nSchrodinger's cat is a paradox used to explain the ability for a cat in a box to be both dead and alive. You have a lethal toxin with a fifty percent chance to go off in the box every thirty seconds, killing the cat. However, because there is no camera inside the box, the cat can be either dead, or alive.  You don't know until you open the box. Now, to the alternate universes part.\n\nLets say you open the box after the first thirty seconds. There are two possible realities: The cat is dead, or the cat is alive. This continues down the line, with the chance of a living cat getting smaller and smaller, but it's never zero, and until you open the box, it is both alive, and dead.\n\nBy being able to see the messages that reflect your actions in the future, you change your course of events. One timeline is you do exactly what the message says, you change nothing. Another timeline is you adapt to the new situation. The only problem with that, is you're now posting about your life, which would impact you five years into the past. Another timeline is formed, and you react to the second timeline, either doing nothing, or alternating the path. This goes on and on. With the knowledge that past you can see the future, you can also send warnings of things to avoid, for example. While you don't get to time travel far, It's still five years of time travel of sending messages to change the future.\n\nOr not. That might not have made any sense.\n\nAnyways, using this logic, I'd want to try to fight climate change. We're approaching the point of no return, and unless we figure out how to change things quickly, we're fucked. I'd use the first five years to learn the issue. Then, I'd right a big note to self online on what I studied, what was important, what wasn't. I'd include things to avoid, things to try going for, a point of no return that scientists concluded,  and that they should constantly update in case I get involved in an accident. This would lead to a long chain of studying, trying to find solutions, and ways to get involved into politics in order to actually have a chance of making anything change. The saddest part is, it might not even be possible, and so there would be an unlimited amount of me's trying to prevent imminent doom, only to fail over and over and over again.\n\ntldr; it's time travel, due to alternate timelines forming when you change what you post on the internet. I'd read future notes from myself an doom myself to five years of climate change prevention over and over again, unable to change a thing",

The club is reported to have been at full capacity.  The shooter has himself barricaded inside Pulse with multiple hostages. This is per a private source.

Yellow and green tag patients will be welcome at florida hospital east.  Florida hospital orlando has taken on two red tags so far.  They have reached out to seminole fire and rescue and placed their units on standby. Orlando sounds like they are charge.  They just made ballistic vests available to the fire and ems first responders in the red zone. The walking wounded are walking to a treatment area behind Einstein bagels.   All that info is from a police scanner. And being updated as it happens.\n\n3:23. Active fired shots outside ORMC.\n3:24. The shooter at ORMC is inside the hospital. They can no longer take any pts. The shooter is locked inside ORMC.\n3:27 three MORE trauma alerts\n3:28 ORMC is no longer on lockdown. They are requested ONLY trauma alerts now.  No walking wounded will be there. ONLY trauma alerts.\n3:34 they reached 250 victims\n3:39 i think they just said they have transported all patients and are waiting to hear from the interior of the structure\n3:50 they are having to pull OPD to a large gathering at Columbia.  Everyone get back in your houses.  Go home.  You are pulling resources for selfish reasons. \n3:56 they requested one more transport. So they have one more patient. It has really slowed down though. They just told someone to stage. \n4:19 they are being told they are expecting more patients who might be coming out right now. \n4:23 there are 8 patients coming out\n4:24 they are not tagged yet.

On Reddit and mainstream media, it's all about the terrorism aspect and possible ties to Islamic radicals. Yet on Twitter and Facebook, the debate hasn't even touched on these aspects of the massacre and instead it's focusing LGBT rights, discrimination, and homophobia within the United States. They're blaming this attack solely on discrimination  and homophobia, and entirely ommiting any religious causes.

            "As a gay person from a different country, this tragedy has hit me hard. It\u00b4s so incredibly sad, that 50 people died for no other reason than that the gunman did not agree with their right to love whomever they wanted, or associate with whichever gender they wanted.. \n Even though I am from Norway, the shooting feels like an attack on even my identity. \n My heart is with all the people that were killed or injured by this senseless act of terror. ",
            "As a Shia Muslim, I am disgusted by this crime, the mentality of Islamic Salafi/Wahabi extremism (and any extremism) that keeps leading to these massacres. I'm appalled at the censoring going on at /r/news. Even if there is some Muslim bashing going on, So be it. Bash away because Islam needs to be a target of criticism until it stops leading to these crimes. It is sick that words are more harshly criticized than actions. Islam is not above criticism. More specifically, interpretations of Islam are not sacred. Why must we continue to tiptoe around Islamic beliefs and the violent rhetoric and actions that stem from those rotten roots? \n\nEven if Shia or Sufi Muslims and other Muslim minorities  aren't perpetrating these actions (and are often victims of them), it is good to scrutinize those beliefs, too. Especially when they lead to terrorism, human rights abuses, murder, violent rhetoric, etc. We need to keep talking about the elephant in the room or else we will never fix this sickness. For that reason and more, censoring is deplorable. \n\nIt's as if there is a cancer that we can't talk about because we're superstitiously afraid it will make the cancer worse. No! When there is a cancer, you talk about it, you scrutinize it, you dissect it, you emotionally vent about it. We need to say \"Fuck Islam\" even if not all Muslims are to blame. Us Muslims need to say fuck Islam if it leads people to this over such things as homosexuality or drawing cartoons. How the fuck can this continue to happen? How can we continue to walk on eggshells about it? Death for having fun?! That's insane!\n\nIf the mods are deleting posts about donating blood and helping out, as I just read, that is even more disgusting and makes me absolutely sick to my stomach. What is going on? I can't wrap my head around the simultaneous violence in this event and the catering to a violent belief system that has been going on. \n\nEdit: I'd like to add, because in my venting I lost sight of the victims, my deepest condolences to them and their families. I extend my sympathies to the greater LGBTQ community for the effect this may have on them. May some form of peace and sense of justice be with you all and your communities. Absolutely heartbreaking.

She knocked on the door and this tall, half deaf old white man who pretty much looked like the dude from the six flags but cooler, came out and hugged my mom (which startled my mom but she hugged back like it was natural). He wore a white long sleeve button up and black suspenders, black shoes and black slacks. Well more like dickies pants. He had black glasses and they were held together by that glasses holder string some old people and really cool young people wear. He was bald with big ears and his name was Elmore and he had been alone for a while. So my mom started bring him food, which he loved and then started inviting him to our themed dinners. Then finally, right when my sister was born (like two years later) he moved in with us and we all called him grandpop except my mom who called him dad because she never had one. He was the greatest man I've ever met and to everyone, my only grandfather because my own either didn't exist or died before I was born. I highly recommend this to anyone, adopt a grandparent man, it's so worth it. That man taught me so much about life and how to be a good person. We're Dominican, well my mom is puerto rican but i was born in DR, which makes me an immigrant and that was so fucking difficult to manage living in florida, white people can be racist af. He was like a protector when it came to that as we got older which I'm so grateful for. He was a golden old man, just kind and loving and smart af. Ahh Elmore, rest in peace grandpop, you perfect newspaper and bo smelling old man \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc i miss you.

(Muriel was 92)\n  \nIf you are in the U.S., you can find a brief table of adoption requirements about half way down [this page](https://www.americanadoptions.com/adopt/requirements_to_adopt).   The table only sometimes lists a requirement for the adopting person to be older than the adopted person, but I have no clue if that is an oversight in some cases, or whether those states truly don't care about that.  \n  \nAs someone who never had kids and has reached early grandparent age, I have occasionally pondered the idea of adopting someone who is already a parent.",

As you get older everyone dies. All that's left is your kids. And if they die. Well I can't imagine such tragedy cauz I've never had kids. I'm not old yet but it must get lonely after all that. Especially for introverts. \n\nAnd there's ways you can be helpful to them and of good service. The eye and ears become weak with age. Some get aliments and they need help just bending down and doing normal things. \n\nAlso if your a Christian there is scripture in the Bible that supports it. The Lord says to look after the orphan and the widow. And even though this is a little different I think it's in the same vein. Its a very similar concept. And the Lord will look upon you with favour and bless you. \n\nI would be honored and privileged to develop such a relationship with an elderly person.",

That it's okay to cry, it's okay to be vulnerable and open up about your struggles. \n\n\\- Accepting that men can also be victims of physical/emotional abuse and rape, and providing as much support for them as we do for women. \n\n\\- LISTEN TO EACH OTHER, it's pointless telling men to open up about their feelings if no one is there to take them seriously.\n\n\\- Body shaming is just as bad when it's directed at a man. Men receive so little compliments, tell them they're looking fit!\n\nEdit: thank you so much for the gold! I\u2019m finding the discussion in the replies so interesting and am so glad to be a part of it. You people raised some great points, I\u2019ll reply later but just to clear up a few things...\n\nWhen I say let men cry and show feelings, I do not mean they need to start crying and mull over every little thing. All I\u2019m saying is that there needs to be a healthy balance between expressing and regulating your emotions. Everyone has different coping mechanisms. Yes, at times it\u2019s necessary to \u201cjust suck it up\u201d, to do what you gotta do. However, it\u2019s not healthy to just suppress every negative emotion (Something that\u2019s still often encouraged in our society). Not only does this cause things to build up, eventually destroying your mental health, but also, it inhibits you from learning how to communicate your feelings (good and bad) to people. \nIf something hurts, then it fucking hurts. If it upsets you to the point of tears, that\u2019s okay! Let it all out, there\u2019s no shaming here! Girlfriend broke up with you and you need to just talk it out? Call up your friend! Tell them how this really sucks and how they can support you. Don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone about it? That\u2019s okay too! Let your friends know that you\u2019re going through a hard time and you can fill them in later if you want to, after you\u2019ve had your time alone. \n\nIn short, let\u2019s break down those outdated gender norms and start using those healthy coping mechanisms, cheers!",

            "Statistically speaking men work more, work longer hours, work in more dangerous professions and consume more drugs (alcohol and other). In addition men, on average, have fewer close friends and feel lonelier than women. I think the fatigue of such a life can be quite draining. \n\nI don't think the problem is that men do not talk about their feelings. I think the problem is that they often don't have someone to talk to. \nIn addition, it can be quite hard to make new friends. Especially when you are past your twenties. You know, people you are potentially interested in are married and have kids. They are preoccupied with their own lives. \n\nI felt very lonely and sad after my last long term relationship ended. It took me over 6 months to find new friends and I'm a hardcore extrovert. Still, I made a bunch of new friends within the past year or so. \n\nI'd like to encourage anyone who feels lonely to put yourself out there. Talk to people. If you like them, ask them if they like to hang out with you. Do you know how I became friends with one of my best friends? I straight up told him that I felt lonely and that I like him and would like to become friends with him. \nAnd for those of you who already have plenty of friends and a busy life: Maybe make some room for people in your community who aren't as blessed as you are.",

Otherwise you're left with a sense of discomfort, a nauseating sickening twisting in your gut and a sense that *something* is wrong. You're not sure what, just that things aren't right and you need it to stop right now. You drink, you punch the wall, you hurt yourself. You try to cry but tears don't come because all you know about crying is, \"Man up.\" \"Grow up.\" \"Boys don't cry.\"\n\nYou try to tell people you're not okay, a shrug when they ask how things are going. Telling people who care about you, you're not feeling so great or are having a bad week. But the lacklustre way, that is the only way, you feel comfortable talking about how you feel doesn't draw the help it needs, and why would it.. or should it?

            "I think a big part of it is a sense of purpose.\n\n\nIncreasingly, the work we do doesn't produce such apparent results.  For instance, a man used to go into the woods and hunt an animal.  It was very difficult, but when he came home with meat, his family could eat and everyone was thankful that they aren't eating soup again.  Everyone loves dad.\n\n\nBut today, a man might go into the office, input some data, crunch some numbers, sign some paperwork... But what is he doing?  Does his wife and kids appreciate it?  Not as much.\n\n\nAnd it's not just work.  Men used to mow their lawn, change their oil, repair things around the house, etc.  But now all of that stuff is hired out to others.\n\n\n\nThe result is that they don't feel useful or appreciated.  And if they aren't useful, what is their purpose?\n\n\nIt's kind of like generating vs consuming content.  If you sit and watch YouTube all day every day, you will start to feel like a pretty worthless piece of shit.  But if you *create* YouTube videos, you would feel like you're doing something.  Like you have a purpose.  That applies to life in general.  People are increasingly consuming more and creating less.\n\n\n\nI have noticed that when I start to feel down and depressed it's because of this.  It's usually when I haven't had any little \"wins\" in my life and I have just been kind of floating through and going through the motions.\n\n\nIf I let that go for too long, I could see how it could lead to deep dark depression.\n\n\n\nSo what can we do?  Women, show your men affection and appreciation.  Even if they don't do much good, at least show appreciation for the little good they do to motivate them to do better and grow.  And men, do something.  Help out around the house, fix something, draw something, do something nice for your partner or your kids, learn another language, learn a musical instrument, build something..... Just be productive and try to limit the time you are *consuming*.

I'm a not conventionally attractive guy, and through the couple years I worked at this job, I noticed that all of the single younger women were somewhat cold to me.

Just tried to have general chit chat while i fixed their computers.)\n\nSuddenly after getting married (which was announced to everyone at work), all of these women were willing to speak to and be friendly back to me. I mean, ALL of them. It caught me off guard. They ask me questions now. We have actual conversations. Complete 180\u00b0.\n\nMy wife and I think this is because they were trying to avoid friendliness so I wouldn't hit on them, as they've likely had experiences with that kind of thing in the past. \n\nCan we all agree that this paradigm is a problem for both genders?

I told her I was currently unavailable M-W but could come in any time Th-F. She said if I couldn't make time for the interview, I probably wouldn't be a good fit. I said okay, and went on to my other interviews and ending up working elsewhere. \n\nYou'd think that would be the end of it, but both the manager and the assistant manager badmouthed me to a few other people in the industry, including one of my friends.\n\nHello?

            "I interviewed for an independent contractor position on a piece rate. It's hard to predict how much you're going to earn on a piece rate, so to attract me the manager showed me some paystubs from his guys. I noticed that:\n\n1) He could easily cherry pick paystubs to show my his best guys best weeks. All that tells me is that I'm likely to make less than what he's showing me, at least on average. \n\n2) The paystubs were obviously designed to be confusing. They were a full page and absolutely covered in data. He wanted me to be impressed by a dollar amount (obviously not accounting for costs which the contractor has to carry or taxes which the contractor has to deduct and pay) but he took them away before anyone could have deciphered what the pay period, piece rate, number of jobs or kms was.\n\n3) He showed me other people paystubs! wtf??\n\nAnother red flag is that they were desperate to hire, because they didn't have enough contractors to deliver the work contracts they'd already sold.

            "I came in for a job interview at 7:30 PM. The entire staff was still in the office. Should have known right then that 9 to 5 was not ever going to happen. One day I worked until 2:30 AM to finish up a big project, and my boss said to me I could come in an hour later the next morning. Gee thanks bro, with my public transport/travel time that gives me a solid 2 hours of sleep instead of just the one.\n\nEDIT - With all the stories in the reactions on this post, I just wanted to say that there really are good employers out there. Do not stand by being treated so poorly, because you deserve to be treated with respect. For any employers reading this thread, here\u2019s a few examples of how to create a loyal, healthy employee base:\n\nMy current employer puts family first. If there is an emergency at home, they tell you to handle that first. For example when I was miscarrying they told me \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you in the next two weeks at least, take your time and give me a call when you feel ready to come back in, ok?\u201d\n\n9-5 means 9-5. If you have to leave early for something or come in later bc of something, they expect you to take your own responsibility (and don\u2019t even check if you actually catch up the lost time, they just expect that you do). By doing so you create that on the rare occassion that you do have to stay late to finish something, you do that without complaining, because it only happens incidentally and not structurally (and certainly isn\u2019t expected, in fact, they ask if you REALLY have to stay late or if you just THINK you have to stay late). If you both give and take, you\u2019re much more likely to give back. \n\nThey frequently and _genuinely_ ask about your wellbeing. And then also follow that up. If you tell them your mother is unwell, they ask about her a week later. It\u2019s not lost in the abyss that is business, no, you feel SEEN and HEARD. \u201cYou look stressed. Is there anything I can do? Do you want to go over your to-do list together and prioritize what needs done first?\u201d Things like this mean the WORLD. One time they walked in and said \u201cHey, my afternoon meeting got cancelled, I know you have like 15 files that need checking and I\u2019ve seen how full your calendar is, why don\u2019t you give me 4 and I\u2019ll make sure they get sent out today, to lighten your load a little\u201d. \n\nThey focus on little tokens of appreciation. A chocolate easter bunny waiting on your desk at Easter (last year they hid 10 easter eggs in every room, I found one hidden in the box of my crackers hahaha), they make sure your salary is paid before Christmas even though you normally don\u2019t get paid before the 26th, they make sure every secretary gets flowers on Secretary-day, they bought us weird pens (think bright neon color with dangly beads on top) just because they thought it would brighten up our days. Like, it only costs a penny, but it makes your staff feel seen. When there\u2019s a heatwave, they treat us with popsicles. When it\u2019s holiday season, they randomly decide to close the office at noon on Dec 31st \u201cif we have to earn it in the last couple of hours of this day we\u2019re doing something wrong. So let\u2019s shut down for the day, have a good one guys\u201d. \n\nThey do not tolerate gossip. We talk WITH eachother, not about eachother. They hire capable staff, people who are not putting in the work/effort do not last. They will ask us about peoples progress, like \u201cwhat do you think about the new receptionist?\u201d and we can answer frankly, even if our opinion is that they\u2019re not making enough progress etc. They want to know what we think and they value our input. This creates a healthy work environment, with driven people who all have heart for the \u201ccause\u201d. \n\nMistakes are human, and we solve them together without smacktalking about the person responsible. Of course we all have our bad days and it\u2019s ok to mope and murmle here and there to your roommate, but we really try to keep that to an absolute minimum.",

            "I had a job interview with two people asking questions.  One of them brought questions for the wrong position.\n\nThings I found out later:\n\nThe person on the IT team who had been with the company longest had been there just under a year.\n\nTheir turnover was higher than McDonald's - over 50% turnover annually.  They had a goal to get it down to 40%.\n\nBonuses only get paid one year after you've been there... for a full calendar year, that only starts counting on January 1st.  If you get hired January second 2020, you wouldn't get your first bonus until 2022.\n\nThere was no manager for the programmers.  There was no director for the IT team.\n\nThey had tracking software for your every keystroke, idle time, programs you were active in.  They would question idle time, which meant people on the phone with clients would be questioned often because their computers would be idle.\n\nThere was a lot going wrong but the interview slip up wasn't enough to really give it away in time.

            "I once interviewed for a job wherein the interviewer actually directly told me that the job was extremely stressful and they'd had a slew of new hires quit within a month or two.  (The job was at a psychiatric hospital).  I thanked her for being honest with me and said that I was not interested.  As she was walking me out, she leaned in and said, \"you're doing the right thing.  Our last hire quit because he said he was having palpitations all the time here and was worried he would have a heart attack.\"  \n\nAbout 3 years later, at another company, I saw one of the women who had interviewed me.  She worked in a totally different position in a totally different setting.  She said that the other woman who had interviewed me, the one who gave me the warning actually DID suffer a heart attack!  She survived, and she stopped working there.   I was so thankful she warned me.  Most interviewers wouldn't do that.\n\nEdit: and in thinking more about that woman, obviously SHE was very stressed and SHE was having to cover work for that position that needed to be filled.  She could have easily (and understandably) have gone into survival mode and thought \"you know what, let's just hire her [meaning me] and then at least I will have some relief for a month or two until this one quits too.\" \n\nBut she didn't do that, she thought of my welfare, a stranger, over her own interests. And clearly, she was suffering.    I would have relocated for that job too, about 150 miles.  She was aware of that--maybe that played into her decision to warn me, maybe not.  Either way, she was an extraordinary person.",

            "I worked at a pretty high end Mediterranean Bistro, my second Valentine's there it was probably the busiest night I've ever worked as a server. We had reservations that booked basically the entire restaurant including the bar and patio from 4 P.M to 11:00 P.M. No walk-ins were to be seated unless a reservation was cancelled, or someone with a reservation didn't show up.\n\nMost of the customers were pretty understanding and either waited or simply left. One dude however kept pushing and pushing asking every 10 minutes how much longer until he is seated, constantly saying how he is a regular customer; and how his date is going to be there at 7 (he got there at 6). We insisted that once a table was available, and all the customers before him we're seated, he would get a table, but because the amount of reservations we couldn't guarantee he would even get a table at all. At about 6:50 the guy loses it, fast-walks up to the hostess stand where the reservation book is, grabs the reservation book and practically runs out the front door.\n\nNow everything is going to complete shit because the only copy of the reservations for the night that is barely half over is gone. Two of the owners ran outside to follow the guy and try and get the book back, but by the time they got out he had already left the parking lot. Even better is, two hours later, chaos is still running rampant and the dude shows back up saying he has a reservation for two. Three of the five of the owners (all brothers) escorted the dude and his date out to the parking lot and banned him from the restaurant permanently. They even took a picture of him and posted it in the window saying \"Do Not Serve This Man\"\n\nTL;DR \nSalty dude without reservation steals reservation book and then tries to come back later\n\nEDIT: If anyone wants to use this for a sitcom feel free; just let me reprise my role as the waiter and we can call it even.",

As they got seated at their table the grandson placed a framed photo of what my friend assumed was the boys grandfather and husband of the older women. \n\n&#x200B;\nFound out it would have been their 70th wedding anniversary but he had passed suddenly but peacefully a few months back.

He got the picture they took at the restaurant printed in wallet sized and carried it around with him in his wallet.  \n\nedit: Fixed some spelling and added more details after speaking with my friend again.

            "16 years in hospitality gives you some good stories.\n\nThe most awkward:\n\nMy first job as a waitress a guy wanted to propose to his girlfriend. He came in 2 months before to book and had everything figured out. He planned to pop the question during dessert. We had champagne, balloons and sparklers prepped for the big moment. The time comes, he drops to one knee gives a speech about his love for her. He asks, she says no, puts the ring in her bag, finishes her dessert and leaves. Quite possibly the most awkward thing I have had to witness (alongside around 200 other people.) The manager gave him everything for free he felt that bad for him. Cringed inside every time I saw him after that.\n\nThe most fucked up:\n\nI was working as a duty manager and one of the tills kept dropping off the network. As I was trying to fix it I could clearly hear the conversation of the table by the waiters station. It started out sweet enough with her excitedly telling him she was pregnant. He went quiet and didn't say anything for a bit and then asked her what the plan was. She said she was keeping the baby. He said he didn't want kids and had told her this. She got upset and said she thought he'd be happy and change his mind when he found out. (By this point I've fixed the till, but am unable to step away from this car crash.) Turns out she stopped taking the pill without telling him thinking she could turn him around. He said he knew she could be a little nuts sometimes but this was next level. He told her it was over and she could send someone to collect her things as he wanted nothing more to do with her. He called me over to pay the bill and just left. The guy never even shouted, he just calmly went fuck this and noped out of there. I couldn't even look her in the eye, just left her to leave in her own time.\n\nThe funniest:\n\nManaging hotel room service where there was a valentines package that included getting each course of the special menu delivered to your room. More than a few couples thought it was a good idea to call for the next course and then start having sex. Having to help with deliveries as reception fucked up the bookings; I had the 'privilege' of people answering the door naked, seeing sex toys strewn around and one where the other members of the threesome were carrying on in the background. After complaints of similar instances from my team I had to take action. I ended up having to call the offending guests and tell them if they could not respect my team by answering the door in at least a closed dressing gown they could come down and collect the rest of their meal from the restaurant. \nBonus from the same night: had to call an ambulance for a woman with a dislocated shoulder. The guy admitted that they were trying to recreate a bukkake type scene in the shower using conditioner as the 'cum.' He slipped in the conditioner and fell on her.",

            "I was the manager of a wings-and-pizza place with a full bar - definitely not the kind of place you'd take someone for a \"romantic\" Valentine's Day dinner, but it was still busy because some people aren't very tactful.\n\nWe had a guy who had called ahead and asked if we could put a ring in a dessert for him and of course, we obliged. He dropped the ring off the day ahead and I put it in the safe in our office to keep it secure.\n\nFast forward to Valentine's Day. The couple shows up, and they're so obviously in love that she didn't seem to notice or care about the fact that he had brought her to a middle-of-the road place with a sports-bar atmosphere on the most romantic day of the year. They ordered champagne (well, the local winery's best sparkling white), entrees, and it was almost time for dessert. I had used my Chef skills to whip up a special chocolate strawberry tart that wasn't on the menu, just for this occasion (because why not try to make their night at least a *little* fancy?)\n\nI went to the safe to get the ring, and... ***It wasn't there.*** I was freaking out big time. I asked everyone there if they knew what the fuck had happened to it. My assistant manager on-site had no idea, so I called my other assistant (who also had the safe code) and they didn't know, either. Finally, my bar manager mentioned that one of the owners had been in earlier, and spent a little time in the office. So, at my wit's end, I called the owner.\n\nIt turns out that he had seen the ring in the safe, and thought it was something a customer had left behind. Figuring that he had come into an extremely lucky situation, he decided (like the scumbag he was) that he'd take it for himself and save money on a gift for his wife on Valentine's.\n\nSo, I asked the server and bar manager to help stall the couple. The server told them that we were going to do something special for their big date, and to hold tight. \n\nI ran out, hopped in my car, and rushed to get the ring from the owner's house (because he was - as I had mentioned - a scumbag, and didn't want to be bothered with bringing the ring to the restaurant himself). \n\nThe bar manager went over to the table, and did some complicated, table-side cocktail mix that had a bunch of flair bartending tricks and ended with a flaming shot that, once dropped into the rest, made it smoke (I was really disappointed when I heard about all of this because I would have loved to see it instead of breaking a ton of traffic laws on my quest to get the ring).\n\nFinally, I rushed back in after about 15 minutes of being on the brink of a heart attack, placed the ring on the dessert, and had their server take it out. At that point, just about the entire staff was watching the table, and when we saw the look on her face, my heart finally started beating again.\n\nShe said \"Yes.\" And, I started looking for someone else to work for the very next day.\n\n\n***Edit: Thanks for the awards, everyone!***",

When I came back to pick it up the guy had a super embarrassed look on his face and he said he thinks he left his wallet in the car and the woman, who is embarrassed for him, doesn\u2019t have anything with her because her dress had no pockets and she didn\u2019t bring a purse. So he goes out and 5 minutes later comes back in looking pale as a ghost. He has left his wallet at home and asks if he can call back later with payment info.

            "Not a TOTAL disaster, but still not good. \n\nHad a table of two people, probably in their mid 40s last year. Took 45 minutes for this couple to get their entrees due to our kitchen being way too slammed. When they were dropped at the table, they immediately asked for to-go boxes because they told their babysitter they\u2019d be home by a certain time. I overheard the wife say \u201cwell I guess this is why we don\u2019t celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d. The worst part was that they weren\u2019t angry, just... very sad. \n\nMy personal feelings about dining out on Valentine\u2019s Day aside, I felt so horrible that this couple clearly had put in an effort to have a nice night with each other only to have it go that way. (We comp\u2019d their meals, btw).\n\n\nEDIT to clear up some timing issues. I should\u2019ve added more context to this the first time but wanted to keep it simple. They made a reservation but unfortunately got seated about 10 minutes late, they ordered a round of drinks while looking over the menu, then a salad course, and THEN entrees. So at the point their entrees arrived they had already been in the restaurant for close to an hour and a half.",
            "Small, fine dining restaurant: Man from my table goes to the restroom and is gone for a while (probably 10 minutes? Which for a restaurant is a while).

We box the remaining courses up and do a walk of shame through the kitchen. He\u2019s pissed, she\u2019s crying, all while the rest of us are stifling our laughter.

He goes up and greets them, the guy introduces his wife to him, and my co-worker mentions something about how much he enjoyed serving them on Valentines Day. They go quiet. Wife gets up and leaves, guy just lowers his head. \n\nTurns out he had brought his mistress in on Valentines Day, but my co-worker didn\u2019t realize he was with a different woman this time around so didn\u2019t think anything of it.

He had been dating this woman for a number of months, but it was his first Valentine's Day on a date that wasn't his wife in decades. I don't think he was ready, but he was there to support the business. He broke down crying during dinner and it was heartbreaking. They left early.",
            "Nothing too scandalous, but I'd say \"Happy Valentine's Day\" pretty much to any couple that sat at my tables, occasionally one of them would say something like \"we're not dating\".  Some of the times, the other person would give a look that pretty much confirmed that they both had very different interpretations of what was going on.\n\nThere's an episode of 30 Rock where they mention that \"going to IKEA\" is a big stress test in relationships.  That has nothing on going to a restaurant on the busiest days of the year, particularly Mother's Day, and Valentine's (especially when it's on a weekend).  I'd say 99% of the \"disasters\" I've seen have just been normal run of the mill issues where couples realize they have different levels of patience, and one person undoubtedly gets aggravated with the packed restaurant, and their time is ruined.",

Well, the night was incredibly busy when a couple came in. They were upset after waiting 45 minutes for a table, and they were complaining quite a lot. The woman was decked out in a super nice dress and faux fur coat that was actually very realistic. Well, she was sat and served her frozen drink. She goes to lift the glass to her mouth, and inexplicably, the bottom of the cup simply breaks and the drink is spilled ALL OVER her dress and nice coat.

A guy walks in and sits at the bar by himself, looking pretty down. He asked for a whiskey, so I poured it, told him it was on the house because he looked like he needed it. He proceeds to tell me his story:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhe had come to the city to surprise his girlfriend for Valentines (about a 5 hr bus trip between cities) and he sure surprised her. She was in her dorm room fucking one of his friends from high school. He didn't know what to do, so he just walked into the first place that sold alcohol.  I spilled as much whiskey as he wanted and watched the raptors with him. Never saw him again.\n\nIt's cliche, but it happened.\n\nEdit: \"watch the raptors\" isn't a euphemism...

The guy (20 ish) says he's waiting for someone, so he's gonna wait to order a full meal, but as waiters we are taught to insist a little more and sell something. So the guy finally orders the cheapest item on the menu (a small carne asada taco, just one). A few hours went by, the dude's date still hadn't arrived, and every 20 or so minutes he would order another one of those small tacos. Eventually the owner of the place, who is a really cool dude and has been a friend of my family for years, tells the waiters \"look at this poor sucker, if the girl never arrives, I'll pay for everything he has ordered myself\"\n\nSo another hour and a half goes by and this dude finally gives up and asks for the check. He looked pretty sad so as a waiter of his age, my cousin told him everything he consumed was on the house.

            "My first day of work on the floor at a country club was the weekend after Valentine\u2019s Day. There was a lot of buzz in the back about this adorable family, where every year the mom brought the son out to a nice dinner at the club and the father brought the daughter to the men\u2019s section for a dinner (which shows how much pull the guy had, since women weren\u2019t allowed in that part of the club). It was their Valentine\u2019s Day tradition. The kids are both ~14 or 15. \n\nI\u2019d also been filled in on the gossip that the waitress I replaced had left to have a baby. She was really young and there was blanket disapproval from the staff and a lot of the members. \n\nI\u2019m serving the mom and son in the more upscale dining room, but getting drinks from the bar where the dad and daughter are, so I\u2019m around both groups. \n\nI\u2019m bringing a bottle of wine to the mom when a woman walks in with a baby in a carrier and starts handing personalized golf balls out to people as a birth announcement sort of thing. She hands one to the mom at the table and one to the son and walks off when the mom knocked her wine glass to the floor and starts whisper-shouting at the son. \n\nPeople are congratulating the new mom, and pretending to be friendly, and then each table seems to go perfectly quiet one after another. \n\nI go to the bar to get a new wine glass and see a man duck over to the dad\u2019s table and say something to him. The man gets up without saying a word, (even to his daughter) and dashes into the men\u2019s locker room, leaving her sitting at the table. \n\nThe whole room goes quiet, but nobody intervenes as the old waitress goes over to the table, hands the girl a golf ball, says a few words I can\u2019t hear then walks out of the club. The girl starts sobbing. \n\nEventually, the mom seems to have remembered the daughter, because the brother comes and leads her out, and they all leave together. \n\nWhen I was clearing the table, I read the golf ball, which says:\n\nWaitress +Member(dad) present\n\nBaby first name and member\u2019s last name\n\nAnd the date.",

This normal seeming couple is satisfied throughout the meal, I ask if the check would be together or separate, big mistake. I figured it would be together and go to the gentleman but not wanting to assume I asked. They say together, nbd I go get the check and drop it off. Come back and she's writing a paragraph about how I shouldn't have asked, I grab my manager and she stops by the table and crazy lady complains.

I brushed it off because she obviously had insecurity issues but damn what a wild ride.",
            "I was a waitress many moons ago, and two couples spring to mind. The first were an older couple who were dressed nicely. They were polite and cordial to me, but not overly enthusiastic or friendly. They were at the table for a little over an hour and a half, and we didn\u2019t see them say one word to each other during that time. Every time I went over to their table, the atmosphere felt like I\u2019d walked straight into an argument, but they weren\u2019t speaking, or looking at each other or anything. It very quickly became awkward as fuck. \n\nThe second couple was meant to be having a proposal dinner. The guy had rung to book a table, and had let us know he was going to propose during dessert. He\u2019d given the ring to kitchen staff so we could bring it out with a cake, and he\u2019d got some balloons and streamers too. Anyway, he walks in a couple of steps behind his partner - everyone has big grins for them both - but he grits his teeth and shakes his head, surreptitiously dragging his finger across his throat pantomime style. Great. Oh, and lucky me, they\u2019re seated in my section. It\u2019s obvious she was bloody furious with him about something; she spends the first half of the meal seething quietly, and the second having a constant pop at him. While she was in the loo, the manager made me double check he didn\u2019t want us to bring the ring out or anything. \u201cFuck, no!\u201d was his response. I felt really bad for him, she really was mean!",

I realize that as long as you\u2019re comfortable with it you can do whatever, who cares what people think. the *awkward* part is that he moved next to her and she decided to move to the different side in response. Long story short, please don\u2019t make me watch an unnecessary awkward situation. You can always, maybe, *ask* if it\u2019s cool if you move next to them before you do it?",

I actually like \"one tops\", even on Valentine's, they're usually quite nice and just want to be treated well despite taking up a table meant for 4+ people. I agree to take it while all the other servers are complaining about the reservation only being for one. Anyway. Hours later, in walks this drop dead gorgeous woman, with a full grown man in a dog mask and full leather suit (complete with leather tail) being LED on ALL FOURS behind her. She nonchalantly gives her name, it's on the reservation list, and so the hostess just...leads her to her table... I walked up to them, being super professional (I was so stoned it wasn't really phasing me) and this woman just orders like 200$ worth of random apps, entrees, and a bottle of higher-end merlot. Of course there were stares, of course others tables inquired and/or complained, but he was such a well behaved \"service dog\" and i never mentioned it or asked questions or stared, and I shit you not that lady tipped me 100% in cash with a twinkle in her eye as she left. 10/10 would wait on them again. Not really a \"disaster\" in the traditional sense, but...disaster nonetheless.",
            "Depends on who you ask as to wether or not this is a disaster. \n\nPlace I worked at in college was a pretty nice establishment and a romantic destination because our view overlooked the entire city. \n\nIt was also located at the top of a five star hotel that had several projectors cycling through what was going on around the hotel in the lobby. There was no footage from the gym or pool so it was relatively tame and never a privacy issue. Best you\u2019d ever get were people eating, walking around the lobby or drinking at the bar. \n\nAnyway guy walks in with his wife and asked to be seated in a secluded area. Well you can imagine since it\u2019s busy and Valentine\u2019s Day we didn\u2019t have those, so he basically waited an extra hour to make sure he was seated in the back corner. \n\nIt\u2019s my section, I take their drink order and take care of them though the husband was gone when I returned and I didn\u2019t see him go to the bathroom.\n\nThinking nothing of it I go to the bar to get the drink and see ALL of my coworkers huddled around the monitor above the bar along with everyone else in there. Sure enough I found the husband as he was underneath the table going down on his wife. \n\nOnly problem was the camera above their table had a clear view because it was situated in the corner. \n\nSo now the entire hotel lobby can see as it cycles between us in the bar laughing, people checking in and our romantic couple dining on each other. \n\nMore and more people start to notice and the bar fills up. This includes back of the house staff like dishwashers and the line cooks. Eventually it also brings out my manager who runs over to their table, tells them what happened and they both run out mortified. \n\nBut before they do the husband tries to stand up too quickly and flips the table, ruining all the plates while also exposing that his fly was down and his dick is out. \n\nHe\u2019s yelling at my manager, the hotel manager (who came up when he saw it in the lobby) and security unzipped as he\u2019s escorted out. \n\nSo yes disaster for them but man they made a lot of people laugh that night",

About 10 minutes after them sitting down, I notice that they don\u2019t have drinks yet, not even waters. We were backed up but they at least should\u2019ve had water. I checked in with their server and he said he was totally backed up, so I offered to get their drink orders. I took them, put them in, and ran them for the server. By this point they should\u2019ve been on their second course (salad), but hadn\u2019t even had their cheese yet (first course), so I check in with their server again and end up offering to take the table because they\u2019re so behind. They say sure and thank me. The table finishes drinks and dinner and give me a huge verbal tip, even asking me to get my manager so they can tell him how well I did. I was bracing for a 0%-10% tip... the one dude who paid left me a 400% tip ($1,000.00).",

We had someone call in and ask if we could fry the ring he was planning to propose with in a hush puppy. Extremely weird request, but we said sure. \n\nThey come in to eat with their families, she gets her order of hush puppies, doesn\u2019t choke on the ring and seems excited enough. Stayed at the table for about two hours total and chatted. \n\nThey dined and dashed.\n\nEdit: Had no idea there would be a ton of confusion over what a hush puppy was. In America (or at least the south) a hush puppy is a fried ball of corn meal. I promise it tastes better than what it sounds like.\n\nAlso, for all those asking, it was a place called the Shrimp Basket. It\u2019s a pretty small franchise.

I had not had a date on Valentine's in probably 7 years, so when my boss gave me the day off I was surprised and posted something dumb on insta about it. I got a DM from a girl I knew but not very well, asking me out for Valentines and she was way cute so I figured why the fuck not.\n\nThings went so wrong, so quickly. We get to the restaurant, grab a drink in the bar while we wait on our table, took a shot to get the social lubricant flowing since we dont really know each other very well. I pay our bar tab, and we move to the table.\n\nTo set the scene a bit, this place is a really nice steakhouse and they have these dark red, diamond pattern booths that are fluffy, with buttons at each point of the pattern. Hard to explain but it looked something like this:\n https://centralseating.com/classic-diamond-button-back-dining-booth-with-side-walls-and-curved-top-b1043.html\n\nThe moment we sit down, my date lets out a blood curdling scream like she had just been stabbed. She grabs her arm and her hand comes away covered in blood, and she looks so confused and I have no idea what the fuck just happened. I look around thinking someone just stabbed her but everyone around us is seated just staring over at us. I move over to her side of the booth and grab the napkins off the table to find where she is cut. The entire back of her upper arm is sliced from elbow to shoulder. One of the buttons had broken off of the wall and the snapped metal fastener was exposed so when she sat down her arm ran all the way down along it. \n\nShe is panicking, I am trying to stop the bleeding, while the people around us figure out what is going on and call 911 for us. The manager comes over and is immediately a defensive asshole until he sees that it was his booth that did the damage. The paramedics show up, I get the owners info from the manager, and we spend the night in the ER where she needed something like 80 stitches. \n\nWe both are exhausted at this point, when a guy walks in with flowers, champagne and a bag of takeout food from the restaurant we had left. It was the owner of the restaurant coming to make sure we could have the Valentines meal we had missed out on. Sure it was probably because he was afraid to get sued but it was still really welcomed after how shitty the night had become, so quickly. \n\nShe and I ended up dating for almost 3 years and became good friends with the owner. Such good friends she ended up banging him and that was the last I heard from either of them. Woo, Valentines. I have stuck to working those nights ever since.\n\nThe end.\n\nEdit: I would like to sincerely thank the people going through my comment history and messaging me things like \"maybe if you didn't play so many video games like a manchild then you wouldn't get cucked.\" You guys are making my fucking night and it is hilarious.

Plate after plate of crab legs, she was eventually cut off from the manager.

About 2 and a half hours before closing the couple comes in. Everything seems normal and they act like any other customers, they order food have their starters and then mains. However, half way through their main they start having an argument and causing a scene, one of the waiters asked them if they could be a little bit more respectful towards other customers. They relax for a bit and honestly seemed embarrassed about the whole situation. This is where it gets interesting. About 5 minutes later the guy just gets up and in complete silence walks out the front entrance. The woman stays there and completes her meal. This is about 1:45 minutes before closing time. After about 20 minutes of staring at an empty chair the woman asks for the bill. The guy who left never came back. The problem was, the woman didn't have her wallet or her phone and the guy drove her there so no car either. After not being able to pay, she asked us to wait until her partner returns, we waited about 30 minutes before we had no other choice but to call the police. The police came and after about 10 minutes they escorted her out of the restaurant. Our manager felt awful about the situation and told the woman that she could return and pay the next day. I assume the police drove her home. And as promised she returned the next day, paid the bill, apologised about the situation and left.\n\nHonestly, don't really know what happened between the two or why they were arguing but that guy pulled a really scumbag move and absolutely humiliated the poor woman.\n\nTL,Dr: Couple come into restaurant, guy leaves after arguing, woman has no way to pay and police are called.",

I enter and immediately realize there\u2019s something bad going on, someone died, there\u2019s people crying everywhere and an ambulance outside, pretty much complete chaos. I go to the front desk and awkwardly say I have a delivery for Jeff. The front desk woman says no Jeff works there, and then leaves immediately.

It was a high end restaurant that was always busy and Valentine\u2019s Day was worse than usual. We took reservations and had a pretty lengthy wait. A middle aged couple came in with a reservation and were seated at a table for two in the bar area. We had a round table in the entry way of the restaurant where the hostess stand was.

During my lunch shift, a couple comprised of a much older guy and a much younger woman came in. They were average, completely unremarkable other than the age gap.\n\nThe disaster came at dinnertime. I was in a different section at night, when I got sat with a party of four. Looked like a family. Mom, dad, two early teenage kids.\n\nAs I walked over, the father looked kinda familiar. Like maybe I had served him recently... like, maybe at lunch. With a much younger woman. He looked slightly worried as he recognized me as well, and it turned in to terror when I mentioned my name and he realized I served him, and his side piece, at that same location maybe 6 hours prior. I simply raised a lone eyebrow at him as I took their drink order.\n\nI wish this was truly a disaster and I can say that I blew up his spot, but honestly I didnt want to be responsible for fucking up his kids lives. He did tip me very, very generously when his second meal was finished.",

            "I love telling this story. Valentine's Day around 2011 or 2012 in Chicago. I was serving at an Italian restaurant and we were slammed. There was a 30-45 minute wait and a crowd of people were blocking the door. People with reservations couldn't even get in the door and were pissed. There was no love in the air that night. The bar was full and everyone was waiting on drinks. We didn't even have a dedicated bartender that night, so whatever server had to make a drink order for their table, got stuck getting yelled at every time they got behind the bar.\n\nWe had large heavy wooden chairs and the screws had come out of the top of a few of them so when you try to grab the seat and move the chair, the seat and cushion come off. They had been that way for a while.\n\nWell, this night a guy tried to move his chair while sitting in it. He reached down to grab the seat and scoot all in one move and got his finger caught between the wooden seat and wooden chair frame. Off flew half his finger 10 feet across the room. \n\nThe guy held up his arm and blood was shooting out of it to the rhythm of a heart beat squirting left and right. A very large lady close by saw it and sprang into action immediately. She grabbed a napkin, picked up the finger, and said, \"WE GOTTA PUT THIS ON ICE!!!\" She ran to the bar, and was yelling, \"I NEED ICE! I NEED ICE! GIVE ME A GLASS OF ICE! HURRY!\" An oblivious guy at the bar turns to her and yells \"Well, you're going to have to wait! I've been waiting on my drink for 10 minutes!\"\n\nMeanwhile the 9.5-finger guy is standing in the same spot yelling and squeezing his half finger with his other hand hoping to stop the blood from shooting out. Someone else was trying to make a small tourniquet. Blood is all over the table, floor, chair. Customers are looking in horror and confusion. \n\nAn ambulance was called and they arrived about 20 minutes later. It was cold out. No one wanted to go outside so they could come in, so it took the EMT's another 10 minutes to get in and get him out. \n\nNot long after, the restaurant got hit with a lawsuit. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I'm sure he got paid.\n\nOh, and they weren't able to re-attach his finger. Crazy night.",

She was NOT. When he proposed she freaked out, started yelling at him about springing this on her and embarrassing her in front of everyone, then left.\n\nIt is worth noting that the park was empty, so the only witnesses were me (standing at the horse\u2019s head, paying attention to the horse and giving them what privacy I could) and the horse, who noticed nothing.\n\nHe finished out the ride with me, and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do so I told him bits of the historic tour we do during day shifts and dropped him at his car. He was really nice... the whole thing was surreal and \u201cyou\u2019re embarrassing me in front of everyone\u201d became a running joke between the drivers whenever one of us left a place early.",
            "Oh man, back when I used to work at...uh, let\u2019s call it \u201cBlue Lobster\u201d...I was forced to work an opening to closing shift, so I was there alllll day. There were the common seafood dates and anniversaries and such, but then came this one guy wanting to propose to his girlfriend. He wanted to do this by ordering a lobster and having us put the ring on one of the claws - pretty goofy right?\n\nIt was a big party so me and another waitress were taking care of them, and I was busy taking drink orders so he told the other girl about it and gave the ring to her. I say this because I had noooo idea about what was going on initially. She went and told the cooks about it, but they didn\u2019t speak English very well and I guess they misunderstood what she was trying to say. Their interpretation of the proposal? Stuff the ring inside of the stuffing that was in the lobster.\n\nWhen I went to drop the food off at the table I noticed this man pale and look as if he were about to vomit. I asked him if everything was okay, and all he replied with was a whispered \u201cwhere is it?\u201d. It was at this point the other waitress came out and saw what was going on, and she quickly pulled me back into the kitchen to explain what was going on. We hurried and went to talk with the cooks and try to figure out what happened with the ring.\n\nWhile all this is going on, the party starts eating. The girlfriend, who pointed out she was on a diet and didn\u2019t eat any of the rolls or appetizers, must have been famished because apparently she just started tearing into the lobster. I\u2019m sure you see exactly where this is going.\n\nIn her haste she didn\u2019t notice the ring and takes a big ole mouthful of stuffing, just to crunch down on a genuine 3 karat diamond. We found this out when we heard her scream out in pain and rushed out to the table. This poor girl had cracked one of her molars straight in half and gouged the side of her gums with the ring, she was positively bleeding all over the place and couldn\u2019t stop crying.\n\nWhen she told him she must have bitten down on a fragment of the shell or something he must have put two and two together. He fished through the small mound of chewed up food and blood and saw the ring...at the exact same time his girlfriend did.\n\nShe asked him what was going on and he had to stutter through what his actual plan was and how he was mortified at how it all went down. She at least had it in her to laugh at the situation through the pain and say yes, which was actually a very sweet and tender moment. He was holding her and crying with happiness, and she was also crying, from pain but also probably from happiness too.\n\nThe chefs that worked on the meal and that waitress were IMMEDIATELY fired right after. I was spared because she was nice enough to tell our manager that I had no idea what was going on and had no part in it, which I admired but also couldn\u2019t help but feeling bad, she was a cool chick.",

Easily $10,000. When he came back the next day, the girlfriend appeared distracted and the man was oblivious. When he went to propose she declined and said that she was having an affair. He looked so heartbroken and just instantly dead inside. The rest of the night, the entire restaurant was kinda silent. When they left, I didn't expect him to come back. Found out a week later that he committed suicide outside her house so that she would see what she had done to him.",
            "I was a bartender who saw a guy get called out for staring at my cleavage multiple times in one night. He was the DD and she was an angry drunk",
            "I waited tables in college and worked at Cheddar\u2019s. It was poorly managed, and the waiters were 80% lazy bastards and 20% hard workers. Valentine\u2019s Day was always a RUSH of people. \n\nSo it\u2019s 9 pm and we have a huge rush of people. I have a section of booths on one side and one of my coworkers, let\u2019s call her B, is on the other side. \n\nSo I\u2019m running drinks and food around like crazy trying to stem the tide of drunk ass couples and I hear \u201cOH HELL NO\u201d  from behind me as I\u2019m taking an order. I turn around and see this woman throwing a full margarita on B and climb over the booth trying to attack her. Her boyfriend or whomever held her back, we called the cops, they took off. \n\nFew days passed and word passed around work. Apparently B had been sleeping with the lady\u2019s boyfriend who was there and she found out by going through his phone. This dumbass dude didn\u2019t know where B worked, so he took his lady out to eat on Valentine\u2019s Day and just so happened to choose the same place at the same time she was working.",

            "Not a waiter, but I'm a busser at a fine dining restaurant. We close at 10 on weekdays and this couple comes in at 9:30 and orders the $280/person 12 course tasting menu. Older guy and very attractive mid 30s woman, they look very wealthy just a guess. I already know I'm going to be there for a long time and sure enough midnight rolls around and they are still there, the only ones in the restaurant. They already got their desert and are not touching it. They were bickering all night and sitting side by side which was odd, and you could tell by looking at them that things were not going well and they were very passive aggressive towards eachother. \n\nI'm standing close by waiting, and i hear the man start sniffling and putting his head down and see he is crying. She immediately gets her coat and leaves and this guy sat with his head down staring at his wine glass for the next half hour until my server tells me to just go home.\n\nAlso, he left a $20 tip on a $640 tab, so don't feel too bad for him.",
            "I served at a fine dining restaurant in Raleigh, NC many years ago. Now, the way this place divided sections to its servers was a little different than other places I've worked: on busy nights, servers were put into teams of two and given one very large section of tables. It was up to those two servers how to divvy up the work and their tips. (Most of us took every other table and split our tips 50/50 at the end of the night.) So this wasn't *my* table, but it was my serving partner's.\n\nIn the back of the main dining room was a row of large booths that were pretty private - you couldn't see who was sitting there unless you walked right in front of them. The host tried sitting this couple in one of those booths, but they refused and asked to be seated in the open dining room. Even though we were totally booked for Vday, the hosts managed to switch them to another table. (This on its face is weird af, because who wouldn't want a semi-private Valentine's date in a nicer area of the restaurant?)\n\nThey ended up choosing a table more or less in the middle of the dining room. The gentleman immediately gets his phone out and sets it out on the table for the room to see. It's displaying a photo of the gentlelady at the table. She's clothed, but in a \"sexy\" pose. The server is like \"wtf? that's weird, but whatever\" and takes their drink order. \n\nWhen she delivers their drinks, the gentleman swipes to the next photo: the gentlelady in a different pose with a skimpier outfit on. The server is, again, thinking \"wtf? this is so weird,\" but she takes their appetizer order. When she returns to the table again, the gentleman swipes to the next photo *again.* This time, the gentlelady is wearing nothing but underwear and a strategically placed towel. \n\nThis pattern continues for a little while until the photo is of the gentlelady naked in a shower, Finally I convinced my serving partner to get management involved because the situation is a clear case of sexual harassment to her, the rest of the staff, and any other guest who is within eyesight of their table.\n\nWe explain the situation to the owner and he gets ready to walk over and talk to them. As soon as he lays eyes on the table, he turns around and says, \"Oh, just let this go. That's [local politician]\u2019s son and his mistress. He's been doing this shit for years and he'll blow it up in our faces if we try to call him out on it. Last week he was here with two hookers.\"\n\n\nEdit: Don\u2019t want to get sued.",
            "What about when a man tries to plan a romantic proposal for his gf. He gives the ring to the waitress to bring out with some cheesecake. The couple are having a great time but after a bit the man starts to wonder about his surprise. Not wanting to ruin the surprise, he makes an excuse so he can go check on the cheesecake and ring. He kisses his gfs hand and excuses himself to the restroom. As he turns the corner, he watches another waitress place a small plate, cheesecake and ring on a different table. Gasps are heard all around them and the female looks up in surprise to her male friend with tears in her eyes. She says yes and holds her hand out to her friend. He is in shock and is still trying to process what just happened. After a moment he smiles and places the ring on her finger and everybody claps. \n\nIn the end, the restaurant bought the first guy a brand new engagement ring set for his gf (his choice because he didn't want to mess up the happiness of the newly engaged across the room) and offered to purchase his and her wedding rings for them as well. \n\nThe restaurant was hired to cater to the wedding of the second couple. \n\nTo this day, both couples are happily married.",
            "Ok, this was a disaster that was caused by the staff. \n\n\nWe had an entire Valentines party come into our high end restaurant. There was an older couple, probably the matriarch and patriarch of the family group. There was at least 50 of them and they were having a blast. \n\n\nHalf way through their Valentine\u2019s dinner it is announced that it is Mom and Dads 50th wedding anniversary as well. Everyone starts clapping and they ask us to bring out champagne for the party. We get several bottles and fill up some champagne flutes, but Mom wants red wine. \n\n\nAnother Server (my friend) brings over a wine glass and I grab the bottle of wine. Just as my friend goes to put the glass down he fumbles with it and it starts to fall towards the table. There was nothing in it, so I didn\u2019t expect anything bad to happen. I was so wrong\nThe glass fell towards the table and turned, but my friend thought he would catch it with his tray.  It his the tray and the table at the same time and fucking exploded. It was the craziest wine glass shatter I\u2019ve ever seen. Glass went everywhere. I started to nervously laugh and say, \u201cwe\u2019ll get you another glass\u201d. As soon as I say We\u2019ll, I notice Mom bleeding. I mean profusely bleeding. The glass had hit her face and neck and she was bleeding ALOT. At first I thought it would be ok, but after a few minutes we had to call the ambulance and have her transported out. \n\n\nI felt horrible for the family.",
            "Not me but a friend of mine used to be the guy who sat at the front desk in one of those classy steak places. And you had to make a reservation a month in advance. On Valentine\u2019s Day it was like a 3 months in advance. But anyway, this couple comes in for their first date, and she opened her eyes(her date closed them bc it was supposed to be a surprise) She proceeded to get the most terrified look on her face, \u201cIM A VEGAN\u201d she screamed in his face and promptly stormed out. He looks at her as she stomps out with a dismayed look on his face, but then he literally says \u201cI reserved this 3 months in advance and it\u2019s 75$ for two dinners, fuck it more for me\u201d. He then proceeds to eat 2 steak dinners. Alone. On fucking Valentine\u2019s Day.",
            "I saw the flip side. A few years ago I saw a waitress have an absolute meltdown on Valentines Day. She was my waitress that night although the meltdown didn\u2019t happen at my table.\n\nThe waitress was being super odd with my girlfriend and I. She was suggesting like $150 bottles of wine (we were both in our early 20s and could cleanly not afford that) and was telling us how crappy of tippers everyone was at this restaurant was. She also very aggressively let us know that no coupons or Groupons could be used because it was Valentines Day. We ordered a cheaper bottle of wine and appetizer and she just brought the unopened bottle of wine with no glasses or a corkscrew to open it. 5 minutes after she dropped she started screaming at a different couple \u201cI TOLD YOU THAT YOU CAN\u2019T USE ANY FUCKING COUPONS ON VALENTINES DAYS. I\u2019M NOT TAKING ANY FUCKING MONEY OFF YOUR BILL!\u201d  and she stormed out of the dinning room. \n\nWe were reassigned a different waitress fairly quickly, probably within like 5 minutes and the GM came around to all the table and gave everyone $15 off their bill. No idea what happen to our first waitress but after that we had a pretty nice dinner.",
            "Not me, but a friend. Couple comes in at one of those restaurants with a set Valentine's Day menu and pre-arranged seating. While there, in the middle of the dinner, a much younger girl enters the restaurant, ignoring the hostess and beelines right for the couple's table. She immediately causes a scene with, \"On the outs, huh? Separated already, huh? You fucking asshole! And by the way, the test is positive.\"\n\nShe slams what my friend assumed was a pregnancy test on the table and storms out. \n\nNeedless to say, the couple quickly escaped the restaurant, the wife crying. And no, they didn't pay their tab.",
            "My wife and I went to dinner and the young couple at the table behind us were visibly \u201coff\u201d. They weren\u2019t really talking much and avoiding eye contact. At the end of their meal they get up and the girl said out loud \u201cDid I forget anything?\u201d And without missing a beat this dude said \u201cYeah... your dignity\u201d and walked off. Made our Valentine\u2019s Day amazing",
            "Couple were fighting pretty much the whole time. Still unsure exactly what happened but the woman was furious and the man was trying to stop her from \u201ccausing a scene\u201d. When I approached the table she stopped me mid sentence and told me they didn\u2019t know what they wanted so I should leave them alone. They argued for about 20min while me and all the other servers watched. They eventually left when the woman stormed out, in a panic the man tipped me a 20 and ran out the door after her. Overall an enjoyable experience for me and the easiest tip I\u2019ve ever made!",

It was the most awkward 30 minute ride back to the barn of my life.

            " Not the waiter but the guest and I also ran a restaurant at the time so I was aware of the awkwardness... for a bit more cringe it was my bday/valentines dinner.\n\nThe girl I was dating at the time for nearly 3 years had a thing where we did a nice dinner on 2/12 because my bday is the 10th and bday is the 14th.\n\nWe had this nice little Italian restaurant a block from our apt that we frequented so it seemed like the perfect spot to enjoy a special dinner since we had just moved to the city earlier that year.\n\nI get off work  and get dressed and walk to the restaurant, she was to meet me there when she got off of work. The waitresses knew us so they were more than accommodating with setting up a bottle of wine and laying out a few of our favorite apps so that they arrived just as she was supposed to get there.\n\nThe apps came and my gf still hadn\u2019t showed. She wasn\u2019t answering her phone but was responding slowly to texts. She claimed she was running late but would be there ASAP. I reassured her that I was fine and to take her time. About 30 more minutes go by and I finally receive a text that she was leaving, I think to myself \u201cawesome\u201d and proceed to arrange for her favorite entree to be prepared. We lived in a city with 3 main cross streets that took mayyyyybe 20 minutes to cross end to end.\n\nAnother 30 minutes go by, her food has arrived but she hasn\u2019t. By this time the waitress is being polite, keeping me company and keeping my mind off what\u2019s really going on. I call once again with no answer and get a text a few minutes later saying she stopped at the store to pick something up. I chuckle it off thinking she was probably trying to grab a last minute gift. After a few I responded to texts an hour goes by and the only response I get is that traffic is bad.... at 8pm.\n\nRadio silence continues from her and the waitress has kind of just started avoiding the table until about 8:45 when she lets me know they are closing soon. To which I awkwardly and embarrassingly ask her to box everything up and cork the bottle of wine. She drops the bill and reassures me that there\u2019s a good reason. I tip her like 50% of the bill I guess hoping to bribe her and walk off with my bags and bottle. I still cringe thinking about what my sad ass walking down the block into the distance looked like.\n\nWhen I got to the apt I just sat like a dumbass in the swings by our apt and watches my gf pull in as I could hear her taking to someone on speaker. She didn\u2019t see me and I walked back upstairs a few minutes later acting like I just got home. \n\nShe apologized profusely and I skeptically replied in an understanding tone taking notice that there was not gift or bags from the store. She said she\u2019d make it up to me the next night and we\u2019d cook dinner together.\n\nThe next day we had a great dinner, drank some wine and fell asleep on the couch. She got up to go to bed and it was a few minutes later that her iPad started lighting up with messages. She left it on the couch next to me and had it synced with her iMessage. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I found out she was cheating on me, on my birthday/vday.",
            "Wasn't valentines day but maybe a 2nd or 3rd date. I had a woman waiting for over 30 mins in my section and she kept saying that he(her date) would be there soon. She orders a drink and seems fine with waiting so I leave her to her drink until he gets there.\n\nI was bullshittin with co-workers in the back and told them about this woman.  My co-worker informed me that she had a man sitting in her section who was also waiting for his date to show up. There was just a partition dividing these two booths. So we each go up to our respective tables and ask them if it's possible that their date was already there unbeknownst to either of them. My table(the woman) said there's no way and that she would continue waiting. My coworker's table took it upon himself to call his supposed date. \n\nHe calls her, she answers and moves over to his table but sadly the man was not happy about this. He berated her somewhat loudly and then just left. The woman sat there crying for a good ten minutes. \n\nI understand why he was upset but holy shit that went south really fast.  We felt pretty awful for the woman but couldn't help but laugh at how easily this could have all been avoided. But maybe if that's his reaction to something this silly then she didn't need him anyway.",

Then we all kind of wondered if they would actually get married or how long the marriage would last.",

            "I worked at a public forest. One day we had someone report a dead animal on the side of one of our trails. A few of us from the front desk hiked out to see what it was. It looked like a giant peice of...liver maybe? Just a pile of smooth red meat...no blood around. And it was wrapped up in a t shirt, with some coins scattered around it. We called our rangers to go check it out, and one of them was pretty sure it was a placenta. The weird part is, you have to check in thru a front desk. So someone either snuck a placenta/liver in or gave live birth/removed an organ on our trails. We never got an answer on what the pile of meat was, how it got there, or why.",
            "I work on North sea oil rigs on an ad-hoc basis (off the coast of Scotland) .\n\nWouldn't say anything was particularly paranormal creepy but it can be very unsettling/weird place. \n\nFog can come rolling in out of nowhere and other rigs you can see off the sides can disappear in front of your eyes. Sometimes you can't see the walkways 6ft in front of you or if you're walking over grating you can't see the sea below your feet (about 60m down from feck to sea) but you can hear it, all be it muffled. The fog can roll in over the course of a few minutes too so a perfectly clear day becomes pea soup.\n\nYou can also feel the rig moving/swaying on high winds /rough seas. Even though it's a fixed leg Platform. Very unnerving to feel your office swaying when it shouldn't be.\n\nMy last trip was my first ever Nightshift and I found it particularly unsettling as you've got the background noise of the plant but I walked around the whole rig without seeing another living soul for the whole shift (usually there are about 130 people on board although smaller rigs have smaller headcounts) . \n\nUsually once a trip im hit by this awareness that you are just very isolated and in the middle of no where (most rigs I've worked on are an hour's chopper ride from land).

            "During college that was located away from major cities, the woods were all around us. That being said, there was a highly rated trail, the Loyalsock Trail, which was about an hour drive from the university. I invited a friend to come with me as he had never been on an extended backpacking trip. A 50+ mile trail that we intended to backpack over the four day weekend. I am an Eagle Scout who has spent countless hours in the woods and went on backpacking trips consistently throughout my college experience. As many have said before me, you get used to the minor \u201cspooky\u201d things happening; Coyote howls, raccoons in the middle of the night, even the occasional unknown noise. The scariest thing to find in the woods, however, are people.\n\nWe were about 20 miles into the trail and, being Pennsylvania where the underbrush and trees line the trails pretty densely, I always walk about 100 meters off of the trail to reduce the chances of me disturbing people/people disturbing me (especially in the early morning when I choose to sleep in). Following that same strategy, my friend and I go out of our way to be in this amazing spot a good ways off of the trail where it would even be difficult to see our flashlights from the trail. This spot was on a peninsula where a creek met a river, meaning there was only one way into our camp and only one way out. We start a fire, cook our food, and drink some (but not enough to get either of us drunk). We put the fire out about midnight and head in to our individual tents. All is quite. It is the fall semester, so leaves are on the ground, the moon is brightly shining through the bare trees, and the air is cool. The only noise is the occasional time when I would hear my friend turn over in his sleep. Then, I hear the voices...\n\nThe voices sounded very close for being on the trail 100+ meters away. I check my watch; 3am. Who hikes at 3am? We are 20 miles in. I slowly get out of my sleeping bag, slowly unzip my tent, only to see my friend peaking out of his tent in the exact same fashion. He quickly moves his finger over his mouth in an exaggerated \u201chush\u201d signal, then used the same hand to frantically motion towards the way of the trail. Then we see them. Four adults, three men and one woman, walking directly towards our camp. No lights illuminating their path; They are walking silently at this point. Only one of them has a backpack; An impossibility for the long hike they were 1/3 of the way through. Being a long trip, you bring wood cutting supplies to chop branches into smaller branches to burn; For me, this was a survival knife. Grabbing the knife, believing it is my only way of defending myself, I am more disheveled than I ever have been, especially knowing that a knife is barely defense at all. These people walk into our site, sit down by our extinguished fire pit, and just sit there for what felt like an eternity. \n\nMy friend speaks up and asks what they are doing in our campsite. Without answering the question, they ask if we have any food. Having packed as lightly as possible for the long trip. We had only a few extra Mountain House, MRE-style meals. I grab one out of my bag and toss it to one of the men. In rapid succession, I ask why they aren\u2019t using a light, if they need help finding the trail, and why they are hiking so late. They respond with the following:\n\n1) \u201cWe don\u2019t use lights\u201d\n2) \u201cWe know where the trail is\u201d\n3) \u201cIt is better to hike late at night\u201d\n\nUnnerved at this point, my friend asks them to leave. They respond by asking if we want to light the fire and hangout for a bit. No we do not. They grab their bag, get up, and leave without speaking another word. We watch them leave and take shifts making sure that they didn\u2019t come back. Needless to say, we both got very little sleep that night. When the sun rose the next morning, we finally got \u201creal\u201d sleep. By the afternoon, when we woke up, it all felt like a weird dream of sorts. The only evidence was a fuzzy cap that they must have dropped that I have to this day.\n\nI have never had something as weird/spooky as that happen in the woods and hope to never have it happen again. In the eight years since that trip, I haven\u2019t been back to the Loyalsock Trail.",
            "I do a lot of stream work so I spend time out in pretty rural areas walking streams and rivers. Once my coworker and I were working in a more urban environment and came across what we initially thought was a body - which of course triggered \"Oh shit!!\" from us - but it ended up being a firefighter's dummy that had fallen down a hill. We felt pretty dumb.\n\nOther notable things include a small grave in the middle of nowhere for someone's dog (pretty sad), and a stuffed rabbit with shotgun shells placed where its eyes should be, a mannequin very purposely placed in a chair in the middle of the woods, and lots of little random alters.\n\nI also did work in Myrtle Beach (what a hell hole) and accidentally walked into an inhabited homeless camp. I was peering into a stormwater grate when I looked up and saw a homeless person standing in his shelter staring at us and saying nothing. I felt like I was trespassing so we quietly left.",
            "I used to work in a ship and we're usually gone 3 to 10 months at a time. I worked night shift so this meant I would sleep in the sleeping quarters during day time with either just me or a handfull of other crew members where usually there'd be 20 to 30 of us in there. It wasn't so bad. Actually I really liked because it's a lot more peaceful sleelimg during the day. You don't hear anybody else snoring or someones footsteps because they have to piss or something like that. All you can hear is the light creak of the walls and the floors of the ship and all you can feel is the sway of it on the ocean. A bit haunting and creepy of you really think about it but I like it. \n\nAll that ended when there was a short period of time was literally only 2 of us in there or at least that's what I thought. I started hearing light taps across the room. At  first they were light taps. Then it would get a bit faster. Sometimes it'll get a bit louder. I'd ignore it if it wasn't so utterly annoying. I look at where the other guys is sleeping and he seems to be fast asleep accompanied by his light snoring. 2nd day, there it goes again. I tried to follow the sound but for some reason it bounced around the room like an echo. Eventually it comes to an abrupt halt. So I try to sleep it off. During work at night I tried to ask my mate about it but he said he was too tired to even notice. I guess I'm alone on this pursuit. \n\n3rd day I take my pursuit one step futher by not sleeping right away. I'd be fully awake when it starts so I'll have a better chance of discovering the source. There it goes again. This time I go from one empty rack to the next until finally it was loud as fuck, tapping in progress. My heart was thumping like a jackhammer. I pulled the curtain to the side. There laid the biggest dude I've ever seen on the ship holding his dick mid stroke. You have no idea the speech I prepared for this guy, in my head, for keeping me up for several days but at that exact moment I had no idea what to say. Of course I gave out a small yalp which didn't help the situation. I never thought I'd be locking eyes with another dude while he's gripping his dong when I began this honorable pursuit. \n\nWith the current situation I mustered my best attempt at displaying my annoyance. It somehow came out as an apology followed by \"I keep hearing tapping noises\". He hadn't said anything yet but at that exact moment, I realized that his elbow that which belong to the fapping arm is resting right on the wall probably banging on it over and over and over. I didn't wait for a reply. I nodded my head, kind of rolled my eye and walked away. It will never be easy trying to avoid a big guy like him everyday  in the same sleeping quarters.",
            "Used to be a supervisor for a janitorial company and a couple times a week I had to go to a middle school and clean their hallway floors and gymnasium with a zamboni type vehicle that mopped and scrubbed the floor. When I was there I had the whole school to myself. Used to get finished quickly and go to the library and read while eating my dinner. Well, one morning after being there, I get a call from school security and they want me to come in. When I get there I see a police car too. Uh oh, I think. They ask me a few questions like \u201cdid you notice anything out of the ordinary or strange while you were here last night?\u201d No, I hadn\u2019t (usually have headphones in). Security then shows me camera footage of someone breaking into one of the classrooms WHILE I WAS RIDING THE ZAMBONI not far away. I was there for another two hours. Nothing was stolen. But the worst part was they didn\u2019t have footage of the person leaving, they didn\u2019t go out the way they came in, and police had to sweep the entire school. Never did find out what happened with that one.",
            "On our drill ship that was built in China, we noticed on the drawings there was a room. We went to look at it and couldnt find an entrance but the spacing was obvious there was an extra room. It might not sound so creepy unless youve been in these shipyards where two things are known to happen: stowaways, although i doubt it in this case, but also hundreds of workers at any given time following orders blindly. So we confirmed that the room had all six sides, yet not a single weld on the outside. There is only one way this couldve happened and im sure youre starting to get it now. They must have welded from the inside for this room and then realized they had no way out upon completion if the gasses didnt kill them first. \n\nIts extremely heavy around that room. People say they hear things. I have definitely. This isnt some old ship either. I rode this ship from China to Amsterdam after completion and then the maiden voyage to America. I guess it happens quick",
            "When I was 15 years old, I was doing my 4am newspaper delivery round on bicycle. I was driving into the garden of this one subscriber where I saw two guys with flashlights looking through the windows of the house. I was a bit in shock and just said 'Goodmorning guys'. They were just as much in shock and an awkward silence followed.\n\nI tried to break the silence by asking if I could pass them to deliver the newspaper through the door. One of the guys said the person living in that house did something to his family and they took it as an opportunity to get away in their car that was still running. \n\nWhen they were gone I rang the doorbell at the house to tell them what happened and they should keep an eye out.",

(Think bulldozer with no blade but a giant metal boom on the side that we use to raiser and lower pipe).  Its february so pitch black.   I keep hearing some weird sound.   I cant quite hear it cause the pump is too loud.  \n\nI search around a couple times and see nothing.  I get in the truck and take off drive past the front of the sideboom to see a cougar sitting on top of a dirt pile 15 feet away.  The damned thing was just watching me there and probably could have ended me without me even realizing it.  I've never seen a cougar in the wild before and its hard to understand just how big they are and how powerful until you see one up close.  That thing leaped off the 6 ft pile and probably didnt touch ground for 15-20 ft.  \n\nIts terrifying to think something so big and powerful could just be sitting there deciding if they want to make you dinner",

            "I\u2019m a little late to this thread but I hope this doesn\u2019t get buried because this story still haunts me. \nI worked as the county historic preservationist in southern Appalachia, working on the buildings and properties the county owned. One of the \u201cbenefits\u201d included with my job was living on-site at one of the historic properties. The historic house was an imposing brick mansion built in the 1810s and I lived in a small caretakers house about 20 feet away. This was in the backwoods, so to deter trespassing and vandalism the county had built an 8 foot tall fence around the entire 5 acre parcel and put barbed wire on top of the fence. I mention this all just to show it was basically impossible for anyone, or anything, to jump or climb over the fencing and onto the property. \n\nOne night, after working late at another property, I pulled up to my entrance gate, let myself in, locked it behind me and then drove the 100 yards down the gravel road to my house. There were no lights on the property so I could only see by my headlights. \n\nAs I turned my car around the corner of one of the outbuildings and parked it, my lights shown on a thing that I still have a hard time describing effectively. It was the size of a deer, but with long spindly legs and long shaggy hair. Almost like a taller Maned Wolf, if you\u2019ve ever seen pictures of one of those. That alone shook me as there was no way something of that size should\u2019ve been able to get through, or over my fencing. \n\nWhat follows is absolutely true: I got out of my car to get a better look at what the hell the thing was and as I opened the door and got out, the thing took off running away: not on four legs, but on two! I literally watched this thing raise it\u2019s back up, stand at full height on its back legs and sprint away. \n\nI absolutely freaked out at that point, grabbed my maglight and my shotgun from inside and tried to find the thing again. There was no trace. No tracks or anything; I have no idea how it got in OR out of my property. \n\nI didn\u2019t sleep at all that night, just sat on my couch with my shotgun watching my front door, hoping that whatever I saw didn\u2019t come back and burst in. I cannot explain what the hell I saw that night but it still raises the hair on my neck every time I think about it.",
            "My oldest brother used to work the overnight sprinklers on a golf course. He took me out one time just for fun and as we were driving uphill on a fairway, a figure of a lady appeared in the headlights at the top of the hill. My brother steered a little to the left of her and kept driving right on by. I stared right into her eyes as we drove by and she stared back. Her eyes glowed like a cat in the night. \n\nAs soon as we were out of voice range I asked my brother \"What the hell was that?!\" He calmly responded, \"Yea, she lives on the golf course and likes to terrorize the workers from time to time. I usually see her out here once a week.\"\n\nAlright. Cool.\n\nCoolcoolcool.",
            "When I was a kid living in Queensland, Australia I used to \"bush bash\" meaning, walk off the beaten track through thick scrub. I knew the national park my house backed onto like the back of my hand. I knew from the topography where I was at all times. Both my parents were ex-military and had a sort of \"hands off.\" Trusting me even as young as 12 to venture off on my own into the wilderness.\n\nSo I could just pack a lunch, and my sister and neighborhood friend would come with, we'd head off early in the morning, returning just before sunset usually.\n\nOnce, when I, the oldest, was about 14, we had been following creek beds and bashing over heavily forested hills towards an area I'd never been. \n\nWe came down a hill, through a gully full of ferns and followed a dry creekbed for another hour, the sides of the creek became steep and rocky, before long we were passing through a gorge.\n\nAs we emerged from the gorge, we noticed what looked like a dwelling. Being idiot kids we wanted to see what was up. It looked abandoned at first. But as we got closer we saw that tarps had been affixed to the ramshackle structure. Chicken-wire surrounded what looked like a pen just outside. \n\nAs my eyes traveled across it, I suddenly caught another pair of eyes looking directly back at me. A rottweiler. We started slowly edging back away from the property, but it was too late. The dog started going nuts and, worried that it was coming after us, or at least alerting the person/s living in the hut, we bolted.\n\nI went back to the area a few times, but not too close to the abode itself and found discarded bones from small game and other bits and pieces, spent .22 casings and such. \n\nAs an adult and knowing the area, it's very likely we stumbled across either a homeless person camping out. Or a meth lab. As the area, as I would find out as an adult, was absolutely riddled with meth labs.",

We started to hear sounds coming off the water like someone throwing softball sized rocks, but they were coming from all over the pond. We thought someone was messing with us and we called out a few times for them to stop, but we eventually got freaked out and left. Cut to a few years later, I\u2019m fishing a different pond and hear the same sound. Turns out it was a beaver slapping it\u2019s tail on the water to drive me from it\u2019s territory.

It was some shit but the explanation was the wind making the noises as it blew through the rig. \n\nWell, that's what we were told but it totally creeped us the fuck out.",

Heard a lot of weird noises like mountain lions screaming, deer snorting, what sounded like owls fighting. Woke up one morning to find two bull moose sleeping 20 yards behind my tent. All of this was \"part of the job\" until one night a truck was driving towards us when we were on a BLM square in the southwestern part of the state. The truck was going overland, no road and was slowly driving at us. It stopped about 100 yards away, turned off the lights and we could see a person get out. They walked a full circle around us at ~100yards away, got back in the truck and turned around. This was after dark and this shadowy figure did a complete circle around us. You could hear them walking through the sage brush and I'm sure they could hear us talking. We packed up after that and drove to a hotel an hour away. \n\nI called the office and told them I was taking a gun when we went back out. Didnt like having the bear mace as our only defense.\n\nEdit: BLM stands for Bureau of Land Management",

I went with her with a flashlight down the road to a run down house that was partially caved in. She walked inside and I went to follow. As soon as I walked into the door she disappeared from my sight and I called for her multiple times. No one responded so I ran back to our work truck to call for help. A man that was living on her street called to me asking whats wrong and I told him the situation. He looked at me with a cold stare and said a mom and her son died in that house 4 years ago.

Every once in a while a huge great white shark would swim up from underneath and snatch a tuna and it really took like less than a second. They're really scary.",
            "Spent a summer doing conservation work out in the absolute middle of nowhere in Wyoming. Was part of a crew that would spend two weeks camping in remote places to do manual labor in places machines couldn't get to. \n\nFor this story, we were building new hiking/biking trails in the back portion of a designated wilderness area in a high altitude desert. This means that the nearest civilization was a 2 hour car ride to a town of 41 people in a sandy soil area where tracks last forever.\n\nIt was the middle of our stint during the early part of the night where everyone else had gone to bed but I stayed up to read, so maybe 11:30 or so. Still pitch black outside, clouds had covered stars. so my head lamp was probably the only light on in a 40 mile radius. \n\nSuddenly I hear footsteps walking around our camp and head towards the tents from where I was in the community tent. That sound immediately put me on edge as I felt the hair on my arms raise and my adrenaline spike. I recall thinking to myself that two things are very wrong since the person was not using a light to see and the footsteps were not coming towards me from the tents, rather it was the opposite.\n\nWithin the four seconds it took me to drop my book, get up, and turn the corner of the tent to cast my light on the sleeping tents, the sound had stopped but I saw tracks in dirt before me. Looked like they came from one end of camp, looked into my tent, walked through the sleeping tents and kept going out of camp again.\n\nI don't know if I was making too much noise or not by walking around, but the rest of my crew ended up waking up and asking me what was going on from inside their tents. After explaining what I found, they all got up to look at the boot prints in the dirt. They were damn near perfect copies of my own boots except for one small thing, I had a rock stuck in my treads that messed up the symmetry. (I was wearing fairly common work boots, except I also happen to wear US size 15 double wide boots, so there was no way in hell this was one of the other crew members)\n\nI don't think any of us slept much that night. Never saw or heard anything more after that night. A light rain removed the tracks a couple days later, but I do remember none of us were willing to step on the prints themselves and choose to step over them like cracks in the sidewalk.",

After a couple minutes they walked out to his favorite bathroom spot, and found...his head.

            "I spent several seasons working at a remote field camp in Antarctica...over 1000 km from the main station in McMurdo. Every once in a while, a Skua bird or Antarctic Tern would accidentally end up following one of the small planes (Twin Otter) out to our camp. Once there though, they'd basically be stranded with no way to get back to the coast. I'd get out of my tent some mornings and see a lonely Tern circling overhead, knowing it was a dead bird flying. It was quite creepy. \n\nAlong these lines, when birds (or seals) do die down there, it's so cold and dry, that their bodies don't decay either. They essentially mummify. Outside McMurdo at Scott's Discovery Hut, there is still a perfectly preserved seal carcass from 1912 sitting by the entrance of the hut.\n\nEdit: Dang...this kind of blew up. Been working all day and just getting back on now. The short answers to some of your questions are:\n\n- I think it's that the birds more follow the contrails than the planes themselves but I could be wrong. I just know from the various camp managers and other scientists down there (particularly biologists) that told me once a Tern or Skua gets that far away from the coast, they're basically toast due to lack of food and temps.\n\n- I have some old pics from my 2008-2010 deployments...but only as partial albums in an old flickr account. Knock yourselves out if you really want. Any album with WAIS in the name was from antarctica. https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnfegy/albums\n\n- How did I get down there? I was in graduate school studying glaciology, paleoclimatology, and in some sense, geophysics. I deployed as part of a big NSF grant to extract and study an ice core record. I actually went back in 2015 to South Pole to work on that core as well. Last year, I deployed on a research ship off the coast of West Antarctica as part of a ocean sediment core team...which was also quite interesting. You can get down there as a tourist as well (see ALE expeditions), but it'll cost you over 10k.\n\n- The most amazing place I visited was the area around Union Glacier to work on remote seismic and GPS stations. We flew all over to tiny exposed rocks in the middle of nowhere. It was quite surreal. Most of those pics are here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnfegy/albums/72157628321851875\n\n- I watched the \"Thing\" at least once a season (as is tradition).\n\n- My little claim-to-fame factoid is that technically I was the first person to reach the south pole in 2016 (I went out to the marker at midnight on dec 31st, 2015). Which also brings up the somewhat eerie notion that while at the south pole, literally every person alive or dead is north of you (except for maybe astronauts on the ISS?)\n\n- While at south pole, I successfully completed the first every 50-mile running ultramarathon in -40C temps...it was insanely stupid...but still kind of fun (see also here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGy_U8AebT8)\n\n- What's my job now? I still do research, but now I mostly teach at a university and work with grad students (see here: https://johnfegy.weebly.com)\n\n- did i miss anything?",

            "I was the creepy occurrence.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live on a ranch off of a quite dirt road.  Our distant neighbors (nearest house is about 1 mile away as the crow flies) have had issues with people stealing things out of their out-buildings and storage sheds in the area.  It was also late in the year, so it was starting to get dark around 6PM.  So as a result every time I would see headlights go down our road I would watch to make sure they weren't stopping on the property. \n\nOne evening I see a vehicle going very slowly down the road and come to a stop at the end of our driveway (about 120 yards from our front porch).  The vehicle is parked right in front of a 60's pickup I have parked, so I think whoever it is might be looking to steal it, or just looking over the property.  Whatever the case, I decide to put on a black coat and grab my rifle to go investigate.  It's dark out, so I stay out of the headlights of the vehicle so I can get close.  I can tell it is a white van, but I don't see anything else distinguishing about the van.  When I'm about 50 yards away the van backs up and turns into our driveway.  I freeze as the headlights wash across me standing in the middle of my driveway....and I see the reflective Fedex logos on the side of the van.\n\nNeedless to say the Fedex driver probably shit his pants as he suddenly sees a dark figure standing in the middle of a field, in the dark, holding a rifle.  Surprisingly after I try to give a friendly wave and smile he continues up the driveway to the house, and I get to explain the situation and we both have a laugh.  \n\nSo that's how I got to be the creepy guy in some Fedex delivery driver's story.",

            "I spent some time in the peat swamp forests of Borneo studying wild orangutan. We would go into the forest very early around 4 am. One morning there was a clouded leopard on the trail we used to enter the forest. It was just crouched there watching us. We shouted, tried to act big, one of the indigenous people we worked with even took out his slingshot and shot rocks at it (he missed on purpose just trying to scare it off). It stayed there for a good 5 minutes watching us before it slowly walked into the thick brush off the cleared trail. When we walked by I shined my light to where it had walked to and could clearly see a pair of reflective eyes only 3 meters away crouched watching us pass. Creepy but  also incredibly cool to see one in person for how critically endangered they are\n\nEdit: since I\u2019ve got quite a few requests for pictures I just posted a picture I took of a baby orangutan named Merkur\n\nEdit: These were WILD orangutans. We tried our best to keep our distance and NEVER tried to touch them. The goal was to observe them while trying not to effect their natural behavior. That being said over my year there I did get charged by one of the big dominant males in the area on three separate occasions which is its own terrifying story to tell another time. He never did touch me but sure scared the hell out of me and made me run \n\nEdit: \nSince a lot of people are asking. I am American who studied biology in college. How I got this job was a combination of luck and preparation. I worked my butt off in college and had field experience and then we had a guest speaker one day who is a big name in orangutan conservation research talk to us. I had always wanted to go to Borneo and got to speak with her after the talk and discovered that she needed two students to go do research for a year after graduation. She interviewed me and the rest was history. I do want to mention to anyone considering this field that it is HARD WORK. We would wake up at 3:30 am, spent 14-15 hours in a swamp forest following wild orangutans taking data every two minutes. It was hot, humid and TONS of mosquitoes. No communication to the outside world except on our days off where we could take a 15 minute walk to a tree stand where we could sometimes  get one bar of service to send a few whatsapp messages to family. The camp was only 15ish people and we would spend 2-4 months there at a time before going back to the city (palangkaraya) to bring back samples. The location of this research was in Central Kalimantan Borneo. That all being said it was an amazing experience of course, saw animals and insects that just blew my minds and I miss it all the time.

I can't believe how awesome that was.... it made the sky clear, made the night look like it was dusk, we were able to see clearly for miles. \n\nFew buddies and I hit the roof or what we call, Lido deck at 1am just to gaze at it. An hour or so in, there was 6 of us on top, nearly the entire crew now. A big white spot light shines at us. We were near land, but where the spotlight was, was above the water and it wasn't low enough to be on a ship, this was very high up. It shined on us for about 15-20 seconds. Once the light turned off we looked to see what it was. Saw nothing; no trace of an aircraft or anything. \n\nCouple minutes go by and the same light shined on us, this time it was on the other side of our vessel, above mountains. Still, unable to see what it was. We all saw it, we all have never seen any aircrafts hovering above these waters, especially at 2am. \n\nWe don't know what it was. We think it might have been some sort of silenced aircraft the military was probably doing drills or something. But anyways, that was one of the weirder things to happen out on the ocean.",

On their last night we would always tell them a scary story around the campfire. It was the same scary story every time. We worked in partners so there were always two staff members for every school group. One staff member would tell the story and the other staff member would go hide in the forest and make scary noises. So, I\u2019m telling the story and every few minutes there\u2019s like a snap of a twig or rustling in the bushes and of course as always the kids all get freaked out and they start getting scared. It\u2019s very fun. Well, as I\u2019m telling a story I\u2019m walking around the campfire looking at all the kids faces and I noticed a familiar one. My partner Eric. Sitting there smiling at me wondering why I\u2019m staring at him. My heart has never started beating so fast in my life. Eventually I sped through the story and all the kids left and I explain to Eric that I thought it was him in the woods and his eyes got very wide and he said are you telling me that that wasn\u2019t one of the staff members?

            "I used to do salmon spawning surveys, which involved walking up streams looking for fish. Some of the streams are quite remote and/or inaccessible on timber land, and you don\u2019t really expect to see any other person when you\u2019re out there. As a naturally smile-y, friendly, small feminine woman, I\u2019ve learned to be wary of people 100% of the time in the field. I actively try to avoid running into people when I\u2019m alone in remote places.\n\nOne of the survey locations is close to a highway. To get to it, I had to park at a pullout, follow a river downstream to a flagged trail, hike over a ridge to meet up with an old logging road on private timber land. I walked along the logging road for about 100 m before peeling off into the woods (very thick second growth Douglas fir reprod), where game trails eventually lead to the stream at the base of the hill slope. I came here during spring to survey steelhead, but this stream was also a survey location for other types of salmon during the fall. The game trails off of the logging road were flagged by previous surveyors, and multiple routes were marked. This made it kind of confusing, and not all routes actually led to the stream. Some just petered out once the vegetation got too thick. Another led to a cliff face overlooking the riverbed. Lots of faint trails. \n\nOne day I turned off into the woods one of the survey flags tied around a branch at the side of the road. I followed some pink flagging heading south along the hillside. I noticed the trail seemed freshly turned up, and figured maybe a bear clambered through recently since the time I was there last (2 weeks previously). The trail led to a small claustrophobic clearing, and the ground was freshly torn up in the shape of a circle. Seemed strange. I was looking for elk tracks but didn\u2019t see any. Then I noticed an assortment of bones scattered around the edges of the clearing. These weren\u2019t there before. Everything was dead silent, and something about it was setting me on edge. I poked around the bones a bit, trying to piece together this scene. I noticed another slight path, which strayed from my main route, veering to the right from the clearing. I walked a bit down that way, and gazed ahead trying to see if this path was flagged. It was densely packed with trees.  A subtle movement caught the corner of my eye ahead and to the right as I walked \u2014 I turned my head to look past the trees and saw the silhouette of a large shelter maybe about 50-75 feet from the clearing. It was surrounded by what looked to be jugs and bones. Tons of plastic jugs. Light shapes of bones on the ground. The lighting made seeing anything else impossible. Everything was so, so quiet. \n\nI left in a hurry, off the trail, without trying to get a better look, without getting to the stream. The alarm bells in my brain were screaming.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if the movement I saw was just a trick of the eye or if there was actually something moving. My gut feeling was someone was present at the shelter when I was there. \n\nAnother clarification, the jugs were large (e.g. not plastic milk jugs). More like chemical containers. It wasn\u2019t random trash strewn around the shelter. It was jugs and lots of bones.",

He had apparently committed suicide by hanging himself off a tree, was found by a few morning joggers. \n\nWhat\u2019s creepy was, we found a straw doll at the foot of the tree, it was stabbed with a few red bobby pins in the head, facial area.

I look up and see the back of a man as he begins walking down the first aisle towards the tin foods and he appears to be talking to someone on the phone, I think nothing of it and go back to reddit. All of a sudden I get this intense smell of soil and earth, I look up and the mans approaching the counter and he's wearing some kind of overalls and his face and long grey hair and body is just covered in dirt. That's when I notice he isn't on the phone at all and is just talking to himself in this absolutely bizarre tone, he sounded like a cartoon elf or something, he's just sort of murmuring and doing this really weird hehee sort of laugh. \n\nI'm just frozen solid, as he's stood at the counter in front of me thinking I'm about to be killed when a policeman storms through the door, he asks if I'm ok to which I don't respond because i'm just in a complete state of what the fuck is happening, tells the man to come outside to which he starts murmuring giberish and saying the words legal over and over again. They come grab the man and put him in the back of the police car and that's the last I ever heard of it, I have no idea who he was, what was going on but I have never been so afraid of another person before, you know when you just sense a bad bad situation.

            "I worked in a salt mine under Lake Erie a couple years ago, and generally speaking when things are brought down, they\u2019re never brought back up. It takes a lot of time to disassemble everything up top, secure and cover the parts, and put it back together down below, and vice versa, so there\u2019s tons of old trucks, tractors, and countless other things lined up in the far side of the mine. \n\nAnyway, in the 80s, U of Michigan and Cal Irvine were studying proton decay, and trying to capture measurements when it actually happened. Conducting this experiment top side is problematic because of cosmic rays and other forms of interference, so the mine was chosen as 2000 feet of earth absorbs pretty much everything. So they dug out a pool, about 80\u2019 by 70\u2019, filled it with 2640000 gallons of purified water, and put fancy cameras and other equipment along the side. They had a whole shop, lab, and dive center down there. \n\nI don\u2019t think they ever \u201ccaptured\u201d a proton decaying,  and eventually the grant money ran out after a few years so the mine threw up some caution tape on the main steel door leading to the study and that was that. Fast forward twenty years and I\u2019m working there as an electrician and I get a job to fix some big conveyer motor drive, so I set off and try to cannibalize some parts off old equipment. I remember one of the old timers telling me there\u2019s a bunch of abandoned equipment in an area by the keppy lift (the main elevator). I get over there and find a big steel door falling if it\u2019s hinges with some very old caution tape laying on the ground. The whole study had to be accessed through this one door, which was dug into the wall, so after awhile, the earth slowly crushes, bends, and pushes the ground up. After several tries, I yank the door open and step inside only to shit myself and fall back when I see a full scuba outfit (wet suit, mask, belt, gloves) hanging 3 feet inside. So I collect myself, find that I didn\u2019t actually shit myself (how, I\u2019ll never know) and go inside, past the goddamned scuba dude. Everything inside was left exactly how it was left 20 years ago, coffee cups left out, day planners, job schedules, along with tons of scuba gear, oxygen fill tanks, and computers. I make it about 10-ish feet to the edge of the pool, and it\u2019s hard to see if the waters still in it because there\u2019s no wind to move it, but eventually I see it\u2019s still there, 60+ feet of pure water in an absolutely dark pool. The sight of a huge black pool in a huge black hole in the ground, lit only by the small amount of light my cap lamp put out, and the absolute silence of being underground made me really uncomfortable, so I left in a hurry. \n\nSo that\u2019s my story, it\u2019s not particularly scary, but all that stuff sitting down there nearly perfectly preserved in a such an unexpected place was always just creepy to me. \n\nThe only pictures I can find of the study are in this page:\nhttp://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/erie.htm",
            "Not exactly at work, but my previous partner was an amateur industrial archeology photographer, so we were often hiking to semi-remote locations to find abandoned factories, mills, storage facilities, etc. \n\nBeing pretty far from civilization, they were almost always completely empty. We found syringes and trash in several ones that were closer to cities or towns, and once a homeless person living inside, but nothing ever dangerous or creepy. Except once. \n\nThis was a massive paper mill located over a now dry stream, pretty deep within the mountain; think a couple hours hike away from the closest village. It was still in decent conditions, all things considered, but definitely abandoned. We'd been in less than half an hour taking pictures of the main building, which was still standing and had two exit points; one was the main entrance from which we had come in, and the other was the half-collapsed door that led further into the factory. We were about to move deeper in, when we heard what seemed like several dogs growling and barking aggressively. We figured it was probably another group of hikers with their dogs passing by, so we remained inside and after a couple minutes the growling stopped. We got back at taking pictures of a peculiar pyramid-shaped mound of debris, when the growling started again, but *much* closer. I was starting to freak out, as I thought it might be rabid dogs and we had no way to protect ourselves. We tried to gather where they were coming from and move in the other direction, when suddenly the growls and barks turned into screaming, quickly getting closer. We were properly freaked out at that point and started running to the main exit, when a gigantic man covered in rags jumped in from the other entrace, yelling and screaming at us things we couldn't understand in what was surely *not* our language. We sprinted out of there like crazy and run back to the trail, and didn't stop for a good five minutes before I couldn't keep up anymore and had to stop to breathe. We were *terrified,* but the man hadn't followed us outside the building and likely had no interest in pursuit once he got us to leave. Still we did the 2 hour hike back in a little over one hour,as the scare definitely motivated us. \n\nIn hindsight it was probably just a homeless/drug addict wanting to be left alone with his dogs, and the language he had screamed at us in was likely a dialect. But the fact that we didn't see any other sign of anyone living there, no trash or clothes or food, and the ghost dogs, plus the remote location left me a very creepy impression of the whole encounter.",

I've seen cats do that before too. To add some more context, the type of doves found were not native to this area.  It's possible they escaped or were released and had a run in with a hungry house cat. And the painted circle of trees and sticks nearby was coincidence.

Upon returning to my car, I sit down in the drivers seat and look up to see a creepy old man standing less than 3 feet from my side of the car. He was just staring. It was the equivalent of a jump-scare. I just started driving forward, had to do a u-turn to get out of the park.

So naturally being kids at the time and having no sense of self preservation we decide to explore it. Mostly it was just full of charred wooden crap and junk but then one of my cousins found an entrance to a cellar outside. We busted the old rusted lock off the door and looked down inside.\n\nIt was dark down there and we didn't really have any reason to go poking around it plus we were starting to get creeped out so we kicked some dirt down into it and walked off. When we get about 15 yards away from the house one cousin says he hears a noise so we stop. And yep there was noise like somebody coming up the rotting cellar stairs of the house. We peek back through the trees and see a dark kind of fuzzy shape crawl out of the cellar which we left open. It looked kind of like a big old dog.\n\nAnd then it stood upright. We hauled fucking ass out of there. We all ran off in different directions like morons each of us convinced whatever the cellar thing was was chasing us.

            "I used to work at a Boy Scout Summer Camp. Every week I had to take a big group of campers to a \"secluded\" spot for their wilderness survival badge where they had to build a shelter out of sticks, leaves, etc and sleep in it overnight. The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.\n\nAnyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.\n\nAll of the campers were super creeped out, but I lied to them, telling them there was a church service going on in camp, and that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, at almost 1 AM, the singing stopped. I found out a few days later that there had been a large KKK rally only a few miles away that night, and that's what we had heard.",
            "I used to own a horse boarding and training farm with about 45 acres surrounded by woods. I used to spend the night there quite a bit, because I had to start chores early in the morning so if I stayed too late it wasn't worth it to drive home. One night at about midnight my dog started to bristle up and growl at the door of the office I slept in, and then my ipod, which I kept on a speaker in the middle of the barn, started blasting out Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire at full volume, which I definitely hadn't left it on. Let me tell you, that song is fucking freaky as shit in the middle of the night. Like shit your pants freaky. \n\nMy dog was full on growling and barking at the door, so I cracked it and let him run out, figuring that if someone were in or around the barn he'd get them (anyone there would have been trespassing at that time of night). After a few minutes I went out of the office into the barn aisle (with a bat) to turn off the creepy ass music. The light I usually kept on so I could see around was off, so it was pitch dark in most of the barn. My dog was just staring out the barn door (which I kept open in the summer to keep the horses cooler) with his hair bristled but wasn't leaving the barn, which he was allowed to do. I wrote it off as creepy as fuck but ultimately just \"one of those things\", you know, like it's weird and I can't explain it, but there's got to be an explanation I'm just not privy to.\n\nBut the real scary part is that my property shared a private gate in back with the property closest to mine, which had a gate at the back. Most of my property was fenced because of the horses, and the property next to mine was like dozens of acres fenced with a chain link fence, which if you know anything about rural fencing is NOT DONE. Anyways we found out later that the owner of the adjoining property was **Todd Kohlhepp** the South Carolina serial killer. He had a woman chained up like a dog on his property who he and his friends would rape and walk around the property on a leash. He also had some bodies of people he killed buried on his property. \n\nHe was doing all that stuff while I lived next to him. In fact I used to ride on his property but would always turn around if I heard machinery (in retrospect probably burying bodies) or got the creeps (like something would tell me to \"turn around and go home\").

Before I was Staff, the Scouts would go 12ish miles into the woods for their night out to a place called \u201cShelby\u2019s Dream\u201d. The stories of kids waking up screaming talking about seeing ghosts running at them, being hung from trees, and other wild experiences. Everybody wrote those kids off. Called them crazy. Eventually there were things people couldn\u2019t explain, such as staff members waking up with scratches and cuts on their bodies. The backstory of the place is that there was a mass killing of Southern Soldiers (American Civil War) and Shelby was the daughter of the Southern Captain who was hung with his men. She supposedly came back to the camp to find her father and all his men hung from the trees. We stopped sending the groups to that location a few years back. One night my cabin mates and I went out there to see if the rumors were true about that place. I heard voices, cries, and screams that echoed in the forest. There\u2019s a point where you cross a bridge and, once over the bridge, the wilderness stops. The woods continue but there\u2019s no noise from animals or insects on that side. Absolute silence. That was one of the creepiest things I\u2019ve ever experienced.",
            "I do mineral exploration in Alaska. I'm often transported by helicopter to very remote regions throughout the already very remote state. \n\nA few years ago, my field partner and I came across what seemed like a bear kill of a caribou carcass. But when we got closer it seemed odd. The only things that remained were TWO spines and one head. The head was arranged such that the mouth was wide open pointing up like it was screaming towards the heavens. The eyes were cut out. Very weird.\n\nTheres also been many instances of coming across old miner's buildings littered with dog skeletons or having strangely new children's clothing strewn about.",

Some odd shit that make your skin crawl. Real \u201cDeliverance\u201d type shit.",
            "I work in northern British Columbia doing bush grinding. My brother and I go in after the logging company's and grind all the left over piles of wood into trucks to take to the mills for wood pellets.\n\nBack in February of this year we were on night shift about 3 hours from the closest town and the few locals that lived out there warned us about a pack of Timberwolves that was about 25 strong and oddly fearless. \n\nIt was about 3 in the morning and we had worked our way down the block road about half a mile and one of us needed to walk back to the pick up truck to bring it closer to fuel up the machines. Of course I drew the short straw and went for a walk. Not even half way to the truck the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I felt like I was being watched so I sweped my flashlight beam across the treeline and all the eyes watching me lit up. Of course I left my shotgun in the truck, and I didn't think running was a wise idea so I kept walking swiftly while focused on the treeline watching the eyes follow me the rest of the way back to the truck.\n\nI got to the truck fine and obviously never left it too far away again. Ive had many creepy and interesting encounters in the bush but this one was definitely one of the \"Oh shit\" moments.",
            "I was about 14 years old when my dad went away on business for a couple weeks, leaving me to tend the \"farm\" by myself. Mostly just feeding horses and chickens, not a big deal. Farm was way outside of town and down a dirt road, nearest neighbors were two pastures away, and my dad insisted on never locking the doors.  \n\n\nAfter the first few nights, I started hearing tapping on the windows late at night, so obviously I broke dad's rules and started locking the front and back doors.  \n\n\nThen the window-tapping advanced to doorknob-rattling.  \n\n\nAnd then I started finding odd things around the farm while doing chores.  \n\n\nOne morning I found the horses stuffing themselves in the hay storage stall. The latch for that stall was very stiff and a little complicated, so it had obviously been opened by a person and not the horses.  \n\n\nThe worst morning, I stepped out on the back porch and found all the chickens sitting in a row along the side of a shed, evenly spaced, with their necks broken. One or two were still moving a bit. They looked set out on display. The chicken yard latch had obviously been opened by a person and left open.  \n\n\nThe worst part of all of this was when my dad finally came home, blamed me for every bit of oddness and disaster, and acted like I was stupid for being scared. He insisted that the horses opened the hay stall latch, and that the dogs were responsible for the open chicken yard and line of posed, broken-necked chickens.  \n\n\nI think it's worth mentioning that our next door neighbor was well-known for being batshit crazy. Documented bits of crazy that my dad was entirely aware of included putting beartraps in his haystack to catch the kids who had been playing in it, and blocking off a neighbor's driveway with a load of dirt as revenge for not letting him ride his horses on their property.  \n\n\nSo my guess is, batshit crazy neighbor could see that my dad's vehicle was gone, could hear my music turned up in the distance across the pastures, and figured terrorizing a middle school girl would be a fun hobby for a couple weeks.",
            "I used to work as an alligator hunting guide for trophy hunters during my summers, south of New Orleans. Spending sunup to sundown deep in the heart of cajun swamp territory definitely left me seeing some weird and creepy things. \n\nThe first one that comes to mind is when I saw what my hunting partner at the time called the Loup-Garoux. I personally would have called it a chupacabra but that\u2019s because I\u2019m a native of the southwest, not the south. \n\nWe were riding through an area deep in the swamp looking for signs of a big gator. The banks were close on both sides of the boat there was barely enough water for us to push ahead. But those mud boats are impressive and can practically run on dry land so onwards we pressed. \n\nSuddenly, I saw a grey flash in the trees out of the corner of my eye. It made me nervous. Swamp deer are small and shy. There\u2019s not many mammals that want to hang out in thick undergrowth and knee-deep mud and hidden gators. \n\nI tapped my partners shoulder to catch his attention over the sound of the motor and pointed in the direction I saw the flash. He cut the motor and asked if it was a gator slide. I shook my head and said I had no idea what it was but I saw something. \n\nAs we were looking around us the creature I saw stepped out from the trees. It was big, on all fours, with mottled grey skin. It\u2019s movements were janky, jerky. It had a canine-like face and it locked eyes with me and I felt sick to my stomach. My partner immediately struck the motor back up and we reversed out of there as quickly as we could. \n\nMy rational brain said \u201cpoor creature with mange, either a massive coyote or maybe a wild dog\u201d but my primal monkey brain was screeching \u201cMONSTER! RUN! OR DIE!\u201d \n\nIt was definitely a freaky experience, even knowing what it probably was.",
            "When I worked in a kennels up the mountains, in the depths of winter it would be dark by 5pm. I\u2019d be in the office finishing up some paperwork. At this stage everyone would be gone and this particular building was a bit away from the main building, car park etc. \nAll the dogs would be sleeping by this time after a busy day. You could hear a pin drop! \nSometimes I would hear heavy definite slow footsteps so much so that I would get up, come out onto the main floor ready to explain we are now closed but no one would be there. It use to freak me out! A couple of times, I would even check the dogs Incase it was coming from a kennel but nope all sound asleep!",
            "I once delivered some soda to a grocery store in the middle of nowhere around 2010, like an hour from any freeway, and the manager had at least 50 pictures of Burt Reynolds pinned up in her office.  Does that count?",
            "I used to work for a company that specialized in hazmat, restoration and working in confined spaces. \nWe traveled around the country depending on the type of contracts we had, we dealt with some pretty cool and sometimes creepy stuff.\n\nOne that comes to mind was at a Haunted\n \"Indian\" school.\n The story goes that it was run by Christians and that they had a tendency to lose Native American children.\nMy boss had called me and a few other in one so we could pick our crews and go over the plans.\n\nMost of us already had people in our crews that we liked, due to specific skills or because of their demeanor.\nThis time we were instructed to pick guys who could keep cool at all times since this job wouldn't really need anything special, it was going to be demoed by another crew after we went in.\n\nWe got a warning about the building, the boss let us know that people broke in to it all the time to do crazy witchcraft stuff and to be careful of anyone who might reside in it, such as hobos, cultist oh and ghosts because it was supposedly haunted as foook.\n\nAt the site our radios would go off and sometimes and hear someone talking, we thought it was interference, our harnesses would get tugged on and no one was there and a few times I got to hear voices or people calling my name. \n\nI believe the place was haunted and so did most of the guys, several used to hold prayer circles before we went in and a few refused to go in and would ask to be moved to a different job site which we would do for their safety and ours.\n\nQuite a few things happened there, but nothing I can REALLY call malicious. Just really creepy.",
            "I fly helicopters over power lines in remote parts of the country. I once saw, what I thought was a human leg sticking out of the woods into a very small clearing in the trees. It shook me enough I went back to the LZ and got one of the ground crewmen to go back and look while I hovered as low as I could get without hitting the rotors on the trees. \n\nWe get there and he says he can\u2019t see exactly what it is. We go back and grab a pair of binoculars so he can get a closer look. \n\nTurned out to be a cow. The catch was it had no skin. Like none at all. A perfect cow sans all of its skin. No animals had eaten it yet, so it was still fully intact. \n\nThere were no farms around for a 50 mile radius. I still have no clue how it ended up there in the manner it was in. I still remember the \u201c Fuck that\u2019s a body\u201d feeling I had when I think of this story.",
            "I was in southeast Alaska for around 15 days a few summers ago. We had just finished up dinner and washed out our pots and pans and gone to our respective tents in the trees along the shore we had stopped at for the night. The spot we had chosen to camp wasn't ideal. The tide was set to come in pretty far that night and it would only leave us with a few feet before the water would be lapping at our tent flaps. But we also didn't care that much as it had been raining and incredibly windy that day so kayaking was hardly any fun at all and we needed to stop. About 45 minutes after we had said goodnight to one another I heard some splashing in the tidal zone, probably 20 feet from my tent. I didn't think much of it because a few times before when in Alaska we had stopped at beaches where the tide had risen to within a few feet of our tents. Anyway, I try to ignore it, although in my mind I'm freaking the fuck out. Our camp spot was less than ideal if you wanted to escape in the middle of the night. We were at the base of a relatively steep hill that was covered in alders and slick with rain, to the left, probably 70 feet from where we camped there was a rocky outcrop that went out into the water and was about 20 feet tall and steep enough that you couldn't climb it. If, for example, a grizzly bear (and there were a lot out that time of the summer, we had seen 4 or 5 that day alone, patrolling the beaches) wanted to see what was going on down the beach and walked towards us from the right it would basically seal off our movement. Sort of like putting the cork back in the wine bottle, not many places to go. Anyway, after 15 minutes of hearing splashing I start to try to rationalize it enough to go to sleep. But that's when I start hearing something other than splashing. This incredibly high pitched gargling sound breaks through the night's relative quiet. It sounded as though two cats had gotten into a fight but every time they let out a scream the other cat would push the one cats head underwater. This went on for a good twenty minutes. After it died down I hear \"that's weird huh?\" from the other tent, obviously trying to downplay the incident. I, being scared as fuck, just reply \"yep, going to sleep!\" Another 15 minutes pass without much sound, but then the same gargling breaks through the night, this time much much closer. The noises are deeper this time, more guttural. It sounds like an old man fighting with a cat, and each time either of them shriek they are forced underwater, the splashing intensifies and it sounds like it's right outside my tent. I think that the fear of whatever was going on eventually just zapped me of all energy because eventually i fell asleep. I just remember that I didn't move a muscle, and i didn't move for so long that all of my muscles ached after awhile and I could feel my heart beat in my throat all night long. Anyway, we woke up, had breakfast, broke down the tents and got back on the road. Didn't hear it ever again. A few weeks later I did some googling and I'm pretty sure that it was just some sea otters fighting each other in the intertidal zone. But it was scary as fuck. I'll link the youtube audio of the noises if I can find it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: They were seals fighting, not sea otters, here's the audio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L\\_UKEU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L_UKEU) Imagine hearing this as you lie in the cold dark in the middle of nowhere scared that a grizzly might come down the beach and eat you.\n\nTLDR: Lying in the dark in Alaska and hear guttural screams and what sounds like someone being drowned, in the pitch black in the middle of nowhere, 20 feet outside of my tent.",
            "My dad told me a sea-tale of his days working on ocean-going barges. He said one night they were under way with heavy seas, and had to adjust the tie-up between the tug-boat and the barge. (Forgive my nautical blasphemy I'm butchering these terms, he was the one with the time off shore...)\n\nHe described doing anything on deck, at night, in a storm, as about the most dangerous thing you possibly do, because outside of the weather and risk of going overboard, there was such high tension on various cables that if anything snapped it might come across the deck and cut someone in half.\n\nNow - he said this particular sea-going tug had had some \"history.\" One of the previous crew had \"gone missing\" before Dad's time on the crew, and from the way it wasn't discussed, but occasionally alluded to, there may have been foul play.\n\nSo in the midst of the storm, with danger and tension high, an argument broke out. Two of the crew started yelling at each other, and at the moment that everyone thought it might come to violence, a fire-axe flew across the deck and landed between their feet. No one was near the wall where it had been strapped down. A fire axe has its own bracket welded to a wall, with straps to hold it in place unless it's needed. They don't just come loose on their own, and the odds of it landing at their feet were impossible... except... that the two arguing were also the ones who had fought with the lost sailor.\n\nThey did not fight. They put the axe back in the rack. Everyone finished their work quietly, and it was not spoken of again until they returned to shore.",
            "Although it\u2019s not really work, I do go hunting kinda north in Canada, and the thing is, where I hunt for deer there are plenty of wolves , bears and the sorts , so I stay in a cabin up there. You aren\u2019t always on your toes, but you want to bring a rifle with you to go anywhere. Even if you don\u2019t plan on shooting anything.\n\nSo it\u2019s like 5am , and I\u2019m on the four wheeler I\u2019m freezing weather to get to my tree stand before dawn hits and I swear to god I keep hearing crashing through the bushes, I dismiss it for probably being ice cracking the branches from last night snow. But creepy , nonetheless. As I reached my stand, I climb up and settle for the morning.  I get a pretty nice view of a field that was cleared out, and there is a old burned out cottage on the opposite end of the clearing. As the sun rises behind my stand, the morning is very still, just the occasional branch falling down through the forest.\n\nDay really passed without any ammo being spent and a get out of my tree stand. And decide maybe I should go look at the burned down cabin, I\u2019ve never bothered checking it. And  looking at it all day got me curious enough to go check it out. There wasn\u2019t a cleared trail, (obviously) so I\u2019d have to go it on foot. \nI unloaded my rifle and went for a long walk.\n\nAround a good 10 min later I started to get close and could see some old farm equipment, which made sense. A field in the middle of the forest was probably cleared so a farmer could do what he wants with it. I come close to the doorway, only really able to hear the crunch of snow underneath my feet.\n\nThe doorway managed to survive whatever happened there and slid down the snow in through the doorway, careful not to touch anything. And I feel crunch under my boots that definitely isn\u2019t snow. It\u2019s the skull of a bull. I look up from the snow and there is more of them. Skulls and legs. A ridiculous amount. But the part that alarmed me is that I could see a tint of red in the snow underneath one that was still covered in skin.\n\nSo I said fuck that and bolted. back across the field and didn\u2019t look back. \n\nWhy was someone collecting that shit in the middle of the forest? I don\u2019t have a clue, and don\u2019t want to think about it. Next year I moved  my stand and I never want to go back there. \nWeird shit happens in the forest.",
            "I'm a machinist and I was working by myself in this old warehouse at night.  I would see stuff moving around and I would get creeper out.  This is when ghost hunters became popular. So I started to ask questions, what's your name \" can you show me that I'm not alone\".  Seconds later a 3/8 Allen wrench came bouncing across the shop and landed at my feet.  It didn't fall of the machine it slid.  I was cutting micarta which is like wood, and you could see the slid marks in the chips.  I said thank you to the ghost, shut down and left.  I never went back.",
            "Not for work but I was at large old cottage in the middle of the Peak District, UK, with a friend who's parents lived there but were away for the weekend. For anyone that doesn't know, it's a very barren place, full of hills, heather and rains a lot. You don't see many people around. \n\nWe'd spent the evening outside on her patio until it got dark and quite cold, so as we packing up to head indoors, her dog suddenly jumped upwards and just ran, as fast as I've ever seen it run into the field next door and into the darkness. No bark, no whining, just vanished. \n\nWe called and she eventually came back but she kept turning around and standing her ground, staring into the dark. A few minutes later we saw these flashes coming from a patch of woods beyond the field. They looked like camera flashes but it was too far away to tell. \n\n20 minutes later we were inside and we locked the doors, a little unnerved by whatever the dog had spotted. It was late, and too late for what happened next. \n\nThe house phone rang, and at that kind of time of night, you know it's never good. But my friend just froze and looked at me. I asked her if she was going to answer it, the incessant sound of it already creeping me out. \n\nShe said, \"It only makes that noise when you've lost one of the handsets\". \n\nI asked her what she meant, and she said, \"We have two house phones, one here and one upstairs. It makes that noise when you phone the other phone if you've lost it. It's an internal call.\"\n\nNothing came of it, but I didn't sleep much that night.",
            "Probably a little too late to the party but here we go! \n\nI\u2019ve seen a few things working in remote locations on land and working oil rigs / platforms in the Gulf of Mexico but I definitely think the eeriest was the one I never saw but heard the countless stories from the people who had to investigate it. \n\nOn a platform offshore a man went missing during his nightly rounds. After searching the platform top to bottom they found his hard hat, tool belt, work boots and all his personal shit neatly placed on the grating near the railing and he was MIA. Everyone has their stories of maybe it was just suicide because as it turns out living on a metal structure surrounded by water for weeks at a time takes it\u2019s toll on you. Some people have their theories he found out his wife was cheating on him at home. Some people even think it was nefarious and someone made him do it because he was having a affair with their wife. The Oilfield can be a dark place both mentally and physically. All I know is jumping into the dark abyss of the ocean and letting the waves swallow you up is a terrifying concept to me.     \n\n\n\nSecond story happens along a dead stretch of highway around 3am. I was making the drive back home from the docks and around 3am I started getting so exhausted it was getting unsafe for me to drive. I was falling asleep slapping myself in the face and sticking my head out the windows trying to do anything I could to stay awake and make it home but nothing was working. \n\nSo due to the time and location there wasn\u2019t any safe places I could park to get a little bit of rest. So in my sleep deprived state and I figured since I hadn\u2019t seen anyone else on the highway with me I\u2019d just pull over to the side of the road and get some rest. I leave my truck running with the lights on and set a alarm for 45 minutes. Well on that truck when you put it into park it automatically unlocks your doors. Thank God right before I fell asleep I had the presence of mind to relock all my doors because about 10 minutes before my alarm went off I woke up to the sound of the door handle on the rear passengers door on my truck getting repeatedly yanked on and it was shaking the whole truck. \n\nNeedless to say I was awake now and full of energy. All I can remember from the adrenaline dump that happened was I slammed the truck in gear and did probably the best burnout that truck has ever done and threw rocks and smoke at whoever was behind me. The rest of the drive home I remember swerving left and right trying to make sure if someone was in the bed of my truck that I\u2019d knock them out. I think the creepiest thing about that whole ordeal for me is there isn\u2019t a way for me to prove that it happened. At the time the incident happened I had been awake over 24 hours. But I\u2019ve also heard instances of that happening to people on that stretch of road. \n\nCall it a ghost, a dream or some kids playing pranks on the poor people passing through town but all I know is I\u2019ll never fall asleep parked on the side of the road again. \n\nI apologize for any formatting or spelling errors I\u2019m on mobile.",

            "I used to work for a pest control company and did most of the termite pretreatment work. This typically involved working super late into the night to get the work done before concrete crews got started in the morning. I was on a job site for a big custom house way out in the desert. The entire job site was surrounded with high barbed wire fence with a drive through gate.\n\n I was down in a dugout area for a basement with my truck working away when I heard the fence line rattle. I was wearing a hat mounted flashlight so I looked up and scanned the fence line thinking a coyote was walking along it. Instead I found a woman trying to climb the fence but unable to get past the barbed wire portion. I have hear people say \"crazed look\" before but never understood the statement before that moment. As soon as my flashlight hit her she dropped back to the ground and just stood there looking at me. A lot of the night is weirdly lost in my memory either because it was over a decade ago or because fear made me foggy, but I do remember a few things very vividly. \n\nHer eyes were as wide open as they could get, like almost popping out of thier sockets. She kept muttering to herself but I couldn't hear what she was saying, and when she wasn't talking she kept kind of smiling like her face muscles were trying to pull her mouth open. All she was wearing was a super dirty and torn up long shirt or dress and she had no shoes on. \n\nShe kept walking back and forth along the fence line and I was pretty sure she was looking for a way in. I always locked myself in construction sites when working and thankfully I did that night too. \n\nIt felt like it took me forever to get my equipment stowed and the pistol out of my truck cab all while trying to keep an eye on the woman. She just kept staring at me, muttering and pacing the fenceline. \n\nI was able to reach the police but it took almost 40 minutes for a sheriff's officer to get out to me. As soon as his car started making noise on the dirt road leading to the work site the lady ran off into the desert. \n\nI'm sure she was drugged out of her head or something but I still don't know how she got that far out of town in the dark  with no shoes on. I was a good 30 minutes or more out of town driving, much less on foot. \n\nI still have an occasional nightmare about it and it always ends with me forgetting I left the gate open and panic running back to the truck.",

I walked in the front door into a long room, with a total of 7 doors, all of which were locked. The owner must have come through one of them to let me into this main big room. On the floor on the right, was a large tube tv, the kind one might get for free from someone throwing it out, or at a goodwill. It was sitting on the floor. No furniture in this room at all. The man said to me I was not allowed to go any further in this house, nor go into the basement to hook anything up, and that he had already hooked up the cable line in the basement up through the floor and that all I needed to do was put in the small box and connect it. While doing this, a door opened, and there was a young boy with a very sad look on his face. His clothes were dirty, tattered, and he looked hopeless. The man quickly snapped at him to lock the door, and the boy vanished as quickly as he opened the door. Suddenly the hair on my neck stood up and it felt like this was a trafficking/pedo situation. There was no signal over the cable wire (naturally), and I asked the man to get into the basement to check and he adamantly refused. I explained he would have no cable, and he said fine in an angrily tone and basically threw me out. It was super creepy.",

Twice a month a plane would fly in to deliver supplies.\n\nOne day, about three months in, my friend was just walking along the river that ran near the site and he heard what he swore was like a church choir and organ music in the distance. He was pretty sure that there was no settlement within a hundred miles, but nevertheless he decided to try to find the source of the music. \n\nHe wandered miles downstream following the river, but the sound never got any louder. Finally he decided to get the eff back to camp, because he'd wandered off really far in bear infested woods without any protection. The music faded before he got back to camp, and he realized that it was such a peculiar experience he was reluctant to mention it to his co-worker in case he thought he was crazy.\n\nThe following day he did mention it, and asked if there were was an Indian reserve or some other settlement with a church in area. His coworker replied, \"No, man. Nothing like that here and I've been here 10 years. Looks like you're bushwhacked. You need to get out of here...\"\n\nHe left on the next plane",

            "I'm an avid hunter in a rural town in Missouri.  My family hunts on public land and we have hunted on the same ridge for multiple generations.  The land used to be kept by a large saw mill that used mules to drag the trees to the mill in the near by town.  We have found all sorts of crazy stuff, railroad spikes in the middle of the woods, horse shoes grown into the side of a tree where they hung it on a limb.\n\nOne of the craziest things I've found in the woods was where a wagon had fell off the side of the ridge taking the mules with it.  It's something like 200 ft drop so they just left everything down there.  I hiked by this thing a hundred times going to and from our hunting spot, the woods all rotted from it but the metal brackets and wheels were still there, grown over and taken back by nature.\n\nOne day while walking in the woods I get to my spot that is probably half a mile form that spot and I've been sitting there for a few hours when I hear what sounds like people yelling down the ridge followed by a loud scream, and a crashing sound.  I grabbed my gear and start on my way out, when I get by where the wagon debris was a flower wreath laid over the wagon but I've never seen anyone down there except for my family members and no one knows who put it there.\n\nWe talked about that night back at camp and we could only assume that if someone had died in that wagon, maybe it was some distant grand child or something  and that day was the anniversary of it happening but that still doesn't explain the sounds that I had heard.\n\nI still hunt down in the same place as always but I've never heard or seen anything since.",

Turns out she came across a dead fox. The thing that was concerning is that she said it was hanging from a tree and looks like it was put there on purpose.\n\nSo a bit later on, a few of us went down to have a look. We came across a small clearing with the dead fox hanging there. Upon closer inspection, we realised it had been hung by it's neck, with an incision from it's balls to it's throat and all of it's insides pulled out. \n\nFelt pretty sick from that one. We got it down from the branch and chucked it into the bushes, away from the path and clearing. Still to this day we have no idea how or why it was in that state.",
            "I'm a geophysicist and I'm out to do survey work about 1/3 of the time. A lot of our surveys are in remote locations. I was doing one in my home province of Saskatchewan, very far north, about a 6 hour drive from the nearest small town, and then a 45 min helicopter ride into our camp. It's isolated, and this survey began in October of last year, so it's quite dark  a lot of the time. \n\nMy room was on the attic of our only building, and the wood burning stove that heated the place was directly below my room, so I often had to leave the window open at night. One night I had the window open and I could hear singing from outside, which was creepy but I figured it was just a member of the crew who can't sleep. The next night I hear the same thing, at the same time (about 3 am) and this time I get up to go to the bathroom. Everyone else was sleeping in cots in a large open room and when I'm heading back to my room I realise that everyone is in their cots.\n\nI don't hear the singing again for a few days and it stops creeping me out... Until about a week later, I wake up and hear it, I go to check and once again everyone is in their cots.\n\n I put my huge winter jacket on, I head outside and walk towards the sound, I step right up to the shore of the lake that we're on and I hear it coming from somewhere across the lake. The moon is up and very bright, and I see somebody in the lake, which is absolutely freezing, as in it has started to ice over. At this point I am terrified but I call out in case they needed help, they dive down under the water and I don't see them ever again or hear the singing. It feels like a dream to this day. What the fuck.",
            "Not working in a remote place, but a holiday in a remote part of Iceland.\n\nI have always wanted to see the northern lights, so I spent a week travelling around Iceland a few years ago.\n\nThe weather was mostly cloudy so I didn't get to see anything for the first 5 days. On the second to last night we were staying at a little place in the middle of nowhere. I had booked an airbnb, but when we finally found the place it was an old run-down farm, just a couple of buildings at the end of a long dirt road. It was 40 miles away from the nearest other house, just old man and a cat that lived there, and he had put his spare bedroom on airbnb and said he would provide breakfast.\n\nIt was due to be cloudy again, so I didn't bother staying up. At about 3:30 in the morning something woke me up and I could see an eerie green glow coming in through the windows and realised that the northern lights were performing. It was bitterly cold, so I put on several layers of warm clothes, grabbed my camera and tripod and headed outside. \n\nThe northern lights were clearly there, but a couple of electric lightbulbs outside the farmhouse meant that it was barely visible in the photos that I took. I couldn't find the lightswitch, so I used the torch from my camera and headed out across the fields. \n\nI had walked about 150m, climbed over a couple of fences and got to a fairly large dip in the ground. Here I was in almost complete darkness, which meant the faint glow in the sky looked better. I set up the tripod with shivering fingers (I had to take my gloves off to fiddle with the clasps) and mounted my camera. I started hear some strange noises from around me, some rustling like there was something moving slowly, but it was windy so I convinced myself that it was just something blowing around. Occasionally the noises would stop for a few minutes before starting again, but I tried to just focus on taking the pictures and getting back quickly.\n\nIt was tough to get the camera in the right place as I couldn't see anything through the viewfinder or on the screen. I had wanted to get a slow exposure, so as I clicked the button I had to wait, as still as possible, for about 30 seconds. \n\nSuddenly I heard footsteps - something was running towards me at high speed, really fast, somehow running in the pitch blackness across very bumpy ground (even with a torch I had had to take it slow and careful). I couldn't see anything at all, and I FREAKED OUT. I don't think I screamed, but I felt absolute panic, gasped, as my fight-or-flight response tensed every muscle in my body.\n\nThe footsteps reached me and I felt a cat rubbing against my legs in an affectionate way.\n\nThe farm cat must have followed me.\n\nAfter I caught my breath, and laughed so hard that I felt a little light-headed, I stayed out there for another 10 mins, took a few lovely photos and then headed back to the farmhouse to go back to bed.",
            "I used to work at a summer camp. Usually the kids would go to bed by 9pm at the latest so the rest of us would just hang out around a fire or something. One night one of the kids came to the fire pit, which was about a hundred yards from the cabin, saying that she was having trouble sleeping because of the noise. So I walk back with her and make sure everything is good in the cabin and come back and tell everybody to keep it down. Maybe ten minutes later she comes back and says that she still can't fall asleep. I walk back with her again and in my head I'm thinking that she's just being restless because we aren't being loud, but anyways I make sure she's under covers and head back to the fire pit. Just as I'm about to get there I realize that I left my walkie talkie in her room, so I head back and see that she's sitting upright in bed with the walkie talkie in her hand. I'm thinking okay, whatever, and tell her to go to sleep. I head back to the fire pit and the guys are like \"why did you say that to her?\" And I'm like what do you mean? And they're like \"we heard you on the walkie talkie tell her that she would look better if she shaved her head. That all little girls look better with shaved heads.\" I never said that and nobody believed me. And it was obviously not her saying it either since it was a grown man's voice. I rushed back to check on the cabin and everything was normal.",

            "My story isn't exactly what was asked for but should be good padding while this post is so new. In middle school, I worked at the school during the summer, doing general painting and helping the maintenance guys. We had to drive out to the fuckoff middle of a Floridian forest to pick up some pine lumber for the gym's new bleachers, and when we got to the mill at like 7am, the whole place was locked down with police. They had found gasoline cans and pill bottles out in one of the tree farm groves, telltale signs of kids abusing substances, but supposedly the cops were there because they found human remains. I was pretty young and I don't remember anything outside of my little kid point of view, but I remember seeing streaks of dark blood running up the trunks of several pines. I've since learned from the guys I was with then that a teenager was killed by a bear after attacking it, and the blood was either from the wounded bear climbing the tree or dragging a hurt person up with it, but I'm sure many of you can agree with me that bears don't do that. And I can't see an injured bear makin it up several pines in a row while bleeding that much. \nSo, technically, I saw a creepy thing while at work in a remote area! Look up lakeland mill casualties or something to find it, the story of the kids death was in the local paper",

            "I used to deliver hotshot freight across the great plains/Minnesota area. One night around 2am I was hauling across North Dakota trying to reach Montana by morning. I was delivering a particularly valuable tractor part that a farm desperately needed for the following day. I began to notice some highway hypnosis sneaking up on me, but it didn't really bother me because I'd been through it hundreds of times before. Anyone who has driven across North Dakota knows that it is incredibly flat. Like, really flat. There also tends to be very straight and long roads. It's somewhat easy to see things on the road that are far away, even at night. \n\nI noticed something long on the road, spanning my entire lane, approximately half a mile in front of me. I slowed down a little and prepared to move into the opposite lane, thinking it was some re-tread off a blown tire. As I got closer I noticed it was two people, laying head to toe across the entire lane. I swerved into the other lane, successfully avoiding them and came to an almost complete stop. But they didn't move. Not an inch. \n\nI was just about to back up and check on them when I remembered a story that an old greybeard colleague of mine told me. He told me that in certain remote areas, people will lie down in the middle of the road and wait for a car or truck to stop and see what's going on. At that point, the road-layers along with whoever else is hiding in the nearby bushes will beat the shit out of the driver and steal his vehicle, leaving him in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI decided not to back up, and when the two people in the road saw me put my truck back in gear and drive away, they both got up and walked toward the shoulder. I called the police and explained what happened, but we were so far away from civilization that I doubt anything came of it. \n\nThanks to that old greybeard, I got to keep my truck, my job, and my teeth.",

            "Lived up north for a while on a 3 year job. A local took me way out into the woods one night because he *swore* that at midnight at this one spot you could see the ghostly carriage where some people froze to death.\n\nObviously expected to see nothing.\n\nSo we're sitting there in absolute pitch black darkness. You can't see your hand in front of your face or anything around you. The sky is slightly, slightly grey from the thin cloud cover reflecting distant lights but that's it. You can't even really make out the tree line.\n\nWe never do see a carriage. Or anything. \n\nAt about 12:20 or so we're just smoking and chatting, thinking about leaving, when we hear the unmistakable sounds of someone walking through the underbrush. Loud crackling of breaking sticks and branches.\n\nBut still, everything is black.\n\nIt gets closer and louder, but we don't see anyone coming. There's nothing. And all we can think is how it's basically suicide to trudge through these woods at night. Good way to get a stick in the eye at the very least, and eventually you *will* twist an ankle or break something when you step off a ledge - the ground around here is very uneven.\n\nBut it's definitely someone coming. Crack, snap, snap...\n\nIn the pitch black? Nope. We drive the hell out if there.\n\nWe weren't afraid it was a ghost. We were afraid it was a person insane enough to be marching through the woods without a light. Do not want to meet that guy.\n\n**Update**: for those of you comforting yourself that it was just an animal...\n\nWhen I say \"up north\" I want you to imagine a place where you literally have to drive 3 hours to arrive at the closest city, and another 3 after that to get to the next one.\n\nAnd when I say noise I'm not talking squirrels. Think rhythmic, and think large branches snapping on the ground. I'd been up there long enough to know what a possum sounds like.\n\nThat big it might have been a bear, but a bear wandering around at night is not normal - which I suppose means it would have been pretty messed up, and that makes it worse. Moose? Possibly but those things are scarier than bears. No joke. They're the size of a truck, use those antlers at anything that gets too close, and disappear into the woods like ghosts... but we didn't hear hooves so...",
            "I work for a railroad. Not necessarily \"remote\" but sometimes its just a conductor and engineer cruising along +/-10mph on very isolated, fairly wooded track.

Constant blowing of the horn, flashing of the lights etc just kept walking down the track. Then disappearing.

            "So in college, I'd wait for my roommate to get off of work at the new parking garage my campus built. He was a security guard on the night shift. Nothing too crazy most of the time but one day he finished his shift and I told him I'd meet him outside. He leaves the garage and says, \"I don't think you're going to believe me when I tell you this but I have to tell someone while it's fresh in my mind.\"\n\n(The next part is how I remember him telling me while we sat in the car)\n\n\"I was in the office chatting it up with the custodian when he pointed to the security camera screen and told me there's a guy in the stairwell. We both looked at the camera closely and sure enough, there's a guy just standing on a landing in the stairwell in an old-timey suit (bowler hat and everything) The security guard told me he'd start cleaning at the bottom of the stairs and if he saw the gentleman he'd tell him to leave. I told him I'd come up the landing and do the same. I didn't see him on my way to the landing so I made my way to the stairs while calling out that the garage was closed for the night in case he was hiding. While walking through the stairwell I startled the custodian because he was expecting to see Mr. Suit as well but no one left the stairwell at the bottom. I told him I had to check out the rest of the grounds and that maybe he slipped out another way (even though there was really no way either of us could have missed him) I'm approaching the ramp of the next to last landing of the top of the garage and I see an older woman in an old-timey dress and umbrella. She's going up the ramp in the distance. I yell she shouldn't be up here and swiftly pick up the pace before I lose sight of her going to the top level. As soon as I arrive to the ramp she was accending, I don't see her. I got to the top of the ramp and see a kid skateboarding on the last level of the garage. I tell him the garage is closed and he shouldn't be up here, but at the same time wondering where that women went. The skateboarder apologized and said he'd walk down with me if that would be ok. We get to the bottom and I say, \"Hey man, you see anything weird at this garage tonight?\" The skateboarder looked at me with the most confusing stare and said, \"Well there was this older woman standing at the edge of the garage and I didn't see her come up the ramp. I screamed she should be careful not to get too close to the edge. I went to pick up my board and when I looked up, she was gone. I ran to the edge to see if she jumped but nothing. She was gone. She was wearing this old looking dress and umbrella.\"  I didn't want to tell the kid I saw the exact same woman because I was too freaked out.\"\n\nI suggested that it was probably a costume party and some people were messing around. I couldn't explain the disappearances though. He said he thought the same thing but he remembered his boss telling him that years ago (20's era) people would dress up in their Sunday duds and walk through the park in town. The park was right where this parking garage was.",

            "I grew up in Michigan before it was fashionable to kidnap the Governor.  Backpacking in the Pigeon River State Forest happened multiple times every year.  On one fateful trip we had closed down for the night, we\u2019re enjoying the campfire and listening to the night noises.  Our campsite was up on a bluff away from the river. I should mention that the experience was nicely enhanced by smoking the devils salad.  All of a sudden we could hear something walking effortlessly through the water.  We froze and looked at each other, eyes big as saucers, knowing our time had come.  We quickly realized that whatever was moving through the water was not one, but many. Certain that we were dinner for a whole family of Sasquatch  we did a military crawl to the edge of the bluff to identify our killer.  Through the moonlight, we could see the elk herd casually walking by the campsite as they headed to wherever they were going to bed down for the night.  We watched in silence as those beautiful animals moved so graciously through the river.  After they left, we walked back to our campfire and laughed uncontrollably as we tried to accuse each other of being the most scared that night.  I think of that experience from time to time and smile from the memory.  Thanks OP for bringing it to mind again.",
            "Not me, but my Dad's coworker. Stretching the definition of work here, but I think it fits. Anyways, in the Vietnam war, this guy was part of a special forces outfit who were dropped into Laos or Cambodia to map the Ho Chi Minh trail. Out of a group of about 20, only 3 or 4 made it out. At one point late in the operation, he was separated from the rest of his squadmates, and was trying to find a river to follow back to a US outpost. He said something they were always taught was to keep their rifle in their hands at all times, and never set it down. After a few days of no supplies and avoiding Viet Cong, he hears the sound of rushing water, and as silently as he can, makes his way toward it. After coming through some trees, he finds a river that he recognizes, and immediately has this mental celebration in his mind of \"thank god, I've made it\", and in his haste to get some water in his dehydrated system, sets his rifle down. He said he was guzzling water when all of sudden he hears this snapping sound, like a branch cracking, directly behind him. He said he immediately closed his eyes and prepared for a bullet to enter his skull. After a few seconds pass and he isn't departing the world to meet his maker, he opens his eyes, and slowly turns around. Five feet away, a Buddhist monk is standing in the middle of the jungle. The monk raises a finger to his lips, and beckons him to follow. Turns out, a monastery is nearby, and the monks were sympathetic to the US. They ended up sheltering him for a few weeks until they got him back to US forces. Crazy enough, years later he ended up running into the same monk that saved his life at a remote buddhist temple in the US. They remained friends until the monk passed away from cancer.",
            "I used to work with wildlife conservation and anti-poaching teams throughout Sub-Saharan Africa as an ecologist and ranger so I have lots of stories...the thing that always bothered me the most were leopards.\n\nIn one reserve we had a local guy who ran his own small guiding business. He would cruise around in his 80s Land Cruiser packed full with tourists and was notorious for breaking the rules (i.e. no off trail driving, don't get too close to animals, etc.) which is probably why people always booked him cause they almost always saw more.\n\nAnyway, one day he stopped his Cruiser on a concrete and iron bridge that carried its users over a creek that swelled and cascaded through the valley during the wet season.  It was dry season so the creek bed was cracked and bone dry. He let his passengers out to take pictures down the creek bed (it was a rather scenic spot). He said he had to take a leak so he walked to the far side of the bridge and disappeared under the spot where the bridge connected to the top of the berm that slowly sloped 30' down to the bottom of the creek bed. Next thing the tourists snapping pics on the bridge see is a massive leopard bound out from under the bridge carrying the guide's body by his neck. As soon as it appeared it vanished and a body was never found. All they located was a pack of cigarettes and a lighter he must've dropped in the attack. His last act of rule breaking got him killed.\n\nIn a different location a young tourist on vacation with her family slept on the open air second floor of the lodge they'd rented despite being told not to. In the morning her family came out to find the shredded hammock, pieces of clothes, and blood. They eventually found what was left of her stuffed in a tree not far away.\n\nHave lots of other crazy stories about poachers, muthi magic, farm raids, civil unrest, animal attacks, lost/missing people, etc. etc. if anyone is interested.

That was pretty scary, I would see shadowy figures gliding along behind me in window reflections. \n\nWhen you only have the hum of a freezer for company, you start to get twitchy, like hearing doors opening and closing far away in the building, the electrics clicking and thumping and the vents turning on and off. Sometimes all the sounds just stop and you wish to god the freezer pump would come on again or something.\n\nScariest moment I ever had was going from one room to another, the authentication lock on a side door goes green and clicks open... There was nobody in there. I could see the window it was dark and nobody opened the door. Stood with my heart in my mouth for ages. Then it clicks red again. God help me I didn't open that door I just tried not to think about it.",
            "Not for work, but I grew up in VERY rural Oklahoma and did a lot of pig hunting. I generally bow hunted, but always carried a side arm just in case. Anyway, I come across tracks and I can tell by the stride that it's a huge hog so I start tracking. I don't know if you've ever tracked, but you kinda get tunnel vision, just looking for sign. Anyway, I'm tracking for about an hour when I realize I've tracked in a circle and I'm looking at my own tracings. Then I heard this 300lb pig snort behind me. Yep, a fucking pig tracked me into a circle and got the drop on me.\nSo, I did what any redblooded American bad ass from Oklahoma would do. I scurried my ass up the nearest tree so fast an orangutan would have clapped. Then I proceeded to pee my big boy pants while the boar rooted and tusked the base of the tree.\nLater I told my friends that pig was lucky I was in a good mood, or I'd have kicked his ass....",
            "Not me but my Dad. \n\nYears ago he was working alone as a geologist in the middle of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall. The Moor is hilly, treeless, windswept, bleak, very old and very atmospheric.\n\nIt was early one morning and the Moor was covered in low lying fog. Dad was surveying a dip in the landscape when he heard a strange screeching/wailing coming from behind a ridge. The fog and shape of the land was such that he couldn't tell where the sound was coming from and he was spooked. \n\nAs the sound increased in intensity a herd of sheep suddenly appeared through the fog then followed by a man in full Scottish regalia, kilt and all, playing a set of bagpipes. \n\nDad assumed it was no apparition and when he spoke with the man it turned he was local farmer who had relocated from Scotland and found that the isolated Moor was the perfect place to practice playing his bagpipes without disturbing anybody (have you heard bagpipes?!). He'd be doing it for so long that the sheep had developed a sort of Pavlovian response to the sound and he could successfully herd them using his bagpipes instead of his dog. He dressed up because, why the hell not?",

            "I used to work as an engineer on a cargo ship.We were passing through the gulf of oman and we had stopped earlier for security guards to board the ship for safety reasons cause that area is very dangerous. \nThis was also the first time time that I passed through that region so I was kinda scared of the things that I've heard about happening there. And the inevitable happened, the thing that I feared the most.And yes I think you know what Im talking about.\nWe got attacked by Somali pirates.I was up in the bridge doing some paper work when I suddenly heard the alarm and the captain speaking about it.The guards were up there with me and I went outside the bridge to see what was happening.\nAnd holy shit it was exactly like that Captain Philips movie if you have seen it. About 3-4 little boats with armed men were coming straight for the ship firing their guns toward the bridge.The guards answered back by firing back and the fight lasted about 5 minutes before they decided to flee due to them not being able to board the ship.\nGod damn what a truly unforgetable  experience.",

            "Forest Officer here.\n\nWorking double-shifted on a wildfire incident after driving 9+ hours and having worked a full shift the day before. It was about three in the morning, very sense smoke soon couldn't see very far from the fire line I was holding. I kept seeing two reflections from my headlamp in the distant smog, like little glints of light where there should be none. They kept getting closer and closer, but only when I wasn't looking directly at the source. This went on for about half an hour until the thing got close enough I could hear it moving through the crispy brush. Crunch, crunch, scrape, crunch, it sounded biiiig. I got nervous at this point, the hairs on my nape we're on end. It's not uncommon for bears or lion's to patrol fire edges looking for freshly bbq'd critters. I got into my engine's cab and shut the door. I could still hear it getting closer still. My engine partner was fast asleep, I contemplated waking her to check out what I was seeing/hearing. Then the thing hopped out of the brush, a yearling deer. It saw me, pooped a bunch of pellets and bounded off into the woods. It was just a spoopy lost deer.",

            "When I was in the Navy I saw a UFO. A lot of people will tell me no, it was just some weird lights, but nothing created on the planet Earth moves the way \nthis did.\n\nIt was just getting dark outside, underway at about 10kts in the Mediterranean, dead flat seas. I\u2019m sitting watch up on the Brightbridge console when I notice a single point of light in the air - to me it\u2019s what looks like a helicopter hovering above one of two merchant vessels in sight. I check the AIS, and get the names of the two vessels and relay that information over to our TIC/IDS. It\u2019s not incredibly uncommon for a merchant vessel to have a helicopter on board, but there is absolutely no signal coming from the bearings I was giving, and no record of either ship having a helicopter. At this point, I started to get more concerned and curious, the point of light is still hovering above one of the ships. \n\nI head out to the port bridge wing and get on the big eyes (high power mounted binoculars) to see if I can get a better look at the aircraft. It appears to be at least 11nm away, and even with the magnification, all I can see is a single point of light. At this point, the OOD is interested as well, and joins me on the bridge wing, and we watch this point of light zip 15nm in a matter of 2-3 seconds and stop directly over the other merchant vessel. There was no wind up acceleration, it just went from hover to full speed to full stop instantly. The Officer standing with me was completely speechless and in awe at what just happened, and called for a higher power air radar search on that vector - still nothing at all.\nThe point of light hovers above the ship for a minute or so, then at about half the speed from before flies to a point between the two vessels over the open ocean. It makes 3-4 dips down to the water and then back up to about 10,000 feet. \n\nThen it started to make a infinity loop pattern in the sky. It was dropping from around 10,000 to 2,000 feet and back up at an incredibly rapid pace - no human made aircraft is capable of this amount of precision, acceleration and deceleration, or speed. Before the two of us could even react, the craft blasted across the sky at a slightly upward angle, completely silently, leaving no trail or trace at thousands of miles an hour before disappearing into the open sky. The Officer of the Deck standing next to me had his mouth wide open, eyes practically bugging out of his head behind the binoculars. He looked at me and said \u201cRedclam, what in the fuck did we just see?\u201d To which I replied confidently, \u201cwe just saw a UFO sir\u201d. \n\nWe reported it to CIC as a glare on the windscreen of the bridge, that we messed up \u201chaha\u201d but we know what we saw with our bare eyes. The two vessels involved got underway a few minutes after our report, each heading back towards the coast at 15 knots, along the exact same track. I lost track of the vessels when I got off watch 4 hours later, but I\u2019ve always been curious about them and where they ended up.\n\nTL;DR\nThe Officer of the Deck and I saw a UFO while on watch in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea.",
            "I worked in a mountain cabin, alone, for 6 weeks about 40 miles from the nearest road. One night a massive storm rolled in and I swear I could hear knocking on the door - but nobody was there",
            "On a solo overnight trip in the Sierra (north of Yosemite but south of Tahoe) whilst descending to a river I found a pile of animal carcasses. Dead center of the trail in a spot by said river where the trees thinned out a bit, just a grosteque smelly splay of dead animals. It's hard to say how many \"complete\" animals there were given the state of them. Some bones and limbs scattered around, but the primary pile consisted of animal skeletons, a couple of elk (I don't know my game animals but one seemed kinda fresh, one was certainly not), and one last animal that was so rotted and falling apart that I can only say I think it was a horse. It was huge.\n\nI don't know if it was a bad call or not but I kept going and spent the night at my destination. I've kinda presumed it was a mountain lion, but I don't know enough about how they hunt. I thought it was strange that these carcasses were clustered cause they had to have been dragged there right? And a horse? Not a huge horse by any means but without a doubt bigger than the elk or whatever game that was.\n\nAt any rate I was definitely uneasy the whole time, and ended up adding a few miles so that I could take a different trail out. Was very spooped.",
            "I used to work nights at a hostel. It was pretty lonely most nights, quite and dark. But now and then I had to run and fix stuff or help someone. \n\nOne time, maybe at three in the morning, I had to go get some tools from the workshop, where Ralph, the handyman, had his headquarters. You had to leave the hostel to get to the place and it sat In a long dark corridor. I used my key to enter and opened the door. It was pitch black in there. And then I heard freaking kids singing! Like small children. Straight out of a horror movie! I freaked out! \n\nThen I remembered the Ralph had rigged the electricity to the door and when you opened it the radio came on. For some reason there was some creepy kids singing on the radio at three In the morning, weird, but atleast they weren't going to murder me.",
            "One night I was driving out on a remote country round and it was snowing pretty heavily. I got a call from my mom telling me to get home as there was a pretty large blizzard and the roads were only going to get worse. At a \u201cT\u201d in the road I went to make a turn only to see someone standing in the middle of the road in a light hoodie. With no houses around for about a half mile, I\u2019m not sure why anyone would be walking out in a blizzard. As I swerved past, the person didn\u2019t flinch and looked right into my window. However it was too dark to make out a face. It stopped snowing shortly after I got home and the next day I went back out to the road to see if I could find any traces. I could clearly see my car tracks, but there were no footprints anywhere. It definitely could have been some kook out for a late night hike, but it was still pretty creepy.",

We'd teach three big classes each year, and then take them down to the Florida Keys for their Open Water check out.\n\nBarracuda were the creepiest ... they'd hang out just at the edge of visibility, watching you.  If you moved toward them, they'd back off.\n\nIf you ever dropped something or stirred up anything that looked like food, a few would dart in fast as lightning to snap it up.\n\nThen they'd go back to hovering on the edge of visibility where you could barely see them.\n\nFlipping barracuda, man.",
            "This is probably be buried here, I seem to be late to the party. I used to make furniture on an old farm in the English countryside. Not that remote compared to others in this thread but as remote as you get in England while still being on a farm. I used to work long fucking hours because it was my own company. The building was just a converted cowshed with machines in it.\n If I knew I was going to be very late, I would go down to the gate at the roadside and lock myself in. I didn't want anyone driving in there at night.\n I did that one evening and at about 1am (working to a deadline) I could see car lights through the shutters. I thought it was weird because I was sure I locked myself in. But before the car even came to a halt someone started hammering the fuck out of the shutter. This made me jump and I took a moment to chill out. The person was still banging on the shutter but as I turned off the machine and walked to the entrance I was more pissed off.\n The person stopped just as I was opening the shutter, no person, no car, nothing other than the dark quiet night.\n Decided I'd fuck off home and miss the work deadline. Sure enough, the gate at the roadside was locked.",
            "I am a Structural Engineer and do routine in-service bridge inspections.  Basically after I-35W collapse, every bridge in the US needs to be inspected every 2 years, so I get to go to remote places where people dont expect other people to go, both in the city and out in the boonies... I have found knives that were suspicious, countless homeless camps, drugs, bones, porn stashes, all sorts of crazy things that people hide.  \n\n\nOne that stands out to me though:  It was an inspection on a tub girder bridge, and we actually have to climb into the tub girders and walk through them to look for cracks.  Creepy in the first place.  Theres a hatch at either end and the DOTs are very careful to make sure they are padlocked, but this one wasnt because it was rather new.  Well, we open the hatch and climb in (we do this in teams for many safety reasons) and it smells, and I mean STINKS in here.  There is some ventilation, but this is not a space that the steel fabricators meant for people to be.  Well we start walking and inspecting, but the smell keeps getting worse and worse. The 'turd covered in burnt hair' smell from Anchor Man comes to mind.  Well after walking for about 10 minutes, we find what the smell was... A (assumed) homeless person had started a fire INSIDE of the tub girder and it appeared they were planning to cook some sort of dead rodent as it was on a stick.  Well with the bad ventilation, they must have been quickly smoked out and they just left the dead animal along with clothes and random belongings.  \n\nSo we covered our noses as best we could and continued.  The tub girders have stiffiners in them so this thing is divided up into 'rooms' with little doors to climb through like what you see on submarines.  Well we came upon the previous occupant's 'bathroom' section, and decided to turn around and call it a day.  We got a ladder and went in from the other side, knowing full well where we left off.  \n\nWe made notes of the situation for the sorry sucker that has to inspect it next time, and crossed our fingers it isnt us.",
            "We live in a remote campsite for a mine construction crew in  sub saharan Africa. One night after a long, endless day i got the feeling i was being watched while i was walkin from the car park to the housing unit. I fell into deep sleep soon as i hit the sack. I didnt even wash the days grime off of me nor did i even take my shoes and clothes off. I just fell into bed.\nAnyway, i was jolted awake by crazy, hair raising screaming. Like someone was being stabbed or something. I was scared shitless but at the same time i felt i had to help. Grabbed my torch and hammer and walked out the unit and creeped towards the noise. The screaming stopped as i got closer. For some reason this scared me even more. I loosened my grip on the hammer when i realised my knuckles skin were stretched tight and prepareed for whatever may come. What i saw and heard will forever haunt me.\nI heard the crunching of bones, the drip drip drip of what could only be blood. Still couldnt see anything.\nI circled the car park and stopped dead in my tracks. There was the back half of a large Impala with its guts spilled out and a trail of blood and crap leading behind my car. I crept up around the car and peered. Four large wild dogs were munching on the other half of the animal. Their eyes glowed red, their blood matted fur and soubds together with the earlier feeling of being watched sent chills down my spine. I dont know how i was able to sneak back to the housing unit unnoticed. I checked the doors and windows and for some reason fell right back into deep sleep. Hammer in hand.",
            "I don\u2019t really work in remote areas, but my job takes me to places people don\u2019t see.\n\nI am an insurance adjuster. I had a claim at a hospital\u2014they knew they had a claim when they could smell sewage from the operating theater. \n\nTurns out it was a burst sewage pipe...in July...in Texas. By the time I got there they had already vacuumed out the majority of the sewage and spread lye/lime. I had to go down into the crawl space and get photos of the burst pipe in order to determine how it happened. \n\nI get in a full Tyvek suit with a respirator. The clearance is about 3 feet and there\u2019s pipes everywhere. So I\u2019m crawling around like Catherine Zeta Jones in The Entrapment (also an insurance adjuster), I\u2019ve got gnats flying into my mouth around the gap in the respirator on my nose. I *hate* bugs. I\u2019ve gotta go like 100 or so feet to get to the burst pipe. As I get deeper in there I glance at one of the foundation walls with my flashlight. It\u2019s glistening. I figured it\u2019s water, but if that much is pouring in\u2014that could be relevant. So I crawl closer.\n\nDid I mention it was still wet from the sewage down there? So everytime my knee or hand moved to a new position it sunk into the wet formally poopy dirt. \n\nAs I get closer I realize the glistening on the wall isn\u2019t moving down as it would with gravity. I get closer still.\n\nAll of a sudden it clicks. The entirety of the foundation wall is covered in cockroaches. \n\nLong story short, it was a shitty (pun intended?) Chinese iron pipe. The insurance company paid for new clothes and I billed the time it took me to take a shower and drown what I saw with booze. \n\nDespite that story, none of it comes close to the horror you can walk into while inspecting low rent apartment complexes."

            "Well, well, well.... Its about time, thank you reddit for asking, Iv been waiting for this exact question.\nThe answer is, we all want better interpersonal relationships, since seeking the approval we miss/missed through past/current social environments in life. It doesn't matter if its within the household, or within the workplace. Often when it comes to specific porn presenting someone that holds a taboo role, you want to be validated by that someone, you want to strengthen the relationship you feel could be stronger. You also desire to be shown unconditional love and support by the person you're fantasising about, but even so, it's all about  those who were caregivers to you in the past (mum) (dad) (unsexy, yep I know) and not because they are amazingly hot. Instead, it's because you feel like  a worthless peice of shit who doesn't deserve atleast one interaction with that person which validates you as a unique human being.  instead, you fear it's at personal cost to yourself, IRL, that's why it suppresses. This may  not be secure if you otherwise deterred them as the worthless peice of shit you know yourself to be. Nobody likes it if you challenge them/balance challenges and roles of the people who prevent you from having personal  expectations and Bounderies. You prefer your mind where for a moment you hold the power and love.\n\nHentia is same deal diff colour of people. \n\nYou're suppressed and trying to use porn as a psychological tool to rienforce why you felt your childhood was dirty, and why it means you are too. it's a psychological form of self harm for those who grew up with cartoons being part of their childhood routine on a much more frequent basis. You also like to imagine yourself as a harsh and cruel individual but Hentia helps you find ethical reason and solution. N you want to be loved. \n\nSelf awerness around why we do the weird shit we do.\n\n\n (don't forget the unconditional love).",
