            "Not sure if anyone\u2019s said this, but The Last Unicorn. Everything from the animation to the characters is stellar, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever watched an animated movie that\u2019s made me feel the same way as The Last Unicorn does.",
            "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind for me.  The intricacy of Miyazaki's worlds is always fascinating, and I just love Nausicaa herself so much.  As well as the tightly constructed plot, the majesty of the Ohmu... Such a great movie.",
            "Meet the Robinsons, Disney movie. I fell in love with it as a child. I have been ridiculously depressed lately and I was going to watch something else on Netflix but saw they had it on here and immediately started crying so I put it on. Cried throughout the entire thing. Just before I was about to quit on myself entirely, that movie told me to KEEP MOVING FORWARD. \"You learn from mistakes, successes... Ehhh not so much\". Was a great reminder and definitely a favorite.",
            "I have a few.\n\n\"Your Name\" is a fantastic piece of art - visually breathtaking.\n\n\"Song of the Sea\" is another gorgeous animated piece: purely magical story rooted in Irish mythology. The art style is a little different and beautiful, and the sound design is also fantastic. \n\n\"The Breadwinner\" is another example of beautiful storytelling filled with empathic characters and realism, telling a difficult story through the eyes of a child. \n\nAll three of these are kind of \"mood movies\" for me, for when I want to feel extra emotional.",
            "*Loving Vincent* is the first (and to my knowledge only) full length film where every frame is an oil painting. It's about a guy who goes to the town in Southern France where Vincent van Gogh was living and tries to figure out how he died. Amazing movie all around. I'm pretty sure that counts as animation.",

            "Has no one said Kubo and the Two Strings yet? Beautiful stop motion film from Laika, who created Coraline, Paranorman, etc. Not even addressing the brilliant story, themes and music in Kubo, the animation alone is just incredible. The skeleton model was 16ft tall and they created new techniques for things that had never been put to stop motion before, such as huge rolling waves in the ocean (done with cloth over a rig iirc). Some of the faces were 3D printed even. It's honestly one of the most elegantly told stories I've ever seen put to screen and it's combined with the best stop motion animation I've ever seen. It's incredible.\n\n'\n\nPlease, next time Laika produces a film, go see it; they are independent and each one of their films has brought in less and less despite the quality going up and up. Kubo only barely brought in 78mil against a 60mil budget. Their most recent film, Missing Link, didn't even make back a quarter of its budget.\n\n'\nStop motion as a medium is really rare already, and to have it be done so well is utterly unheard of. I would hate to see Laika go down like this.",

            "Broke my belly button over eating at a company lunch, went from an innie to an outie (Hernia). Put off going to the doctor for a few weeks before going to see a specialist. Hernia doc said yep its a hernia we're in a pandemic we can schedule you for whenever if you want to wait a bit there shouldn't be any problems no hurry. I decided to get it out of the way they had a cancelation so I scheduled for a week later. I wake up from surgery and the Doc says there was a complication they didn't get to the Hernia when they were going in they noticed my appendix was about to explode so they took that out instead (still not the tactical nuke). I asked about when they could fix the hernia he said the appendix looked funny and was going to send it to the lab and get back to me. The lab was really backed up from the pandemic so several weeks later I get a call from the doc. It was a really rare appendix cancer something that happens to around 1000 Americans a year, not only that but of the 2 kinds of appendix cancer based on lab work I had the worst of the 2, the kind that spreads everywhere really fast and cuts your lifespan down considerably even with treatment. The 1st kind grows slow and stays put but every once in awhile it will go into overdrive differentiates, pokes out of the abdominal wall and spits cancer slime everywhere that turns whatever it touches into more cancer. The cut off for it turning from good into the bad kind is 1 cm tumor, mine as 1.5 cm, under the microscope it had differentiated and they saw the cells that spit cancer slime had formed. There's really only one treatment referred to as the mother of all surgeries which is it's own ball of tactical nukes. I stew over that for a few weeks till they can get more tests scheduled (still in pandemic so it takes awhile). Go in for a barrage of scans, poking's and prodding's and the scans are all clean no signs of cancer spread (mostly). It had just turned from the slow growing kind that stays put into the fast moving kind and hadn't had a chance to spit cancer slime outside the wall holding my appendix if I had waited just a week for the hernia surgery, literally everyday that I waited  would have exponentially increased the odds of it spreading the mucin. They think they got it all when they took the appendix out. There's a few things they want to keep an eye on that they're reasonably sure is just scaring from the surgery but they gave me an 80% chance of being cancer free. I have more scans in December to make sure.\n\n\nUpdate Dec.30: My scans in December came back great. The thing they were keeping an eye on got smaller not bigger which is what they would expect if it was scar tissue from the surgery and not a tumor. Although not completely out of the woods (they're still going to do routine scans for the next 5-6 years) pretty much every scan is expected to improve my odds. I get to do the hernia surgery in 3 months, my oncologist will be there to take a look in case the surgeon see's anything weird while he's in there",
            "After a night of partying a bunch of us wanted to go watch the sun come up at a local beach when we had just graduated HS.

A few of us said no let\u2019s watch it from the deck, but he Said he was sober enough.\n\n I just had a bad feeling and a bunch of us stayed back and slept it off at the house. \n\nWe were all woken up a few hours later about 8:00 to phone ringing off the hook, cops, and freaking out parents. (Pre cell phone days) \n\nThey were in a really bad single car rollover accident. 4 of 6 dead. No one wearing seatbelts.

            "Throwaway. And I've posted this on r/creepyencounters before using a different throwaway I've since forgotten the password for, if it sounds familiar. \n\nAround the time I turned 30 (2010), I lost a large amount of weight. While I'd previously always looked my age or older, I suddenly looked to be about 5 - 10 years younger than I actually was. I started hanging out in Allston, an area of Boston known for its nightlife, often with people in their early-to-mid twenties.\n\nThere was a guy who also hung out down there who who really stood out. I never saw him in the bars, just walking down Brighton Ave. or North Beacon Street, usually carrying a gym bag, always alone. Unlike most understated Bostonians, he dressed in a very \"eurotrash\" sort of way. He had a light olive complexion with smooth skin and dark hair, which he wore slicked back.\n\nWhat I remember most vividly is that every time I saw him he was wearing reflective aviator sunglasses, so I never got a look at his eyes.\n\nI thought of him as \"Aviator Dude.\" Enjoying my new confidence, I decided to try to befriend Aviator Dude. \n\nThe first few times I tried to make eye contact, I got exactly zero response. No acknowledgement whatsoever. I suspected he was unfriendly and not interested, but maybe he just didn't see me. I wasn't done trying yet.\n\nFinally, one day in early autumn 2010, Aviator Dude and I stood across the street from each other, waiting for a light to change so we could each cross. I decided that this was my chance.\n\nAs the light changed to the \"walk\" signal, I made direct eye contact with him. I gave him a flirty smile... and then I winked at him.\n\nI immediately regretted this decision.\n\nAviator Dude stopped dead in his tracks. His jaw dropped a little bit, then his lips hardened into a sneer. I didn't need to see past the aviators to know that his face had twisted with disgust.\n\nMore than a bit taken aback, I kept walking past him. I looked back at him briefly. Aviator Dude was still standing there, in the middle of the intersection of North Beacon and Cambridge streets, staring at me with a disgusted look on his face. He shook his head, rang his hands, and walked on, muttering under his breath.\n\n*Well, okay, then.*\n\nAbout five years later, I saw Aviator Dude again, but not in person. In 2015, I was watching the trial of the Boston Marathon Bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, online via Twitter and the news updated in real time. Some of the evidence presented included photographs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older brother who was killed in a shootout with police.\n\n I immediately recognized him - Tamerlan Tsarnaev was Aviator Dude. Not only was he a radicalized murderer responsible for the worst terrorist attack in Massachusetts history, one of the points brought up repeatedly by the surviving marathon bombing suspect's defense lawyers was that Tamerlan was abusive to those weaker than him, including and especially the women in his life. A domestic violence charge regarding an ex-girlfriend held up his US citizenship application, and his widow's college friends testified that they heard him getting verbally abusive and throwing furniture at her. It has been speculated that the man may also have been responsible for a triple homicide in suburban Waltham in September of 2011- about a year after the events described above.\n\nI'm really glad he rejected me.",

            "I have some acres of woodland that I take care of with a chainsaw to keep a desirable mix of tree species and avoid overcrowding. Often when I cut through the trunk of a tree that\u2019s too close to other trees, it just leans against them rather than falling down. Then I have to make a series of angled cuts and let chunks of the trunk slide off, more or less vertically, onto the ground. Eventually, the trunk winds up vertical enough that I can push it toward a clear space and complete the process of felling the tree.\n\nWell, a couple years ago, I was getting to that point. Tree was basically vertical, a few thousand pounds of wood balanced on its end, reaching thirty feet up. I made another cut, and the rest of the trunk slid down off the 3 feet or so of trunk that I\u2019d separated it from at the base. And then it started to lean. That sucker was coming down.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t going the direction I\u2019d planned. No big deal, just move out of the way. Except I\u2019d gotten careless and left a bunch of branches down there at my feet and I was disturbed to find that my legs couldn\u2019t move. I was stuck rooted to that spot, which was very close indeed to the way the tree was moving. It wound up just nicking my head on its way down. Another few inches and it would have done a lot more than that.\n\nI\u2019m always very careful to make sure the ground is cleared of branches when I do this now.",

            "24 years old, had a pesky sore on my tongue that was really bothering me. My boyfriends dad was a dentist so when I was over at his house one night I asked him to take a look. He recommended I go see an oral surgeon the next day for him to check it out. The next day I decided it was feeling better so I tried to cancel my appt but my boyfriend\u2019s dad insisted I go. I went, and the oral surgeon pretty much diagnosed it as cancer on the spot. It was aggressive and by the time of my surgery to remove it it had already spread to multiple lymph nodes. They ended up removing over half my tongue followed by chemo and radiation. Given how aggressive it was, I often think that if I had put off the doctors visit any longer I probably wouldn\u2019t have survived. I\u2019m coming up on my 10 year anniversary in January",
            "I was driving home from visiting my brother in Vermont when a snow storm started.  I didn't have much experience driving in serious snow and I completely lost control.  Car careened off the road and I was heading for a giant boulder at around 50 or 60 mph.  I felt time slow down and I reflected on my life for a moment and then said goodbye to my body.  Suddenly, I was jolted out of it by an abrupt impact, but I could see that the boulder was still 20 or 30 feet away.  When I got out of the car, I saw that I had hit a little skinny tree that I could have easily grabbed with one hand.  However, it had a giant root system that lifted the car off the ground and stopped me.  Car was totaled, but I was completely fine because of that little tree.  There is no way I would have survived the other impact.",

            "This happened before cellphones existed.\n\nI had a long commute home and on a rare occasion my husband drove into the city to meet me. I started for home about fifteen minutes before he did. On the stretch of Highway 101 that I needed to be on for about twenty miles, there was a big rig in front of me that seemed to be driving erratically. I got this weird feeling and just moved over to the next lane and accelerated past him. In my rear view mirror, I saw the big rig run over the car in front of him, flip to it's side crushing the cars in the next lane (where I had just been). \n\nMy husband was behind the accident and as the police were letting cars file past in single file, he saw one of the crushed cars had a red bumper. He got home a couple of hours after me and said he'd never been so happy to see my red car in the driveway. That he'd been holding his breath as he turned down our street because he really expected me to be under the big rig.",

            "I had some chest pains one night and woke up my wife to tell her.  She got a little scared that it might be a heart attack and we agreed that I should go to the ER. The nurses were pretty sure it was a false alarm but would run an EKG as is common practice. In my head I was hoping that the chest pain would come back, not to prove a heart attack, but so that we can find out what the chest pain was. The EKG was done by one veteran nurse and a new nurse. I was watching over their shoulders. Something was flashing on the screen that made both nurses look at each other with disbelief. They ran it again and one nurse went out to the station for help. The other stayed with me and very nicely told my wife and daughter to go back out to the waiting room. A few seconds later 5-6 more people came into the room slowly and calmly and began prepping me for something.  It turns out that I was having my second heart attack that night in the ER. The doctors and nurses found an obstruction in my heart and were prepping me to have it cleared and a stent placed. When I got out of surgery, the doctor who placed the stent told me \u201cyou probably picked the best time and place to have a heart attack, right here in the ER\u201d\n\nedit: Thank you to everyone for the upvotes and awards.  If anything, this has taught me not to take your health for granted and get yourself checked out if you're not feeling well.\n\nedit#2: The funny bullet I dodged during this event was that the doctor told me that when they put in the stent, they can go one of two ways.

My brother and I thought it was awesome he paid us any attention since we were younger than the students he worked with for his job but he still took time for us. He had a parish which we\u2019d visited, multiple car issues in which we occasionally would have to walk somewhere, plenty of opportunities where we weren\u2019t in public. He took another job a couple years into this at a different church and was arrested shortly after for child molestation.

It was on nuclear fusion history and technology, and he was an expert in the field, and it was a really interesting and challenging elective.

All of them were graduate students, and at least two worked with the professor at the side company he had founded.  \n  \nAs the year progressed, as I tried to figure out where I was going after I graduated, the professor offered me a spot in his graduate program and a job at his company.

            "Back in ~2004, when I was only 20y/o, I was on a road trip with my friend (& her dog) from California to Washington. I was on I-5 north at around 1:00am, using my cruise control to keep my speed at 75mph (speed limit is 70mph). \n\nI\u2019d gotten speeding tickets in that part of Northern California before (I was familiar with this drive because my b/f was in LA and I lived in Seattle - so I made that trip a few times a year for a few years). All that is to say, I had learned my lesson and used cruise control to keep myself from speeding. Never going more than 5 over the posted speed limit. \n\nSo it\u2019s pitch black, early morning. My friend has her seat reclined all the way, taking a nap on the passenger side, her dog on her chest. \n\nI see what I assume to be lights from a cruiser come up behind me. The car slowly pulls along side me, and matches my speed exactly. I kept my eyes straight ahead but I knew this person was staring at me. I wasn\u2019t panicking tho, not like I had in the past when I\u2019d encountered a cop on I-5, because I knew I wasn\u2019t *really* speeding. \n\nI kept glancing at the speedometer to assure myself I was good. I may have even slowed down a notch or two, to be certain.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of this cruiser just keeping pace with me, he finally slows down, swerves in behind me, and puts his lights on. \n\nAs I\u2019m slowing down and pulling off to the shoulder, I nudge my friend awake and tell her I\u2019m getting pulled over. She asks if I was speeding (she knew my history) & I assured her I was not, and had been using cruise control. I was really starting to shake by this point. Cops make most people nervous, but something just didn\u2019t *feel* right about this stop. I knew there was no reason to pull me over. \n\nPitch black, middle of NOWHERE, hadn\u2019t seen a gas station or rest area for miles. The guy strolls up to the passenger side of my car as my friend is using the lever to get her seat upright again. When he finally gets to the passenger side window, he looks visibly surprised that I have a passenger. He begins to fumble over his words, claims that I was going 90mph. He was so damn flustered he forgot to ask for my license. I actually *asked him* if he needed it. \n\nHe trots back to his car and my friend and I look at each other like, WTF? Her dog, btw, was going absolutely apeshit during this entire interaction. I never saw that dog act like that before or after this happened. \n\nNow remember: I\u2019d gotten a few tickets on that same stretch of road, within that same year or two. I was very familiar with this process and knew how long it should take and what to expect. In my previous experience, most cops go back to their cruisers for a good 6-8minutes. \n\nThis guy came back after about 2 minutes. Kinda tossed my license and registration into my friend\u2019s lap, like he was annoyed, and yelled at me to slow down and told me he\u2019d just give me a verbal warning for now. I thanked him, despite how creepy it was, and while I was putting my license back in my wallet and registration back in my glove compartment, he fired up his cruiser and floored it back onto the highway. This is also NOT normal. Any time I\u2019d been pulled over, they would always tell me to pull out ahead of them, so they could make sure I merged carefully back onto the freeway. \n\nMy friend and I were freaked. She was more freaked than me, I think I was trying to explain it away, give him the benefit of the doubt, at first. But the longer I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I became. I couldn\u2019t shake that nasty feeling that something wasn\u2019t quite right. \n\nFast forward many years later, I remember hearing about some cop that had been arrested. He\u2019d been trolling I-5 N in Northern California (during that same time period I\u2019d been on road trips), stopping unsuspecting young single female motorists, and sexually assaulting them in his cruiser. His M.O. was to pull up alongside their cars, scan them to make sure they were single females, and pull them over in desolate areas at early morning hours. He ended up murdering one of these girls when she put up too much of a fight. I can\u2019t remember his name and I don\u2019t know what he looked like, it was too dark to see his face well. But my blood turned cold when I\u2019d heard that. Definitely dodged a huge nuclear life-changing (possibly life-ending) event thanks to my tired friend and her protective little dog.\n\nEDIT: I did not expect my inbox to explode over this! I am doing my best to reply to the comments, but maybe an umbrella edit is easier:\n\nMany of you are saying that you know this case from Forensic Files.. the case I believe you\u2019re referring to is from the 80\u2019s and happened in San Diego. So, this was an entirely different cop that I encountered.\n\nAs I stated above, I didn\u2019t see the guys face. He wasn\u2019t close enough to the side of my car thanks to my friend\u2019s dog (not only that, I got the impression he was trying to make sure his face remained out of view). I have done some light googling today to see if I can pin point this situation better and find an actual news article to point to and say, \u201cit\u2019s probably this guy!\u201d But I haven\u2019t been able to find any such thing (yet).\n\nPart of the problem might be because I got the year wrong. I said 2004, because to the best of my estimation that\u2019s when I believe this happened. That being said, it\u2019s possible that it happened as early as late 2002/early 2003 or as late as 2007/2008. I made so many trips to and from CA <-> WA and that friend of mine joined me a 2-3 of those times, so I\u2019m not 100% sure what year this took place. \n\nAnother problem? I also don\u2019t know exactly where, either. I say I-5 N in Northern CA, it\u2019s a big long state. There are a few good long desolate stretches along that highway that are pitch black at night, for miles. They always blurred together for me before, especially at night. But if I had to guess? This happened somewhere in the abyss before or after Redding, CA. \n\nScary thing I have discovered today: there are a sickening amount of stories just like this in the news, old and new.\n\nLast: thank you for all of these awards, completely unexpected and super appreciated. \nI seldom open Reddit up in the morning and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even commented on a Reddit post before 8pm. Today, when I saw that question, this memory from that road trip flooded me and I just shared it with exactly zero expectations for any response, let alone this. Stay safe out there! \n\nPRO TIP (thanks to those commenting):\nIf you ever find yourself alone on the highway, getting pulled over by the police and you feel in any way, shape, or form uncomfortable pulling to the shoulder, slow your car down, turn on your hazards, and call 911 (if you have no service, just keep driving until you do). Inform them of your predicament, they will relay this to the cop behind you who will gladly follow you to the safe place of your choosing to make a stop. Moreover, a 911 dispatcher will also be able to warn you that there\u2019s no cop in that location, which means you should keep driving and wait for the real police to arrive.",

            "My manager was trying to have me fired for underperformance, and I was so depressed at the time that I believed I was an awful employee\n\nThe place I work has a whole song and dance routine just to get someone a verbal warning, let alone fired, so she tried to get me to take a severance payment so that I'd leave and save her the trouble. I had to take sick leave shortly after that conversation, and while I was gone, she initiated the formal process to have me fired. I was able to drag things out for a couple of months, and during that time, I discovered she'd falsified documents to make me look like a lost cause. Presenting a dossier to HR demonstrating her statements were provably misleading, and documenting every time she failed to follow proper procedures turned everything around. I got moved to a better job on a better team, and spent a solid year rubbing it in her face how well I was doing, and ensuring it got back to her whenever I got praise from the department head.\n\n\nIt was pretty annoying that she didn't get fired, but there would have been too much blowback on management if she had. \n\nStill, I went from the verge of unemployment to unequivocal success",

            "**Nuke #1:** Being in a head-on car crash just 4 days ago. A car was passing 2 vehicles (including an 18-wheeler) on a 2-lane road, at night, with a double-yellow line, and was headed straight for us. My husband was driving, and he swerved off the road to avoid the collision. We missed being hit literally by inches. Thankfully, the other guy didn't also swerve or he still would have hit us, and the shoulder of the road just happened to be somewhat level where we ended up.\n\nI can only imagine how many people would have died if not for my husband's quick reflexes and sheer dumb luck. Of course, I'm having *yet another* panic attack just thinking about it.\n\n**Nuke #2, not me but my husband:** He and I were attending a local trade show, but he had to be there earlier than me so we arrived separately. During the show, he said he wasn't feeling well and was going home. At the same time, I was approached by someone who wanted to talk to me, so I told him I would be a few minutes behind him but I would see him at home.\n\nWhen I got home, he wasn't there. I called his cell phone, but got no answer. I called his office, but he wasn't there and no one there had seen him. I was frantic.\n\nAbout an hour later, I finally get a call from his cell phone, and it's a doctor from a clinic between the site of the trade show and our house (we both had been to this clinic before when we lived in that area prior). He said I needed to get to the clinic right away, my husband was there and he'd tell me more when I got there.\n\nTurns out, my husband started feeling extremely sick on the way home from the trade show, so he pulled over on the side of the road, in hopes that I would see him there on my way home and stop. He sat there for a few minutes waiting, but I never showed up and he felt like he was going to lose consciousness. Then he remembered that clinic, which was just a couple of blocks away, so he drove himself there and stumbled in.\n\nWhen he arrived in the clinic, he was in full anaphylactic shock from an allergic reaction to a medication that had recently been prescribed to him. They rushed him back and the doctor began working on him immediately. The doctor told me when I got there that if my husband had not shown up at the clinic when he did, he most likely would have died in his car waiting for me on the highway. Fortunately, they got some epinephrine in him just in time to save his life.\n\nEdited to add: Nuke #2 happened back in the days when cell phone use wasn't particularly widespread. If I'd had a phone, which I did not, all of this probably would never have occurred. Needless to say, I got a phone shortly after this incident, and my husband got an epi pen, just in case.",

I put it on the only credit card I had and it wasn't a long time before I felt the effects of interest. I worked at Starbucks, making a measly 9 dollars an hour, but quickly started jumping to jobs that paid more. I also had to pay off the loan monthly, and a car note. Thankfully I lived with my parents but I was paying nearly 1000 a month in loan, debt, and bills.\n\nI averaged 8 months at each job, going from Starbucks to Target to loading UPS Planes to eventually working at whole foods and amazon at the same time. The whole foods manger worked out a beautiful schedule for me where I worked 11am to 7pm and then worked at amazon from 8pm to 1am. \n\nDuring this entire time I had a girlfriend who was also studying but she never seemed to grasp the stress that I was in. When I started working at Amazon and Whole Foods her only response was \"What about me?\" \n\nAnyway, one night I'm leaving the amazon facility and decide to skip chit chat with a coworker because I'm exhausted and I really wanted to go home. I get to my car, pull up to the stop sign, make that left turn and get hit by some kid who was speeding in his moms Nissan Altima. It was a dark warehouse road with no street lights and they were going well above 90mph. Their car flipped over the divider, mine spun out like 5 times, hitting theirs again while I was spinning. All I remember is seeing the car go dark and gripping the wheel. When I came to, I had to crawl out the passenger seat before I realized something was wrong with my knee and my shoulder. I get taken to the hospital, get told I need surgery, etc etc etc. My girlfriends visits me and keeps me company. I cried a lot when no one was around, thinking about what I was going to do. \n\nI eventually get sent home in a wheel chair. The first night I'm home my girlfriend comes to visit and says she wants to take me for a walk (lol). She pushes my wheelchair to a bench a block from my house and tell me she needs to know if we're going traveling in the next 6 months or not, because for her it's mandatory. It's a need for her. It's something we've talked about before my accident but it's never been posed before as an ultimatum like this. At first I'm taken aback, trying to collect myself, then I pretty much told her to look at the situation I'm in. Yeah, I'd fucking love to go traveling but it isn't in the cards right now for me. If she needs that, she can find someone who can do that. She shuts right up. When she wheels me back my house, I tell her if she really wants that we can help her find a better paying job (I had two jobs paying me 15 dollars an hour, she can find one too). \n\nThat never happened. All she did was sit around and tell me that she doesn't feel like a priority and bring up traveling. Fast forward three months and I'm walking again, barely. I only work at whole foods now. One day she calls me to celebrate her completing therapy and we go get drinks and she tries to bring up traveling again. I just tell her how I feel overwhelmed with everything (my own debts and bills and then hospital bills) and this ends in an argument in her car with me telling her that it eats away at my self worth and makes me feel like shit. She apologized, got the water works, and we end the night. She calls me before bed and brings it up traveling again, this time begging.

            "I married my high school sweetheart when I was 23 and she was 21. We had been together for roughly five years at that time and were madly in love.\n\nWe were married in April and she announced in mid to late May that she was pregnant. She had taken a test with her friend after feeling sick. I was so happy and excited that I didn't take the time to ask to see the test - she had just thrown it away!\n\nFast forward a bit and she wouldn't let me attend doctor's visits and I gave her the benefit of the doubt for privacy and the such. But then she wasn't getting bigger at even the six month mark. I was suspicious and confronted her about it and she went off on me with the standard barrage of \"How could you?!\" and \"Don't you trust me?!\" And she pointed out some weight gain. I was skeptical but loving and supportive of my wife. She had a rough life growing up and I felt as if I needed to be more patient and understanding. I reminded her that I will help her find help if she's not really pregnant; that I would love and support her and we would work through it. She said it wasn't necessary.\n\nWifey started gaining weight more, especially in the belly so I kept going moving forward as if she was pregnant. We had a name picked out, a full wardrobe of the first three clothing sizes, a fully decked out bedroom, etc. My family was suspicious but still supportive.\n\nAround month 8 it was painfully obvious she was not pregnant. I had already found her ultrasounds on Google, the weight gain stopped (she had a pancreas issue that she couldn't even eat enough to gain much weight - she had to be making herself sick to gain), and our relationship was deteriorating fast.\n\nI was remarkably patient. The due date came and went and I asked what the doctor was saying: \"Oh it's ok - the baby can sometimes be up to two weeks past due!\" And I had my date. I gave it two weeks and then laid down the cold hard truth: Go to the hospital with me to see what's up with the baby/pregnancy or I'm gone right now.\n\nShe went. I was not allowed to go back with her (she requested the doctors do not share with me). Wifey had told the doctors that she was there for an issue related to her pancreas issues. Never mentioned the possible pregnancy. I was permitted to \"visit\" her in her room and I looked her in the eye and told her it was over.\n\nI took the bullet  - or rather shotgun blast from that issue. But I avoided being gaslit and manipulated for the rest of my life.\n\n**Edit: This blew up so I'm going to continue the story to the aftermath as I wrote in a couple of comments. Sorry for any formatting/continuity issues but I didn't want to edit the comments.** \n\nShe disappeared, took another man's name, and ran from the process server so I could not divorce her.\n\nWe're still legally married even though she lives as someone else's husband. I went through years of massive depression after this and I'm only just now in a financial and mental position to be able to finally solidify the divorce. That will be happening within the next year.\n\nShe also went around telling people that I lied, I'm a horrible person for abandoning her, and that I was abusive and it caused her to lose the baby. The day after I left she she came back to our house to gather things, attacked me, and then called the cops to say that I threw her to the ground. Luckily I knew enough not to be alone and had several witnesses to the situation.\n\nThat did not stop her from filing an emergency protective order to have me thrown out of our home after I had left her. She then emptied the house- all of which was paid for by me or brought to the relationship by me because she had nothing due to her situation growing up. I lost every heirloom, keepsake, and picture that I had saved from my childhood until I was \\~24.\n\nI lost it all. And to this day all I have to show for it is a reputation as an abuser and a severe distrust of relationships.\n\nI'm not OK. I still deal with the fallout from this on a daily basis sometimes. Check my other lengthy comment about the fallout and come back to this.\n\nI tried to leave the woman I dated after her. It took me 5 years to date again and the \"rebound' ended up getting pregnant early on. I tried to do the right thing and stick with her so my child would have two parents. She, too, ended up having mental health issues. Diagnosed while we were together. Hers showed in the form of child neglect and abuse. I ended up with full custody of my son (she hasn't seen him in two years!).\n\nThe fucked up part is that when I built my case and finally left the GF she reached out to ex wife to try to plot against me. They came up with a plan for my current GF to do the same thing that the wife did to me. She filed a false protective order, drained my house of all of my stuff (since GF didn't work..), and took my son and fled the state. GF said that I was regularly beating and raping her and my son. Luckily I had learned and had been keeping extensive records of everything to protect myself in the event that history repeated itself. I had records, messages, pictures, and witnesses the second time around.\n\nI've found it impossible to date since. I now have a reputation as an abuser and molester even though no charges were ever filed, the protective orders were thrown out of court with prejudice, and I won custody of my son from the 2nd relationship due to all of this.\n\nI won.

One day my friends all asked me if I wanted to go to the starlite since there was some overnight thing where he\u2019d be giving away free shit while you spent the night in the place basically. And to make a somewhat long story short, if you got any sort of prize he had touched you inappropriately. And I had two friends to vouch for that case as well. Whenever he\u2019d had you the prize he rub you all weird and shit after he gave it to you. He only recently got arrested for his actions surprisingly.

So I decided to get brave and flirt with this girl I liked.\n\nWe seemed to click, but I was too nervous to ask for her number just yet. She was planning to go to the LGBTQ center after the party to say hi, and I kept finding excuses to keep her there just a bit longer, until it feels right to ask.\n\nThe party wrapped up, and I kept chatting with her. Her friends already left and headed there... And I kept trying to find the right timing to ask for her number. We kept chatting for... 30? 40 minutes? Before I finally got the courage.

            "I wanted to start a business with some friends. It was 2018 and escape rooms were the new trend, so living near an university we expected to have a lot of customers. We found a place that seemed nice and we were ready to sign, it was near a bus stop, rent was high but affordable.\n\nAt first, we found a small bureaucratic irregularity, the real estate map wasn't up to date, and the old tenant left drywall walls. The agency told us that we could remove the walls or use part of them. I put my foot down and refused, asking them to give us what real estate map said. \n\nThe owner sent his construction workers to check our complaint. We hired a construction worker too and he found out the false ceiling was damaged and poorly repaired, and the ceiling was damaged too. According to the owner, the work costed 400\u20ac that they could discount from our second or third month of rent, he wanted us to sign a paper to commit to repair the place at our own expenses. I refused, my friends weren't that sure. Our worker said it costed 20.000\u20ac and maybe 3 months to remove the false ceiling, repair the ceiling and put a new false ceiling.\n\nAfter some blackmail from real estate agency (whose owner was the cousin of one of the involved friends), we finally refused to rent it. We couldn't find another place, the idea slowly faded, friendship ended for unrelated reasons, i couldn't find new business partners, and then covid hit. \n\nBeing on the hook for the rent of an unusable place and legally committed to pay whatever expense was necessary, with people who showed themselves unable to keep their word, and finally forcefully closed because of lockdown would have been unbearable.",
            "One time me and a couple buddies were staying over our friends step dads house. This friends older step brother was the stereotypical edge lord at the time blasting metal music playing WoW, and he liked to fuck with people. One of my friends made a comment he didn\u2019t like, so he had the idea to put a needle with a ball end inside of a BB gun. He thought pumping it one time to shoot one of us would be funny, but we all freaked out. Seeing how much it scared us, he decided to pump it 9 more times. All we could do stuck in this room with him was grab some pillows to try and protect ourselves (dumb in hindsight trying to stop a flying needle). He pulls the trigger while we are freaking out and we all look around to see who got hit. My friend turns around to see his twin brother have something sticking out of his back poking his shirt outwards. The needle had gone through the pillow obviously, and bounced around in his body nearing missing his Heart by millimeters. The dude didn\u2019t think about the results of shooting a needle directly at someone while the gun was pumped up so much. The needle bounced around in my friends chest about half a dozen times puncturing his lungs, esophagus, and almost his heart/artery before exiting his back partially. Friend had to go to the emergency room, and the older step brother faced criminal charges since he was 18 at the time and we were only 13. Friend ended up being fine, but it was an incredibly stressful situation to be in so young. And we didn\u2019t know how deadly that situation could have been if the gun was positioned a little different.",

            "Worked for a company years ago which had a rather autocratic head. They randomly appointed a new manager to oversee our team one day. He was swiftly promoted and the two of us would butt heads every other day to the point where I was made to look like a complete troublemaker (meanwhile I just pointed out inefficiencies and possible legal/regulatory abnormalities in their processes). His promotion, I would later learn, was due to his appointment having been aimed at restructuring the company to get rid of 'troublemakers' from the get-go. He was appointed to stir and eliminate.\n\nMyself and a few senior staff at the company were served with retrenchment notices. I was livid and wanted to take matters further, but the other 'retrenchees' told me to be patient. The staff who weren't retrenched refused to speak out or have our backs, they were pretty smug and feigned sympathy. For a moment I wanted to concede, give into their demands and beg to save my job and income, but luckily I didn't.\n\nThe CEO who retrenched the other seniors had bargained on majority shareholding as he'd assumed the other directors would sell their shares to him on exit (he had less than 50% at the time, and their shares will have secured his majority shareholding). He'd dangled a pretty juicy carrot in front of them. Instead, they collectively (and legally) sold/handed their shares to an opposition company and did so pretty stealthily. They did this months after I'd already left, so I wasn't there when the pawpaw hit the proverbial fan.\n\nThe retrenchment plan aimed at ousting us few to make a point and eliminate non-conforming staff backfired. I ended up with a pretty nifty settlement and given the nature of my exit I could immediately contact their direct opposition for a position. The staff who remained ended up under the employ of an international corporate entity - many had to accept demotions, pay cuts and/or were prompted to relocate. \n\nI won't have been in the same space in my career today had I grovelled and stayed on.\n\n**EDIT: grammar & spelling**",

TLDR at the bottom.  \n\n\n\\[**Context\\]**: *I'm a 40 year old Gay man, and this story takes place when I was about 22 years old.*  \n\n\nThis might date me here but I was browsing [Craigslist.Com](https://Craigslist.Com) 's personal adds. I was quite adventurous at that time, and I didn't have a boyfriend back then. So, I often looked for N.S.A. hook-ups.  \n\n\nI found a profile for a man only 3 years older than me (*we'll call* **Brad**) looking for N.S.A. \"passionate hugging\". He was cute, and if his dating profile was anything to go off of, we'd hit it off nicely.  \n\n\nSince I couldn't host, we agreed to meet at a neutral location in my city's downtown area. When I got there, I saw him talking with a group of 5 other guys in our age-bracket or so. I initially assumed they were his friends. Well, it *was* true to an extent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurious, I asked who the other men were. He explained they were with him to also hook up, and the night's activities would involve a group. I thought in that moment, \"Okay...not *totally* against this.\"\n\n  \nI signal that, while caught off guard, I would go along with them. We start walking in the opposite direction of where he'd said his car was parked. We are now walking through the far seedier section of our downtown's \"LGBT\" district. This place would've been sketchy to anyone - let alone to gay men. I asked what we were doing, and he said he was going to take a little bit to score some coke, meth, and heroin! He wanted to make it an unforgettable night. To quite a Youtuber, \"This was a Cold-War Era, Soviet Propaganda Parade of Red-Flags.\" I might have been only just comfortable with the group thing, but drugs? Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said that I wasn't going to go through with it, and despite how much it would cost I'd be taking a cab home (*Uber didn't exist yet*) . He grew dark, and grabbed me by the shirt. He said, I wasn't going anywhere. He said that, because we met, and there was evidence of our conversation that might be enough to get me brought up on charges should they get caught. I gulped, as this going so far south, people could charter expeditions to find it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore much else could happen, over his shoulder, I saw a familiar face get out of a car. It was someone I'd fooled around with before. I saw my ticket out of there. I called to the man (*Lets call him* **Ted***.)* I called out to Ted, and said, \"Hey honey, you're here early. I wasn't expecting you for another couple of hours.\"  \n\n\nTed first looked very bewildered, but once we made eye-contact he remembered who I was, and seemed to read I was in trouble.  \n\n\n\"(He sighs) Ugh. I know, and I would've been able to give you more time, but the client's car broke down on the 5, or something. So, boss sent me home early. Didn't you say you had a date with somebody? Is this him?\"  \n\n\nBrad, stammered, but just nodded that he was \"the guy\" I had intended to meet.   \n\n\nTed walked forward, and hugged me. \"Are you going to have fun?\" Ted asked. I replied, \"Yeah, but can we stop by the house I want to pick up a few things.

            "Better buckle up for this one. My boyfriend and his best friend came to pick me up from work one night. His best friend was in the drivers seat and my boyfriend was sitting in the passenger seat. It was a coupe so my boyfriend had to get out of the car to let me squeeze into the backseat. I was so freaking close to asking him if I can sit in the front instead (I get really bad carsick in the back no matter how short the trip, so I always ask for the front seat). But, I thought to myself our destination is only a block away so just let him have it. That\u2019s one of the last things I remember about that night. I woke up to people yelling and trying to pull me out of the car. When I got out, the car was barely recognizable. The entire thing was mangled and crushed except for the back seat where I was sitting. A drunk driver ran a red light at the intersection where we were driving and hit us. My boyfriend died instantly from the impact and his best friend was in a coma for almost a year. It\u2019s been 6 years and he never made a full recovery. Death isn\u2019t the only nuke I dodged that night, tho. When people were pulling me out of the car, I remember they had trouble getting the seat belt off of me. I thought that was fuckin weird since I NEVER wore seatbelts. Seriously, I absolutely refused. I told the people that was impossible and they said they unclicked the seatbelt themselves and the Police told me it was a good thing, since the seatbelt saved me from a lot of damage. They also asked me if I was drinking or distracted that night, which I wasn\u2019t drinking. But I do remember replying to a text when we were approaching that intersection(which again, I normally would NEVER do bc of car sickness). The police said because I wasn\u2019t aware of my surroundings and bracing for the impact, my body was kinda \u201cloose\u201d when the car hit us and that assisted in my body taking the least amount of resistance (I walked out with a bruise on my knee and that\u2019s about it).",

Apparently the neighbor was the nicest she ever had been and was saying stuff like \"look at you all soaked, come on inside and out of the wet and cold\". Saying other things like that to get her to come inside. My mom kept saying no and eventually left. Sometime briefly after that they were killed. So my mom told the cops this (and I believe the FBI showed up at one point a few weeks later), and they think that the killer was there behind the door and the neighbor may have been trying to get help. 10 or 11 years later, no one has been arrested and we still have no idea who did it",
            "This story is a twofer.\n\nMany years ago I was working on an oil rig up in the High Plains oil fields in northern Colorado and making the best money of my life.  Everything was going great until one night I looked up at the Kelly ( the large yellow piece of equipment that hold up the drill pipe ) and felt absolute mortal terror.  We are talking ice water down my spine and the cold finger of death up my ass at the same time.  I just knew that thing was going kill me.  I tried to talk myself past it for a couple of weeks, but one night I just couldn't take it anymore.  I knew I was gunna die, so I quit.  I ended up missing my both my car and rent payment, almost got evicted, ect.  My wife was Not Happy.\n\nTwo weeks later the main cable holding up almost a mile of drill pipe snapped loose, spun across the bottom of the Kelly and took the head off the man who had replaced me.  Literally there was not a piece of his head large enough to even pick up, they had to wash it off.\n\nThe twofer part??  My wife was PISSED that I had quit because she missed out on the insurance payout which was very high 6 figures.\n\nSo yeah, a twofer.... I dodged an untimely death, and divorced a complete bitch at the same time.",

            "My dad: came home from work complaining of chest pain one night. He wanted me to get Tums for him since we were out and showed me where the pain was (moving from the stomach up). I said no because I was a college teen who couldn\u2019t be bothered. \n\nRight after he left, I realized something was wrong and that he was actually having a heart attack, not heartburn (my best friend is a nurse and I remember her saying something about this a few weeks earlier). I drove fast to CVS and told him we have to go to the hospital ASAP. He refused and we went back and forth while I pleaded with him to let me call. \n\nA stranger (who just happened to be a DR) overheard our argument and said \u201csir, I\u2019m a DR and your daughter is 100% right. You have the symptoms of a heart attack\u201d. We drove to the hospital since it was a 5 minute drive and he didn\u2019t want an ambulance and they admitted him quickly because he was in fact having a heart attack. \n\nWish I could meet that man at CVS again. I think if I went to CVS instead of my dad, or if I didn\u2019t realize the symptoms, and if that man at CVS didn\u2019t hear us arguing, my dad would be dead right now.",

She would randomly blow up and mess up the entire mood frequently.\n\nOne time, she decided to lie about being pregnant and I could not even fathom being a father at the age of 20. Turns out she was just \"testing\" my loyalty because she already has one kid whose father just left her.\n\nWe broke up 6 months later.

I was going to do that, while I'm sure raising the baby mostly on my own, until the baby was old enough to go to school. I ended up having a miscarriage, and while devastated stayed in school. Over the next few years my boyfriend became an alcoholic, never did find employment, and got progressively more and more violent and abusive. I managed to get away from him. His family was my main support system, so I imagine that would have been so much harder if I'd have had his baby. I now have an amazing job that I love, am working on my masters in engineering, and have the kindest husband. Feels kind of dirty to say it, but thank God I lost that baby.",

He was caught with a man by his wife and disowned by his family , kids included. Well Jeremy my buddy wanted to get out as these guys were sketchy at best and didnt want to violate his probation by fighting or being caught up in nonsense. \n\nSo he moves out , well 2 weeks later i get a call from the police looking for him. A mutual friend gave them my number because his phone was off and he had moved into a place my buddy was renting out. \n\nWell the detective explains that the roommate was found dead and was in such bad shape that they couldnt even determine cause of death yet.(his roommate kept the place boiling like 80\u00b0 f and that sped up the decomp apparently)\nSo he asks where he is i tell him where he moved and explain that he moved out and i helped him 2 weeks ago. That i had helped and the guy was not even home when we did. As soon as i hang up the phone i hit the phone tree to track him down. He is at work with my buddy i got him a job with. I explain to him what happened and he start freaking out. He had committed an act of violence after he was discharged and a burnout vet with a violent past is a great suspect. He wants to run and i tell him thst would be incredibly dumb. They would find him and take an easy conviction.\n\nSo i drop him off at Police HQ, after the interview/interrogation is complete. Jeremy calls me for a ride. \n\nWell they were not looking for him as the killer but people he may have seen. They arrested 2 men in the guys new car he bought (2 months before Jeremy moved out)  They had pawned a bunch of things and had some of his cc cards on them. \n\nThey believe they came in at night through the garage where we used to hang out and drink and was always left open. Kicked in the door and murdered him and stole a bunch of shit. They believe they went room to room and if he had been there would have been murdered and robbed as well. \n\nLast i heard the guys were arrested and were awaiting charges. Im not sure how it ended but im sure they at least took a plea and are in Atmore now. \n\nJeremy finished probation and still works for my old friend as a pool guy.",

            "**Sacrifice**. I don't remember a lot of buzz about it. It is one of the most imaginative RTS titles in history. It came out late 2000, and I don't think there has been a game like it. Unlike most RTS titles, it played like a third-person RPG instead of a top-down isometric game. You personally controlled a unit, you would summon creatures and cast spells, get into direct combat with the opponent. The goal was to corrupt the altar of the enemy.\n\nYou play a wizard in service of one of a pantheon of gods. The campaign is well-told and imaginative - you show up after a catastrophe destroyed your reality (one that you might have caused) in some ethereal realm, and the gods there try to seduce you to their side. Every mission, you can choose to serve the same god or a different one (gaining new spells and summons each time - you essentially build your repertoire this way, similar to an RPG, since you keep your old selections). As war breaks out between the gods and they start dividing into factions, your options close off, until you are left serving the last god standing against a horrific foe.\n\nIt has some great voice acting (Tim Curry plays this god of air who constantly insults the earth god.) The game's visuals are insane, the world crafted using voxels that could show massive terrain destruction (one of the spells would transform a huge area of the map into a volcano and rain down massive flaming boulders that would break massive holes in the ground.)\n\nSadly it sold pretty poorly. It was ambitious, funny, ahead of its time. The UI really hurt the game, it's pretty awkward to play.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1Eiw90Lnh0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1Eiw90Lnh0)\n\n [https://www.gog.com/game/sacrifice](https://www.gog.com/game/sacrifice)",

            "There is a game I just recently heard of and immediately got on Switch. It's still quite new and definitely has more than a few bugs, but it's concept is so cool and the game itself is beautiful.\n\nIt's called Pine and the concept is that you are a human in a world where humans never made it to the top of the food chain. There are 6 main species on the island including the humans and basically everyone is stronger, smarter, and more well-established than you and your people.\n\nOne of the coolest things about the game is that it has an always-changing sort of political status among the different species. If you ally with the Fexels then the Litters will hate you because they hate the Fexels. You can join in fights or you can try to watch from a distance as a Carablin gatherer gets into a fight with a Gobbledew gatherer.\n\nThere's a main quest to follow, some puzzles, resource gathering, crafting, and combat.\n\nIt has elements that remind me of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but it does still have plenty of bugs and kinks to work out. The game developers seem to be active, one especially in the subreddit for the game, and take peoples' concerns very seriously so the game can run smoothly.\n\nEdited to add: Hey! So I see a wide mix of responses to this and a lot of people saying the game disappointed them. That\u2019s fine and I get that - especially if you played it right at release and not after the main patches like I did. I really enjoy the game despite the bugs I\u2019ve encountered personally. But I totally understand if other people don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to mislead anyone into thinking it\u2019s some perfect game but I truly enjoy the concept and I\u2019m willing to put up with the minor annoyances of the lagging and whatnot in order to play. If you give it a try I hope you enjoy it! If you don\u2019t then I\u2019m sorry I led you astray!",

            "I've talked about this game before, but I think it's very underrated for such an amazing game:\n\n\nBack in 2003 Bethesda came out with an RPG called \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" The game is not at all connected with the film series, aside from a few names here and there. Basically it was a pretty large world full of islands that you could explore as this guy named Nathaniel Hawk.\n\nYou could choose what kind of pirate you wanted to be based on your actions, like you could be a smuggler, a trader, a bloodthirsty swordsman, etc. They gave you skill points as you leveled up to put into things that would help you become the character you wanted to be. You could hire crews for your ships that would also fight at your side as you explored the islands and at sea. On the islands there were dungeons and caverns to explore where you would fight skeletons and get treasures and really great weapons.\n\nThe ship battles were fun, but they also gave you the option of avoiding them or doing them in a less involved way if that was not your thing. These battles would either be with other pirates or a country that you were not friendly with at the moment, because diplomacy also played a major role in your character. There were quite a few ships you could choose from too, and if you were a smuggler or trader you would rely on these ships to move cargo from one island to the other.\n\nThere was a main story of sorts, but it was a pretty open world filled with sidequests that allowed you to do your own thing. My biggest complaint was that the controls were a bit clunky, but you got used to them. I loved that game very much, and revisit it every few years, but not a lot of people I know have ever played it or even heard about it. \n\n[Here is a trailer of some of the gameplay if you're curious.](https://youtu.be/CBFoBZu_xq4)",

It's the first RPG I played where the player actually is \"themselves,\" and simply communicating with the main character through the game, complete with sneaky messages passed back and forth and antagonists reaching out to mess with the player.\n\nIt's truly a hidden gem, and I will sing its praises whenever I can.",

Except each game is distilled down to pure PVP action. Without the often boring early game of those two's creep/minion last-hitting farming phase. You are never in the situation where at 15-20 minutes mark your enemies have already clearly snowballed and won, yet they still toy with you 40 minutes more, like a cat with its mouse.\n\nAlso, each spell is a skillshot and they can all be dodged with WASD movement. And with certain heroes you can even reflect spells back to your enemies! Even their ultimates! Pretty fun. As you can imagine all of this means that the skill ceiling is pretty high.\n\nSome people claim that it's a bit harder for a new player to really feel like they get the hang of it. I don't quite remember, because my first game was a long time ago. But nowadays, especially with matchmaking finding you other noobs, I guess it cannot be too bad! You'll see how you fare after a few matches. They are not long either, around 10 minutes each. I recommend 5-10 games, and that might be enough to get the basics.

            "Pyre by SuperGiant games. It's probably their least played title but it is not only my favorite but might be one of my favorite games ever. \n\nThe art direction and character design are world class. The story is unique and inventive (not to mention the game doesn't end if you lose but the story changes), and the gameplay is weird but fun. \n\nBut the best thing about it is the music. The music is the best I've ever heard in a video game as every character gets their own themes, and the game ends with a song that is personalized to what you did in the game. \n\nI cannot reccomend it enough. It is a truly beautiful artistic experience.",

            "Eternal Darkness (Gamecube).  It's essentially a horror action RPG which has you play multiple characters over millennia.  What really makes it great, though, is that it MESSES with you as your character starts to go insane.  Bugs crawl on the screen, you hallucinate becoming a zombie, etc.  But the absolute best was when it put up a fake BSoD.  I about shit myself, realized what it had done, and just had to say, \"Bravo, devs.\"",

Don't worry about the first game, it's not worth playing really and there's no plot you miss out on. This is basically the main inspiration for Mass Effect, but it's much better - UQM is, I would say, the best Sci-Fi video game ever made. It has exploration, role-playing, action, and small parts of other genres (e.g. management) all wrapped in an excellently written story with very memorable characters (mostly representatives of different alien races) as you attempt to lift the yoke of Ur-Quan Suzerainty from the Galaxy.\n\n**Your Turn To Die**\n\nThis one is actually a browser game so you don't even need to download anything, just play [right here.](https://vgperson.com/games/yourturntodie/) It is a mysterious anime-styled Visual Novel centered around a \"Death Game\" - think Danganronpa but not so outlandish or ridiculous, and with better developed characters. Simply put, solve puzzles and make tough decisions to try and survive, the emphasis on this one is really on the characters, they are very memorable and form the bulk of why the game is worth playing. It's not finished yet, with only two out of three chapters currently released, but that is no reason to hold back if you ask me because it's already a much more satisfying story than anything else I saw in 2019.",

            "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger\n\nThe call of Juarez game before gunslinger was garbage so I don't think people gave it a chance. It's a game in the old west where the main character is telling the story to other patrons at a saloon. He'll make mistakes and people will call him out on it so mid missions the game rewinds and corrects itself based on what actually happened. (IE. He says \"There was 1000 men all ready for a fight.\" Patron: 'In a town that size? Not even 1000 people live there!\" Him \"Right right, it was closer to 100\" then the game rewinds and removes a good chunk of enemies). Bosses are introduced borderlands style. You have shootouts with other characters involving keeping your hand steady and at the right spot before drawing. The story goes wild a few times. You can upgrade your character and gear. Some of the achievements involve shooting the gun out of someone's hand in a shootout or  shooting a chicken behind them before shooting them. Solid shooting mechanics. Great story and replayability (shifting focus to dual pistols rather than a rifle or shotgun) it got decent reviews when it came out but I heard 0 about it until I saw it on Steam a few years ago. Worth checking out since it's cheap ($5.99). It's also on Switch.",

It was a completely open world action adventure game long before that was common. There are hundreds of NPCs and you can walk up to any of them and speak to them and have a conversation and they're all fully voiced. It also took the interesting route of being voxel based instead of pixel based. And [the soundtrack is *fantastic*](https://youtu.be/3NSvzyrPVzc) recorded with a full orchestra.\n\nThe story is great if you love 90s scifi action. Wonderfully cheesy. Definitely inspired by Stargate but it does it's own thing with it. I fell in love with the world they created.\n\nI *highly* recommend it. It's still available for purchase for PC on Steam and GOG.

The publisher revealed in November 2010 that the game only sold 800,000 copies worldwide,[\\[57\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West#cite_note-57) but the figure was corrected to 460,000 in February 2011.[\\[58\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West#cite_note-58) By September 2011 sales of 730,000 had been achieved, but this was not considered substantial enough to warrant continuation of the franchise so a planned sequel was cancelled.[\\[59\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West#cite_note-59) Namco blamed the game's release in a crowded window as the key factor it is a commercial failure.[\\[60\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West#cite_note-60) In 2014, Tameem Antoniades stated, speaking of the game's poor sales \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the fantasy elements were a turn-off, the gameplay mix, or the lack of visibility.

            "Not a particular novel, but an author: Kurt Vonnegut. He has a way of stating truths about humanity in a way that is so direct and beautifully simple.\n\nEDIT: WOW! Thank you all for the awards and the personal connections to an author who has been so special to me. For those asking where to start, here are some ideas.\n\nThe short story Harrison Bergeron is a great start and wouldn\u2019t require committing to an entire book. I do think it is less humorous than most of his other work, but I love it in a different way (as do my students because I teach it every year).\n\nOthers have referenced a talk that he gave about the shape of stories. That video really helps viewers get acquainted with Vonnegut, his insight, and his delivery.\n\nAs far as books go, my favorites are Cat\u2019s Cradle, Sirens of Titan, and Bluebeard. I also love Slaughterhouse Five and will end with my favorite passage from it. The main character has become \u201cunstuck in time\u201d and therefore perceives things out of traditional chronological order.\n\n\u201cHe came slightly unstuck in time, saw the late movie backwards, then forwards again. It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:\n\nAmerican planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighters planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments forms some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\n\nThe formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\n\nWhen the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.\nThe American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed. That wasn\u2019t in the movie. Billy was extrapolating. Everybody turned into a baby, and all of humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed.\u201d\n\nNone of this managed to capture his sense of humor that I so adore, but I don\u2019t know that I could ever do it justice. If your interest is piqued, consider picking up a book and getting to know one of my favorite people who I\u2019ve never met!",

            "'Never judge a book by its cover' as someone who works in a bookshop - you're damn right I'm gonna judge the quality of a book by its production. As do most customers. I have gotten insights into the world of publishing and the decisions they make based on the quality and success of the product they are pushing.\n\nFor instance - an author just starting out? The catchy title of the book is going to be the biggest text on the book. The author has brought out 3-4 books that are proving succesful? The text size of their name is going to be equal to the title. Ian Rankin or Kate Atkinson? Their name is going to be the biggest text on that cover because that's what draws customers in. I remember chatting to James Oswald who said 'I knew I had made it when my name got bigger'\n\nOur Scottish buyer is very good at sniffing out underdog books. Books that are incredibly well-written, but haven't got the recognition they deserve, and she will discuss with the publisher about changing the cover of the book to reflect this. Suddenly huge boosts in sales.\n\nWhen a customer is looking for an obscure title, and I look it up, I can almost immediately tell if its a low quality independent publication by the way the cover looks.\n\nDisclaimer - much like with the underdogs, there are ALWAYS exceptions to rules. And it is definitely not always the case that a low quality looking book is necessarily a bad read. It's just often an indication of a first time or unpublished author, who hasn't had a chance to hone their craft yet.",

Sure, there are some who enjoy it but it isn't something they're passionate about. I personally believe that any hobby you turn into a necessity kills your love for said hobby, of course it's not true for everyone but it's true for me and apparently a lot of people who have commented about their experiences. In the end, you'll either land a job you are passionate about in which you'll be the lucky few or you'll land a job you won't be passionate about and feel like you failed because you aren't passionate about your job. I would prefer the saying \"do what you find tolerable and use the money to pursue what you actually love\". Also some passions cannot be turned into careers and some people just don't have passions, my passion for running isn't something I can make a reliable income with. That's something else I recognized as I remember lots of people in my HS did not know what to pursue after HS because they did not have any passions in any fields or in general.",

            "In college, I lived in a crappy apartment nearby the school, that was mostly populated by students. Halfway to class one day, I realized I forgot a book and had to rush back to my apartment to get it. As I was running up the stairs (which shared a wall with the stairs in the next door apartment, which mirrored my own) I could have sworn I heard someone yelling. I ignored it and ran to my room to grab my book. As I clambered downstairs, again I heard yelling, and I paused to listen. I heard some unintelligible moaning, and eventually heard the words \u201chelp me,\u201d weakly groaned from the stairs next door. I rushed out and tried their door, but it was locked. I totally forgot about my class and ran to the apartment management office, hoping that someone was there. A manager was, thank goodness, and after I explained the situation, she grabbed her master keys and we booked it back to my neighbor\u2019s place. She opened the door and the poor guy was laying in the stairwell (it was one of the ones that goes up halfway to the second floor, then turns 90 degrees for the rest of the way), clearly having fallen. I called 911 while the manager ran over to the guy. Ambulance came and picked him up, and I later learned that he had fallen down the stairs after passing into a brief diabetic coma. I guess he hadn\u2019t eaten in some time; I don\u2019t know too much about how diabetes works. Anyhow, to this day, I feel grateful that I forgot that book. That poor guy could have died, slumped halfway down the stairs with his face in the carpet.\n\nEdited to add: also, relevant to the thread, I was grateful for the thin walls. Just for that though.

I guess things worked out for awhile, from the snippets of the fight I caught Male B had joined them on multiple occasions for various sexual escapades.\n\nThe kicker was Female A came home early from a work trip and found Male A and Male B deeply engrossed in their sexual acrobatics \n without her.   Female A flipped out and I guess after that point they tried to patch things up but she caught both of them on two other occasions (the latest being the night before fight night that I was unashamedly listening to)  \n\nNeither neighbor would hold my gaze for long the next morning.

            "My husband and I have lived in apartments since we got married over 8 years ago, so each place has it's most memorable neighbor story. Believe it or not, none of these places seemed like \"bad\" places to live on face value. However, the first three turned out to be pretty crappy the longer we stayed.\n\n**1st place:** We heard domestic violence in the apartment beneath us where the husband literally threw the wife into a wall. We called the cops immediately, and so did the neighbors next door. The cops showed up and took everyone's statements, and the couple broke up and the guy moved out very shortly after. The woman didn't stay long, but at least she didn't have to stay with that guy any more.\n\n**2nd place:** We were just settling onto the couch in the evening to watch a movie, when suddenly we heard wild screaming from upstairs and loud thumping as someone stumbled down the stairs. It was our female neighbor, screaming that her cousin was going to stab her. My husband charged outside to grab our neighbor's hand and pull her into our apartment, and I called the police. Turns out, she'd been letting her cousin stay for a few weeks, and the cousin had some MAJOR mental health issues. Thankfully our neighbor didn't get stabbed, but half of her weave had been ripped out and her scalp was injured a bit. The cousin got arrested a few days later (for reasons unknown), so thankfully things were quiet for us and our neighbor after that.\n\n**3rd place:** Heard our next door neighbor (a young woman living alone) getting extremely drunk and trying to assault some of our other neighbors who were having a party in the same building. Then when the cops were called, the drunk woman charged at an officer and they had to tase her. First time didn't phase her at all, second time finally knocked her down so they could take her in. A month later, she knocked on our door absolutely wrecked and ill; turns out, she'd been trying to get sober, but a shit friend had brought her some alcohol and she'd drank the whole thing and it was horribly interfering with one of her meds. We tried our best to help her (she could barely walk), and called an ambulance when she asked and made sure that her dog had food and water. Her parents came and helped her move out shortly after that; I'm pretty sure she checked herself into rehab. I hope she's doing better now.\n\n**4th (and current) place:** Thankfully, our 4th apartment is a lot calmer than previous homes we've had. There has been the occasional loud argument or party, but mostly people here keep to themselves. A lot more people have cats here, so during the day when everyone is out, you'll see a bunch of cats sitting in windows watching the outside. Very wholesome :)",

The dude was sneaking into his gfs apartment because her parents weren't home & the cop asked him if he lived there. The kid lied and im guessing the officer found out so there was a bit of a scuffle. At one point or another the kid got ahold of the cops gun and shot him while he was down after falling down the stairs. When my mom got home our door was broken into due to the officers looking for the guy. They tracked in brains into our house apparently so that's fun. The shittiest part tho was this little scarecrow I had outside our door that my mom had to throw away, it was drenched in blood and brain matter. This also happened right after Christmas so it was probably extra traumatic for both the victim & the shooters family.\n\nI don't even live in a dangerous part of metro Detroit (I live in the suburbs) so it was really shocking.

            "I've always been a moderate conservative and consider myself Republican. Up until now, I've been apathetic about politics (much to my husband's dismay, as he loves talking politics). I was too busy with my kids the last 7 years to pay attention to how far right the right has gone. I knew Trump did bad things, but didn't have the mental energy to dig into it.\n\nThen, I got deeply sucked into reading and informing myself about the spread of the coronavirus when it started in Asia. Trump did one bad thing after the next, crippling our response and confusing the public. This resulted  in a country divided when it should have been united against the virus. It all got my attention and enraged me. Finally, I saw the petty and selfish things Trump has been doing. The pandemic has really shown everyone's true colors.\n\nThen George Floyd was murdered and peaceful protests were met with more brutality. Trump encouraged the violence and orchestrated a brutal unconstitutional clearing of peaceful protesters to get a photo op... That was the last straw. I started to look into Joe Biden.\n\nI'm no Biden supporter, and never paid much attention to him. I also heard rumors of his negatives: old, creepy, senile, and makes tons of gaffes. Compare this to what damage Trump has done in the last 6 months, I'll take the creepy, rambling grandpa! \n\nThen I watched his interview by Trevor Noah. Color me surprised! He's quite eloquent and way more human than Trump, who acts like a toddler. Biden has got my vote!\n\nMy fundamental beliefs haven't changed, but the Republican party has devolved and is led by a narcissistic, petty, racist, childish coward.

            "2020\n\nI retain my political leanings.  I am a fiscal conservative with compassion for my fellow citizens.  I consider myself an independent and functionally I have been what I would consider a moderate conservative.  Still am.  I value differences of opinion and believe that our collective ideologies make us stronger.  We don't need to be a nation of only liberals or conservatives, of only socialist or capitalists, of only whites or hispanics or asians or blacks. I believe now and always have believed that the diversity of Americans makes us stronger, gives us more answers, allows us to come to greater stability in our society.  We have more to contribute because of our diversity.\n\nI have for years watched, with growing concern, the division in our society and our politics;  I am 59 years old and we seem much more partisan than I remember.  It used to be that lawmakers could disagree civilly and debate vigorously while maintaining respect and the ability to work together.  Now it seems like we have a culture of opinionated  \"my way or the highway.\"  When we encounter this in our various neighborhoods, we have coined a name for this kind of individual,  a \"karen.\"\n\nThis year starting with the evolving Covid pandemic, and then spilling into and snowballing with the response of our public servants to the civil rights protests, I have seen a complete lack of diplomacy and leadership.  At this moment in time, what our nation needs most desperately is not politics but the ability to lead.  We are desperate for a leader to settle down the national emotion, to acknowledge the legitimacy of BLM, to lead us in introspection, and to lead us forward in constructive ways to unite people of all races, cultures, and politics.\n\nWhat we have is a karen, who gets in our face, self-righteously shouts at us, intimidates, and refuses to listen.  Our president karen has systematically divided us when we need most desperately to be unified.  He has riled us up when we have needed settling down, he has blustered when we needed introspection, and has threatened when we needed leadership. The saddest thing is, that our country right now is experiencing the greatest civil rights renaissance of my generation.  This would be much less painful with leadership, but it is going to happen anyway because it is the right thing to do.\n\nKaren has mismanaged the office of president, he has utterly failed to lead, and he will lose the election this fall by historic and unprecedented margins.  \n\nWe have 6 months to endure president karen.  The good thing is, look around: people are uniting in amazing ways anyway.  I believe the vast majority of americans are behind #BLM and civil rights with equal protection under the law.  I believe peaceful discourse on these issues is up to us; it certainly isn't going to be helped along by president karen.  Luckily, we \"the people\" have that ability in us, even if president karen does not.\n\n\nEdit:  Thank you very much for the upvotes, awards, and the kind comments!!  If you read through the comments, you will see positive thoughts from both sides of the aisle, which very much is an encouragement to me, and supports the idea that people with differing views and ideas can still care about issues while retaining their respect for each other, acknowledging their collective wisdom, and celebrating their common ground.\n\nPay attention, mr president!!",

            "I was raised in an ultra-conservative family. I only started to pay attention to politics during Obama's presidency, which I was promised would result in Sharia law being imposed on America. I saw Fox, my parents, and those around me rail against Obama every day listing off the various ways he would destroy the country. I cast a vote for Trump \"knowing\" that in a blue state it didn't really matter, so I didn't have to question/research it (and figured he would lose anyway, absolving me of any blame for a Clinton presidency).\n\nMy biggest regret is making the popular vote closer. My family, Fox, and those around me have all completely rejected their values to follow Trump--every day he does something they VOWED Obama would do to ruin the country and they twist themselves explaining why it's actually a good thing. My 'good wholesome Christian' family members are now some of the most genuinely racist and least intellectual people I know. (But there are other siblings like me as well! And they give me hope).\n\nIt took me about 3 months of being a casual follower of politics to start being involved in local elections, driving an hour+ to vote, and actually paying attention. I've (hopefully) started to make up for my mistake by voting more intelligently in the last primary and having discussions with the siblings that are asking similar questions.\n\nI can say without hesitation that people who are voting for Trump are either utterly politically apathetic (formerly me) or filled with hate (whether they think about it or not).

            "This is a difficult question. For context, I am 22M, and 2016 was my first election. Anyway, here goes:\n\nI didn't like him when I voted for him (edit: I supported Kasich in the primary, and ended up voting Cruz because he had the best chance of beating Trump in my state of Indiana); I really only chose him because he wasn't Clinton, and as I am a conservative, there were some things he pushed that aligned with my views.  However, since the election I have been progressively less and less impressed with both him and my party. It's hard to point to exactly one thing that pushed me over the edge, but the major events that catapulted me away from him are probably the following:\n\n1. \"Grab 'em by the pussy\"\n\n2. Mocking a disabled person (my brother has Downs' Syndrome, so this one really gets to me)\n\n3. His tendency to nickname everyone he competes with: Lyin' Ted, Crazy Bernie, Sleepy Joe, Crooked Hillary, Do-nothing Democrats, etc. My dad repeated one of these a while back, and I let him know that if he continued to use these terms, I would instantly lose much of my respect for him.\n\n4. His mockery of John McCain\n\n5. Most of the GOP's handling of the impeachment process, and especially Romney's speech in favor of impeachment\n\n6. His photo shoot in front of the church after tear gassing the entire place\n\n7. Perhaps the biggest one is the impact I've seen on the people around me. After the 2016 election, people I had tremendous respect for suddenly became extremely hateful and vindictive. Perhaps it was always there and I was too young to notice it, but it was striking.\n\nMore generally, I am sick of America's leader, and to a lesser extent, its people, being the laughingstock of the world. I am no fan of Biden, and didn't really like Obama that much either, but enough is enough.\n\nIn hindsight, maybe I should have realized all of this sooner, but I really wanted to like him. After all, some of the things he had done happened years ago, and I believe people can change. Beyond that, he was the candidate I voted for. I wanted to be right. There were a handful of things he did that I agree with, and I clung to those, hoping that I could stand behind them, if nothing else, but after all this, I could not ignore his transgressions. Barring something extraordinary, I will be voting Blue come November. I will not be looking forward to Thanksgiving with my parents this year.\n\nEdit: a lot of people have asked how I could vote for him to begin with, since several of my points occurred before the election. I don't really have a good response to this, but: I was 18, and my political knowledge came pretty much entirely from my family, who were staunch conservatives, and got me to think that Clinton was basically the worst thing since genocide. So since I agreed with some of Trump's political ideas, I was able to overlook 1-4 at first in an effort to keep Clinton out of the White House.\n\nBy the way, I still believe my family are wonderful people, just very misguided on this particular issue.",

He is also a horrid racist and bigot, and honestly not mentally healthy.",
            "It took me less than six months after he was inaugurated before I realized I made a huge mistake in voting for Trump. Just the way he handled himself, the people around him, those different from him, and his immediate lying made me realize that he is not mentally well. I should\u2019ve seen the signs with the \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201c reveal, but at the time I was a Republican, and wanted to stick with the party vote. Trump and his bootlicking army of sycophants have caused me to switch my political affiliations because I can\u2019t be a part of a political party that marginalizes non-white people and does everything in its power to destroy the environment and dissuade immigration. And please don\u2019t bring up your \u201cDemocrats founded the Klan\u201d bullshit. That was over 200 years ago, and the racial perspectives of the Democratic and Republican parties have reversed. It is my fervent hope that the house stays blue, the Senate turns blue, and Trump is defeated. Most of all, I want to see Trump being led away in handcuffs for the crimes he\u2019s committed before and during his presidency.\n\nAddendum: I\u2019m posting an addition to the message above in response to all the people who have rightfully pointed out that the Republican Party has been doing for many years and administrations the same things I stated I dislike about Trump. I fully admit that I did not pay as close attention as I should have to those Republican administrations and politicians prior to Trump being elected. I believe in small government, am a gun owner, and while I don\u2019t stand steadfastly against it, I\u2019m not really in favor of abortion, although that conflicts with my belief that women should have the right to govern their own bodies, and that they should have equal pay for equal work. I believe in the work ethics of immigrants, and I believe it is wrong to discriminate against any race, religion, or culture. However, I wasn\u2019t always like this. I am 64 years old, and throughout my formative and early adult years, I lived in an environment that saw non-white people as inferior. I also spent some time in the military, where racism was very prevalent despite the large percentages of minorities in service to America. As I mentioned in a previous post, my daughter, who is now in her 20s, was very liberal and still is, and she would call me out on things I would say. It took a long time to come around to changing my perspectives, but it is literally the only thing that I thank Trump for because he was and is so blatant with his words and actions against non-white people, I was able to see parts of myself in him, and I didn\u2019t like it. What really helped me understand the Black perspective was viewing Ava Duvernay\u2018s documentary \u201c13th.\u201d That really opened my eyes to the institutional and systemic racism that Black people for so long have endured. It completely changed my opinion, and made me understand why the black population is rightfully angry. It made me angry too, and that anger was also felt for the persecution that Trump committed against Hispanics, Muslims, in other groups he views as a threat. I hope this satisfies the statements that were made about why it took so long for me to turn against the Republican party.\n\nUpdate: for some reason my Reddit account has been permanently suspended. This is the only way I can let you all know I appreciate the kind comments.\n\nTrump is now hawking beans since he obviously doesn\u2019t have anything more important to do with his time.\n\nTrump golfs with Brett Favre and gives the \u201cthumb up\u201d in the photo of the two of them on the golf course. Someone should rip that thumb off his hand, shove it up his ass, and then extract it and shove it down his throat. Fuck him and his \u201cthe suburbs are for well-off families\u201d bullshit. I hope he drops dead from the stress caused by his addled brain not being able to accept that he\u2019s a failure and a loser.",

And to hear President Trump mock him and say all of those things was really the tipping point.

I hesitate to do so because that would prevent me from voting for \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans in the primaries. If everyone switches to the Democrat party, only extremists will be left during the primaries and only extremist candidates will be chosen to run on the Republican tickets from now till forever.\n\nEdit: I think many people in this country woefully underestimate the power of a primary election.

His comments on using the military were awful. His gassing of peaceful protesters was a huge snap for me. His recent actions with transgender healthcare even further proved how bad he is. Since this month started, I\u2019ve looked back and realized how awful he\u2019s been. He\u2019s an asshole who mocks people, he has no principle, he\u2019s completely ruined what I thought was my party.

It seems Americans feel compelled to either be Republicans or Democrats, and this is part of their identity.

It seems so restrictive that Americans can see political ideology as so simplistic and binary. I can see how they can have such a \"you're either with us or against us mentality\". Of course I'm generalizing and I know not ALL Americans are like that, but from the outside looking in, it sure seems that way.\n\nIn contrast, here in Canada, people are far less likely to align themselves with a political party for life. Canadians are more flexible and will vote for whichever party is pushing platforms that they agree with at the time. Part of this is likely related to the fact that we have a diverse range of parties in each province/territory, and nationally. Liberal, Conservative, New Democrat, Bloc Quebecois and Green Parties all currently have representation in our federal government. I appreciate the greater diversity and range of voices and perspectives this allows for, as well as less of a tendency to a person to feel the need to attach their identity to one particular party or ideology.",

Fortunately I wasn't offered the job as it was at Michael Milken's firm... before he went to prison.  \n\n-If the company brings alcohol into the office for 'end of week' sessions on a regular basis.  I know they can be fun but it's a stupendously bad idea for all kinds of reasons and if leadership hasn't figured that out then I'd think twice before joining.  \n\n-If when you're visiting the company for the first time and you pass someone in a hallway, do they smile and acknowledge your presence with a nod or maybe a hello, or do they ignore you?  It's a small thing but very telling about the workplace culture.  Similarly, do people seem 'healthy and energized' or 'grey-faced and tired'?  \n\n-ANY 'bait and switch' deviations from representations made during the recruiting process vs actual terms/conditions.\n\n-If it's a job in a manufacturing or distribution facility, is it messy or tidy?  Messy, cluttered facilities are indicative of poor management, plus they can be dangerous. \n\n-As others have noted, any B.S. about 'oh people like to work late' or stuff like that used as pressure to get you to put in extra hours.\n\n-Last, pay attention to your gut feel.  If something feels 'off', it probably is.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the nice comments, and for those who disagree, well, I'm just sharing my perspective.  I'm pasting in my answers to a couple of follow-up questions re cars and beer:\n\nRe cars: There are obviously exceptions, but in my experience leaders who are focused on the external indicators of their personal success will orient their behavior and decisions towards their own benefit versus benefiting the entire company and/or other employees. In more extreme cases- which unfortunately are not uncommon- these people tend towards the narcissistic personality type, which means they will tend set their direct reports against each other rather than encouraging and fostering collaboration and display other behaviors that make for a miserable workplace. I know, kind of a big leap from a fancy car... but I've been at this for almost 40 years and it's amazing how patterns tend to repeat.  And for clarity I'm really talking about 'conspicuously' expensive- not a nice Mercedes or whatever, but a Bentley, Ferrari, that sort of thing.\n\nRe alcohol: So.... as someone noted elsewhere, sometimes these can be good/useful/fun. In fact, they start that way when companies are small- and I used to do them regularly. But... here's why I stopped doing them. In a group of 100 (actually, a lost less than that) or more, you're going to have some folks with alcohol-management issues. So you're creating a company-sponsored regular event in which they have the choice of either not participating- and thereby missing out on the networking etc- or being in an environment where everyone is drinking. And for those who haven't figured out they have an alcohol problem, you're basically helping them pre-game for the evening. I've seen people knock back three beers in 20 minutes... and then realized they will be driving home. Is it my responsibility to ensure they don't drink too much? No. But is it a good idea for me to enable it? And, finally... for those who think I'm a prude or whatever... if it's your company, you regularly provide alcohol at company events, everyone knows old Bill often hits it a bit hard before heading home, and Bill happens to kill someone on his drive, you are completely, unutterably fucked. Quite aside from the whole 'gee am I partly responsible for what happened' guilt thing, the family of the person killed will get a contingent litigator and they will come after you for literally everything you have- easily $20 million or more per person.",
            "Having to take an online IQ test before even being considered for an interview.\n\nBackstory: when I moved to Australia, I was looking for work as a language teacher. I went in Monster.com and found an advert saying that they were looking for teachers for gifted children, but that I needed to take an online IQ test to apply (needed an IQ above 125 to go for an interview). I took the test, sent in my CV and cover letter, and waited. An hour later I get an email asking to meet at a special cafe in downtown Melbourne the following day.\n\nSo, I go and notice that this building was a Free Mason building and that one needed a special pass to get in. There was a little older lady waiting for me in a tacky floral print shirt and a white fisherman's hat. Immediately, she pardoned herself for wearing that hat, explaining that it was lined with aluminum to protect her from the cell phone radiation. I think nothing of it and order a coffee.\n\nOff the bat, the old lady tells me about how she has an IQ of 160 and the rarest blood type, similar to that of Tutankhamen... She goes on and on about this for a while and then begins explaining the job. She tells me that in the beginning, I wouldn't be teaching but administering tests in schools around Queensland to recruit children to special camps, where then I would be teaching.\n\nThe whole thing screamed red flags, but I politely listened and got her business card if ever I had further questions (I got a proposal on the spot). I looked at the card and it said \"The wise ones\". After looking it up, I noticed that it was a cult (similar to that of Universal Medicine)",

I gave a non-answer and I thought that was also my invitation in and she said that the person was not ready yet and I had to continue to wait.\n\nWhen I finally was greeted by the manager I'd work under, he was new to the company (2 months at the time) he made sure I knew that for some reason, they first asked a standard tell me about yourself, then pivoted to pay saying look I understand what you might expect in terms of compensation but please hear us out before you make your decision (weird that was not something I mentioned in my \"get to know me pitch\")\n\nWe do a quick tour and by quick I meant 2 minutes, no workers looked up from their areas as we passed through and you could hear a pin drop it was that silent. \n\nNext the place is old, inside the \"work area\" everything looked like it was bought in the 80s, the manager casually drops, so when you first pull into the office leave your cell phone in your car because having it go off at your desk is grounds for termination, if something is that important give your family the number for the receptionist and they can forward a call to you if you are not busy. Anyway follow me the owner wants to meet with you.\n\nThe owner is in his 70s and the son of the founder of the company, his personal story was nice but after the get to know you stuff (no technical questions) he slides a folder across the table and says quit your job today, start tomorrow and I'll give you $2000, inside is a break down of their policies (2 highlights: Doctors visits and funerals are unexcused absences unless you take vacation for them, you are not allowed to be more than 15 minutes late twice in a calendar year or you are subject to termination)and pay, the amount for salary was blank, so I asked about it.\n\nHe stares down the manager (who looks like he saw a ghost at this point) and asks \"what do you think is fair\"\n\nI asked for a market rate for pay given my education and the position and they countered with a significantly lower number (more than 25k/yr less than my market value ask) saying \"We are glad to pay you that amount at a later date but you need to go through training and on-boarding. While doing that you aren't actually doing all the responsibilities of this role and on boarding takes 6 months so we can negotiate a more reasonable salary then but for now this is our offer\u201d\n\nI said I understand there are costs for training but what does that entail to justify the pay, he said to learn the company you need to start from the bottom your first 6 months you'll be in the warehouse loading and unloading product from semi trailers.\n\nI thought he was joking, he was not.\n\nI immediately said thank you I need to think this over and walked to the door, the owner half blocks the door and says if you leave now you're ruining you future, you don't understand this opportunity will set you up for life if you're willing to make sacrifices. I say I'll call you tomorrow and leave. This entire process lasted 45 minutes on a first interview.\n\nI get home and have an email from the owner saying how dare I leave the interview, if I had any level of experience they'd start me closer to my desired pay, I am making the worst decision of my life by not taking this job...etc\n\nI get a phone call about an hour later from the manager saying look I understand you may have reservations but if you come in tomorrow I can give you another $500.

Professors like to gloss over his overwhelming anti-semitism.\n\nFord wrote and published a wildly anti-Semitic newspaper, which were spread around the Ford Motors facilities.  Those papers were republished in Germany and became incredibly popular with the Third Reich.  Heinrich Himmler described Ford as \"one of our most valuable, important, and witty fighters\".  Hitler praised Ford in *Mein Kampf* and referred to Ford as an \u201cinspiration\".  \nThe admiration went both ways, because Ford was a Nazi sympathizer to the highest degree, hosting Hitler\u2019s representatives in his home and hobnobbing with Nazi officers. On his 75th birdthday, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, the highest medal Nazi Germany could bestow on an American.  \nBut all anyone cares about are his f-ing assembly lines **which he didn\u2019t even invent**.

            "Lajos fucking Kossuth. He's a Hungarian history figure who lived 1802 - 1894, but most notably he declared himself as Governor-President of the\u00a0Kingdom of Hungary\u00a0during the 1848-'49 revolution. \n\nFor those of you who are not really familiar with Hungarian history, the short verion is: we were fucked by everyone and never had independence since the early 1300s. This time we had beef with the Habsburgs. We really wanted independence, have Hungarian as the official language and the liberation of the serfdom. Sounds cool. \n\nBefore the revolution the two most outstanding political figures were Kossuth and Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi (he's actually a really cool dude, and I think he deserved the title \"the Greatest Hungarian\"). They both wanted the same things but Kossuth wanted everything ASAP, while Sz\u00e9chenyi understood that change takes time. So of course they didn't like eatchother. (With some other factors) Kossuth ended up \"bullying\" Sz\u00e9chenyi out of politics. \n\nI give Kossuth the credit for being smart and charismatic, who could motivate people with his speeches. (So one time he basically started a rally amongst common folk, because other politicians told him that discrowning the king was a bad f-ing idea. But because of the massive amount of people surrounding them, they couldn't really say no. So they did discrown the king)\n\nDuring the revolution we sucked ass. Not getting into details, we had more downs than ups. (Also some minorities revolted against Kossuth, who would not give them any rights) \n\nEnter one of my favorite historical figure: Art\u00far G\u00f6rgei. He was the greatest general in this whole scene. (And finally he has his own exhibition). He actually won against some Austrian army corps. Kossuth hated him- most likely because he feared his power- and did everyrhing to remove him from charge.\n\nBut the Austrian king (Ferdinand the 5th) asked the Russian Emperor (Nicholas the 1st) for help. So, Hungary is a small country with a small population, Russia on the other hand... you see where this is going. G\u00f6rgei wanted to go west and destroy the Austrian army, before the Russians arrive. Otherwise we're fucked. Sounds great. Not for Kossuth. He wanted to wait until the two armies merge in the east- because if they loose, he can emigrate to Turkey. \n\nThe latter happened, and Kossuth as his las fucking move, stepped back from being Governor-President and appointed G\u00f6rgei. A few days later On August 13rd, it was clear that Hungary had lost. In a hopeless situation, G\u00f6rgei signed a\u00a0surrender at Vil\u00e1gos.\n\nKossuth emigrated to Turkey, but tried to control everythimg from afar. Writing the Cassandra letter, that if we make peace with the Austrians Hungary will no longer exist. Which was bullshit. Our industry and agriculture fucking blossomed after. As a really great university professor one said \"Kossuth threw a big rock up in the air and pushed G\u00f6rgei under it\" (basically he threw him under the bus). What buffles me about this absolutely garbage of a person, that he has the biggest mausoleum in all of Hungary. It's made out of gold, marble and all that jazz. (You know what G\u00f6rgei has? A f-ing black iron cross)\n\nGod I hate him so much. Btw he died in Italy, and he still has a huge following because he was \"so great\" that every fucking town has to have at least on road named after him.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the silver kind stranger!\n\nEdit 2: changed the swear words.\n\nEdit 3: Thank you for all the response I got! I didn't expect it to blow up! Thank you for the gold, platinum, everything!\n\nTLDR: Lajos Kossuth is a charismatic politician, becomes Governor-President of Hungary during a revolution, his plan fucks the whole nation, leaves everyone to deal with what he caused by running away to Turkey, acted like a know-it-all until he died. Now has a huge following as the \"nations hero\" but he's basically an asshole.",

But did you know *he wasn't the only man on the Midnight Ride?*\n\nA lot of the work and credit goes to his two peers that night. Revere only gets the credit because his name rhymed nicely in the poem written about him.\n\nI only know this because my grandma pointed out that we're related to one of the other two men, William Dawes. I'm too lazy to look up the other guy's name or how much of a role each of the three played in the event, but my basic memory tells me Revere wasn't the most critical player of the three. In fact, and I could be wrong, he got caught before he finished his role which led the real heroism to one of the other two.\n\nSo yeah, thanks Paul Revere, but let's give credit to the other guys who warned us of the British that night.

So he was of average intelligence, he's just being compared with other serial killers who overall skew lower in terms of IQ.\n\nAnd no, his crimes weren't clever. He broke into the basement of a sorority house and bludgeoned 2 girls to death with a log from the fireplace while they were sleeping. The only reason he wasn't caught sooner was because the detectives working on the case were idiots and ignored multiple credible reports from Bundy's ex-wife. \n\nStop romanticizing the guy. Outside of how nasty it is to hype up freaking serial killers; he, like all serial killers, was a gigantic turd sandwich. He wasn't smart, and his crimes weren't 'elegant' or super planned out 4D chess murders. Don't believe the stupid dumb netflix movie.\n\nOh and he admitted that after he tossed the bodies into a field because they were too badly decomposed to keep them in his house, he'd still go out there and sleep with them despite the fact that they were rotting and likely full of maggots and etc. \n\nDude was sick. People need to stop romanticizing crime.\n\nedit: For people picking apart the law school comment, what I said came directly from Ted Bundy's mouth in terms of the reason he dropped out.\n\n\"In August 1974, Bundy received a second acceptance from the University of Utah Law School and moved to Salt Lake City, leaving Kloepfer in Seattle. While he called Kloepfer often, he dated \"at least a dozen\" other women.[110] When he studied the first-year law curriculum a second time, \"he was devastated to find out that the other students had something, some intellectual capacity, that he did not. He found the classes completely incomprehensible. 'It was a great disappointment to me,' he said.\"\"\n\nThis came from Polly Nelson's book, and she was one of his lawyers. So if you have issues with my comment about him not keeping up with his peers, that comes straight from Ted himself.\n\ndouble edit: To whomever gave me silver, thank you! Usually I respond to the guilding message with a thank-you but I got up to clean my fish tank and came back to like 60 comments, so I got a little overwhelmed."

If you leave a wooden spoon over the top of ANYTHING boiling to stop it boiling over, for example, you really should just turn the heat down and avoid potentially burning yourself on a really fucking hot utensil. Its not hard. No, you can't melt down gummy bears to make a jelly/jello. Why even try when jelly/jello is fucking cheap anyway?

I have worked in kitchens for close to two decades and never saw any chefs do it, but I have seen both my sister and housemate try it to utterly miserable results. So please folks, learn to boil with more of a 'low and slow' mentality in mind.

He approaches a STYLIST \u2013 a fifty-something woman of Chinese descent \u2013 at the register.*\n\n**RAMSES:** Uh, hi, I have an appointment.\n\n*The stylist eyes Ramses warily.*\n\n**STYLIST:** You have appointment?     \n**RAMSES:** Yes, I just... yes.    \n**STYLIST:** Okay. You come here.\n\n*She struts away from the cash register and approaches a vacant barber's chair facing a mirror.

Instead she points at the chair.*\n\n**STYLIST:** Sit.\n\n*Ramses sits. The stylist wraps a cloth collar around his neck and drapes a cape over his front.*\n\n**STYLIST:** (*CONT'D*) What we doing today?    \n**RAMSES:** I'd like to keep the very same style, but have it cleaned up and shortened a bit.     \n**STYLIST:** Same?    \n**RAMSES:** Yes, same.    \n**STYLIST:** No. You choose something else.    \n**RAMSES:** I, uh... heh.

Maybe shave one side of head?    \n**RAMSES:** I'd really prefer to keep it as it is, just... you know, shorter.\n\n*The stylist mutters to herself in Cantonese, but appears to reluctantly accept the request. She yanks Ramses' head from one side to the other as though examining it for defects, then snatches an ominous-looking electric clipper from a nearby shelf.*\n\n**STYLIST:** I start clipper cut. Okay?     \n**RAMSES:** ... Okay.\n\n*An angry buzzing noise fills the barbershop.*\n\n**RAMSES:** (*V.O.*) Oh, no. She's... that's too much hair, isn't it? That's not going to be the same at all.    \n**STYLIST:** You stop fidget!    \n**RAMSES:** (*V.O.*) Why can't they ever just, like, cut some of it off? Why does this have to be a whole-head affair?    \n**STYLIST:** You movie star?    \n**RAMSES:** No.    \n**STYLIST:** Didn't think so.    \n**RAMSES:** (*V.O.*) Then why did you ask? Hey, what...? Okay, that was *definitely* too much hair.    \n**STYLIST:** You want shaved side, yes?    \n**RAMSES:** No, I really, *really* just want the same style, but shorter.\n\n*The stylist continues muttering to herself in Cantonese. Ramses sits there for several minutes, his face alternating between expressions of horror and relief as the haircut continues.*\n\n**STYLIST:** ... Okay, all done.\n\n*She grabs a mirror, hands it to Ramses, then spins the chair around.*\n\n**STYLIST:** (*CONT'D*) Good?    \n\n*Ramses pretends to examine the back of his head in the handheld mirror.*\n\n**RAMSES:** Yes, thank you.    \n\n*The stylist whips off the cape and yanks the collar away, then points a blowdryer at Ramses' back for a few seconds. Once this has finished, Ramses stands and walks back to the cash register. There is a brief fumbling of credits cards.*\n\n**STYLIST:** You need any product?     \n**RAMSES:** No, thank you.    \n**STYLIST:** Maybe you try some product.    \n**RAMSES:** Maybe next time.\n\n*More muttering follows, but the transaction is processed. At last, Ramses turns to exit... and catches his reflection in the window as he goes.*\n\n**RAMSES:** (*V.O.*) ... Well, at least it will grow out.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\n------\n\n**TL;DR: Haircuts are rides on emotional roller coasters.**",

Management refused to reconsider the policy and every single projectionist quit as a result.\n\nThey then decided that the door people (of which I was one), who were always scheduled seven days a week, would now only be scheduled on the weekends, and refused to reassign any of us to concessions on the weekdays so we wouldn't lose hours.  As a result, almost every single door person quit, including me.\n\nAfter that they started imposing impossible cleanliness standards on concessions, things like requiring them to scrape popcorn kernels out of the cracks in the trim behind the popcorn machines.  Concessions was there until 5 AM every night trying to meet their standards.  Most of the concession people quit as a result.\n\nBy my count the theater went from a staff of about fifty to a staff of about twelve in three weeks.  I swung by about a month after I quit and found out that entire management staff had been fired and replaced yet again by an entirely new one, ones who actually seemed to be running the theater properly.  My best guess is that the previous management had been told to whip the theater into shape and they were idiots who had no idea how to effectively do that.",

So far toward a year later and this guy was doing everything he could, making the store run and look wonderful and all the staff liked one another, out of nowhere he is told they are putting in a franchisee bid and tell him that if he wants it, he can have it. He bids, but so does one of the District Managers sons, he gets it, Original manager is of course pissed but accepts to stay as the grocery manager if he keeps pay rate. Fast forward and the new franchisee gets fired for not following regulations, they do the franchisee bid a second time and tell original manager the same thing, he can have it if he wants it.\n\nThey give the store to another person a second time!

Minimum wage at the time was $5.15/hr, this job payed $8, and it was always in the evenings so it was perfect work for a high school student. The only bad thing was our management was TERRIBLE. The main manager would throw toddler tantrums about once a shift over stupid bullshit, like not ordering enough of a specific beer (she did the ordering) or running out of pre-cut lemons for tea. \n\nOne night the stadium was running a promotion and it was incredibly busy - easily 2-3x the normal volume of customers. We were all working our asses off handling multiple roles each with absolutely no downtime. Although we all cleaned as we worked, nobody had a chance to do thorough cleaning for the whole shift because of the never-ending horde of hungry baseball fans.\n\nThe manager showed up 3-4 hours late per usual and throws the biggest fucking tantrum ever over the unswept floor. Finally, she announces \"Listen up you lazy fucks! Minimal work gets minimal pay. Everybody is being paid minimum wage tonight because you slobs won't clean up anything.\"\n\nBoth of our bartenders and the bar back quit on the spot, which caused a chain reaction. We all took off our aprons and hats to leave. She blocked the exit and was red in the face from screaming, so one of the cooks climbed out of one of the big serving windows where we served customers, so I did the same and most of the staff followed. Bear in mind that this all happened in front of like 200+ customers. Of course, my final paycheck \"got lost\" so I had to file a wage theft complaint with the Texas Workforce Commission.",

So after about 4 days I ask him where he's headed and if he's excited. He just looks blankly at me and says \"I'm not going anywhere. I'm just training you as the assistant manager, right?\". The look I gave him must have been a great tip off because he got up and walked into one of the new owners offices. After about 30 seconds they were screaming at each other, then he just storms out of the office, grabs his stuff, give me the finger, and leaves.\n\nOver the next few days I'm trying to calm things with the employees. They're not faulting me, but now have a very bad taste in their mouths about the new ownership. Over about a 7-10 day time period my team shrank from 15 people down to 3. I hobbled along with that the best I could while we tried to hire new people, but the new owners were offering so little we had trouble finding people. After 3 months or so of that I started to get fed up and overwhelmed and when the owners started to get on me about missed deadlines I had had it. We were still only at 5 people, 2 of which were brand new and still training. They didn't allow me to refuse work or push deadlines out, they expected the same output as a 15 person team. So after my third day in a row of being berated for missing a deadline that was impossible to make, I quit.",

Before he started running the store most everyone liked working there as it was a good environment. A few months after, a couple of people quit because of him. And one day I roll in at 9 to help open the store and he comes out to my car as soon as I park (I was 15 minutes early and usually just sat in my car until 9) and tells me, \u201chey I need to to start early because the three openers just quit on me\u201d. \n\nWe manage to get the store open and had a number of people from other stores help run the place until the people from the next shift came in. \n\nA couple days later I hear the full story of what happened from a coworker. The regional manager is supposed to be at the store at 7 or so, and the openers 30 minutes later. He didn\u2019t actually show up until 8:30. So when the openers, already pissed at being at work really early and not being on the clock, saw the regional manager roll in and knew it was gonna be an awful shift all decided that they were done with him and just quit right there. \n\nSo at least 6 people quit because of him by the time I left the place.

Everyone else hated him too, but no one wanted to call him out on his shit and quit. I was the first to do it, because I requested 2 weeks off in August of that year, about 3 months in advance (my family likes to plan our summer vacations early-on). When August came around he had my schedule set up for *all of August off except for those specific 2 weeks*. There was no way that he could have misinterpreted my request. When I got my schedule, I stormed into the restaurant, called him out on everything, and then quit on the spot. \n\nAbout 2 weeks after that, I heard from one of my work friends that 5 other people had enough and quit as well. I kind of felt good to be the first.",

            "Over-reliance on institutional knowledge.\n\nBasically, it was company non-policy not to bother documenting anything, never to create procedures, never to get \"wrapped around the axle\" by planning, etc. So the jobs basically lurched from crisis to crisis aimlessly in the name of being biased towards action and not getting bogged down by bureaucracy.\n\nAs such, getting anything at all done meant finding the person who already had the knowledge in their head and relying on them to remember how they addressed a specific issue previously (annual maintenance was effectively a scheduled crisis with everyone fumbling to remember exactly what they did a year ago), or to adapt memories of previous crises into a solution for the current crisis.\n\nThen one day, a multi-decade employee got sick of the dysfunction and left for greener pastures. This gaping hole meant that simple problems became crises and genuine crises became group hysterics. This made an already toxic environment almost comically radioactive, and within two or three months, over three quarters of the department had left the company.",

Nothing wrong with that except the guy he brought in didn't have a clue what it takes to build a boat from scratch. So one day we had a meeting in the break room, the owner and this guy were there and first they asked the metal guys what their thoughts are on how to improve things. They say they need new welding equipment and some other stuff. No problem, we're going to take care of it. The painters are next, same thing. Then the mechanics, same thing again. And then they got to us and things fell apart. Now here's the thing that's true for all shipyards I've ever worked on, shipwrights always come last when we need new tools or whatever but everyone always comes to us to solve a problem. We keep the place going so you'd think we got what we asked for. Instead they tell us we have everything we need and we just have to improvise. We all looked at each other and we told them we're done. Fuck you, fuck your shipyard and fuck everything. We all packed our tools, got in our cars and drove home.",

            "Worked at the SPCA. The month I was hired on there was a lot of stuff changing because a couple managerial and senior staff were moving on to other things, so it turned into a shit show when a new manager came in. And then the district manager also tried to screw senior staff of their bonuses, EI, etc. But most controversially was the new Manager and her bosses decided that they needed to try and save money. So we stopped spaying and neutering cats and adopted them out that way (real fucking smart idea), she was also told by the District manager that the SPCA needed more money, so if we got a good purebred dog in off the streets instead of registering it we should take it home, breed it, care for the pups (on our dime by the way) and then surrender it to the SPCA for some extra income. They also shut down their grooming facilities (which made them roughly 55% of their income). \n\nWhat made me quit was that I was hired to replace their tech, but I wasn't being trained properly because their current tech kept telling me to go clean dog pens or cat rooms instead of showing me how to work the systems properly, so after a month of not being properly trained and me constantly mentioning it to her, I come in one day and find my name omitted from the schedule. The manager's reasoning? \"Oh, well you struggled a bit the day you were the only tech, so we dropped you from full time to on-call, we're going to hire someone else and train them to take over tech.\" Good job! I already knew about 90% of the job by this point, so you're going to hire someone else and \"train\" them like I was being \"trained\"?  Anyways, I quit, shit apparently got really bad after as well.\n\nAll in all they lost 11 employees in about 3 weeks because of negligence, stupidity, etc. Me and 7 other employees went to the PetSmart on the other side of town as it was just opening and needed employees, so it wasn't completely terrible. But the complete mismanagement at that location was terrible. It was just a tip of the iceberg too, some of my co-workers regaled me with more stories of shit that happened shortly after I left.\n\nEdit: Just adding some details and some of the other shit pulled in that month. But basically management wanted to save money after I left and they decided to do that by not paying for the shampoo, conditioner and other products in their salon. They instead told the salon manager to pay for it out of her own pocket. It was the start of the shit for the salon manager that ultimately ended in her being bullied and almost assaulted until they fired her. When she decided to claim EI after she was fired, the management denied that she was fired and said she quit under \"hostile circumstances\" or some such bullshit. Luckily she got the position as salon manager at PetSmart and pretty much the entire client base went there and rendered the SPCA salon null.\n\nAnother coworker quit because he was expected to take care of 48 dog kennels and about double that in cat habitats, because they needed to save money so they cut hours, where they had 6 people opening in the morning they only had 3, so my coworker was expected to do a 4 man job in 3 hours.\n\nAnother coworker quit because, again, the low hours meant that shit couldn't get done on time, so she comes in for morning shift to a mountain of dog and food dishes stacked together with cat litter pans that were not washed meaning none of the animals could be fed and watered properly and the cats had to wait for their litter. That was the day she quit.",

Good enough that it can support a family if you had some experience, were friendly and had a few regulars.\n\nOn my second night there, it was a Friday night dinner service. Rules were you could choose your own shifts during the week (day/night etc) but Friday nights were all-hands-on-deck. It was the busiest night of the week, and although it did feel cluttered at times because of all the waitstaff being present, it was still mandatory.\n\nOne of the more senior waiters, +-35m, got a call from his wife just before the busy dinner service. Their daughter had taken ill, and was rushed to a hospital around 2km from the restaurant. Seeing as it was Friday night, and all the other waitstaff were there, he asked the manager if he was allowed to be excused to attend to his daughter as he had divided his tables amongst 3 of us. This wouldn't have been a problem, we were, if anything, overstaffed that night because of the fellow new recruits like me.\n\nThe manager, who was always a bit of a fuckwad (who would throw tantrums at the slightest/most petty grievances) denied him the leave. He warned that if he were to leave his post that night, he would be fired without any chance of appeal. The waiter, who was unaware of the nature of the condition begrudgingly continued his shift. We weren't allowed to be on our phones during peak times (the manager would keep them in his office) and he only checked in with his wife at around midnight. His daughter had had a brain aneurysm and passed at around 10:30. He had been denied the opportunity to say goodbye to his only daughter.\n\nDistraught, he rushed to the manager's office and delivered the most bone-chilling, harrowing emotional fuck you to the manager. His cries were heard throughout the restaurant, everyone heard. Everyone cried in sympathy, even restaurant patrons... He resigned on the spot, along with 80% of the waitstaff and me. We all accompanied him to the hospital and tried our best to comfort him and his wife before leaving them to grieve together.\n\nI never went back and didn't even collect my tips for the night. I don't know if everyone who walked out together stayed that way, I heard that management reached out to some of the more senior staff to try and get them back, but I certainly was never going to show my face there again.

But if any of you asshats are reading this: you know who you are. I have never seen a corporate office so disconnected with the needs of the employees. Go bork yourself and give me the raise you should have given me over a year ago. I got all the responsibilities with the promise of payment and you kept delaying it over and over. Eat my poo.",

            "360 SkateSpot in Willow Grove, PA. Fuck that place, the management/owners deserved to fail. It was an indoor skatepark that only existed from ~2002-2005 if that long. The owner was a rich asshole with no social skills whose spoiled kid was a skateboarder and the guy thought that opening a skatepark was a great get-richer-quick scheme. He had zero passion for skateboarding (I'm not naive enough to think any business isn't first and foremost about money, but starting a business you otherwise have no interest in is a great way to fail). Nevermind that kids and teenagers don't have a ton of money to spend on something they can do outside for free - this guy was sure his plan would succeed.\n\nThe place was a classic middle-aged businessman's \"Fellow Kids\" presentation of a skatepark. It looked like a lame mall, charged more than your average bowling alley, didn't have a working water fountain (so they charged for water) and had no realistic system in place to ensure there weren't too many kids skating at once or that kids would leave when their time was up. They treated the customers as entirely disposable and treating their young staff even worse.\n\nOn top of that, the older guys they hired as managers were absolutely fucking creeps and would hit on the teenage girls who also worked there. After one of the managers referred to my 17 year old friend by saying she \"looks like she knows how to ride it rough\" about a half dozen of us decided to quit. I'm sorry I didn't kick the guy's ass looking back on it, but was glad to find out that a few months later the guy was thrown over a table by another teenager and had the shit kicked out of him for making similar comments.",

One day the company brought us all to into a big conference room meeting, usually not a good sign at this type of job, and told us that our commission checks would no longer be paid as checks but would now would be paid on company issued gift cards. Imagine how well that went over. Some people walked out that day. THEN the first day the money is supposed to be  issued on the cards we get called into another meeting and told that the cards have not yet arrived and we sent to another branch across town. Cool, have someone there get the boxes of cards together or whatever and bring them here, no problem right? So the cards finally show up a few days later. Of course everybody immediately goes to check the balance. $0 on each card. People quitting left and right, just gathering their stuff and walking out.

            "Call center management promoted a guy to supervisor who was clearly a sociopath. It resulted in some funny things like: \n\n* supervisor requiring everyone to post sales to chat so he could do his best Ned Flanders \"congratu-gosh-diddly-ations!\" Supervisor is so anti-praise that it was clear this was something his manager was making him do to practice passing as a skinsuit.\n* As part of the \"learn to praise\" initiative, when my supervisor pulled me for our 1-on-1, at one point he said \"now is where I'm supposed to say something nice.\" He starts digging through metrics for a few minutes (keep in mind, I won a national award for my role in the company 2 months prior) then sorta gives up and says, \"you annoy me less than others.\" And he pulls up some time clock metrics and spends 10 minutes shit talking other people on the team who annoy him more.\n* He faked a bad yearly performance review, and when I called him out he kept all the scores, but just made his comments more vague. So I had these \"probably an ax murderer\" scores with descriptions that suggested we'd never even met.\n* his team surveys were so low that two levels of management came down to have a chat with us about the scores. They opened the floor for feedback, and everyone was afraid to say anything. Management said \"it's ok, we understand it can be scary to speak in front of a group. Feel free to email your feedback to us...but only if you CC your supervisor.\" I bet that worked out great.\n\nIt turned out that everyone had individually been going to the manager above our supervisor with our complaints, so management knew damned well what was going on, he just didn't care. From a team of 12, 3 people quit, 2 people changed departments, and 4 people had nervous breakdowns, including one drug relapse.",

They borrowed a ton of money against the company and insisted we had to pay the $40k a month interest out of our budget. We were making a $20K a month profit but now we were suddenly responsible for making up a $20k loss each month. \n\nSo they started to strangle the company.

Your screens are lit up enough for you to see.\u201d They sold all the furniture in the work kitchen. \n\nThey brought in two new managers (Vice Presidents) to oversee operations.

We all suspected it was because they were the highest paid. \n\nI got assigned to do my job and the job of one the fired people on top of that. For the same pay of course. After about a week of that I started looking for a new job. Within a month 80% of the staff had quit. Within 18 months the 100 year old company went out of business.",

            "Worked for a genuinely terrible small business owner, job was filling and delivering hazmat bottles around Ohio and surrounding states. 5 employees at this company not including the boss(Rich), coworker(John) got a better job and finished his 2 week notice but on the day he was to come in to get his last check, owner was drunk at 9am and mouthing off with his gun in his hand about how he is going to shoot John, I had a long haul to make so I went to work and I called John to warn him. Johns wife made him call the police for an escort rather than waiting for the check in the mail, and I was the one that Rich told this to so as soon as the cops show up, he knows I did it. A 3rd coworker(Sam) calls me on the company cell phone telling me not to come back, I'd be in danger. I stopped at the police station on my way back to the office and found the same officer that escorted John and told him that it looks like I need the same treatment. I quit that day, it was the first day that John was done with the company after his 2 weeks notice. Next day, I get a call from my dad to let me know that Sam had overdosed. Rich lost 3 out of 5 employees in a span of 36 hours. Sam overdosed on drugs that Rich kept trying to push on all of us employees. Within a month, the other 2 employees also left, one was my father and due to safety issues that Rich would not fix and OSHA and the EPA did not care about, he had an acetylene explosion at face level from inches away.

            "Back in 2004 I worked at a pizza place, one of those take-and-bake joints. Had one of the best bosses ever - totally chill, would come in after her shift was done to help out if we were getting slammed, and would hang out after work and drink beers, shoot the shit, and it was a great opportunity to build relationships with the people you worked with. Eventually shit came to a head in her personal life and she had to make a change. Ended up quitting the job to go back to school, and eventually work for her parents business.\n\nThe manager who was hired was not equipped to work with younger people and it showed, almost immediately after she was given full reign of the store. One day I came in after closing the previous night and before I got behind the counter, she was screaming at me about how shitty of a job I did the night before. In front of the entire store - customers, employees, the truck driver dropping off our shipment (of which I came in to put away). That was my clue this probably won't be working out.\n\nThat happened in January, and by the start of May I was out. I got a different job and within 6 months all but 3 people from my crew were gone & replaced. She didn't last more than a year managing that place. In the 10 years after I quit (I lived nearby and didn't get sick of their pizza, prob the best in town), they probably went through 4 or 5 managers. Real bad, considering my boss was manager for at least 5-6 years.",
            "I worked at a AAA game publisher in the SF Bay Area for almost 4 years. If you don't know much about the game industry, there's a long and storied history of worker exploitation and underpaying. The reason for this is because there's a long line of people trying to get into the game industry and not enough jobs to go around. To put it in simply, worker supply far outpaces worker demand. \n\nAnyway at this game publisher, my entire engineering group was severely underpaid, to the point that one could get a 60% to 80% pay increase just by moving to a normal tech company in The Bay Area. At some point, we did an internal anonymous review, and nearly everyone on the team rated their pay as too low. The manager took it up the chain, and it resulted in upper management re-affirming that our pay was \"within their margins for the area\". \n\nSince then, nearly all of the engineers independently left to go and take their skills elsewhere. This kind of thing isn't uncommon in the game industry. Remember, developed talent in creating games is infinitely more valuable than a fresh, untrained worker who's ready to be exploited. If you're wondering why games have gotten worse over the years, blame the labor practices of companies like the one I worked at.",
            "My husband worked for a city. Pay was lower than other places, local politics played a huge role in daily work, and he was basically on call for 24 hours. But the health care was very good and he could take \"comp time\" when kids had games and activities.\n\nThen came a new mayor and new city administer. This new administer had never worked in a city job. The mayor has a local company that struggles to find employers as most quit after only a few months.\n\nFirst thing they did was start to make unnecessary changes like new job responsibilities that upset all workers. Next they said there would be no raises this year due to needed budget cuts yet bought a new city vehicle for the administrator. BUT....the final straw was when they switched health insurance providers. Suddenly, the healthcare not only became high deductible but absolutely horrible to even use. To fill out a single claim would take pages of documentation. Many places would not even accept it and suddenly, many routine procedures started being denied. That was the last straw. Everyone started to quit. The only workers they could find are worthless and they don't last long.\n\nMy husband quickly found another job that pays about the same but the insurance is wonderful.",
            "Mentioned this in another thread, but a supervisor was possibly insane. Every little thing was an offense worthy of being screamed at by her. Most of the time she was wrong, just really liked screaming at people. The majority of us weren't even on her team, she went after everyone.\n\n\"Infractions\" were dumb things like being 15 minutes late clocking in when your shift doesn't start for another five minutes, taking a break at your desk, not taking a break you just got back from. She even yelled at other supervisors for coming in on their day off to get work done.\n\nSeveral employees, myself included, had nervous breakdowns because of her. HR would tell her to apologize and calm the hell down. She did neither.\n\nDemon supervisor coupled with the client's contract expiring and our hours getting cut to 4 hours/day ended with most of us quitting.",
            "I used to work for an internet  company that had a real problem with management abuses.  Just a general lack of respect for employees while pampering and rewarding executive management with no attempt to hide it.  \n\npeople started getting pissed off about it and quitting.  Then we'd try to hire replacements for them and management wasn't approving the replacement headcounts fast enough so jobs stayed unoccupied for months and months.  then when we tried to hire people, it would take 4-6 weeks to get an offer approved and submitted to the applicant, by which time most had already taken other jobs.\n\nthis got more people disillusioned so more people quit.  Management eventually realized we were in an emergency situation of attrition, and we frantically started hiring anyone with a pulse.\n\nSo then people would show up for work their first day, and find out that the person who hired them had quit.  we had all kinds of people sitting around collecting a paycheck, but with no one to report to, no project assignments...many of them had other job offers and quit without notice.\n\neventually our parent company looked at us hemorrhaging people, several times as many leaving as we could hire and they decided to shut the company down.  One monday morning there were security guards at the front door with a clipboard, they told you if you were laid off or not.",

Most of the employees had been there for at least 5 years, some close to 10. \n\nNew guy comes in and is just an ass. No one worked fast enough, everyone was dumb, he kept trying to make them do tasks differently when the old way had been working just fine. Major power trip type guy. \n\nThere was about a week between old guy leaving and the new guys \"grand re-opening\". They all (about 20 employees) stayed that whole week, new guy was a dick from day one. But they stayed, so they could walk out an hour before they re-opened. \n\nLike half the town showed up and he had to explain to them that he couldn't open because *everyone* quit. He hired new staff the next week, they all quit. Tried again, couldn't keep anyone longer than a day. \n\nEventually, after being open less than a full day over about a month, he gave up and sold the place then bought a different building a few towns over.\n\nOld owner heard and sent his son to buy back the building. Almost immediatly the old staff came back, they \"re-re-opened\", and it was smooth sailing from there. \n\nNew guys place got robbed like 3 days after he moved equipment in and he still can't keep staff.

            "Worked at Toys R Us a few years ago. They had a rule where an employee could not approach a customer if they saw them steal something. The employee had to witness it, then get a manager who then had to witness it. And since the only cameras that worked were point at the cash registers to make sure the cashiers didnt steal, hardly anyone got caught. When day one, a girl was walking to the break room and saw a lady put multiple things into her baby stroller, which was empty, meaning no baby. She was attempting to the leave the store, didnt bother buying anything to throw suspicion, just tried to walk out. The girl confronted her and when she tried to run the employee grabbed her arm and the thief scratched her arm. i was outside getting carts and I saw the lady bolt out of the store into traffic. about 30 minutes later I was called into the manager office to be told not to go after the thief, explained I was already outside...they didnt care. Another hour went by a the girl who confronted the thief was fired. She was well liked by everyone, and since they cared more about their employees stealing then customers, all but like 3 people quit. It was the holiday season.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL/DR Toys R Us was more worried about their employees stealing than customers. Caused an entire shift to quit at once\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit. Forgot to mention, the manager on duty was told about her and didnt do anything about it. \n\nAnd we knew about the liability for not interacting with thieves. It was just a perfect storm for stress cause by management."

The only thing I honestly want is to spend every waking moment with my young children. The thought of them growing up without me, without knowing who I am, is probably the thing that weighs most heavy on my mind. \n\nBut as far as actionable list items, I need to climb a mountain again. I grew up near the Rockies and have backpacked and hiked all through the southern Rockies. I keep thinking about when I'm done with chemo seeing if I can't bag a few of the simpler peaks nearish the Denver metro area. I'd like to start a group in Indianapolis with this or similar hikes/climbs in mind, but haven't done so yet. I'll look into starting this though. \n\nAlso, if anyone else in the Indy area needs anything, please DM me. I'm doing okay and would love to help someone in need out. Great thought OP!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the ideas everyone. I'm going to look into getting a small digital video camera that myself or my wife can grab whenever to record what we are up too with the kids. I'll capture a lot of cell phone vids as well, but that can be cumbersome when trying to get an event. \n\nEdit2: Thank you kind stranger for the gilding. You are much too kind and I wish you all the best\n\nEdit3: Sorry it took so long to do it, but I've tried to reply back to everyone who responded. I will keep trying to do so if anyone wants to keep a conversation going. I will be attempting to get an Indy hiking group together and maybe planning a CO trip for some indeterminate date in the future. You are all extremely kind and good people and I wish a million, billion blessings on each of you. \n\nEdit 6 (Sept '18): Hi! I'm still around and get a few messages a month asking how I am. Basically it looks like surgery is kind of out of the picture, so I'm back on the chemo train. Down seven infusions for this second go around and after six the response was quite significant. They changed up my regimen from the first time and this stuff is working just as well. I'm still going to work, still hanging out with the family. Still doing all I can to get ahead of the cancer and get rid of it. Thank you all for the kind words and messages. I edited out Edits 4 & 5 because they were basically saying the same thing as this, only at prior points in my treatment. ",

This time it is inoperable, because it is skull based, but chemo begins next week. If I don't make it, I am content with that. I found out who I was and what I wanted out of this life 19 years ago, and no, unless your work is really important, it will never define you. I can say that I truly lived and can die at any time without regrets and full of inner peace and happiness.

            "My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer this spring. He's gone through two rounds of chemo and so far it has actually done a good job of shrinking the tumors. He's pretty miserable while doing chemo but he has reasonably long stretches between treatments when he feels fine. Based on his age and overall health, he could live more than a year, maybe a couple years. But it's pancreatic cancer... we are not taking anything for granted.\n\nHe's already taken a trip to Italy (where he was born), and he's visited or made plans to visit many old friends. We're all doing our best to just do everything normally. I will grieve after he's gone, not before.\n\nThe one thing he really, really wanted that he never got was an old Volkswagen bus. He used to own one, years ago, but had to sell it for various reasons. Around 20 years ago he bought a \"restorable\" one. Basically a rusty shell. He paid a local VW mechanic thousands of dollars over several years and did lots of free database work for him, but the guy was a total flake and took him for a ride. He managed to get back about half the cash he paid, but of course no work had been done, and he was also out all the time he spent working on the guy's database. Several years later, the mechanic died in a shop accident, and that was that.\n\nHe sold the shell some years ago for a few hundred bucks. It had been sitting in our driveway for years doing nothing.\n\nNow, old VW buses (specifically the split-window ones that he loves) have exploded in price, and not only is it not feasible to do a full restoration on one, he can't even really afford to buy one in rough but drivable condition.\n\nI thought about looking up local VW clubs and seeing if anyone would be willing to lend their bus to us for a day or a weekend or something, but I'm not sure if that's realistic. I don't know if anyone would be willing to lend out their rare and expensive classic car to a total stranger. On top of that, I'm afraid that even if I do manage to score a VW bus for a weekend, it'll only lead to him feeling worse because it's not *his.*\n\nSo I'm not sure. I think I just wanted to talk about this. I still think he would love to drive one before he dies.\n\nEDIT: Before anyone goes too nuts, I still need to contact the Twin Cities VW Club and find out if they know anyone who would be willing to lend us a bus or ride along or something. They seem to have a good number of meets through the summer so maybe we can find something. I've just not put a lot of effort into this yet because I wasn't sure if my dad would want to. But if I can get something arranged ahead of time, I think he would really enjoy it.\n\nAlso, thanks for all the well-wishes and support!\n\nEDIT 2: Going to a VW club meeting tomorrow evening to talk to some people and hopefully set something up. There were tons of other great suggestions and offers in response to this post that I am looking into as well. One thing is for sure - I will definitely get my dad behind the wheel of a VW bus, even if only for a little while.",

It takes about an hour to give and you get cookies and juice (usually). Do it!\n\nEdit: Awesome to see all the interest! A lot of people have said they are unable to donate blood (for one reason or another). There are other options out there! Sign up for organ donation, bone marrow donation, plasma/platelet donation, or even donating your blood for research purposes. If you can't donate, ask your local blood bank where you can!

But I love talking about movies, too, and I think...maybe...I could do that well. And that's most of what I do at home--I sit around and talk to my mom and my friends about movies--so if I made a bunch of videos of that, she'd have them once I died, and it'd pretty much be like I was there, which she would like, and knowing that would make me feel good too. And it'd be way more fun putting thoughts and videos together if it felt like you people were watching, 'cause that's how my brain works I guess.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: I registered a YouTube channel for movie reviews, and if, well, you cool people who have liked this post did two more clicks and subscribed to the channel, and then I guess went and liked a few of my stupid videos once I get it set up, if you want--even if it was just out of like, pity or charity or whatever 'cause it's dumb...well, that would be pretty wizard.

Ice made it farther so that's great. But when it was really iffy the only thing I wanted to was pay off my car and all the medical debt I was getting because I didn't want my family to have to deal with it. I was super close this year. I only had $5k left on my car and paid my medical stuff off leaving just a personal loan I had to take out when I missed a ton of work and some lady hit me on the highway on my way home and totaled my car so I've had to start over there.\n\nIt's been a rough couple of years but if anything I've made it a lot longer than expected. I know people who had way fewer and less severe issues than me that didn't make it. Being completely honest there's nothing crazy on my bucket list that tanks higher than making sure all my stuff is taken care of so my dad won't have to if something happens.

I dropped out of school a few years ago and I've been super depressed and anxious and trying to get my life on track for sometime (even before this).\n\nI always felt something was wrong with me and kept asking to get scans by my doctors but never had any symptoms until a high LT blood test warranted ultra sounds. \n\nApparently that's a thing, where people can walk around with growing cancer and not even know until it's too late.  \n\nthought being diagnosed with something would allow me to pinpoint the problems I have  instead of my ambiguous suffering, but now I realize this probably had little to do with my low energy and severe paralyzingly anxiety since I've had that for years and it was just exponentially getting worse.\n\nAnyway, now that i know I'm fucking dying, it's the exact opposite of the sort of breaking bad liberation I might have expected.

            "Not technically dying, but have considered ending my suffering on my own. Intense, chronic pain from a severe lower spine injury in March 2004. Botched surgery and poor post-op care resulted in permanent nerve damage, that on my best days feels like I'm being slapped in the nuts every 10 seconds and someone hitting my leg bones with a 5# sledge hammer. On some potent opioids but it only takes the edge off a little bit for a few hours a day. \n\nBeen kickin' it like this for just over 13 years in hopes of medical advancements, but due to this happening at work the Workman's Comp insurance won't pay for stem cell treatments which apparently do work, and Medicare won't cover it because it's still \"experimental\". Would be great just to have pain levels cut in half, amazing if I could walk without a cane, a miracle if I could go hiking, run or ride a bicycle, and work again. \n\nI just keep hanging on at this point for my family because my older brother took his own life in 2005, at age 34, due to not being able to get clean (meth) and my younger sister died in 2013, also at age 34, due to a long illness. I currently have custody of my sister's 15 year old son who has gone through Hell, having been essentially (and legally) kidnapped by his biological father who ran off with the babysitter when nephew was a year old, then once he got awarded custody after divorce proceedings, stuffed his son in a boys home rather than actually raise the special needs kid he stole from the only family he ever knew. But I fought for him and the father & stepbabysitter finally agreed to give me temporary custody and I've had him for about 18 months. He's supposed to get Social Security Survivor Benefits but it goes to his father, and they pass it along to me but they keep a huge chunk for themselves and don't pay any child support, so as you might imagine it's pretty tough to get by on that and my small monthly disability check. I'd have the SS Survivor Benefits sent directly to me, and I could have that done, but the father would just take him back and stuff him in another boys home to be abused more and I refuse to let that happen, so I make do.\n\nSo as I opened with, not technically dying but certainly feel like it. My only wishes, which I doubt anyone can help with, is for the biological father to actually support his child and for me to receive stem cell treatments so that I might be able to get my life back, and get back to working so I can build that life. Maybe even find a good woman, get married and have a family of my own. At age 40, that's looking less and less likely to happen, so I guess just pray for us if that's your thing.",

I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.*\n\n>*I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.*\n\n>*As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.*\n\n>*In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.*\n\n>*Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.*  ",

            "I could die tomorrow, any one of us could. So how can we help each other today?",
            "This will probably get buried but whatever. My fiance who lives in England (I'm from USA), we've known each other for years and plan on getting married soon, but she does have some crippling diseases she's developed recently. Myocarditis ( inflammation of the middle layer of the heart) and Churg-Strauss (EGPA) which causes inflammation of blood vessels, being the main two. We found out during a normal checkup about a year ago, the doctor found scarring in three places on her heart, so we canceled a 3 month trip for her to come to America otherwise she would've died in a couple weeks. Got started on Chemotherapy immediately for three months which I visited for instead to support her. That helped relieve the myocarditis to a dormant state. She's been on some basic steroids (Azathioprine) the past year but has been getting weaker and weaker. After more scans and tests they've found her bone marrow has been deteriorating and decide to put her on a monthly injection of Mepolizumab. So far it's been helping her tremendously and has taken away her own personal stigma she felt from taking multiple pills a day, but the hard part is the cost. There, she has the NHS and it's free. Yearly cost in America can be $12,000+ and I'm only 21, lost my job three months ago, living off my savings and generous friends/family who offer dinner or other small needs, job market in my area is very sparse. I've been considering joining the Navy to help pay for this, I had good grades, smart guy, dad did nuclear work for the Navy before and right now it pays very well and I believe I can shoot straight into that line. But the biggest thing of all this is just hearing her hurting every day and worrying about our future because doing all this at my age with only a high school diploma and now no income is hard. We're going through the process with USCIS (Immigration Services) to get married soon and it's been hard. I don't know what to ask for other than just some emotional support for us because we've wanted this for about 5 years now and the future of her health is very uncertain. ",

My doctor is pushing chemotherapy but I really don't want to die that way. \n\nI haven't told my family yet. My wife wouldn't understand and my father is getting married in a month. I'm going to wait to tell them until I feel the time is right. \n\nIn the meantime, I have no one to talk to about this. If someone has the time, I'd love someone that I can talk to about this. Getting the stuff off my chest would be absolutely fantastic. ",
            "Exactly 1 year ago TO THE DAY I was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 Lung cancer (Non smoker), that has moved to my lymph nodes, spine and clavicle. It's unlikely I'll see christmas.

I have a beautiful wife that loves me, two little girls that make me laugh, A house, a cat, a dog, and family and friends that really care. I had the career I wanted as a child, and I live in an area that has great healthcare. There are SO many people with cancer, but are alone, or not in areas they can get good support. \nI am very lucky.\n\nThe govt gave me back my superannuation (401k) money when I became terminal. I had the option to renovate my house for my family (a rundown house that we had JUST purchased), or invest it in my girls' schooling. I chose the latter, as I know my girls will be looked after when I am gone. That brings me joy. My only regret is that I am not alive long enough to make them a nice place to live. My chemo makes me too sick to work, so money is light. When I'm not sick, I have plenty of energy and strength (for now) I am going to do my best to fix my house where I can. I'd appreciate any links to good home maintenance videos. Skylight installations, Old home fixing tricks, floorboard laying etc. I love that stuff.\n\nMy bucket list is really only to help others with my remaining time. If I can remind someone to call their family, or forgive something, then that is enough for my list. Give some spare change to a cancer foundation. I am alive right now due to research breakthroughs made by donations. Every day I have is another day with my family.\n\nTL:DR. I'm dying but its ok. My bucket list is for you to tell your mum you love her, donate to cancer charity, post me home renovation tips. ",

I was dead. I flatlined for 5 minutes. The nurses of the small town didn't know what they were doing so I was gone for probably about 7-9 minutes. I survived. But they didn't know if I would make it to 1. I was 1 lb 2 oz I was adopted 6 months later by an American family, right after I got out of incubator care. I weighed 4 lbs. The nurses there told my parents that I had hip dysplasia and could be fixed. They got to America only to be told that I had cerebral palsy, pretty severe. They prepared my parents for the worse, that I wouldn't be able to walk, or talk, and if lucky I would make it through high school (don't expect college to be a goal) with the amount of damage done to my brain. They said I would maybe even be a restrained to a wheelchair, needing help with everything. I walked when I was 4 almost 5. All by myself. I struggled with math. I struggled to look myself in the mirror because I was a product of a woman who did drugs and smoked and did damage to her baby and now I was stuck with the consequences every day. I was severely bullied because of my CP. I had two major surgeries one when I was young and another when I was older to help my gait and ability to walk. I graduated high school with a 3.5 GPA. and I'm graduating college in a year. I can walk and even run. I have had 16 year of physical therapy to help my muscles stay loose and all that good stuff. And I have almost made it to 21. I pushed myself and now I hike mountains and workout in my free time. Even though my balance is a huge issue I don't let that stop me. I can even rock climb.

February of 2016 she was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer that had spread to her spine and hip.  She's on daily chemo pills called iBrance now as well as monthly infusions and shots.  The side effects suck, but she's  been a trooper.  The doctors gave her a median life expectancy of five years.   We are doing the best we can to make the most of that time.  We leave on a 7 day cruise next month.  We will snorkel barrier reefs in three different locations.

            "My tip to anyone who knows they are going to die soon: Talk to your children and/or parents about your will, discuss with them any inheritance, and what kind of funeral you want.\n\nWorst case you don't die and you've done that earlier than strictly needed, so it's never a bad investment of time.

This has been a nightmare for me, as I'm the one caring for him, albeit from a distance, as we weren't able to find a single floor 3 bedroom home within our budget that would suit him. He has become basically paralyzed from the waist down recently, and this man still has a smile on his face everyday, through the tears, he's still alive and happy. His bucket list is small, he wanted of course another summer alive, I'm not sure that will happen, but we can hope. A motorized scooter/wheelchair, which insurance has given us the run-around over thus far. And the possibility of dying in the care of myself, girlfriend and grandson. I can't give him these things unfortunately, and it's a horrible feeling of failure, but the one thing I can give him is my time and love, I've neglected my life and responsibilities the last 6 months, and i'll never regret a minute of it.  To all the people in this same or similiar situation, I love you, I'm sorry, and I wish you the best.  \n\nThank You Reddit, I really needed to say this to someone..

            "28, female - A month ago I was given an estimate from the doctors of 1-4 months left without treatment, 2-8 months with treatment. Stage 4 breast cancer with metastases to my bones, lung, right femur, and most importantly - spinal cord and spinal fluid (among other areas I'm forgetting right now). \n\nThe life-limiting disease is the cancer in my spinal cord and spinal fluid, called Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (Leptomeningeal metastases). A year ago I beat cancer (Stage 3 Triple Negative breast cancer) with chemo, radiation, surgery - but it came back with vengeance.\n\nI found out a few days before I was induced (34 weeks pregnant at the time), and they had to induce me so that they could run more invasive tests without causing harm to my son. First time pregnancy, thought I just sucked at being pregnant - turns out I had fractured ribs and severely high calcium in my blood from the bones disintegrating into my blood. I was very, very out of it during that time (seeing people/things that weren't there; I legit went crazy for a period of time before my calcium levels were sorted out). My fiance stayed by my side for weeks in the hospital while the hospital kindly kept our son in the nursery until I was able to go home.\n\nNow, a month later, my Occupational Therapist and Physical Therapist have since discharged me (they came to my house a few times a week), but my nurse still comes to check on me once a week. \n\nBecause of the cancer in my spinal cord, I have lost most usage of my left eye due to damaged nerves from the cancer in my spine. I see permanent double vision out of my left eye and usually have to keep it closed and/or wear an eye patch. I can, however, focus with it for short periods of time and only at a very specific angle, so if I'm sitting still looking at one thing it's able to be used.\n\nI'm currently on a chemotherapy pill to help with the cancer that's in the rest of my body, though it won't have an effect on the cancer in my spine and spinal fluid. This chemo is meant to just help prevent more cancer from spreading throughout my body and causing more pain. I believe it's working after only being on it for a week, but as my pain gets better I know that it's not extending my time left here with my amazing new little family.\n\nIt breaks my heart to know that my first and only child will not be able to know me, and I him. I love him so unbelievably much, and not to mention my amazingly supportive and caring fiance who has taken such great care of us while maintaining a full time job to support us. I'm spending every waking moment getting to know our son and just being with my fiance. My family comes to visit as often as they can - they're 700 miles away in New Jersey (we're in Michigan). It's incredibly hard to know that you're dying and there are family members you won't be able to see before you pass.\n\nBucket List? It'd be nice to go on a train ride in a cabin and see some amazing landscapes out the windows. Most of what was on my bucket list was just travel-related or camping with my family. A lot of stuff I can't really do because my mobility is so severely limited. But for now, my main goal is to get things in order so that my son can have some semblance of who I was as he grows up. I'm going to start writing his birthday cards for when I'm not here, some videos and maybe recordings of me talking and reading some books. I also have other things I need to get in order for the rest of my family - letters and such. So right now I'm just focused on family. 150%, family. I also am trying to see everyone as often as possible to make some new good memories before I pass. I would also like to be able to somehow get out to NJ to visit my Grandma as she is unable to leave the house, and she hasn't even met her Great-Grandson. He's a month old and there are so many other family members that haven't met him yet. But I also don't know realistically if it's possible for me to travel that far, especially since I'd want to bring my fiance and 1 month old son.\n\nI thought that I could be the savior for my family, we've had it rough these last few years. We've lost a lot and been through hell and back. My Grandma isn't doing so great since the passing of my Pop-Pop 2 years ago (also to cancer). I was so excited to tell everyone we were pregnant - it lifted everyone's spirits. We didn't think it was possible to get pregnant because of all the different chemotherapy I was on (they have a very high chance of causing infertility). And we were just over the moon when we found out, I didn't even believe it until they tested my blood! Then, when I had our baby, I got to tell everyone the good news about him then break their hearts the next minute telling them I have 1-4 months left here with them. It truly hurts. \n\nThere's so much more to write about and this is the most I've ever talked about at once other than with my fiance. So, apologies for the rant and if you made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time. Before I die I'd honestly just want to know I made a difference (a positive difference) in someone's life.\n\nIt sounds all made up and frankly I wish it were. It's still hard to believe that this is real life. With how happy our son has made us and how close we feel now as a family, that even feels surreal. We have such happiness with him and he definitely helps distract us from the sadness. I also have billions of forms of proof as being diagnosed with something like this tends to leave you with 5lbs of papers for discharges/prescriptions/test results etc.\n______________________________\n**TL;DR** 28 female, 1-4 months to live, was 34 weeks pregnant when diagnosed with Stage 4 Triple Negative Breast Cancer with mets to bones, lung, right femur, spinal cord & spinal fluid (Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis/Leptomeningeal metastases), had baby, currently 1 month into diagnosis.",

            "I don't have a year left, but I'll have a much shorter life than most. Doctors have been estimating my death since I was born pretty much.\nThe most recent one it seems is within 5 years. \nI can feel myself getting weaker as I get older, and it's definitely becoming more painful.\n\nI've got a lot of different problems, that on their own would be fairly manageable, but together have created a big issue that can't really be fixed. If they fix one thing it interferes and worsens the other, and vice versa. So at this point they just kind of don't do anything but try and keep me as comfortable as possible. Which is fine by me.\n\nI'm 20 currently, almost 21, so I've already lived 20 years longer than the doctors thought possible at first.\n\nI don't have many dreams in life, or a huge bucket list. And I've even already crossed one off!\n\nI want to:\n\nMeet Stan Lee, which I got to do last year!\nMeet Peter Capaldi\nMake a real movie (my goal in life is to be a filmmaker. I'm trying to go to film/art school soon. Specifically I want to specialize in editing).\nAnd lastly, I want to own a movie theater, which I realize is the most unlikely option, and one I most likely will never achieve. And that's ok. It's fun to dream at least.\n\nI love film. It's my passion. And so that's why the last two are there.\n\nI'm a huge Marvel fan, which is why I was dying to meet Stan Lee. I had been trying for literally years but my health always got in the way. But finally I got to go to SVCC and meet him last year. It was hard and really tiring on me. But it was an amazing experience.\n\nAnd lastly, I'm a major Doctor Who fan. And 12 is my favorite! Meeting Peter is my next goal, but I just have to wait/hope he comes to a con near me one day.\n\nFor the record I'm not posting this to ask for help or anything. Even though I know the thread is about how others can help. I just wanted to share my bucket list is all.\n\nAnd sorry if the formatting is messed up. I'm on mobile and sometimes it comes out good and sometimes it doesn't."

That's it. That is all he said. \n\nI, on the other hand, was, and still am, an absolute idiot. What I interpreted from what he said was, 'The answer to every question *is* observing.' Now, I knew this kid had the smarts i didn't have, so i took what he said very seriously and unfortunately very literally. \n\nMy parents were freaking out, my school had to call my parents multiple times and eventually we had a big meeting, that ended up landing me in therapy because for nearly a solid year, the only thing i ever said to anyone was 'observing.'\n\n2 x 2=? *Observing*\n\nWhat do you want for tea? *Observing*\n\nWhat is on the TV? *Observing* \n\nWhy the hell are you such a stupid fucking kid? *Observing*",

            "My old art teacher told our class a bunch of stories about weird things kids did in her class through the years before she retired. Before she worked at our school, she worked as an English teacher at the juvenile court school. All of the kids there had issues, but there was this one kid who really stuck out to her. \n\nShe was assigned to teach him, but the catch was that he had to be in solitary in order to be taught. She was also told that he needed to be watched at all times because he ALWAYS tried to escape class (and usually was successful). \n\nWhen she taught him, there was a guard posted at the door, the windows were locked and boarded up, and the door was kept locked. The only things in the room were his desk, his chair, and her desk, so that he couldn\u2019t hide either (apparently he was also extremely good at that). \n\nThe first time she had to teach this kid, they were put in a solitary room, but it had a closet. The kid went missing, and about three hours later they found him taking a nap at the bottom of the closet (they missed him the first time they checked there).\n\nANOTHER time she had to teach him (this time the room did not have a closet, or any other visible places he could hide), she left the room for something (probably to go to the bathroom), and when she got back, the kid was gone. The guard was there the whole time, and the room was basically sealed\u2014there was no way he could have gotten out. Once again, there were also no places he could really hide. The school went on a lockdown while they tried to find this kid. \n\nAbout two hours pass, and they finally find the kid when he *pushes away the paneling on the wall of the classroom and steps out* to casually ask if he could go to the bathroom. This kid opened up the goddamn wall and climbed inside to hide, causing no one to be able to find him for HOURS.",

We have school swimming lessons, and you could either get changed in the change rooms or the toilets/ showers, since i am a shy person, i would always use the showers to get changed, figures he followed me in there, got dressed outside my door, and just when i was leaving my cubicle, he was just there, dancing naked.  I died inside that day.",

            "A kid I grew up with started wearing home made chain mail to school our freshman year of high school. Every day. For all 4 years. \n\nHe was always pretty odd, but he was nice enough. Plus we had a few classes together thru middle school and we had connected over a shared love of a few videogames, so I felt comfortable asking him why he started wearing it all of the sudden. \n\nHe proceeded to explain the defensive benefits of chain mail vs. both sharp and blunt instruments of harm. For like 5 solid minutes. Daggers. Pikes. Hammers. Even how curved blades like katana and falchions would struggle against it! \n\nI basically just shrugged and told him \"I mean, makes sense.\" And we both went to our classes. \n\nI don't know what I expected, but I guess it wasn't the basic defensive benefits that armor offers.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you all! This is a much more widespread phenomenon than I had thought! This all took place in Wyoming (before it ceased being) for all the people wondering if it was their own knightly scholar.\n\nEdit 2: I believe he wore an undershirt, then armor and then an over shirt. The armor was about 55lbs (I think) and it had a full hood (widows peak and all) and sleeves. This was in the 2000's so school shootings were definitely a thing, but not quite a weekly event, yet (yay America!). Also, I'm not gonna say his name, like I said, he was always nice and I'm not about to dox an old homie. Plus Wyoming has like 35 people in it, so... yeah...\n\nI also was not trying to shame him at all, I think it was way cool and creative. Like the thread may suggest, a little weird, but I absolutely applaud the ingenuity to craft it all himself, so I don't want anyone who reads this to think I was shaming or bullying.\n\nIf you want to make chainmail for school or work or church or whatever, hell yeah, lil homie, be your own beautiful self!

            "As someone who was in high school during 1990, I can say that I think things would have been far worse.\n- People would have HAD to go to work, or not be paid. My mom worked in an office and there was no way she could have worked remotely. My stepdad was in sales, and you couldn\u2019t really do that from home. \n- You think the run on toilet paper was bad this past year? Imagine no internet or social media, and smaller grocery stores, and everyone panicking because they are getting some \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d type vibe from the network news.\n- Phone lines would 100% have crashed - because a strong storm could still take them out. Long distance calling (at least in the US) was still expensive, so no hanging on the phone with your friends either\n- No internet\n- No Netflix\n- Blockbuster would have been sold out in about 5 minutes.\n- There would have been home schooling, but it would have really underlined the class divide. Rich kids usually had encyclopedias and lots of books around. Poor kids did not. Most homework involved reading books or looking things up, either in encyclopedias or in the library. I would bet that libraries would have closed.\n- No online shopping means all the things we\u2019re having delivered now (masks, groceries, etc) would have to be purchased by someone going out and getting them.\n- I also agree that martial law would have been a real possibility, if only for crowd control\n- Finally, for all that we gripe about things, the internet and mobile phones have been an equalizer of sorts - giving us all a way to connect and stay entertained during lockdown. I\u2019m thinking back to my house in 1990... and I would have gone through every book in the house about 45 times by now at least. We didn\u2019t have a Nintendo, and we didn\u2019t have a computer. We had a very old typewriter, but I\u2019m sure that would have gotten old in about a week. If the library stayed open, then maybe there would have been a glimmer of hope. But with limited phone time, and no texting/social media, I feel Iike small neighborhoods would have banded together in unforeseen ways - some good, and some isolating. If you were living in a very poor area, it might have made it worse. If you were very wealthy, it might be like now, where you didn\u2019t really notice any real difference - just minor inconveniences.\n\nOn the plus side:\n- I think the government would have been far more motivated for stimulus payments because people could not work remotely - so either risked spreading disease or staying home\n- With not many kids having computers or video games, creativity would have soared (because kids have been entertaining themselves in less than ideal conditions since time began)\n\nEDIT: this has been my most liked post ever! Wow! Thanks everyone for all the awards :) made my day!\n\nSECOND EDIT: yes, microwaves and dishwashers were around. My point was that they were a lot more expensive than they are today. We didn\u2019t have either, nor did anyone I knew. We got our first microwave in 91, and it was a hand me down from a relative - it also worked only sporadically. We also didn\u2019t have video games. I guess TIL I grew up a lot poorer than I ever thought!",

It feels like there was a big jump in mobility in the last 30 years, so it's possible that it would not have spread as far in the first place.  However, let's assume it did get your neighborhood.  On the downside, the internet was really in widespread use, so no work or school from home, so you would have to interact with others.  However, on the upside, no internet means no social media spreading false information.  There were only a small amount of news outlets, and while they aren't perfect, I think they would have given better information than what some people are getting now.  There would have been very little cries that it's all a hoax on network TV back then, so the general public might take it more seriously.  I think Bush Sr would also have taken it seriously, so having the President on television telling you that there is a problem does a lot to convince people that there's a problem.",

            "I have read up quite a bit on how the covid vaccine was made. We relied a lot on research that was done starting in 2005. If this had happened in the 90s we would not have gotten a vaccine so fast. There is a misconception that we developed the vaccine too fast. However we actually have years of research on it. In 2005 a man started working in his lab to create a vaccine for MERS which is another type of caronavirus. It wasn't as contagious and basically got swept under the rug but this guy created the first RNA caronavirus vaccine. We basically just took that research and plugged in the new virus. Kind of like how you can plug in numbers to an equation that we know is true. This dude spent 10 years trying to make the first RNA vaccine and using his research we were able to make a working vaccine before Covid-19 was considered to be a global pandemic. The rest was just perfecting it and testing it. We took no short cuts when it came to medical trials. We just had a great head start from a dude that was interested in MERS.\n\nIf covid had happened in 1990 there is a good chance it would have taken years to come up with a vaccine instead of months. We are pretty damn lucky.\n\nEdit: shit I wrote this right before bed so I didn't get to see this blow up. I'm sorry I didn't do my best writing.I have dyslexia so sometimes details get really fuzzy and my spelling sucks.I was not just writing about Katalin Kam though. She did good research starting in the 80s. The part I was really highlighting was research done by Nianshuang Wang and Jason McLellan. They worked with the MERS virus, Katalin Kariko did not. Katalin Kariko worked more with RNA on its own. Both of these instances were stories of important research not getting funded because it was not deemed important or life saving enough. Also all the MERS research Nianshuang Wang and Jason McLellan did was based on Katalins research. All three of them worked with either Pfizer or Moderna on the vaccine. I think some people here liked good articles. If you want something to listen to I would go with the Boulder Vs Hill episode of the \"this American life\" podcast.https://www.thisamericanlife.org/727/transcript The first half of the episode is about the wild forest firefighters in California and the second half is about Jason and Nianshuangs research. \n\nI'm sorry if I focused on one more than the other or forgot names. I think there are a lot of contributors to creating the vaccine. I really did look into this a lot but with my dyslexia it is way easier for me to understand stuff when I've also have interesting audio information to rely on.",

Windows 3.1 would not have been released yet in 1990, so you had Apple computers and that was about it.  And it was 24k modems, not even 56k yet, so everything would be sloooooooow.  Maybe if all you did was paperwork a fax machine could work, but not well.\n\nIn short, more people would be infected because more people would need to gather together for work.  And more people would get bored and go to video stores and libraries.  And schools wouldn't be able to close unless the entire area closed because young kids can't study alone at home.  It would be a huge thing, and a pain in the ass, and a lot worse.

            "The main difference would be the medical response and time to develop a vaccine. Medical technology has come a long way and many countries are much more prosperous today. \n\nAs for everything else, it depends on how equal you want to make things. If you assume the virus originated in China, then in 1990 it's unlikely the virus would have left the country for the same reason MERS never became a pandemic. It was a poor country and almost nobody traveled to/from it.\n\nMisinformation would still be present. But you would have received it through the mail, fax, over the phone (automated calls) and through normal conversation.\n\nFor example I do not use social media, and I know all about the misinformation as well as other BS conspiracy theories (like flat earthers and 5G) because I hear it from people and it's reported on and corrected through the reputable media outlets.",
            "This is a pandemic that the US specifically was uniquely well equipped to botch despite knowing what needed to be done and how to do it. Others have touched on social media spreading misinformation. But additionally, the primary method of containing this virus relies on doing things for the benefit of other people at a time when the US is more divided than we\u2019ve ever been. I truly think we would have faired far better on that front in 1990, especially considering we would have a more competent leader at the helm.  \n\nThat said, I do not believe a vaccine would\u2019ve been made as quickly. So I think it could have simmered for an extended period of time instead of coming in such deadly waves.  \n\nEdit: phrasing",

That would drive less  competing judgments slowing down  progress and understanding. \n\nHolding the 99% or so survival rate constant, I would say it would have been better managed. \n\n\nHypotheticals!",

            "We wouldn't have a vaccine yet. Most of us (including myself until recently) aren't aware of the persistent work of a researcher on the initial development of a vaccine for the MERS Coronavirus. After YEARS of work, he was successful. Five science journals rejected his paper, finding it had low relevancy - the belief was a flu strain would cause a pandemic, not Coronavirus. \n\nThe sixth publishing attempt succeeded, and a few years later, here we are. Guess whose research was licensed to Pfizer and Moderna? Nianshuang Wang and his partners, rejected by five journals, told their work wasn't relevant, now saving the world. \n\nThis American Life covers them in episode 727. So yes, we have a vaccine in record time, except for the fact it's based on research that took years to complete. As always, the real heroes are invisible."

It's kind of funny, a guy is wearing a cell phone costume and talks like he is the traumatized phone of a teenager, telling in therapy about how it started and becoming more uncomfortable with the things his owner was sending. I think it ends with him getting or sending a new text and is upset and doesn't want to participate.\n\nI use several Australian psa videos in my classroom and I just can't find this one again. ",
            "Last week I was in Athens, Greece. Walking down the street, I glanced in the window of a restaurant. There were four men, twenty-something years old, sitting around a table drinks in hand laughing and celebrating something. All four were bald on top (maybe shaved?) with identical bandages on their heads. The bandages went from ear to ear horizontally across the back of the head, forming a half moon shape. The bandages were quite thick but I could still see blood beginning to soak through them.\n\nMy question: wtf was going on? Is there some sort of religious ritual or gang initiation that requires partial scalping? I'm not from Greece, so maybe this is a normal cultural practice I've never heard of?\n\nThere's no way that all four of those guys could have accidentally gotten injured in exactly the same way, but I can't think of a reason for all four to be cut there deliberately. The fact that they seemed to be celebrating whatever had happened to them makes it even stranger.\n\n",

            "Attending a bachelor party a long time ago.  The stripper came in, said hello, and went to the bathroom to fix herself up.  She peeked out the door and called one of them over.  Turns out, she went to high school with us, a couple of years younger.  She called a friend to replace her and she left.",
            "Not a sex worker. BUT! \n\nA girl from my high school became a somewhat popular cam model/amateur porn creator. (Nearly 50mil views on PH) My school was small so everyone knew everyone and she dated a good friend of mine for a while. As if she was fitting a stereotype, she was the very quiet \u201cnerdy\u201d shy girl in high school. \n\nI found out what she did, but made no attempt to reach out to her because I had no reason. One day I came across her porn snapchat account so I added it. My screen name on there is pretty much my full name so it wasn\u2019t like I was trying to be sneaky, however I assumed she was too busy to look at when people add her on things. \n\nShockingly enough she messaged me later that day and we chatted normally. She was super nonchalant about everything. Apparently another kid from our high school found out and went into her chatroom spamming her real name followed by question marks. So she politely asked that I didn\u2019t do that. Seemed pretty reasonable. This was a few years ago. \n\nWe are from the US but she ended up moving to a major city in Europe. I happened to be visiting the area last year with my cousin for a backpacking trip, so on a whim I decided to send her a Snapchat saying I was in town. Again I assumed she would be bogged down with messages from other people that she\u2019d never even bother to look. To my surprise again, she got back to me right away and we met for lunch later that week. \n\nI told my cousin we are meeting a friend and I informed him what she does for a living, but I told him not to bring it up unless she does. I wasn\u2019t sure how open she was about it in her day to day life. Sure enough, she showed up to lunch wearing a PH branded letterman jacket with her stage name on the back. Kind of set the tone for what she was cool with talking about. \n\nLunch was fantastic, we just chatted and caught up. She said we could ask her whatever we wanted to know, so all of my questions were about what it took for her to move to Europe. She also gave us tips of places to see while we were in town. \n\nTl;dr: A quiet girl from my high school, who I hadn\u2019t seen or talked to in years, moved away and became a cam model. While I was on vacation I decided to reach out to her on a whim, and we had a very wholesome lunch.",
            "My mom was a stripper when I was in elementary school. A 22 yo guy came in and paid for a lap dance and my mom recognized his last name and asked if he knew Ruth (I have no earthly idea why she would ask him given what she suspected). He got weirded out and said that Ruth was his mom and MY mom said that HIS mom was her daughters 3rd grade teacher. He then begged her not to tell his mom where he was. Apparently my mom just laughed and said she didn\u2019t want her daughters teacher knowing that she was there either. \n\nI hated that teacher, she was such a jerk to me because we were poor and my mom always dressed slutty. I\u2019m glad her kids weren\u2019t as uptight as she was.",
            "My much-younger brother was getting married, had a bachelor party at a strip club with a dozen of so high school friends. After about an hour there, a rather ordinary looking stripper comes on stage, takes off her top and our tables of guys goes wild, standing and applauding and hollering. I have no idea what is going on. The stripper looks through the stage lights, her eyes get really big, she grabs her top and runs offstage to the back. Bouncers come running over to our table, thinking we're starting trouble. Nope, it turns out all of the guys in his high school class had a history class with her a few years back.... she later came out and talked with us, said she never thought she'd see someone (let alone 12) she knew (it was in the next town over).",

            "In the mid-'90s my friends took me to a strip club for my bachelor party. A few cocktails and a few stage shows in and out walks an ex-girlfriend of mine. She was stunningly beautiful, but bat crap crazy. My friends desperately tried to get her to give me a lap dance offering her 5x the normal rate, but she refused. She said it would be too much of an emotional strain for her considering how intense our relationship was and ended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe ended up sitting with us between her floor shows and lap dances just chatting. She had gotten actually married and this was a way for her and her husband to save for a house. About halfway through the evening one of the other dancers grabbed me and pulled me up on stage whispered into my ear \"Are you wearing underwear?\" which I affirmed. She pulled my pants down, sat me on a chair mid-stage, and another girl loosely tied my hands behind my back. Each girl took turns giving me a lapdance up on the stage. Turns out my ex paid them all for a lap dance and arranged the entire thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFunny end to the story, after that event I was at work on the sales floor of a local bigbox retail chain working and in walks my ex. We chatted and half a good laugh. My lunch came and I went out into the mall towards the food court and my ex comes up besides me with a bit of a panicked look in her eye. She slides her arm under mine and leans in and kisses me on the cheek saying \"Let's go get that hot dog now\". Befuddled I walk with her towards the food court and she proceeds to tell me one of her regulars was in the mall and he was stalking her. She told him she was married and he didn't believe her so I got to play the part of her husband. I walked her out to her car after the hotdog and a leisurely chat to make sure she was safe and never heard from her again.",

He said no and I realized who it was as I walked away. He came in a few more times and avoided eye contact with me. When I was on stage he would look away. \n\nAnother story: my first day as a stripper I saw two guys from my high school. We chatted, then they both paid for lap dances.",

I was like, yeah right, \"I've only ever known one AJ, if it's true what's my name?\" And sure enough he put my real first name right there in the chat. \n\nWe were in youth group in church together almost a decade before that.

            "Not a sex worker, but found out a girl from high school, that i had a crush on, was a stripper. It was my buddies bachelor party. We load up in a van and head about an hour away to a \"better\" strip club. We get in and settle at a table. About 30 minutes in I get a tap on the shoulder and this sexy ass chick hops in my lap. She calls me by the nickname I had in highschool and hugs me. She was always Tom boyish in highschool, never wore make up, always competed well in gym, kinda nerdy, quiet, and reserved, but always very pretty if you thought about it.  I didnt recognize her for a full minute. It was a fun reunion. It was a full nude spot and she gave no fucks during her stage performance. Really seeing everything I really should have tried to pursue it in HS. But i was a dumbass back then. \n\nTL;DR she was a stripper and gave one hell of a show",
            "There was a girl I went to highschool with who was basically a walking stereotype. She fit so well into the archetypal 'ditzy blonde' mold that you might swear it was an act if you didn't know better.\n\nShe was also *fucking mean*. This girl was a power bitch and wasn't really nice to anybody as far as I'm able to remember. People orbited her because she was hot, and had everything.\n\nShe never really bothered me because I did my best to be invisible, but the handful of interactions I ever had with her left me feeling unpleasant.\n\nTurns out she wound up being a pretty lucrative stripper later in life. I bought a lap dance from her and while being nice is part of the job it really did feel like in those brief few minutes that she did have a genuine personality shift. She was way more laid back, you could even hear it in her voice. She even commented about how she wasn't \"a bitch like I used to be, *and* I have nicer tits.\"\n\nIt was a genuinely fun interaction. She seemed happier in comparison to the person I remembered.",
            "Kinda, sorta along the same lines...I guess. Once a friend wanted me to go to a strip club with him located outside a small town in Alabama. A young (REALLY young) looking girl got on the stage and he told me \"Look at her. Isn't she the prettiest thing you've ever seen?\" I said, \"Yeah, but she seems like she's too young to be working here.\"  \"Don't worry...she's 18.\" \"How do you know?\" I asked. \"She's my niece.\"\n\nI felt uncomfortable after that.\n\nOP here. And Wow! Just WOW! I was not expecting my post to get as much attention as it did. As a matter of fact, I thought it was such a throw-away comment that it didn\u2019t occur to me to even follow-up on it.\n\nBut to address all the comments (and messages) I\u2019ve gotten because of it: It happened in a small club way out in the county outside a town named Harvest, Ala. I don\u2019t know why its so important to folks to know that unless they are expecting to go there and see the girl for themselves (fat chance of that happening...it was about 10 years ago, so I seriously doubt she would still be there).\n\nAnother thing, so many are casting *doubt* about his character or the nature of his relationship with the girl. Trust me, his tone was that of a proud uncle, not a dirty, lusty one. You would have to know the area - meth and opioids have decimated rural Alabama to the point that it\u2019s refreshing to find a young person that is healthy and making an honest living. Besides that, I had known him for years. You will not find a more religious, God-fearing person.",
            "Was an RA in college and had a pair of residents on my wing who were both cam girls.

I also found out that night that they had a pet kitten in the room, another rumor I heard about them that ended up being true (but also heard they abused it pretty bad, poor thing). Anyways, as we made it up to their wing, one of the girls came to just as we entered their room and tried to play with the pet kitten. She rolled off the bed from her side, stumbled across the room in just a few steps, and ended up falling face first into the makeshift litter box they had set up for their cat...\n\nCat shit and cat litter flung everywhere. Our campus PD was so confused when they showed up to find sex toys and cat litter everywhere. Their dorm room nearly looked like a crime scene. What a time college was...

            "Last semester I ran a massage service, and I had this one client I particularly liked because he was so friendly, positive, and just smart as fuck...

Well, fast forward to \"one existential crisis and a college major change later,\" and this semester I have to take chemistry. Lo and behold, that really smart client is now my professor. Neither of us is currently acknowledging it, but I can tell that we still feel that bit of connection we did when he would come see me for massages.\n\n\n edit. It was massage, regardless of whether I\u2019m a licensed professional. Giving someone a HJ after working out their pain, tension, knots, etc. for an hour doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t massage them. I sympathize for those who are victims of sexual assault and harassment (I faced the same sort of things with my business) and that\u2019s never okay, but massage therapy is and probably always will be associated with sex work, and people who engage in either endeavor should be aware of the risks involved. The people who conduct sexual assault against other people are responsible, not me or anyone else who does sex work. I am not going to call my service just a hand job service or whatever else people want me to say because \u201ca massage service\u201d is the most accurate phrasing for the operation I was running. I did not at any time claim to be a licensed professional and I was always honest with clients about it. Yes, I am aware that it\u2019s illegal.

I always imagine that some of these people HAVE to be doing what im doing. They drive european cars and seem to always been in the gym for hours.\n\nSo one day, one of my regular johns hires me for a appointment. Normally, I just flex, jerk off and talk crap as im doing it.

Im hesitate yet after an increase in my hourly pay, I go through with it.\n\nLet me set the scene for you. (Vert NSFW)\n\n I've never worked with another sex worker before so i figured to thrust myself into the situation without any normalicy to lessen the awkwardness if that makes sense. I figured being fully nude and ready to go would be the easiest ice breaker to another sex worker rather then making small talk and slowly taking our clothes off. Im in the john's bedroom. Fully erected, oiled up and the john is getting the other guy from downstairs. I can hear them walking up as im very much indecent when my heart immediately drops....i know this guy. I see him every week for 3 or 4 years. We never spoke, but always gave a head node to each other. His face went white. My penis went limp. He acted like we never knew each other and I followed along.\n\n\"Hey bro, nice to meet you\"\n\n5 minutes later, our hands are on each others dicks looking at each other trying to put on a show for the john.

I massaged him, he massaged me, it was all dandy work and it was over. He left first and i stayed back with my john to hangout a bit.

            "Male stripper checking in.   Tl;dr getting caught almost cost me a career.\n\n In 2007 i was in stationed in Florida. Me and a couple buddies found out about a male strip club in the area and they had an amateur night. We drunkenly decided to go shake our shit on stage. None of us were worth shit at dancing, but we were in great shape and the club was actually looking for guys, so he offered the 4 of us some work. Me and 1 other accepted. I moonlit there for almost a month when one of my supervisors walked in with some of her friends one night.  We made eye contact, she had a confused look on her face for about 2 seconds, then it clicked. She sat down, waited for me to be available, and called me over. \n\nShe explained that since i was still in the AF at that time it was not ok to be a stripper, and that as of the end of the night i would be quitting or i would receive some serious repercussions on the military side. I smartly agreed to her demands, and offered her a lap dance, which she turned down. Her friend took me up on the offer instead. \n\nFor those interested: the job mostly sucked, but i made good money. Women think nothing of just grabbing a guy at any given time, wherever they reach first. Suddenly having a hand wrapped overly tight around my dong and/or balls was a nightly occurance, same for having my ass grabbed, or a customer trying to kiss me. IDK about other clubs, but in ours we still had \"house mom\" who made sure everyone was taken care of for food, water, and watched out to make sure we were still good to be on stage (ie noone too drunk, high, been roofied, etc) many female strip clubs have a similar role. That said, our Mom was also slanging every drug available from viagra to coke, weed to xtc, vicodin to flintstones gummies.

We'd met at some work drinks a few weeks before and I'd chatted with him and his wife for an hour or so, but I probably looked quite different out of context. I recognised him immediately and explained that we'd met before without explaining how I knew him, to protect my partner's privacy. I said that we're likely to run into each other again as we ran in the same circles and he'd really appreciate not having slept together should that happen.

He is still one of my best friends, and if he asked I would more than likely still sell him content because he was always so appreciative and wouldn't accept free content.

            "Years ago, my and a couple friends go to a strip club.  2 strippers come.over and sit by us, we end up talking and it turns out I live in the same neighborhood as them, and we have some mutual friends.  Including a guy I knew, who one of the girls used to date, call him A.  She had just started stripping, so she made me promise that I wouldn't say anything to him about seeing her there and her new job.  I said sure, no problem.\n\nNot 20 minutes later she goes up on stage, and I go up and sit by it to give her some dollar bills.  About halfway through she does the stripper crawl up to me, gets real close and whispers in my ear, \"is that A sitting over there?\"  I kinda laughed and as I looked over said \"I'm sure it's not what would be the chances-oh shit yeah it is!\"  At the same time he looked over and saw me, and was starting to wave and say what's up, when he looked over and saw her.  To this day I have never seen a human being's eyes get that wide.  It still makes me laugh thinking about it.\n\nEverything ended up being cool and we all hung out together but it's one of my favorite memories.",

When I went by his table to thank one of the guys he was sitting with he said hi, slippped me a $100 and said, \"You never saw me here.\"  I just laughed and said, \"I won't tell if you don't.\"  It was kind of awkward. He never told, and I kept his secret even when family found out and his wife said some really bitchy things to me about the questionable morals of anyone who would work at or go to that type of place.",

            "On the opposite side of this I once saw a crush of mine from HS stripping.  \n\nWe were 19-20ish at the time.  I think she got super embarrassed because not only my group of friends were there (most of whom knew who she was) there was also a separate group of friends there that were from the same grade in high school.  When she came around her face was red and she said \"I'm being good I'm going to college!\"  I replied \"I'll help\" as I slid some cash into her panties.  I still think about that interaction sometimes.  I hope she's doing well.",
            "I had a really cool math/engineering teacher in HS who told me a story about the first time he ever went to a strip club. His wife convinced him to go as a date or something (which I thought was really weird.)  So they went up to the thing where like the main stage is (I've never been to a strip club, so I don't know what the terminology for things are) and looked up. The performer was one of his former students. Not just like a random student, but one of the high achieving good students too. He said this was his one and only strip club experience, and I can understand why.",

            "About 4 years ago I was a stripper and taking college classes. A guy I was in American History with came to my club and we were talking outside in the smoking area trying to figure out why the other was so familiar looking. Finally we pieced it together, laughed about it and became really good friends while I was living in that town. He would bring his friends in and they would tip me and the girls and buy dances. He said he was helping pay back my student loans lol. Last I heard he's in Florida living the dream and he texts me sometimes to see how I'm doing.\n\nThe time it didn't pan out well was my brothers best friend knew a girl I worked with as he had tattooed her. He drove almost 2 hours to the club I was working at to see her (he didnt know i danced there) and I see him as he's walking in but he didnt see me. I ran to my manager asked if I could hide in the dressing room (I wasn't out to my family yet about dancing). My manager said no but he let me \"act\" like a shooter girl and wear shorts and sneakers with my top until my brothers friend left. He definitely told my brother but told him I was a cocktail a waitress, which still got me in hot water with my family but not as bad as dancing did lol.",
            "When I was younger I worked at hooters for a while and developed a lot of great friendships with regulars. Fast forward a year and I was dancing at a place downtown and loving every minute of it till one night I after a transition from main stage to a satellite stage near the back I looked down and sitting right in front of me was my old favorite regular from hooters. I squealed and covered my boobs before I died laughing. He had been there for god knows how long before I noticed him. It ended up being a fantastic night for tips :)",
            "My best friend's girlfriend used to be a stripper. After she met my friend she quit stripping and started working as a bartender at a pub. \n\nI was a manager at a luxury hotel and we had a guest who would stay with us every other weekend and get a hooker (sometimes male prostitutes too). We obviously knew about him and like all of our guests, maintained his privacy.\n\nOne night smoke detector went off in his room (New Zealand has strict laws against indoor smoking).\nNormally I'd get one of the duty managers to attend to such situations and I only get involved when they refuse to pay the $200 fine.\n\nAnyway, that fateful night the duty manager was busy handling another situation so I go upstairs (since I was a manager I had the authority to blacklist any guest and this it this guest's third time smoking in room).\n\nI knock on the door and I hear a frantic \"hold on a sec'\nThe door opens and he is just wearing his undies and I notice in the reflection of the mirror inside the room a naked chick going under the covers.\nI asked him about him smoking in the room. He very calmly and arrogantly told me that it was impossible for the smoke detector to go off as he had covered it with a condom.\nNow, that is a literal crime, tempering with the smoke detectors. I told him that I will have to take a look at the smoke detector to see what he has done and will have to report it to the fire department so that they can come and make sure it's still functional.\n\nHe let me in. I saw the condom covered smoke detector and asked the guest to pack his bags as I would be transferring him to another hotel. I was being very assertive. Then I looked over at the lady and my jaw dropped. It was my best friend's girlfriend.\n\nShe was an escort without the knowledge of my best friend.\n\nAfter I had transferred the guest to another hotel and fire department already at the scene, I received the hooker's call. Asking me not to tell her girlfriend. I told her that's between them and that she needs to come clean as her girlfriend truly loves her and I love my best friend. She's been hurt and heartbroken many times (lesbian drama). That night I got home and my friend was acting strange. Forgot to mention that my best friend and I were roommates too. I asked her what's up and she asked if it was true that I came onto her girlfriend?\n\nI had the most intense WTF moment. I told her everything. She was in tears. I didn't know if she would believe me or her.\n\nSo she called her over to talk to her. Before her girlfriend got to our place, my friend came to me and asked me if I was a hundred percent sure that was her in the hotel room. I was absolutely positive. Then I gave her a hug and told her that I am sorry that she had to go through that and whatever she would decide to do next, I understand and that she would have my support, even if that meant either of us moving out.\n\nI was in my room pretty upset myself when the door bell rang. My friend came into my room and asked me to accompany her to the door to greet her girlfriend. When we opened the door, my friend just asked me to make sure that bitch couldn't enter the house. She then grabbed her stuff and threw it out on the stairs, some of which hit the cheating bitch's face. She then told her to never ever contact her or come near her.\n\nAfter all that was said and done between them, after the storm had passed, I made my friend her favorite cocktail, went to her room, climbed into her bed and asked her why did she not even give her girlfriend a chance to explain herself.\n\nMy friend's response: 'it hurts to know that she lied to me. That she cheated on me. With a man. But I could have forgiven her for all that! But I can never forgive her for accusing you of something like that. You are not just my best friend, you are my bro, you are my lesbro!'\n\nWe slept in her bed watching Grey's anatomy that night.\n\nI truly miss her.\n\nBut yeah, her ex is now a full on prostitute working at a brothel and has cancer in her neck!",

She finally confessed over coffee.    \n    \nI admit it suprised me, even shocked me.  But after thinking about it, I found I wasn't really upset.  I asked if she was doing any touching or taking things further than just dancing, and she was very clear she wasn't;  Dancing only.    \nSo I asked if I could come to a show.  I told her I wasn't freaked out.  I'm just not that worried about nudity.    \nShe was enormously relieved, and was happy to have me go to some of her shows.  I got a lot of jealous looks since she paid extra special attention to little ol me, sitting in Gynecology Row.   \nI'll tell you this:  She made bank.

Nice place, good dancers, and great steak. There was this one particular girl I found very appealing. That summer break I went to that club quite often, for birthdays and for personal reasons.\nThe next semester, I became a Teacher Assistant, and started teaching a pre-req Calculus class. First lecture of my life, I walk in and see this beautiful, stunning, girl sitting on the second table. I thought I knew who she was but could not place her. For the rest of the class, I kept thinking about it. I tried not to stare too much, that would have been rude, and unprofessional. At the end of the class, she comes to me and says hello, we meet again. I looked at her and finally recognized her. I was pleasantly shocked to say the least. It was a bit out of place to see her in broad daylight, and in a Calculus class. All this time, I always thought of the stereotypical story, \"I am doing this to get through college.\" But she really was doing it for college. \nWe became good friends, and although my trips to the club went down in number, I never asked her for a dance again. Morals and such. She ended up getting a B+ and i shamelessly bumped it to a A for all the good times sake.\nShe graduated with bachelor's in computational mechanics.",

She had taken that bag we had left and planted the fake plants along the side of her house. She said she wasn\u2019t real confident that they would make it but so far they seemed to be thriving!

Just an older, quiet guy, who keeps to himself and eats my flowers. Comes over to my yard, and eats the lillie's raw, or brings scissors and clips the heads to 'boil and make jam'.\nI thought that his particular foraging was interesting and quirky, so I planted a couple raspberry, blackberry, and blueberry bushes 3 years ago, when we first moved in, on the side yard we share. I told him to help himself to berries anytime, especially before the birds do. The bushes have all gone insane and the entire side of my house is now a summer berry haven for us to share.\nHaving a decent relationship with the guy I share a property line with, is worth some deadheaded flowers.",

His truck wouldn\u2019t start one day ( dead battery) and he told everyone on the street that another neighbor was stealing the electricity. He knew this because of the way this guy parked his vehicle - obviously it was sucking electricity from the ground for his battery, which drained the car batteries near him. Many times he would run down the street and warn everyone to hide their valuables because Japan was invading the country. He wasn\u2019t on drugs, but he did take medication for his mental illness and everyone on our street could tell when he stopped taking it. Whenever he would start saying completely irrational things, we would remind him to take his medication, and he would thank us and go home, presumably to take it. He lived alone, and he was getting older, so I think he had a hard time remembering to take it. There were many, many more incidents.\nETA: Thanks for the rewards!!

            "I cared for an elderly woman for many years. She lived to the age of 93 in a crime ridden inner city neighborhood by being as tough and nasty as any criminal living nearby.  \n\nHer oddest actions involved her incorrect belief that she owned the road in front of her house.  She didn't even own a car, but she insisted that nobody park there.  She would confront them if they parked in front of her house.  If they did it again, she slashed their tires in the middle of the night.\n\nOver and over for years.  She was never caught, but everybody knew it was her.\n\nShe only stopped when she lost the physical strength to slash a tire in her mid 80's.  Then she started using spray paint on the cars.  \n\n\"He don't park in front of my house no more,\" was all the justification she needed to damage her neighbors' cars.",

She spends hours a day outside with the leaf-blower in fall. \n\nShe will go and knock on other neighbors' doors if she thinks you have too many leaves on your grass. She'll come over into your yard and do it ~~yourself~~ herself if you're not home. \n\nWhat I think is weird is that she's in her 70s, no kids or grandkids living with her, and lives alone in a pretty large 4 bedroom house with an amazing in-ground pool in the backyard (with a slide and diving board and everything). Nobody has used that pool in at least 5 years yet she opens it up every summer. \n\nSomehow she likes my family and has never once yelled at us about our leaves and randomly brings things over like half-eaten gallons of ice cream and ask if we want it because she's not using it. ???",

I took it down after a few months after multiple cryptic letters (eventually management got involved and took her side even though bird feeders were explicitly allowed per the lease). There were several trees nearby, including one that literally hung onto both her and my balconies. I assure you that birds existed before I set up the feeder, as the continued to exist after.

            "My neighbor was an 85 year old widow that lived alone. She had two vehicles, a car and truck, and over the course of a few months I realized that she was no longer parking her car in her garage like she had for the many years prior to that, then suddenly the truck wasn't being parked inside the garage either.\n\nTurns out she no longer had room in her garage to park her vehicles because she was walking down to a residential construction site about a block away every evening and she'd grab two 2\"x4\"s and bring them home. She had over 500 boards stacked in her garage and when she was questioned on what she was going to do with it, she didn't have an answer.\n\nEdit: Bonus crazy neighbor stories:\n\n* I drove 16 hours straight, pulled in my drive, and crashed on my couch immediately. Must have left the garage door open because I woke up to the neighbor lady shaking me to see if they missed my newspaper delivery that morning also.\n* Neighbor lady thought I didn't clean up after my dog in her front yard (I had never owned a dog) so she retaliated by walking around the neighborhood with a garbage bag, picking up every bit of dog poo she could find, and dumped said bag of dog poo on my front lawn while I was standing in the front window watching.\n* Ran up over $300 on one months water bill of mine because neighbor lady was hooking her sprinkler up to my water when I'd leave for work in the morning and would let it run all day until right before I got home from work.\n* She would put up an ugly orange snow fence between our yards in the fall to keep my leaves out of her yard. Me pointing out that I only had pine trees did not dissuade her from the decision to leave the snow fence up.\n\nEdit #2:\n\n* Day one I should have known something was fishy with this lady. Literally, day one. I closed on my house at 9:00 a.m. and had a roofing company at the house waiting for the call that I closed. We spent the day ripping off the old layers and getting bundles up on the roof for the next day. It was hot out, we were exhausted and all sitting in the front yard cooling off when neighbor lady walked out of her house, down the sidewalk to my house, and without even acknowledging the 6 of us staring at her, she walked in the front door and had herself a look see.\n* She hated dandelions. I found this out the first year that I lived there when I noticed that my lawn was dieing off in an extremely weird way; almost as if someone was spraying weedkiller on the stream setting trying to snipe dandelions from 20 feet away. That's literally what she was doing.\n* Being the nice guy I am, I would clean her driveway off in the winter because I had a snowblower. She would never thank me in person, but instead, she'd come over to my house after I had finished and would leave a bag on my front door that usually contained whatever expired goods she had in her pantry. Some of the standouts for me was like a dozen cans of 10 year expired chef boy-r-dee (sp) stuff, and once, a half a bag of wheat flower.",
            "The neighbour behind us had a leak in his water pipe and, rather than fix it, he just had the sump pump drain it out into the back yard. This meant that all year round the back of our yard was a little bit damp.\n\nEventually, the leaky pipe burst and filled the house with five feet of water. His solution to this was just to keep the pump running and flood the entire neighbourhood. After about an hour, a posse of all the neighbours whose yards were being flooded confronted him and called the city to shut off the water.\n\nThe city fixed the water pipe and the neighbour ended up with a large fine. At least my yard stays basically dry now.\n\nI should also mention that this neighbour once rented the house out to a bunch of crackheads and it nearly burned down because the ex-girlfriend of one of these morons snuck in and set the house on fire.",

We said no. \n\nWe farm 20 acres of our land which happens to be located around the plot he lives on.  Long story short he started trying to sabotage our land and our farmers. He would post videos to Facebook saying our farmers were harassing him. Then one day the neighbour got 2 friends of his to come and attack our farmer, which resulted in his friends death. \n\nNeighbour fled the scene and ended up in a neighbouring state. He was summoned by the police to come and clean up his property within 30 days. He came back for one day, and the 1 day he was back his trailer mysteriously caught on fire and burnt down. Neighbour ended up fleeing again, until he was subpoenaed into court for the death of the other guy.\n\nFor reference, the neighbour has a rap sheet about 12 pages long, including burglary, touching children, abusing his ex, stalking, meth use, etc. And so did his friend who got killed. Sad he got killed because he was pulled into his friends stupid mess. \n\nAs his friend was dying on the ground, my neighbour had the decency to pull out his phone and go on Facebook live. No attempts to aid his friend or anything, meanwhile the farmer was on the ground putting pressure on the wound and bawling his eyes out.",

She'd regularly practice saxaphone while the dogs howled along with her.\n\nShe didn't have a job and spent everyday going on craigslist free and picking things up.

            "Explodes.\n\nOkay, I guess that requires some explanation.\n\nThis isn't so much \"crazy\" as it is dumb, but it sure seemed crazy to me. This happened back in 2009.\n\nI had a neighbor back in The Day\u2122 who we will call Gary. Gary was a really sweet guy. Middle-aged guy, kind of had it rough in life, but managed to keep his spirits up. He liked beer and BBQ, to a degree that made me like him immensely. He made extra money by doing odd jobs around the neighborhood. Heck, he mowed my grass for pretty cheap. Great guy. He lived with his uncle, a cool old coot with a hook for a hand. The uncle supplemented his income by buying and selling random stuff, much of which he kept in his back yard. Very Sanford And Son. They even had the old-timey truck.\n\nGary loved to make BBQ. He would slow-smoke stuff in smokehouses that he made himself out of random junk. People would bring him things and he would turn them into smokehouses. He made the neighborhood smell nice.\n\nOne day, I am off from work, hanging out at my house and playing video games. Suddenly, there is a loud explosion that sounded like an artillery shell. Pictures fall off my walls and my cats scatter and hide. Being a dumbass, my idiotic ass goes running out the back door of my house toward the sound of the explosion.\n\nMy neighbor's house is right behind mine (across an alley), so I immediately see the following:\n\n* The awning on the back of my neighbor's house is on fire.\n* There is a 50-gallon drum in the backyard. It is on fire.\n* There is a tarp held up by a number of poles, to provide shade in the back yard. It is on fire.\n* My neighbor is on the ground, unconscious, being rolled around by his uncle and a buddy. He is also on fire.\n\nSo I see someone is already calling 9-1-1, so I go to help. By the time I am there, Gary is no longer on fire, so one of his buddies grabs the hose, and I grab a bucket. They have one of those dual-spigot thingies, so I can fill the bucket while the other guy uses the hose. I am putting out the awning on the house, and the other guy sprays down Gary to make sure he is good and extinguished (and to take heat from his burns, which look TERRIBLE). As I am re-filling the bucket, I see the guy with the hose is putting out the tarp shade. He turns toward the burning barrel, aims the hose, and pulls the trigger.\n\nI am doing the slow motion \"Nooooo....!\" thing.\n\nWhen the water hit the barrel, a mushroom cloud of fire and smoke appeared above my neighborhood. I was freaking out, screaming about shooting a hose into burning liquid.\n\nI later asked his uncle what was in the barrel. He said \"Oh, a mix of kerosene and fuel oil.\" I said \"That is two of the three ingredients in rudimentary liquid rocket fuel. The third ingredient makes it explode slower.\"\n\nEventually, the ambulance came and IMMEDIATELY left with Gary. Turned out he had 2nd and 3rd degree burns on over half his body. However, the biggest issue was the concussion of the explosion. He had a bajillion little internal bleeds all through his torso. He nearly died more than once. It took him a few months to get out of the hospital. His face had melted, and he looked pretty horrible. He's fine now, though he is not pretty, but he had to stop doing my lawn because I guess sunlight hurts now. Poor, sweet dude came to me (this was how I found out he was out of the hospital) to apologize(?!?) and to tell me his cousin will be doing my lawn. I was just glad he lived, and here he was making sure I was taken care of.\n\nAnd that is the story of my exploding neighbor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Since people are asking, the reason the barrel exploded was because he decided to \"burn off\" the liquid in the barrel by lighting some newspaper. When he approached, the fire hit the fumes, and KABOOM!",

He had moved into a new neighborhood and got along fine with most of his neighbors, except for one guy. This one guy had kinda appointed himself the neighborhood HOA, and goes around and tells people what they should do, like cleaning up their yards, repairs they need to do to their houses to make them look better, where they should park their cars and so forth. So this guy proceeds to start \"suggesting\" to my friend that he needs to take better care of his yard, do repairs to his house, and a few other things, to, you know, make the neighborhood look better. My buddy was nice at first, and thanked him for his suggestions. Over the course of a couple years, the guy got meaner and more insulting, saying that my friend's place was trashy, badmouthing him to other neighbors, and being an annoying pain in the ass. Walter had gotten tired of of the guy, and pretty much told him \"to get f***ed\". It was his private property, and he could do what he wanted. They had went back and forth in verbal arguments over a few years.\n\nAt this point, I should mention that the neighbor was a rich business owner. I think his argument was, that Walter's place was bringing the surrounding property values down. I thought my friends place just looked average, but nothing that would affect other people's places. And you could barely see it from the road. The  neighbor from hell wanted everybody's yards immaculately manicured, and fresh paint on all the houses. So the neighbor hires a contractor one day to do some work on his place. After the job is done, he's talking to the contractor, telling him how much he hates Walter, and wants to teach him a lesson. He then asks the contractor if he knows anybody that would \" go have a little talk\" with my friend. The contractor let him go through his whole spiel, and tell all the details, then lets the neighbor know that him and Walter are cousins. As in, \"grew up together and pretty much brothers that would die for each other\". He tells the neighbor, that if he hears anything else about that, or if anything happens to Walter, the neighbor would be in a world of hurt.\n\nWalter hasn't heard a peep out of the neighbor since.",

When my grandparents lived in the house, they were good friends with his parents, and there was a \"good neighbor\" gate between the yards. When he started acting crazy we put a lock on it, and he tried to burn it off. We changed the locks, because my mom knew they had a spare key to the house, and there were several times when we came home and all of the lights were on and the heat was cranked up to 80. When my mother, who had known him his whole life, went over to try to figure out what the hell was going on, he tried to tell her that we (myself, two of my siblings, and my fiance) were selling drugs, and that people were banging on our door at all hours whether we were home or not. We all worked full time, and the dude was just straight up crazy. We worried he might actually have his mother in the freezer, since no one had seen her in quite awhile."

He eventually gained the confidence to winnie-the-pooh himself into her feeder box, which is frustrating if I ever need to be gone for the weekend, as he'll literally eat all her food before she touches it.\n\nSo far my solution is to put a little inflatable collar on him when I'm gone, so he has a barrier besides his fat to keep him from going in. \n\nAlso I had to barricade his automatic feeder because he kept beating it up to get loose kibbles.

Whenever my cat got near the cage the guinea pig would start squealing aggressively at the cat and the cat would swat at the cage while sporting a look of utter disgust. That was a daily routine. It was the first thing that happened in the morning and it lasted a minut then they didn't bother each other for the rest of the day and the cat could even nap on top of the cage at times without any protest for either. It was just part of the day for them. That drama just had to happen every day.\n\nThe went on like that for 7 years. The guinea pig got really sick because he was old and I realize he doesn't have long left. I picked him up out of the cage and put him on my lap so he didn't have to die alone. The fucking cat came up and licked the guinea pig and laid on my lap beside him until he passed. Apparently the cat loved him all along. The 7 year drama was just their thing.

Where do they want to go? Wherever the anemone is. Cue the anemone getting literally butthurt by Cowrie spines and climbing out of the hole it has lived in for 6 months to roll around the tank stinging the shit out of all the corals and killing most of them. \n\n\nThe anemone looks like Cthulu's flashlight its massive, easily 10 inches in diameter on the oral disk and the stalk is like a human arm. If it had the wit to put its tentacles on the cowrie on the run around then it would probably be able to eat them. It has eaten a couple of unwary fish before and is known for swallowing razor clams with the shell and all - but the cowrie have not only outsmarted it at every turn but they appear to find a reason to ram it in the arse every day, which causes the nem to flee at a similar speed and try to settle elsewhere, only to be bullied again a few hours later.\n\nI am looking to rehome the anemone for this reason - its a Heteractis Magnifica if anyone in the UK would like to buy it, lol.",

So he would carefully steal it every time Reese got the slightest bit careless. \n\nThis escalated to them tossing it in the air in front of the other to taunt about who had the toy. Needless to say some tosses resulted in the toy changing hands. \n\nSoon other toys got really contentious. Pepper especially wanted all the toys so he lay on top of them like a dragon hoard. Reese would take whatever toy he had and toss it in front of Pepper to show that there were still good toys not in his dragon hoard. \n\nThis culminated with a serious disagreement between them and now all the toys are out of reach for the foreseeable future.",

It broke my heart hearing it. It was not a loud sound at all, it sounded like a human holding back tears with the sniffles.

If you stripped away all that I was as a person, piece by piece, it would be one of the last things to go. \n\nSimilarly, I find most peoples' attitudes towards the deaths of others bizarre as well. We tend to feel sorry for the family and ourselves, but the person that died just got wiped from existence. Their beautiful, complex, feeling brain has shut down... and we're sad because of how that impacts us?\n\nAlso, death is rarely peaceful, so I live with the knowledge that my last precious moments of existence are probably going to be in agony and fear.

            "I've 'died' three times in the course of a traumatic brain injury. Its frightening. It HURTS. My GOD it hurts. I was bleeding in the brain in two places (frontal and anterior lobes). My breathing shut down. Panic. Complete and utter panic.... I was fighting the paramedics. They had to strap me down. They intubated me, which is another whole level of panic for a lifelong asthmatic. They were bagging me and then my heart went into fibrillation.\n\nAnd then the pain... oh my god the pain. Everywhere. Every single nerve was screaming like I was on fire.  And then they defibrillated me. I've been shocked a number of times (clumsy Electrical Engineer), but this was like nothing I've ever felt. It was like sucking on a high voltage line... my whole body lit up and my eyes saw sparks. And then they did it again. I tasted blood (mine) and copper and smelled fire.\n\nAnd then.. WHAP.. like hitting a black wall I was gone. Totally gone. And from the records they worked on me for a couple of minutes and got me going again. AED only, fortunately because cracked sternum and ribs from CPR really sucks.\n\nThen repeat in a hospital ER. Then a helicopter to the Level 1 trauma center. Then repeat in the trauma center ER. Then coma for four days. Then surgery and I woke up a day or so later wondering WTF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't like pain. I've experienced it. I know dying all the way will hurt like hell. I fear the pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat comes after ? I have no idea. As far as I know, nothing. But there won't be that level of pain again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I can say is.. try not to get concussions / brain injuries when you're a kid.

            "I look forward to wandering this world in the here-after, exploring in death as a spirit that which I could not explore in life. I will visit my family's old landmarks, go to see friends, cause some mischief every now and again, and simply live wherever I please. Granted, I won't do so forever, and when I've had my fill I'll simply venture into the next life. The path to get there, though, is something that preoccupies my mind a great deal of the time. How will it happen, will it hurt, will I be satisfied with my life and where I've left it, or will I seek to finish in death what I couldn't in my previous existence?\n\nSo many questions, so many sleepless nights, so many waking moments of disorientation and disassociation. Life ends, death begins, life starts anew-- two things seemingly perpendicular to each other, but are actually one in the same. Death exists as another form of life, and life exists as an aspect of death in its own right: ending one form of existence to bring it to another, revitalized one. Dear Redditors, everything's connected, two sides to the same coin, and that's what makes life so interesting, yet also so dull. \n\nSo, am I afraid of dying? Not so much afraid as I am curious as to how I'll go. I've already died twice in my life so far, from a head operation gone awry when I was still a baby, to drowning in my grandparent's creek when I was a few years old, so death doesn't surprise me much anymore. If anything, I would greet them as an old friend, for they bring peace to the pain that is the poor circumstances of one's dying... but no, I am not afraid. Merely, I'm expecting and accepting that I shall die, and that upon my passing I'll be healthier and stronger, unbounded and can do what I please. If anything, I'll be happy once I'm dead, yet my life is not mine for the taking; simply: I shall go when the time is right.",

I consider myself spiritual but I have no idea what I believe. I have some soul searching to do. I am mostly afraid of dying because of the unknown. I have no beliefs, as of right now, of an after life. I really struggle with that fact that there is no scientific explanation or concrete information about what actually happens to us after death. \n\nAlmost two years ago I lost some one who I loved deeply and it shook me to my core. He was so young and full of life. His death was the first one I experienced where it felt very permanent to me, he was here and then gone and will never return again.

Where would everyone who has never done something really bad *or* good go? Moreover, who decides? Does a higher being? Because that\u2019s a lot of people to filter through. Do we? Because there are good people who feel bad when they shouldn\u2019t and bad people who don\u2019t feel remorse, so if we decided, some people would get screwed over. \n\nThinking of the logistics of Heaven and Hell make my head spin, but I always end back up to wanting there to be something to give people what they deserve after death.

            "I read an article the other day about how the people in a really small rural village in India drowned a women and her 2 small children in a well because they thought she was a witch. Apparently this is not *that* uncommon in really remote areas of some countries.\n\nIt just blows my mind that in my city we're starting to see shit like driverless cars and gene editing becoming a reality, but in some areas of the world they still believe in witches enough to kill someone over it.\n\nEDIT: Woah. This blew up. Welp... it's been pointed out to me that this level of savagery exists in the modern world. Yeah, it totally does. Honestly, villagers killing a family because they think they're witches is far less terrible than politicians and modern healthcare companies letting thousands of people die from preventable diseases. At least the villagers *think* they're helping, however misguided they may be. Whereas, the people who let other people die while they make money off a system that allows people to die are wayy more terrible because they have all the knowledge available to them and choose to continue to let that happen.\n\nAlso, I recognized that we have our own modern version of witchhunters, the anti-vaxxers, the climate-change deniers, the flat-earthers. Frankly, these people are probably more harmful because their beliefs have a wider impact on the world.\n\nI guess it was just reading about something like drowning a witch that just feels so medieval to me that it gave me pause. Like somewhere in the world, someone is being persecuted for having perceived magical powers while at the same time, someone else in the world is implementing technology so advanced it feels like it's out of a science fiction novel. Some people are going to fucking Mars in a few years and other people think babies born as twins are cursed witches. I guess the point I was trying to make is that I can't believe that in 2019, even with all the globalisation that has happened that we still have this VAST gap in the human experience and the technological advances that are prevalent in our lives.",

            "Ooh here we go. Cocktail bartender here who is full of opinions.\n\nMy number one answer is always going to be a [Trinidad Sour](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3328/trinidad-sour) purely because of how out of left field it is for most drinkers. The base spirit being bitters instead of any of the common offenders. It's spicy, rich, complex and very well balanced for containing a shot and a half of bitters. Though I personally think it's better equal parts rye and angostura, but I love my rye.\n\nGin fans need to give the [Aviation](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/127/aviation-cocktail-diffords-recipe) a good try. It's one of the cocktails that turned me from \"I don't really like gin\" to \"turns out I just don't really like gin and tonic\". It's floral, fragrant and quite tart.\n\nIf you're an old fashioned fan, get all up in the [Sazerac](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3390/sazerac-cocktail-new-orleans-style). It's absolutely always going to be one of my biggest benchmark's of any bar I go to. If I wander into any bar that calls themselves a cocktail bar, and they don't know how to make one, I immediately default to a good ol' bourbon and coke, because I no longer trust them with anything more complicated. It's sweet, rich, spicy and all around gorgeous. This recipe is for Rye Whiskey, but I often prefer cognac if there's a good one available.\n\nVodka fans, I know you're out there and feel shy because you're a vodka fan, but try a real proper Cosmopolitan some time. I'm not going to drop you a link because frankly, most recipes for the Cosmo are very crowd pleasing, by which i mean sugary and awful. A real cosmo, in my opinion should be a nice light pink and be opaque. If it's a rich pink or purple and you can see through it, run.\n\nTry 50ml Vodka, 20ml Cointreau, 15ml Cranberry, 20ml Lime and a burnt orange zest garnish. The lime being dominant over the cranberry is a big deal in my opinion. Note that mine is very booze forward.\n\nRum fans, look, a [Daiquiri](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2153/daiquiri-no1-natural-emburys-821-formula) will always be firmly my number one rum cocktail (though I would serve this particular version with a bit less sugar). But switch things up with a [Hemingway Daiquiri](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/954/hemingway-special-daiquiri-papa-doble) for a dryer, more tart alternative. If you're a big fan of dark rum, absolutely try a dark rum old fashioned some time, it's top notch.\n\nWhiskey Sour and Scotch fans out there, need to go and give the [Penicillin](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2539/penicillin-cocktail) a good try. It's a style of ginger whiskey sour that floats a bit of smokey scotch on top to give it a bit of a bite. Always going to be one of my favourites. But if you're a scotch fan that wants to keep things on the dark and boozy end of things, try a [Bobby Burns](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/280/bobby-burns-cocktail-craddocks-recipe), which is at it's core a scotch Manhattan with a touch of Benedictine for sweetness. \n\nTequila fans, I know you exist, but you're a tough cookie to crack since you can be anywhere from margarita loving, to wanting something very out of left field dropped in front of you. If you're more of a whiskey lover outside of your tequila adoration, try an [Oaxaca Old Fashioned](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3003/oaxaca-old-fashioned) which will always be one of my favourites. If you're more on the rum and vodka side of things, try the [Toreador](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2207/toreador). A margarita twist that substitutes triple sec for apricot brandy. Another fun option is just sticking tequila in place of other spirits, it's surprisingly versatile. The penicillin I listed earlier? Try it with tequila and a smoky mezcal for the bite instead.\n\nSpeaking of Apricot Brandy, a [Charlie Chaplin](https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2914/charlie-chaplin-cocktail) will always be one of my go to's for those who aren't a huge fan of cocktails that you can taste the booze in. If you like french martinis, this might be your new jam.\n\nIt's an annoying state of the bartender scene being a bit full of judgement at times that leads to a lot of drinkers being unwilling to admit they don't really know what they want to order. They may know their tastes, and always default back on a tried and true choice like the old fashioned or a french martini. If you're in a nice cosy smaller bar, and obviously if it isn't too busy at the time, talk to us! We love to help you find the exact drink for you, that may even mean a bit of experimentation behind the bar for us too. If a bartender isn't busy and isn't willing to help you find the drink for you, you're in the wrong bar.\n\nI tried to cover the alternatives and lesser known options here, but as always, the Negroni, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, Martini and other 'taste defining' classics are absolutely ones that you should give a go too.\n\nEDIT: Also fernet branca and coke because it's the nectar of the gods.\nAnd clarified that my measurements were in millilitres!\n\nBecause it's been requested, I'll point out that these cocktails are most easily found at a bar that actually calls itself a cocktail bar. Your average pub or dive bar mightn't have the materials for some of these, but when in doubt, ask!\n\nI'm in Sydney, Australia and we're lucky to have a great small bar scene here. Not gonna completely dox myself, but if you're in Sydney googlu 'Small cocktail bars' and you'll definitely find something solid. Big tip from there is to ask the bartender for recommendations! There's a solid chance you'll either start off at the bar I work in or mine will be on the bartender's list somewhere. The scene down here isn't perfect however, and if you feel like the service isn't friendly enough when it's not too busy, feel free to move along to another bar. There are a few places here that I won't mention that are a bit guilty of that. ",

But if Jeff is at -25\u00b0C^(-13\u00b0Freedoms), he'll first absorb 25\u00b0C^(~45\u00b0Fs) worth of heat before he even starts to melt.

Excellent and easy. \n\nChill a martini glass by loading it with ice and water. \n\nIn a shaker full of ice pour in 1.5 oz of your favorite gin. I find Watershed\u2019s Four Peel Gin out of Columbus, Ohio to be my current favorite for this recipe, but seriously whatever gin you enjoy. \n\nNext, and this is crucial, add dry vermouth. It makes the drink a little oily and adds a slight sweetness and tang to counterbalance the gin\u2019s flavors. The amount is up to you; I do 1 oz (for a 3 parts gin, 2 parts vermouth martini). \n\nStir this together in the ice. Don\u2019t shake it; it will look nice and homogenous when you stir it. \n\nDump the ice and water from the chilled martini glass. \n\nTake the peel of a lemon and rub the outer skin side around the rim of the martini glass. This just adds an amazing aroma of citrus and will delight your nose. \n\nStrain the booze, serve with the lemon peel (\u201ctwist\u201d) in the glass. \n\nDrink, and look dapper as fuck in your local watering hole.

You'll be fine\". We went into the classroom and the one is still crying. So I'm doing my best trying to get her calmed down and continue teaching but she's really upset. Finally I stop, look closely at her and I'm like \"hold up. You're not Sabrina. You're Samantha!\" She immediately stops crying and smiles at me and is all happy. Turns out Grandma has been calling her Sabrina all weekend and actual Sabrina wouldn't correct her cause she thought it was funny.

It's amazing, now that the twins are fully grown (in their late 20s now) their personalities are still so opposite (artist vs. banker) and their names suit them both absolutely perfectly. \n\nAlso, it's a great story now that they tell everyone - which is very cute.",

We were dumbfounded, \u2018did she just steal our kids?!\u2019  (We has baby lojak installed).\n\nIn what seemed like five minutes the lights came back on, the nurse returned with our girls freshly bathed.  She said the nursery was empty and all the nurses wanted to play with babies.  When they found out there were twins earlier in the day they decided to see if they could borrow them.  When she showed up the next night, we surrendered the babies eagerly.\n\nI still get their names wrong 25% of the time, and they are nearly 7.",

            "Our boys are 18 months now and Leo was born with a rare condition called hyperinsulinemia which is effectively the opposite of diabetes where a part of his pancreas was over producing insulin and starving his body and more worryingly his brain of the sugar that it needs. To counter this he was put on diazoxide, which has an interesting side effect that it accelerates hair growth. \n\nSo by the time the boys were a couple of months old we had Finlay who was still a wee baldy, and Leo who looked like a little monkey. It was a really tough time, when he was in hospital we very nearly lost him, and then when we got him home we had to give him medication 5 times a day including one set at 12am and one at 4am.. but I suppose the silver lining was that we could easily tell them apart thanks to the hair! \n\nLeo grew out of the condition by 6 months and over time Finlay caught up in the hair department, so we've lost that as a means of telling the difference, but it doesn't matter by this point as they have their own personalities, facial expressions and mannerisms which makes them instantly identifiable for us. People that dont see them all the time struggle to tell just because they aren't familiar with these things. \n\nOh and if they both stood perfectly still, we'd still manage as Finlay has a small epidermal cyst beside his left eye. So if we were totally stuck theres always that.\n\nI was thinking about sharing a picture of them when Leo had all the hair but I'm not sure how I feel about putting them up on reddit for anyone to see.",

            "Not a twin, but everyone in my family has a name starting with the same letter. My dad would regularly cycle though the list until he got the right person (including our dog). He was scatter brained but a good dude",
            "My twin boys have always been very hard to tell apart. We kept hospital bracelets on as long as we could, made a small sharpie marker dot on twin B\u2019s foot before taking off the bracelets, and then painted one of twin B\u2019s toe nails blue for 9 months. \nThey\u2019re 2 now and have no trouble telling people off when they\u2019re called the wrong name.",

            "We put purple polish on one\u2019s pinky finger and pink on the other\u2019s. Once their hair was long and thick enough to see it, their whorls were opposite.\n\nBefore that, who knows? It\u2019s entirely possible that we switched them multiple times. When we were the sleep-deprived parents of infants who needed feeding, burping, and fresh diapers at nighttime, when it\u2019s dark, some confusion could have happened.\n\nNow that they\u2019re adults, well, history be damned. Their names are their names.",
            "Actual father of identical twins here...\n\nWhether or not it was silly, I actually became somewhat obsessed with making sure this did NOT happen to my girls. For multiple reasons.\n\nFirst step was that within seconds of each girl being born, the nurses put the typical newborn baby ankle tags on them. Those had names, bar-codes, etc and stayed on  ( loose enough to never cut circulation but tight enough to never slip off ).\n\nWe also color coded each girl, starting with their little newborn caps. Baby A got Pink, Baby B got Green.\n\nWhen it was finally time to remove the anklets, we were still very cognizant of this consideration and carefully painted the big toe nail of each foot on each girl, Baby A pink, Baby B green THEN removed the tags. My wife wrote down the color code in the feeding charts for each girl to be EXTRA sure.\n\nAbout two weeks later, my mom noticed a small red birth mark on the back of Baby A's neck, and baby B never had any apparent birthmarks.\n\nFrom there we were good.\n\n(In addition to the OCD/psychological importance of not mixing them up, there was also medical significance, as each girl had post-natal complications which were minor but still required monitoring early on.)\n\n**edit:** I almost forgot the best part! The girls are almost 8 years old now, and Baby A's favorite color happens to be Pink, while Baby B's favorite color... you guessed it... Green!",
            "We tattooed their names in their upper back! :P\n\nWe actually painted a finger nail. They were born at 34 weeks due to one hogging all food. \ud83d\ude44 She was almost a pound heavier so it was easy to tell them apart! Same size now but we can tell them apart. Voice, personality, even facial features.",
            "Parent of identical twin girls, we painted toe nails.  Eventually one developed a small mark under left nipple that made you 100% sure... And later the other slipped in tub and got stitches under chin, scar made it easy if unsure.  Make them pick different glasses frames now that they're older. They giggle and laugh hysterically when they try to pretend to be each other still.\n\nAs they've aged and developed some slightly different preferences it's pretty easy to tell them apart, vocally one of them has adopted a slightly deeper tone as well.\n\nMy brother-in-law's wife was an identical twin and the school forced them to separate classes fro K on, and both of them said it was the most traumatic event of their life, so we insisted that they be allowed to stay in the same classes together. I'm sure their teachers weren't terribly fond, but I think it's better than traumatizing a kid. After fourth grade they wanted to be in different classes anyway, but since they chose it, no trauma or a lot less.\n\nIt's definitely an interesting experience having identical twins.",
            "I am an identical twin (34Fs) . My dad said they kept the bracelets on for as long as possible, and he got mad at my mom when she took them off. There's 100% chance that I am my twins name, but - at this point, we're both 34, and it's FAR TOO LONG to even know. Even when we would call our mom in high school, she admitted that she would have to ask \"clarifying questions\" before knowing who it really was, and in some cases, she would have complete conversations with us and think it was the other one. So - there's a HUGE CHANCE, that I was in fact, given my twin's birth name - but, now - I am who I am, and she is who she is, and no one will ever really know who was who on the day of our birth.",
            "So my gf is an identical triplet. She has tried on mutliple occasions to trick me. It has never worked because i know that she is the most beautiful of the three of them.",
            "My Mom just gave us different colors :\u2019D. I always got purple clothes while my twin brother got the exact same stuff in red :D.",
            "My cousin has twins and she marked them on the hand for a year. One started getting dark hair so she stopped.",
            "I used to be friends with these fraternal twins, this is important to note because you would swear they were identical. At one point I was best friends with one of them but I could never tell what one. The only way you could tell was what ear their piercings were on. Their parents also had the brilliant idea to give them names just one letter apart.",

I was an anxious emotional wreck from my early teens until my late 20's, with very few friends and zero romantic partners. Didn't lose my virginity until I was 28. Did jobs I didn't care about and that paid zero money for almost my entire 20s. I was suicidal for awhile and was popping in and out of therapy and crisis centers.

            "Money is the thing I've struggled with the most in my life, so here are some things I've learned:\n\n* I like the idea of having a career that makes a lot of money, for example medicine or software engineering, and keeping your passion projects as hobbies. Following your passions as a career will make you broke, plus you'll get burned out on the things you're passionate about. You don't have to go to college to volunteer your weekends at the animal shelter.\n\n* Stay away from debt. Pay cash for as much as you can. Finance your house and car if you want, but don't go into debt for school. There are so many lower cost options than a 4 year university. You can do community college and transfer to a state school, etc. NIU in Illinois offers free tuition to students who hold a 3.0 GPA or higher in high school. I wish they had that when I was a teenager but it's a new thing.\n\n* Save some money. If you save $100 a month into a 401k or IRA from the time you're 21 until the normal US retirement age of 60, you'll have over $1 million. Imagine how much you would have if you could put back $200 or $500 a month!\n\n* Travel before you have a spouse and children.\n\n* Learn to live by yourself.

Some guy who desperately wanted to work there was emailing his resume to HR one thousand times every day. Several times a day, the number of emails would get too overwhelming. So the people in HR would just select all the emails in the inbox and delete all of them, whether the emails were from the applicant or not. My relative had to show them how to filter emails from the applicant.",

            "Not weird as much as kind of funny (and inappropriate). Was working in HR at a call center in the early 2000s. Got a visit from the IT guys one day letting me know that a guy in Quality Control had been visiting porn sites on his work computer. They gave me the report and I set up a meeting with him. \n\n\"So John...you've been visiting adult websites on the job.\"\n\n\"Well, you know how we do a lot of research...and...sometimes you just accidentally land one. It happens.\"\n\n\"John, you visited one particular site 27 times.\"\n\n\"Um....should I grab my things?\"\n\n\"Yup.\"",

They'd also consistently pick up the phone and hang it up without saying anything so that it would stop ringing.\n\nI sat in on their termination, and the employee started screaming at the manager about how they were doing an amazing job, and they had to give them another chance... I was 100% confident that they were just trying to get some easy money and wouldn't be surprised that they were finally getting fired, the whole thing was just bizarre.",
            "Not exactly weird but... I work in HR and we have two people with the exact same name but in different departments. This still causes confusion sometimes but the most awkward was last year at the Christmas party. We have this anual \"employee of the year\" award and the name was announced before mentioning the department or other info, although I warned the MC not to do that, as we had 2 people with the same name.

            "While back, at a very sales-focused company (can't go into too many details, the story got passed around the industry for a while and I'd rather it remain anonymous) it was crunch time for basically every department. Lots of orders, lots of money made but with a bunch of pressure to deliver on those orders. Tensions were a bit high, so we (HR) did a few things to raise morale and keep people happy; we had some lunches catered in, donuts and coffee brought in for people, just small things to bring the mood up. After a week or two of this kind of atmosphere in the office I get notified by one of the sales managers to hold a disciplinary meeting for one of sales guys who had been around for a few years.\n\nI knew this guy (call him \"Dave\") but never really talked to him much, seemed alright, not one of the ones I'd expect to be a troublemaker. What surprised me was that this meeting apparently also included one of the newer sales guys (\"Ben\"), out of college for maybe a year, and also not one of the ones I'd expect to cause trouble. Turns out Dave had been coping with the stress of the office by sneaking into empty conference rooms with his cellphone and 'enjoying' some pornography - IT said that since he did it on his own phone, they couldn't track it. Well Ben stumbles across him, which you'd think would just make an awkward moment and maybe a report to HR... but instead, maybe due to stress of his own, started *loudly yelling at Dave to stop slacking off and started taking swings at him*.\n\nThis broke out into a fistfight in the room, which drew a crowd and ultimately broke some of our video conferencing equipment. After a minute someone managed to get the two of them apart... which calmed things down for about 10 seconds before someone made a joke about Dave throwing punches with the same hand he had been touching himself with, which somehow provoked Ben to lunge at him again and take another swing before being restrained.\n\nThe weirdest part? After the meeting and like a week of internal discussion, during which both sales guys kept working to keep orders rolling in, we had to make a decision. Our department head had carefully gone over the rules and relevant laws (assault charges and things) and determined that Ben be terminated for assaulting an employee, but *Dave not be fired* and instead required to attend sexual harassment training to keep his job. As a result, a week later, we had to send an office-wide e-mail informing people that referring to the incident in vulgar terms - off the record, my favorite was \"Dave, you beat that kid like you were beating your meat in there\" - was technically grounds for warning under our sexual harassment policies.",

Moral of the story is use a fucking email address to identify people\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*edit: yes the employees had unique ids, the problem was people were searching for them by name & tunnel visioning on the first result.

            "I was an HR manager for a small company that shared an office with a mid-sized business. Their HR manager really disliked us, mainly because our company cultures really clashed. It wasn't a big deal for a long time, maybe just a little tense, until one day they decided to terminate one of the shared administrative staff members. I wasn't part of this decision, though I agreed with it, and technically that was their employee. The other HR Manager (let's call her Cheryl) calls me into her office to inform me the next morning that this admin had been let go. Cheryl made it clear, I was not to e-mail our companys employees and inform them of the change in employment status. As she put it \"They'll find out when they get in and she isn't here, and if they don't, well that's not my problem.\" Lovely. That is not how handle communication matters in my company, and I was completely uncomfortable with it.\n\nSo I go to a VP and discuss what we should do. He says to hold off for a day, let everything settle, then go back and work out a strategy with Cheryl on how to redirect employees who used the old admin until we can hire a new one. Most of our employees, unlike theirs, work out in the field, so it would be important to communicate with those individuals specifically, but it could hold a day. We knew that the old e-mail for the admin was being forwarded to Cheryl, so at least someone was watching the e-mails in case something critical came through. Ok, cool.\n\nNot two hours later Cheryl comes barreling into the cubical area of our office screaming about how our employees are idiots. They clearly are too dumb to understand that the employee who was terminated the night before was no longer with the company. She was sick of getting our stupid e-mails, and didn't want to have to deal with our incompetent employees e-mailing her non-stop. I was a horrible HR manager, I didn't know how to control my people. I clearly wasn't able to handle my job. Just insulting me, our employees, the entire company at the top of her psychotic lungs.\n\nI was clearly to blame, and she was going to get me in so much trouble. She goes running into the CEO's office, and starts flipping out about me. It was a complete clusterfuck. She had friggin set me up as a scapegoat in case her lovely approach to HR went wrong, and when it did immediately, tried to throw me under the bus for something she did! I believe that someone had sent the admin a time-critical e-mail the night before, and Cheryl hadn't caught it, and the deadline had passed for the item maybe 15 minutes before she actually opened the request.\n\nThankfully I'd already talked to the VP, who was a life saver. Cheryl was reminded that whatever had happened was her damn fault, and she was told behind closed doors that if she ever did that again, our company would be logging major complaints with her company, and the CEO's of the two companies were close friends.\n\nShe told every new hire they had that our company was full of lazy, entitled assholes, and actively encouraged hostility between people in each company.

            "Oh man. I've been waiting for this one. Two Words: Dick Tag. \n\nI don't know who started Dick Tag but it became a very popular game very quickly. The whole gist of dick tag was pretty simple. You popped out your dick and showed it to another employee. Whoever saw the dick was it, to not be it, you had to pop your dick out and show it to someone else. I had heard whisperings but people denied that it was a thing and I never witnessed anything so the only thing I could do was to send out an email to remind people of appropriate office behavior. Until then, Dick tag continued until one day, it was taken too far. \n\nOne of our managers, we'll call him Kyle, was an idiot. Kyle decided that the best way to welcome a new employee into the company was to induct him into dick tag. So while this poor kid was filling out his new hire paperwork, Kyle pulls down his pants, dumps his dick on the table, and yells \"YOUR IT\" \n\nAround the same time as this is happening, multiple employees in our parking lot are also playing dick tag.  Our lovely and super sweet accounts payable lady, Ronnie was walking into work and got caught in the crossfire. Here is this woman, who is super religious and has been with the same man her entire life and clutches her pearls at the sight of a shirtless man and within seconds, has this barrage of dicks coming at her. First thing in the morning no less. \n\nRonnie walked into my office like she had seen the devil himself commit kitten genocide but before she even got a chance to explain, the new kid walked in after her, handed me back the new hire paperwork, told me what happened and that this probably wasn't going to be a good fit for him job-wise, and then left. Ronnie then launched into her story about the absolute indecency and how she doesn't know if she can even look her husband in the eye after seeing what she saw. \n\nAfter soothing Ronnie, I call Kyle up, he explains his side, the rules of the game, and rats out who is playing. Kyle is then fired. \n\nThat Friday, a company-wide memo goes out banning dick tag, we have multiple training sessions on sexual harassment, and I have to tell 50 grown men that it's not okay to take your penis out at work. \n\nSo yeah.",
            "Not HR exactly, but management.  Two stories.\n\n1. Law Firm.  We hired a legal secretary who was much older than most (60s), returning for a second or reinstated career.   She had been retired and needed to return to work. Her husband remained retired.  She worked as secretary and he'd drove her to work each day, and pick her up each day.  Week 1, he started waiting for her in the parking lot, in his car.   Week 2, he began waiting in the lobby of the building.  Week 3, he came up to our floor and waited in our own reception area lobby.  It started as a few minutes before 5, then 10 minutes, then 15 minutes, pretty soon as much as 30 minutes.  We asked him NOT to come so early as it made her \"rush\" through end of day tasks.  She was too distracted, knowing he was there. Week 4, he came inside the \"bull pen area\" to get a cup of coffee, and sat down in the employee lounge area, at 4:45 pm.  We did not take kindly to this.   We asked him to back into the outer reception area, and he did.  However, he once again, by Week 5, started arriving earlier and earlier, and would poke his head through the door to the secretarial desks, offices, asking if she was nearing time to go -- well before 5:00 p.m.   She was always so rushed and flummoxed the minute she saw him. Didn't want to make him wait.  I sensed some domestic problems here -- was he a bully?  Was he angry with her hours? Anything wrong?  Need help? No, she said, he's just really bored.  Just had NOTHING to do, she said, and couldn't wait for her to get off work.  We told him he had to go back downstairs to the ground floor, or wait in his car, period.  He was crushed. He did it, but then within days, he'd call her from the lobby pay phone to see \"if you're ready to go.\"  She didn't make it past Week 6 for other reasons, but her husband was a big one. I told her \"your husband is costing you this job, Etta -- you've got to get some control over this.\"  She just wept and said \"I can't hurt his feelings, he's so embarrassed we even need the money.\"   I was then and remain worried that he may have been a source of great pressure and bullying, even though she denied it.   Hope she is collecting social security somewhere, not having to work at her age.\n2. Warehouse Building. I was handling legal work for business owners who had numerous buildings on a \"campus\" including a fuel station and a warehouse and a few pumps and industrial equipment, wells, etc.  Fairly rural area, so not much in the way of vehicular traffic, and virtually no pedestrian traffic unless you were a hobo following the railroad tracks, which happened.  A man kept coming onto the campus at wee hours, had been spotted many times, and he'd steal.  Whatever little things he could recycle. Nothing to the level of stripping copper wire or breaking glass, but a dumpster diver as well, and would eat any food or snacks, and take anything not nailed down, just to survive apparently.  Owners asked him many times to move along, move along. He'd return.  Finally, the \"Old Man\" who started the company came upon him and asked what the heck was his deal, why would you risk jail for this petty stuff?  Well, it would be a cot and a meal, at least, he said.  The owner set up a cot in the warehouse.  Gave him a job. Minimum wage.  Plus a food box.  Said this:  You steal from me one more time, you're out, and you're going to jail.  Or, you can have this cot, live here until you're on your feet, watch over my place, make sure no one like you comes around, make sure no one steals from me and get a paycheck. Your choice.  He took the job.  He's been there, in his little warehouse bunk, for about 6-7 years now. Very very loyal employee. Does all the \"Charlie Work\" for the team, and collects his paycheck, and is very kind.   Brilliant solution, I thought.",

Her fake name for this story will be Sarah. Sarah always had the biggest smile, was super positive, and everyone loved having her on the team.\n\nThree months later, the client calls me. \"painturd, we need to talk about Sarah.\" \"Is everything ok?\" \"No, it really isn't. Do you have her emergency contact information? You need to get in touch with her mom. She needs to come to the hospital. We are heading there now too.\" Several hours of juggling calls to family, the General Manager, our parent corporation's Legal and HR teams, and a federal investigative body ensued.

I work in pharma so I was curious as to why he was leaving his current position, and without skipping a beat, he started going into the legal troubles he was facing.

He pressed on telling me that he was being accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a student and that he was on leave from his current school.\n\nI had to end the interview and excuse myself from the room.

            "I used to help out the HR department at a small town law enforcement agency. We once had a woman call from a payphone, refuse to give her name, and ask if she could come in and fill out a paper application for a secretary position in the investigations department. We standardly only accepted online applications, but she was (allegedly) in the witness protection program and remarked that if she submitted an online application, then an individual who had a hit out for her could track her.\n\nOur HR manager allowed her to come in, and I had the honor of sitting down with the two of them before HR gave her an application. Her story is where things started getting crazy.\n\nShe had 25 years of experience working for a very affluent NFL program, where she had been in charge of coordinating player travel. Over the years, she had made a lot of friends with the players...and an enemy, who just so happens to be a quarterback who has won multiple Super Bowls... He's probably one of the first five quarterbacks that comes to mind if somebody were to ask you \"Who's the greatest quarterback of all time?\"\n\nAnyways, we were a bit doubtful that one of the most famous quarterbacks of all times had a hit for her life, but of course we tried to maintain our composure. After getting paid out by said quarterback, and then \"enlisting in witness protection,\" she ended up in our small town and wanted to apply for the Investigations division department because....she was psychic.\n\nApparently she had used her psychic abilities to uncover some pretty bad dirt on the quarterback, which is why he had it out for her. And she had moved 500 miles away to escape that life, change her name, get witness protection, and start over. When she saw the position in Investigations, she was confident that her psychic abilities would bring a lot of people to justice.\n\nThe freakiest thing is that I mentioned something like \"so what is the extent of your psychic abilities?\" And she responded saying \"Well I know you won't be here much longer.\" At the time, my husband was in the process of applying for a job in a different state, and sure enough we moved away less than 3 months later. I get a laugh out of this because I still don't believe in psychics or anything, but that was quite the coincidence!\n\nAnyways. We had her fill out an application and then proceeded to run our own background check on her. We discovered she was not actually in the witness protection program, but she did indeed have 25 years of experience at that NFL team. Makes me wonder if her truth is somewhere in the middle of all that craziness...",

He told him that he came down to check out the jeans because he liked my friend's so much. They chat a little and my friend introduced his girlfriend and then they left the store leaving his boss to shop.\n\nThat Monday his boss approaches him and hands him a bag full of jeans. He bought a bunch of them at the Levi's store for my friend when he was there and wanted to give them to him. Keep in mind this is at the store itself so these jeans are full price of about $60 each. My friend said he couldn't accept but he insisted, so he reluctantly took them.\n\nHe gets back to desk and his coworker sees the jeans and asks what was the deal. He tells him about what happened, not saying who it was, and his coworker was like, \"Was it_____?\" My friend confirmed and his coworker said, \"Oh yeah HR has a whole file on him. He's done this before with other guys. He bought me a bunch of jerseys last year.\"\n\nSo apparently this guy liked to buy gifts for his coworkers, all male and made most of them feel uncomfortable enough they went to HR about it, but he was big enough in the company and he never really did anything totally inappropriate, so nothing was ever done about it.\n\nMy friend didn't know what to do with the jeans, because he didn't feel okay with wearing them himself, plus only a couple of them sorta fit him, so I said I would take them. As you can see they are various sizes because the guy wasn't sure his exact size and just guessed around, but hey they were free for me.",

Kooky.\n\nDifferent company:\nWe had an interview with a perky young lady who came with her high school co-op facilitator for an interview. Seemed fine enough, we often employ summer students for our offsite work in summer camps, and for some of them, they require some accommodations due to high school education law, etc. Usually kids with autism, Tourettes, ADHD and other disorders do quite well in roles at our summer day camps, and we have several specialized roles to accommodate most teens who really want a job or co-op credits.\n\nHOWEVER, this \"student\" was not a high school student. She looked young. But she was actually 30, and somehow this co-op facilitator had learned we interview students for roles at our camp. Within 5 seconds of starting our interview, it was obvious this lady, while sweet and pleasant, was not able to work at our camps. The facilitator we figured, from looking at the organization he came from, was like a headhunter, placing people with special needs in employment, like Community Living, or something like that. He pleaded with us to take her on as an employee. For every question we asked, she answered \"I work well in teams.\" She just smiled and said that over and over. \n\nI finally took my interview hat off and talked to her without asking those type questions. I found out she lived with her Mom and Dad who she said \"need a break\" and she was trying to earn money because she knew that money \"gets people breaks.\" \n\nI made a couple calls, one to her parents, and found out she had an organic global delay and her parents had paid for this facilitator to try to get her into a day camp as they were retired and felt she needed a change in scenery from them entertaining her 24/7.  I got them in touch with some organizations that they weren't familiar with and she accepted into their program for disabled adults to get involved in community and work small jobs at coffee shops or picking vegetables in summer, or working for golf courses washing dishes, stuff like that.\n\nThis \"facilitator\" KNEW she couldn't possibly work at our camp with children, but lied to get her an interview to beg us to take her so he could earn a fee off of her earnings.

            "A picture of \"Genie\" doing tests: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/14/genie-feral-child-los-angeles-researchers\n\nGenie was a \"feral\" child, but not because she was raised by wolves, but because of abuse, where she was essentially tied to a chair in a room her whole childhood, and punished when she made noise.\n\nShe was found, rescued, and they tried to teach her to speak...but also a lot of linguistic research is based on her case.\n\nThe thing about the picture is...while her family had claimed her to be \"retarded\" she actually managed to learn to communicate a bit. By all we know now, she was curious, intelligent, and eager to learn...her brain had just literally missed the window to learn language.\n\nShe's, on this picture, desperately trying to learn to communicate, but she never gained full language.\n\nAlso, she sort of ended up cast aside by the researchers who used het as a guinea pig. If alive, she's in a assisted living facility somewhere.\n\nEdit: Several people commented on the \"cast aside and used as a guinea pig\" part. While SOME researchers, such as Curtiss, seemed to genuinely have cared for Genie, there definitely are signs that NOT all of them had equally noble motives. I did research this a while back, and different articles focus  on different people.\n\nThis article: https://www.verywellmind.com/genie-the-story-of-the-wild-child-2795241 paints a somewhat different picture than the Guardian one.\n\n\"Psychiatrist Jay Shurley helped assess Genie after she was first discovered, and he noted that since situations like hers were so rare, she quickly became the center of a battle between the researchers involved in her case. Arguments over the research and the course of her treatment soon erupted. Genie occasionally spent the night at the home of Jean Butler, one of her teachers.\n\nAfter an outbreak of measles, Genie was quarantined at her teacher's home. Butler soon became protective and began restricting access to Genie. Other members of the team felt that Butler's goal was to become famous from the case, at one point claiming that Butler had called herself the next Anne Sullivan, the teacher famous for helping Helen Keller learn to communicate.\n\nEventually, Genie was removed from Butler's care and went to live in the home of psychologist David Rigler, where she remained for the next four years. Despite some difficulties, she appeared to do well in the Rigler household. She enjoyed listening to classical music on the piano and loved to draw, often finding it easier to communicate through drawing than through other methods.\n\nNIMH withdrew funding in 1974, due to the lack of scientific findings. Linguist Susan Curtiss had found that while Genie could use words, she could not produce grammar. She could not arrange these words in a meaningful way, supporting the idea of a critical period in language development.\n\nRigler's research was disorganized and largely anecdotal. Without funds to continue the research and care for Genie, she was moved from the Rigler's care.\"\n\nAt the very least, not all of their motives were so pure, and this kid was failed on several levels.",

He made both girls drink a glass of water, drop by drop. Julie died some time later. He stored her body in a plastic bag in a freezer.  \n\n\nHe told Melissa that her friend \"was at the hospital\" to give her hope, brought her some food to make her eat which she could barely do.

            "I don't have it to show anyone, but during the last week of my freshman year of high school, I brought a video camera to school to film my friends and I for fun. The senior class was practicing for graduation (where to walk, where to sit, how to come to the stage for their diploma, etc) in the gym, so our gym teacher just had us sit on the bleachers and watch them/chat. Basically a free period. I got bored, so I filmed some of the seniors rehearsing, including this one guy who I'd known pretty much all my life. He was the definition of a \"gentle giant\". Tall as hell and built like a linebacker, but very kind and would always protect people he saw being bullied. All around great guy. \n\nTwo days later, during senior skip day (senior class skipped school and met up at a nearby park for a big picnic/last hurrah together; local tradition), a group of the senior boys decided to hop into two separate cars for a race. I live in the mountains of West Virginia, and mountainous, curvy as hell, poorly maintained roads are not safe even at the best of times, but while speeding? Dangerous as fuck.\n\nThe two cars reach a set of train tracks and a train is coming. One car makes it across before the train, but the other has to wait for it to pass. It does, and they hurry up catch up with the first car. And then they see it. \n\nThe first car had taken a curve too quickly and went sliding over a hill before wrapping around a tree. The driver lost an arm and a leg, one of the passengers suffered severe brain trauma and was left... just about the closest to a vegetable you can be without actually being one, and the other... the other was our gentle giant. He didn't make it.\n\nDid I mention that the twin of the brain damaged boy was in the second car and was the one who found them? Did I mention that our gentle giant came from an abusive home, so his grandmother had taken him in and raised him, and he had learning difficulties and she just wanted to see him graduate high school and he died mere days before graduation? They buried him in his cap and gown.\n\nAs far as I know, I have the last footage of him alive, somewhere on a tape. I have the last footage of the twin before his life changed forever. The last of the driver with all his limbs.\n\nI still think of him and cry, wishing he'd gotten to graduate, knowing his grandmother was so proud of him, knowing that he was one of the kindest, gentlest men I've ever known, despite coming from a background of so much pain. Knowing that it could've made him angry, made him the bully, and instead it just made him determined to never let anyone go through what he did. \n\nAnyway. I only rewatched that video once. I couldn't bear to look at it again.",

Once the scene with the suicide happened (I think it was within the first few episodes) I got an email from the APA letting all therapists know that suicide rates and attempts spiked. Not only for attempts, but successful attempts as well. Since then I've met more clients I'd like to admit that essentially learned how to be successful with suicide. Some people argue it opened up a conversation about suicide and how it isn't as rare as people would like to believe, but I'd argue that you don't open a conversation about domestic violence by showing someone a video of brutally beating their partner.\n\nEdit: Damn guys, thank you for the gold! In all seriousness though, a lot of you have opened up about how this show impacted you or others in a negative way. If you are struggling with suicidal ideation or depression or self-harm, anything of that nature, PLEASE try to seek out a therapist.

My father was an exec at the Gillette company which for a good long while was the largest manufacturer of pens in the world (paper-mate, waterman, etc.) and then subsequently sold off the stationary division in 2000 (long after my father's retirement).  We visited factories all over in general - kinda dad's thing, nerdy as he was, and proud of his job and company and people.   \n\nThe balls were made of tungsten carbide if I recall, and they weren't manufactured in the factory (most of the pen really was built there, but the balls were brought in ready-to-go, I assume made by some ball specialist.\n\nSo....they have these big vats of them, kind of like farming produce storage containers and you can walk right up to them.  They are absurdly shiny and small enough that it's almost hard to tell they are balls and not a sort of textured surface.  Anyway....you could absolutely sink your hands into that vat.\n\nNever did.

Anyway I'd half empty the box into the tumble blaster, then while that was running I'd tilt the box to the side so all the bb's went to one side, stick my arm down the other side and then tilt the box back so my arm was buried (balls deep)  in ball bearings.

            "My dad died 4 years ago. Right after the funeral, I snagged all his plaid button down shirts (10 of them!) and have spent the last few weeks turning them into a quilt for my mother. I had hoped to do it sooner, but a lot of life happened in the interim and it was just too painful for me to work on it for a while. But I\u2019m finishing up the binding this week and it will be ready by Christmas. I\u2019m so excited (and terrified) to give it to her.\n\nEdit: OMG, I\u2019m overwhelmed at the response to this! I\u2019ve made more quilts than I can remember, but this one is super special to me and I can\u2019t wait to give it. I\u2019ve cried into the fabric as I cut the pieces, as I sewed them together, and as I\u2019ve closed the binding and written the label. The back is wood grain flannel because he loved to make things with his hands. And the binding is a custom-printed orange and blue stripe because he loved him some Auburn Tigers football!\n\nTo add, I also made pillows out of some of the shirts for all the grandkids. I offered mom one, but she said she\u2019d wait for the quilt. She knows it\u2019s coming, just not when, and she\u2019s never seen it. I told her why I wanted the shirts when I took them.\n\nI\u2019m seriously considering telling her ahead of time that this is her Christmas gift and asking if she\u2019d like to see it ahead of time. It\u2019s a big family Christmas with all the grandkids and kids and spouses in attendance.

There were many tears and I worried briefly that they wouldn\u2019t stop, but of course they did. I told her that when she\u2019s ready to wash it, to let me know and I\u2019ll help. Washing handmade quilts is a bit of an art. :)\n\nI was over at her house yesterday (the 26th, also his birthday, incidentally), and it\u2019s on her bed. She said she\u2019s going to have to spend some time with it before letting it go for cleaning. He was a smoker and, while most of the shirts were cleaned and showed no ill effects from the smoke, there was one that he must have especially liked and worn a lot. I pointed that one out and told her it does smell a bit like him. I fully expect that\u2019s one of the reasons she doesn\u2019t want it washed.\n\nI hope it brings her healing. She\u2019s come a long way, but the holiday season is rough. I got a lot of healing from working on it. I told her I\u2019d posted about it online and that there were literally thousands of people who were touched by our story. So thank you all for that.",

            "My dad is a active 91 yr old.   This year he's getting an Oculus Quest VR headset.   It never fails to make me smile to think that he grew up when radio was a big thing. He's seen all the various versions of TV and now (in 11 days) he's going to take the jump into VR.    He's expecting a box of DVD's and books ...which I am getting him but no where near the normal amount.  He's not suspecting a thing. :)\n\n\\[EDIT\\]  Thanks to all that commented and for the gold!  I will get some video of him trying it out and post it.   I don't expect any wide-eyed reaction as he did experience VR for the first time over the summer.  He wanted to get one right then, but the Quest was sold out everywhere.  That was the test to see if there was going to be any grief (nausea, disorientation, etc) and there was nothing out of the normal.     I'm going after 3 VR experiences.    1) Sports Scramble will allow us to do essentially Wii bowling with audio chat in a immersive setting.  It's simple and well, fun.  2) Wander is an app that lets you navigate anywhere Google Streetview has gone, so he'll be able to sight-see the world.. from his couch, 3) Gadgeteer is a problem solving rube-goldberg machine making problem where you line up the dominoes to knock down the teeter totter to flip the ball over to the track... chain reaction sort of thing.    I don't know if things like Beat Sabre or Superhot or First Person Shooters will appeal to him, I doubt it.   I want to start off relatively simple.   I'm driving 10 hours to get to him and have 10 days to get to where he's comfy with it.    Thanks again!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[long update Jan 2nd\\]\n\nok, as requested by a few of you... here's an update. \n\nThe unwrapping didn't happen on the 25th as there was a limited time frame where I could get him playing enough with it to make him feel comfy enough to use it by himself.  I had 6 days.   The Quest was unveiled on the 22nd and I immediately loaded up Wander, Sports Scramble and Gadgeteer as apps. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough he had experienced the VR  thing about 6 months prior to him getting his own, it was a new experience to have to start from scratch and not just have a \"here, put this on\" visor handed to him.   To put his computing skill in content, he's been around computers since the mid-70's. He's comfortable with excell and word and other such office type programs, CorelDraw ( I know, I know) is still his favourite drawing/drafting program. Lately the lack of need to create stuff has diminished the skill set.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe controllers were a bit of a stumble. Grip buttons, index finger buttons, a thumb/joystick control/button and 3 other buttons on each controller proved to be a bit complex.  Having thumbs like sausages didn't help.    So it took a while to get the basic grip thing happening.  The First Steps program in the Quest was helpful.   I remember breezing through it in a few minutes . My 91 yr old dad took about 30 minutes before we moved on.   But it was a decent learning tool.  He kept holding his hands too low for the visor to track the controller consistently.   That was an ongoing issue, so we'll see how it goes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMultiplayer bowling in Sports Scramble was an enlightening experience.  10 years ago he had the Wii bowling so it wasn't  too much of  a leap to do it in VR land.   Bowling was a good introduction to the VR immersion and the traditional (no scramble balls or shifting lane designs) bowling scenario was familiar and yet science fiction at the same time.   He caught on fairly quickly and ended up beating my score by the second game.  Yeah, I was paying more attention to him than my game, but hey, he did end up beating me!    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Gadgeteer program was a bit of a wash.  I didn't have enough time to get it going properly.  The initial set up seems like it has to be done from standing mode.   The instruction tutorial needed some space to have the participant walk up to a panel and click a button.  But from the sitting-down mode, there was no way to get close enough the start panel to initiate the tutorial to get it started. This was needed to get the info/gestures to move within the game environment.  So after a bit of time sitting and waving hands around and not getting anywhere, it was abandoned for a later time when one could play the game standing up.. at least long enough to get the directions on how to play sitting down.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWander was a big hit.  It had it's learning curve and his thick thumbs kept triggering the voice command button which caused some confusion.  By the end of my trip this I was the program that  he was most comfy with.   It's essentially Google Street view with a VR interface, but it allowed him to check out places he'd been to, went to school at, towns visited... so this was a good experience.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't really care which program he took a liking to.   Once he gets familiar with one the others will drop into place.   It'll take a few weeks for him to get to the \"push a button and see what happens\" happy spot.   I did tell him about the internet place that had 7k+ people liking the idea that he's getting involved with VR.  He shrugged that off with a disbelieving , \"Yeah? Why would they be interested?\"   To which I responded .. \"Becuase!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhere's a  link to [a still photo of him wearing the gear](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tHGu2MQsn_N__6mQpfQN1hfxt4OwpVFJ).

            "My brother's been saving to take a course abroad next year. It's a huge deal for him and a game changer career wise (I don't fully understand why or the details but he's been saving for a year, sold his car and stuff so it's a huge deal for him). He's supposed to have the money to pay everything before December 30th.\n\nWhen he goes to pay, he'll find out it's already paid. \n\nBest part is he gets to believe, for a week, all he's got from me is a pair of socks.\n\nEdit: Wow! I didn't expect this reaction. Thanks everyone for the awesome comments and for the awards. This community is truly amazing! \n\nI thought I'd provide more information here to try and answer some of the questions :)\n\nWe live in Brazil and he's going to the UK for a year and a half. \n\nHe'll be taking his masters there for a year and a half. This has been a goal of his for a while and, according to him, will help him get a good job in a larger company in one of the capitals. We live in a small town, not a lot of options for someone in his line of work.\n\nAs to why he's been saving for a whole year, we're in Brazil. Exchange rate is 1 GBP to 5.47 BRL. That alone is quite the challenge. \n\nHe's been saving for tuition + accommodation for the first two months and is paying through a local travel agency. The owner is a close personal friend, so I'm not very worried about him paying twice.\n\nTo everyone worried about the car, he was going to sell it anyways. It doesn't make any sense to keep it stored for a year. Cars are quite expensive in Brazil, so yeah, he was going to use the money towards the trip. Now he can use it to explore.\n\nOh, and I'll post an update here once he finds out :)\n\nEdit: UPDATE\n\nSo he got the socks! He has until the 30th to pay for the course so he hasn't found out yet but he did his best to look happy with the socks \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 It was pretty clear he was disappointed though!\n\nI will need to travel back home tomorrow so I won't be around to actually see his face when he finds out. But I am sure he's gonna call / text so I'll post an update with the reaction :)\n\nEdit: UPDATE\n\nHe found out!! And as promised here's an update on the reaction.\n\nHe called me and he was crying :) He said he called our father to ask if he could borrow a couple grand to be able to make the payment today and my dad told him it had been paid already. He couldn't believe it.\n\nHe kept saying thank you and that he hopes some day he can pay the gesture back. I told him he more than did already. He was there for me everytime I needed. He went out of his way to pull me out of the gutter when I was down. I was always able to rely on him. \n\nHe cried. I cried. \n\nWe talked about the UK, about his plans for the future and decided that, now that he has spare money to explore Europe, we'll take a trip together next summer.\n\nI wish I had been there when he found out. \n\nThank you everyone for your kind words in the comments.",
            "My girlfriend hate presents and everything that connected with them. Any kind of celebration she skip and trying to avoid as much as possible. But once,  we got drunk and she said, that she's waiting only for Christmas and New year's EVE. Those two holidays that makes her happy and comfy like home. ( should notice she's living out of country  for the last 15 years. And during that time she never spoke or seen her parents only text. ( country blocking any kind of communication aka. Skype or Facebook.)) I brought as a gift  her parents to the country, and basically they are here already and they saw her maybe like 2 or 3 times. She's working in luxury restaurant and they have their own zones where they serve and you can change your zone only every half of year. I can't wait to see her reaction on Christmas dinner. I book a villa where we will celebrate Christmas. All of the family. Also I'm planning to propose her on that day. Oh well wish me luck. Love her so much that can't wait at all. Thanks that at least on Reddit I can tell my story.\n\n\nUpdated: so many people are asking for updates of this thread, definitely send you a pic of her ring, but can't promise the video, please understand that privacy is important for me :D much love all of you redditors\n\nUpdated 2: so many people enjoyed this story and felt sad because her parents are not close to her. You might probably change my mind, and the idea that I spend time with them instead of her makes me cry.\nMost probably I'll try to find time in her schedule ( because of high amount of work ) to take her in restaurant and make a surprise earlier. Anyway the 2nd gift is still with me and I'm 100% sure I don't want to rush with it. It's an serious move to all of us.\n\nP.s. thank you Redditors for all your support, your warm words and all the wishes that you gave me.

            "I've been trying to teach him how to cook. His mom did basically everything for him and his brother up into their late 20s. So far he's done alright with spaghetti, although he has to check with me every step of the way, but if he's required to actually cut any sort of meat himself it's a total loss.\n\nOne night we were making dinner and it required cutting some chicken breasts. I handed him the knife, stepped away from the cutting board, and watched him press the blade down on the chicken gently. No slicing. No real movement of the knife at all, actually. He just looked up at me helplessly, like the chicken wasn't just parting neatly and he had *no idea* what to do about it.\n\nHis idea of stirring something also includes sloshing great waves of it up over the sides of whatever container it's in. Although he is blown away by my ability to whisk eggs and not make a mess, so it's kind of nice in some ways. This is a guy who is, in all other areas of life, one of the smartest people I know. He's just completely helpless with food.",

            "This was in 1998.  I was M 17, she was F 18.  We had the day set.  I drove around for like a week trying to find a \"spot\".  I found one inside a wilderness preserve.  The day comes, it was late, dark outside.  We were in a tiny truck, the front ~~on~~ of the truck, not the bed.  I knew it had to be hard, and where it went, and that was the end of my knowledge.  So, she had a condom, I put it on, and I put it in.  And.. I... didn't... move...  I just put it in and laid there perfectly still.  Needless to say, it didn't take long for things to go south.  Now, I had masturbated plenty in my life, but I honestly thought that had nothing to do with the movements required for actual sex.  So, it went soft, I was embarrassed, and I got out of the truck.  The condom was no longer really useful.  She told me to throw it out and try again.  I was worried, but she reassured me that it would be fine.  She ended up telling me a lot of lies over the next few years.  (Actually, it was fine, but that was still dumb on our part).  Anyway, I manually got hard, trying to hide what I was doing from her.  This time, I did the \"masturbate\"  movements while I was inside her, even it it made me seem like a weirdo by moving during sex, just trying to make something happen.  Well, it happened, and I was relieved.  Now, to get out of there.  I had pulled into an area of the woods where there was a small pull in.  When I reversed out, I reversed into a ditch.  Not a large ditch, but definitely stuck in the mud now.   No amount of forward or reverse would get us out.  We had no phones, this was just before cell phones became common.   So, we began a 1-mile walk through this wilderness preserve at night.  Talk about being scared.  We came across a house, a random house with a big dog.  I wanted to skip that house, but it was the only one for another mile.  So, we went to the door, knocked, and told the suspicious home owner we were stuck and asked to use their phone.  I had a friend, actually more of an acquaintance, with a truck.  I had to guess at his dad's name to look them up in the phone book.

            "Throwaway cuz this shits fucking embarassing.\n\n\nI was very sheltered, like absolutely no movies with sex and even kissing scenes had to be skipped/eyes averted. Always taught not to kiss until marriage. Sex was taboo, and to this day I still have some irrational shame talking openly about it. The only people I socialized with at all were like me, extremely sheltered and old fashioned (small town, small church, small school). Had \"sex ed\", but it never actually taught us about sex, just basic anatomy - I think it was 20 minutes once a year, only in grade 5 and 6.\n\n\nFirst time I got a boner, maybe 13 idk but I thought the head of my dick was gonna fall off as soon as the foreskin pulled back behind that edge and it freaked me out. I sat on the toilet for a good while just holding the foreskin forward until it went away on its own.\n\n\nFirst time I masturbated I was I think 17. My dick was *disgusting*. Because I had never done it before and never really played with my dick at all, and nobody told me anything about cleaning it, there was years of dick cheese (aka dead skin and all that stuff) that built up into a several mm thick layer under my foreskin. I don't remember a smell, but hard to imagine how there wasn't one.\n\n\nOne night I had a boner randomly in bed and I got super annoyed and just looked at it, and a piece of this dick cheese was sticking out from the edge of the foreskin and starting to come off... so I just carefully (holy shit it was sensitive) pealed it off. Then some more, then some more...it felt *amazing*. Like pealing dried glue off your finger nails had sex with, well, having sex and this was its baby. I eventually ran out of this nasty fucking shit to clean off but by then I realized that moving the foreskin back and forth on my dick felt amazing...so I kept doing it. Then I sped up. Then I came. Then I knew. I had never cum before then except from wet dreams, and I 100% was convinced I was sterile. So seeing that white stuff come out was almost better than the orgasm itself.\n\n\nThe interesting thing is I'd been looking at porn for years by that point, but somehow masturbation had never even crossed my mind. I just didn't know it was a thing people did. Someone at school asked me if I masturbated in grade 9 and I didn't even know what the word meant so I had to go home and look it up, and I tried a few different web searches but all I found was that its when guys \"put their penis between the mattress and boxspring and thrust\". Which I thought was super fucking weird and painful and why do that. To this day I have no idea how nothing more explicit came up on that altavista search but that's how I remember it.\n\n\nTo this day I'm actually pretty self conscious about the whole thing. Like how fucking dense was I that I took so long to figure such a basic human exercise out? How disgusting is it that I didn't figure out how to clean my own dick? Wtf was I thinking about when I looked at all that porn? Am I fucking autistic? (Probably to some extent).",

Almost a criminal act.\n\n- Age 7 to 8 - I found out ALL people who had children had sex at least once. I never looked at adults the same way again. My 5th grade friend told me reluctantly. \n\n- Later that year - through overhearing my married cousin, I realised that people have had WAY more sex than the amount of children they have. I was thinking it was a once or thrice in a lifetime thing.\n\n- Age 9 - somehow I figured out COMPLETELY on my own that sex happens when a penis enters a vagina. It is NOT through just sleeping and kissing with someone while naked. \n\nThis was because my similarly aged, uninformed friend had mentioned **that a penis must get \u201csoft enough\u201d to have sex.** You\u2019re welcome for the laugh. \ud83d\ude09 I managed to connect some dots.\n\n- Age 11 - I read a poorly written erotica from my sister\u2019s secret collection. \u201cBlowjobs are a thing? \ud83e\udd22\u201d\n\n- Age 12 - I read a really GOOD, steamy romance novel. My face was red as a tomato by the time I finished reading the sexy scenes. This was my first real sex-Ed on the mechanics of sex. I was introduced to the concept of nipple sucking for the first time which blew my mind, just reading about it made me soak my panties. I also thought to myself, \u201coral sex actually sounds really, really good.. \ud83d\ude05\u201d\n\n- Age 15 - I stil didn\u2019t really know what an orgasm was because I was homeschooled, and romance novels are so fucking elusive when it comes to describing what the fuck an orgasm actually is. \n\nThankfully by then I started typing in questions about sex on the internet, found r/sex, and lurked for a while in this ~~unicornicopian~~ sub. \n\n**This was how I first discovered Reddit.**\n\nThrough people\u2019s comments I came to realise that orgasms are the final goal of sex, but you can actually have them on your own.\n\nAs someone who had never masturbated before and never thought I ever would, I set about on the project to achieve an orgasm. Two weeks I researched on r/sex about different methods to reach orgasm, trying and failing. It was so difficult and frustrating. And not to mention I felt awkward in the beginning. I was hopeless. I tried a vibrating massager, shower head, faucet, lube, fingers, pillow, etc. \n\nBut it\u2019s all in the technique and the way you \u201chold\u201d and \u201cmanage\u201d your body, and I finally got it. \n\nIt was thanks to two different comments on r/sex.\n\n1. One mentioned to try squeezing your PC muscles super tight all the way down to your asshole. (That led me to squeezing so tight I could have passed out from lack of oxygen \ud83e\udd23)\n\n2. That alone didn\u2019t work. So I tried the advice of another comment which mentioned \u201cnot to forget to breathe!!\u201d\n\nAnd voila. \n\nSo you can say **Reddit gave me my first orgasm.** \n\nSo, thanks Reddit. \n\nHope my story reaches you guys.",

For 21 years she never once entertained the thought of wanting to be married, and by the transitive property of abstinence before marriage she thought she'd never have to worry about sex (the near equivalent of, \"Sex? Shit, teach me somethin' I'm actually gonna USE!\"). Never planned any dream wedding. Decided she never wanted kids. She thought the idea of \"sticking something up there\" was icky in general (she uses pads), leading to an ingrained Liz Lemon-esque relationship with sex. So, in her defense, her ignorance was a confluence of many many things that coalesced on our wedding night. Her understanding of sex started here:\n\n> Prior to age 20 (only a year after we met), when a girlfriend showed her porn for the first (and only) time, my wife's idea of sex was literally the thought of people, \"sleeping together,\" and the nightmare scenario she created: while asleep in a bed next to one another, tendrils protrude from each others limbs and chest, dance and envelop each other and then \"sex stuff\" happens, but you're asleep for it. Then they wake up happy, and sometimes there's a baby afterward.\n\nWhat continuously makes me laugh when I think about the vacuum of details that had to occur for her to glean \"tentacles\" from reading between the lines of \"sleeping together\" while not concerned enough about the subject at all to ask her parents, or anybody she's confided in since childhood. Even conversationally, I wonder how she missed picking up things sometimes, it's magical.\n\nFast forward some years of friendship and courtship and suddenly it's our wedding night. By then we had more-or-less explored one another's bodies before (the \"reveals\" of which went great; I'm no prize: she literally couldn't be judgmental because she'd never seen another guy's tendril; maybe she was lowkey expecting more of them?), but no penetration of sorts. Anyway, it's late, we're both in the mood and physically ready, but she was locked up tighter than WR.UP pants. After some hours trying, we blamed stress, whiskey and the shitty DJ at the hotel bar and went to sleep. The issue was manifold (and had nothing to do with lubrication! I don't know why I feel like I need to put that in there, but something tells me somebody's gonna wonder!), more to do with a lack of experience using those parts of her body.\n\nRemember that history of never worrying about sex? Well, that included masturbation: her head never had a reason to go _that_ direction, so she never tempted herself, and ultimately never \"learned\" about masturbation. Tampons? Nope, passed that up years ago. Couple searing pain, tearing sensations felt by a person who has no problem reasonably avoiding _anything_ that could cause pain or discomfort because \"why wouldn't you? that's silly,\" with the personality trait of stubbornly believing their anxious paranoia, and that flower isn't giving up any nectar anytime soon. Suddenly, we weren't sure that sex was going to be a part of our new marriage.\n\nI'll gloss over the stress and depression we were both fighting during our first year together (new couple, new city, new jobs), but it took over a year of stop/go trying, therapy, research, doctor visits to tell her it's her head pushing on her body that's keeping her agitated, and her self-committing to using a set of dilators in the bathtub to develop a comfort with the sensation of insertion, and manipulation of her sensitive areas. For her, one day she tried the dilators and it just \"slipped right in.\" We successfully made love that night, and we've been making up for it since.\n\nBoy that was long, but I don't think I'll ever get to tell this story to anybody but Internet strangers. Now you know, too.",

The guy didn't have the heart to tell her, so he just let her keep at it for a couple of minutes and pretended to orgasm.\n\nHe did have the heart to tell just about everybody else, after which she became known as the Grandfather Clock (sounds way snappier in our language, though).

Anyway we were sitting there and i said something along the lines of \" blah blah.... have sex.... blah blah\" and my friend just says \"wait what?\".

She started laughing (she liked that I was slapping her) and biting harder, I slapped her again. I pulled my penis out of her mouth (that hurted the most, I felt every tooth of hers scrathing my junk while pulling out), after that the penetration happened. No problems during that. I was smelling my penis the rest of the night because I could not believe I had sex. And it smelled like real sex haha.\n\nSo that was my first time without proper teachings or education, the only thing I could have done in that moment was using my porn knowledge, and we all know porn and sex are not the same thing.",

            "The Chinese MeToo movement actually spread around about 3 days ago. The accusation of a charity celebrity sparked widespread discussion, and more survivors stood out to tell people what they've been through. Most people who are accused are those with some power, such as professors and leaders and media people iirc.\n\nThe hashtag \"MeToo\" was banned from Weibo, a Twitter-like social media, when one famous CCTV (Chinese Central TV) host, Zhu Jun got accused. That guy was a constant host for China's largest broadcast festival of each year (Spring Festival Gala), so at the time police and government persuades the survivor to just drop the case (Plus, her parents worked for the government, so their jobs would be in peril if she insisted on suing Zhu Jun). Now the case was brought up again, and for some reason, you can't find any description of the case when you search on Weibo. \n\nOn the bright side, at least  someone that has a lot of power in the system (apparently) got exposed to his past sins. On the dark side, the purge on Weibo probably implied a sudden death to the movement. ",

On last labor day (may 1st here in France) he was filmed, dressed as a cop and amongst cops, beating up a protestor. The protestor had it coming, threw shit at the police etc. However, Benalla was supposed to be there only for observation purpose. He should not have intervened, especially not with cops being nearby for that purpose.\n\nGerard Collomb, minister of the interior, knew about this video from the get go. However, it took until July for Benalla to be recognised. Consequently, shit hit the fan.",

            "I wasnt the surgeon, I was the patients family doc, and took care of him in the hospital for his short stay after. \nHe had a cue ball get stuck. Not sure exactly what he thought would be the way to get it out. We had a lot of trouble getting it out. \n\nThe conversation of the surgeons trying to come up with a way to get it out was pretty hilarious.",
            "ER doc here, as previous posters suggest, it becomes hard to distinguish what is weird any more, so judge for yourselves\n\n3 lemons\nAbout a foot of broom handle\nA lightbulb (which did not survive is adventure)\nSo many toilet brushes (inserted brush and handle first)\nA series of toothpicks\nAny number of bottles, aerosol cans, etc\n\nMy favourite case was a simple dildo. We xrayed it and the radiologists report read: \u201cThere is an approximately 15cm cylindrical foreign body in the large intestine extending proximally from the rectum. Judging by the indistinct outline of the foreign body, I suspect it is still on\u201d",
            "I\u2019m a vet. Dog had eaten a whole roll of poop bags (the plastic baggies people use to clean up after their pets on walks). They unspooled in his gut and spread from stomach to colon. His owners realized what had happened when he started pooping out bags, and brought him in through ER. My coworker went in to cut him, and the scene she described was hilarious: he would intermittently strain a little, and poop out a little section of bags. Someone would tear them off, and he\u2019d be ok for a bit then poop out some more. Like he was dispensing them for himself! He did great after surgery.",
            "Endo Tech here, had a guy come in with a capped section of PVC pipe filled with Mercury because he liked the \"sloshing\" when he Jerkin his turken. Had to call in Hazmat and security had to be called when he became violent because they wouldn't give the Mercury laden pipe back.",
            "ER Nurse.  I've seen baseballs, loads of dildos, cans of soda, vegetables. There should be a public service announcement about using dildos in the bum. It needs to have balls, or some sort of base so it doesn't get lost up there. Women's vaginal dildos don't need them, as there is only so far it will go. A doctor I worked with once told a man, \"It's ok if you want to put things in your rectum. You just have to use the right things\".",
            "Years ago my nurse wife told me a man had an apple removed from his butt but I never understood how this could be possible. I often think about this but have never asked her for more details. I\u2019ll ask her over the table at Christmas dinner tonight.\n\n**dissapointing update**   \n\nI didn\u2019t ask her at the Christmas dinner. There were small children around and everyone was having a nice time, it didn\u2019t seem cool to bring it up. Also no one else started any butt stuff related conversations providing an opening for my inquiry. \n\nI asked her today but also told her about my post on here. She didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing the details with you guys so I guess you\u2019ll just have to use your imagination. \n\nSomeone posted about a similar situation and suggested they had possibly worked with my wife. Based on the details in their post I am sure it was a separate apple/butt incident.",
            "A enormous silicone butt plug which broke off at its base inside the patient. It was shaped like a soft cone on a stalk, with the base at the bottom. Had to remove it in pieces.\n\nAlso, an Orangina bottle two years before this butt plug.",
            "A friend of my mine is a surgery resident and during one of her trauma shifts a meth head walked in with an incandescent light bulb in his colon... it was shoved in with the wide part first. They were dilating the rectum in an attempt to remove it and the resident in charge of the procedure managed to accidentally separate the  metal base from the glass globe; which immediately shattered under the pressure if the colon. They had to perform a partial colectomy to resolve the complication. Meth is a hell of a drug. \n\nA foreign body per rectum is a fairly common occurrence. In my time rotating in the ER the most common things have been yuca roots, avocados, shampoo bottles, etc. But that lightbulb story is still unmatched... I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen the xray.",
            "When I worked in the ER we had a guy come in with a 6 battery Maglite stuck up Main Street.  The funny part is that it was inserted bulb out and it was turned ON. \n\nSo we laid him down prone and the doc spread his cheeks; then the room lit up like he just cracked open Marcellus Wallace's briefcase.",
            "Back when I was an ER tech, we had this guy come in with a full size bottle of VO5 shampoo up his butt. Of course he said he \"fell on it in the shower.\" You could clearly see it on the X-ray, it was pretty spectacular. The best part was he knew exactly what needed to be done to get it out, suggesting that this wasn't the first time...he asked for conscious sedation and for someone to pull it out...well the ED doctor tried that, then tried to manually get it out with forceps, and was essentially elbow deep in this dude...but couldn't get it. He had to go to the operating room to get it taken out. I bumped into the surgeon a few days later and asked him how it went ...he joked to me that \"after we knocked him out, I grabbed a plunger out of the bathroom and got it out that way.\" But then told me all he had to do was stick some suction up there till he felt it connect, and then slowly pulled it out.\n\nAccording to the surgeon, this guy never presented any sort of identification or insurance card, and demanded to pay his entire bill before he left (usually takes some time for bills to get finalized). He paid it completely in cash, and then left via a taxi.",
            "I\u2019d be more interested in what non-medical people have had to help people remove from their butts",
            "Not my story, my friend is a radiographer. A guy came into the hospital with Barbie dolls up his butt. After scans, One came out without too much issue, but the other was too far up. They were worried that if it was pulled out, it\u2019s arms would open and puncture the bowel. So they scheduled surgery, the x-ray staff waiting excitedly for news...\nThe surgeon then returned and with a serious voice announced: \u201c We\u2019ve found Ken\u2019.",
            "Not a surgeon but, wowie wowie, do I know a LOT of cases involving \"falling\" on things and other such excuses. Here are just *some* of the things I know:\n\n* A Buzz Lightyear action figure.\n* A Barbie doll.\n* Plaster of Paris (they wanted a mold of his colon. Instead, it had to be cut open as it was glued shut by the plaster)\n* Glasses (the sight kind)\n* Jewelry (mostly necklaces)\n* A cucumber which, after proclaiming he fell over in the Garden naked and landed on his cucumber patch, STILL HAD THE TESCO WRAPPER ON IT.\n* A light bulb.\n\nFinally, on a rather dark note, if you're a fool who slipped something up their black hole (cos the butt sucks things in disturbingly well) they can't retrieve, please, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, ***GO TO YOUR DOCTOR***. People have died due to toxic shock due to this shit, a guy here died of it in two weeks due to having a dildo stuck up their and never went to his doc's. Your pride can recover, but you can't recover from death.",

            "Not me but a good friend I have known since 6th grade who is an emergency room Dr.  \n\nStraight couple in their early 20s and they were using a vibrator on her.  They switch (he said it was his first time) and they had lube everywhere and the slim 6 inch vibrator disappeared all the way up in him while it was still on.  They waited and tried to get it out on their own and finally went into the ER.  They were going to wait til the batteries died but it was getting late.  My buddy tried to get it out but couldn\u2019t get it.  He told the guy they might have to do surgery to get it.  The guy asks my buddy if he has to go in can he call his mom and tell her.  My buddy laughs and says you are 22 and YOU get to call your mom to tell her you have a buzzing vibrator in your ass that might be perforating your colon.\n\nThen my buddy remembers a guy he went to medical school who works in the same hospital.  He has freaky long thin fingers like ET that might work.  The other DR gloves up and gets the vibrator still buzzing out of him.\n\n\nJust a FYI it is really easy for this to happen so limit the lube on your hands.  Your colon gets like a suction on it and things go in easy like what happened to these guys.\n\n(Edited- subbed vibrator where dildo was)",
            "I was an RN at a busy Detroit emergency department. A homeless woman, frequent-flier and drug abuser came in to see us with abdominal pain. The x-ray revealed 17 oval-shaped objects in her vaginal space.\n\nThey were removed by a very diligent medical resident armed with a speculum and McGill forceps, with the aid of an ultra sound tech.\n\n17 Barbie doll heads. Their removal was made a bit easier by their long hair.\n\nEDIT: Former co-worker saw my post! Small world. Reminded me of the man with the small fluorescent bulb in his rectum. He insisted on the doctor in the ER just pulling it out, and sending him on his way. But those bulbs break very easily (lacerated colon) and are full of toxic chemicals (poisoning). Surgical removal was recommended, but he flatly refused, because hey, what would he tell his wife? He signed out AMA and we never saw him again.",

The real joy of removing a foreign body usually isn\u2019t what was removed but it\u2019s the story you\u2019re told as to how it got there. No one just fesses up. \n\nMy personal best was removing two vibrators double sided taped together. He admitted that he was pleasuring himself with one when it got stuck however he was too embarrassed at the time to get help, so he took another vibrator and put double sided tape on it in an attempt to fish the first one out. The way these were taped together was clear they had been approximated together well before ever inserting one. \n\nMy favourite from a colleague was a man who had a carrot in his rectum. This man was convincing that it was an accident. He swore up and down it was an accident and even said that he knew how unbelievable his story sounded. He said he was making dinner but his wife had the thermostat up in the house. He normally runs hot anyways so this was excruciating. Adding insult to injury he had both the stove and the oven on so it was really hot. He was afraid of sweating into the dinner so he had to get naked. After washing the carrots there was some water on the floor and he slipped when the one in a million chance happened and he had a carrot go up his ass. In the OR everyone made comments about just how convincing he was. When it was removed it had been shaved into the shape of a penis. \n\nBonus story of a colleague: there was a guy who had already had two items removed previously and came in with a third.

I mean I know it started with a Z but I didn't want to butcher it. But in my mind I kept seeing that lemur talking to the men. I did not know that they used a real lemur for some parts and a puppet for other. I could have sworn it was a cartoon lemur.  So sorry about the confusion there. \n\nThis is just many of the crazy things this son has put me through over the years.

The proportions will be a bit different, but the same plant will produce the same soup for 3 or 4 different off brands as well as their own.\n\nAt least Campbells changes up their formula a bit.  Meat packers don't.  A meat packer will produce their own brand, plus one or two off brands, but it's exactly the same meat, from the same plant, processed exactly the same way.  No variation whatsoever.  The only difference coming from a meat packing plant is the shipping and handling instructions.  Some brands insist the meat not be frozen, others want it frozen solid as a rock.\n\nBut the worst offenders is the \"organic\" industry.  The definition of \"organic\" in the U.S. allows for stuff that is definitely NOT anyone's idea of organic.  Organic produce will tend to be smaller than its non-organic counterpart, and often with natural blemishes you normally don't see on regular produce.

But in reality, it's not about quality, but about customer manipulation.\n\nLet's say you see three HDMI cables on the shelf. First one is just wound and ziptied, marked $5. The second is $25, and it's in a nice paper box with some snazzy graphics on it. Third one is $120, has a thick box with dark maroon and gold graphics, looks ornate and fancy.\n\nThe consumer is going to think \"well, I don't want something that looks cheap and will probably break after a week of use,\" so they skip the $5 cable. But then they look at the $120 cable. They figure \"ah-hah, I'm no fool, I know a rip-off when I see it, this is all just fancy packaging!\" So they skip the $120 cable. They happily choose the $25 cable, believing they have outwitted those clever marketing folks at the HDMI Cable Factory, and returns home with their smart sensible purchase thinking they won.\n\nBut they haven't.\n\nThe cables are all the same.\n\nThey just spent $20 more for a simple paper box. They were tricked by the \"middle option\" product, deceived into thinking it has any justifiable value over the cheaper ones simply because it was placed next to an absurdly overpriced version.\n\nFortunately, people have wised up to this practice, and thanks to user reviews on online retailers, it's much harder to pull this scam. But back in the mid 2000's, when HDMI cables first started rolling out, you had some pretty awful offenders out there, and even more unfortunate, a lot of \"ah-hah, I'm no fool\" consumers thinking they were seeing right through it.",
            "I'll just throw this in there- LUBE.\n\nIf you use a lot of lube or would just rather never have to buy it again then go search for a bottle of J-LUBE or K-LUBE. K-LUBE is safest as it doesnt contain sugar which would give any would be lubettes a gnarly yeast infection.\n\nForget what it's intended purpose is (getting your arm(s) inside cows to help with delivery) this shit works. It comes in a moderate sized bottle of white powder. All you have to do us add water.\n\nSprinkle it on a toy, wet your hand and give the toy a once over and you're good to go. Dump a bunch in a cup or bottle and add some water, stir the shit out if it and keep it on standby, whatever you need. The more water you add the thinner it will be, the less water you add the thicker and stringier itll be, if that matters to you.\n\nHeads up- this stuff is insane. If you're looking to have fun in the shower or bathtub be very fucking careful. Whatever it gets on will be cartoonishly slippery, ceramic very much included. It takes a bit of time to wash off (water will do it just fine it just takes a bit) but that also means you likely wont have to reapply. \n\nOne bottle is like $50CAD and I can't see myself ever running out. I dont know how this lube tastes if that's a factor. I imagine terrible since taste has nothing to do with what it's meant for.\n\nAlso another protip- any numbing lube is shit and dangerous. I know this part has nothing to do with the original posted question but while were on the topic of lube I thought I'd throw it in. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. You can be tough and push through it but that doesnt mean you're not hurting yourself, which might set you up for more injuries later. Numbing does not help this in the least, all it does is take away your body's ability to tell you that you're hurting it, and you might be hurting it a lot more than you realize. Any lube with a gimmick is not a great lube nor a good idea. Cooling/tingling/heating/glow in the dark/nanobots, etc. \n\nTo reiterate: J-LUBE for butt stuff (dudes not ladies just to be safe) and K-LUBE for putting just about anything anywhere in anyone.",

On top of this we do have some more high end custom shop guitars on consignment. \n\nThese Japanese guitars cost in the ballpark of $300-800. To some people that might be a beginner guitar and to others that might be a perfect price range, but the quality you receive for that price absolutely rivals guitars that sit even in the above $1k range. These guitars look wacky and interesting, but have really substantial build quality and they sound great. I own 3 Japanese guitars that span the 60s-70s range. And while you can\u2019t sweep pick on them, I\u2019ve put all three through hell during my shows and not a single one has freaked out on me. \n\nMy favourite shape of all time is a good old Les Paul. However, In more recent times, I believe (and so do thousands of others) the quality control of Gibson, the leading Les Paul manufacturer, just isn\u2019t there anymore. I think they\u2019ve made bad business decisions and overall have lost focus on their instruments. Their guitars sit roughly between $1,800-4,000 and that\u2019s a more budget instrument all the way up to their high end custom shop. \n\nI own a 70s Japanese Les Paul, and a high end Epiphone Les Paul. The total combined cost of the two would be around $1,300. Substantially lower than the price of a Gibson, however both of them play exactly the same, if not better. To really summarise, fantasising about being a big rock star with a $3000 guitar isn\u2019t the way, because you can 100% find something that is exactly the same for not even a third of the price. You just have to really really look hard, it might even take you years, but it\u2019s not all about those big name brand.

            "I have had plenty of things in butt excuses but by far my most memorable story was a guy who came in because he had unravelled electrical wire and taken one of the thin pieces of wire and stuck it up his urethra (penis). By the time he came in he has lost it inside his shaft. After an xray it was found to be balled up at the base of his penis. This led to a trip to theatre to cut it out via a decent sized incision at the base. His father gave the excuse: boys will be boys ... he was 18 at the time.",

            "Not a doctor, not my story, and not a butt story, but sorta relevant and a weird twist on the usual 'something up the butt' story.\n\nWhile backpacking I met an English doctor who we spent a few weeks travelling with. Asked him for his weirdest ER story, and he had a few doozies, but mainly the usual lightbulb/Barbie doll up thr ass scenario. He did tell us a good one about a pregnant women who came in with her partner, with a little something shoved up somewhere else though- \n\nThe couple doesn't appear to be first in line for a Nobel Prize, judging by this story. Basically they were worried that having sex would be bad for the baby, so decided to get a bit experimental instead. Baby daddy was tickling mummy-to-be with a makeup brush around her clitoris/urethra, and ended up shoving the makeup brush up her urethra. The thing must have disappeared up there, because they couldn't get it out and she required surgery to have the damn thing removed. \n\nI've never forgotten that story. I think about it every time I set a catheter. It must have really been up in there...",

            "Everyone is giving good advice, but flirting didn't click for me until i heard it described not as a set of behaviors to look out for, but as an escalation of suggestive behaviors couched in plausible deniability.\n\nPut practically, if someone is doing something to engage you that feels extra (lots of touching, looking at you in a way that feels a bit to long, or doing a lot of poking fun and complimenting you), then that might be flirting or it might not. That's the whole point. Plausible deniability. They can safely disengage at any time.\n\nIf you want to know if someone's flirting, you need to test it. You do that by escalating things, but just a bit, so that now *you* have plausible deniability (touch them back in a comfortable way, maintain eye contact, or joke-compliment them back). If they escalate back and continue to do so as you escalate in turn, that is flirting. Eventually one of you will break cover and do something with clear intent (a kiss, an approach + ask for a number, or straight up telling them what you think of them and that you're interested). Otherwise, if you escalate and they don't change their behavior or they back off, then they were probably just being friendly and you should take the hint and do the same.\n\nDunno if that's something obvious to people, but it was definitely not for me, and college parties would have been way less fun had i not known. Hopefully this can help someone else too :)",
            "If you're in a group of friends (new or old), find a natural opportunity to hang back. Someone who's interested in you will notice and take the opportunity to talk to you in private. Now this isn't full proof but it'll at least give you the opportunity to feel for any chemistry between you.",

One night she was dropping me off at my place after a movie. \n\nTurned the car off, put her arm on my headrest as we chatted before I got out.  I was fully in the mindset that we were just friends, so I. Shook. Her. Hand.  Goodnight. \n\nRIP.",
            "Good at flirting also means recognizing when the other party isn't receptive.\n\nIf they're answering briskly and killing conversation, cut your losses and move on.",
            "If they look directly at you while talking to their friend it's a good sign",
            "I read once that if someone looks at you after someone (doesn't have to be you) said something funny and everyone is laughing, they like you. From personal experience, it's true",
            "They make a lot of eye contact. They are interested in what you have to say and ask you lots of questions. They laugh at your jokes, even the lame ones. They initiate physical contact. They try to find space where you can talk more privately (this does not always mean sex but it often means they wish for more quality time with you).\n\nEdit: As other users have mentioned, do not take these as signs that a worker is interested in you. They *literally* get paid to seem interested in the concerns of every customer/client. Furthermore, any of these one signs alone is NOT confirmation someone likes you. Everyone flirts differently and some may not even use any of the above. These were simply some traits that came to mind based off my limited experience. I have never been an expert at reading signals (I was always shy), but I think the most important aspect of flirting is demonstrating that you take a *keen* interest in the other person and want as much one-on-one time to get to know them better as a person. Some people will rush the sexual aspect of dating, at which point their flirtations become more physical and obvious. But for most dating adults, signals are more subtle and revealed through conversation.",
            "Does someone spend a lot of time around you?\n\nI'm terrible at flirting but that's my method.  Hang out.  Be with this person.  See if you vibe.",

            "Generally there's no one thing that gives it away. Everyone says to look for eye contact, look at posture, look for mimicry, etc, and sure there's some truth to that but no one should be expected to keep track of all of those things and not everyone exhibits any particular one.\n\nIn my experience, almost everyone can get a sense that someone is into them, but most people second guess themselves until they convince themselves it's nothing. I say trust that sense. It's based off all of these factors that we pick up consciously and subconsciously, and almost always it's not a coincidence. \n\nWhen you think someone likes you, you can test that theory in a few ways. A subtle but effective example is inviting them to something you know they can't or don't want to attend. If they express interest in rescheduling or finding some other way to spend time with you, they like you. Otherwise they'll just say no, sorry I can't make it. This works because you're showing interest in spending additional time with them (this event would be more enjoyable for me if you where there) and if they like you they will be sure to make it clear that they are saying no to the event, not to you.\n\nOf course, you could also just ask. In my experience anyone worth getting intimate with is mature enough to deal with that question.",

Eventually, if you cross your arms and the person who's attention you are seeking does the same, for example, you can rely on that being a good sign.\n\nThat's not to say you need to reposition or fidget while interacting; remember, being comfortable and at ease is a way bigger turn-on and ultimately lends itself to a more approachable experience for all parties.

Hugging a little too tightly or for too long. \n\n3) Taking a notable interest in conversing with you and not really anyone else in the room or area.\n\n4) Complimenting you over things that are sort of arbitrary (like you\u2019re brave for doing something not even scary or difficult); they\u2019re taking any chance they can to make you feel good.\n\n5) This is obvious but asking you to hang out in public outside of where you normally meet (I.e. school, work). If they\u2019re asking you to get coffee or try a food place with them it could be a sign they\u2019re trying to spend alone time with you and push more into your life.\n\n6) Hanging around to leave at the same time as you do- they may just pretend to look at their phone or take a really long time packing their bag, but happen to start leaving when you do (consistently) so that they can converse with you on the way out.\n\nAll of these could be signs of friendship for some people, so it\u2019s definitely not fool proof.

From what I heard he was very excited to tell the police what he had done. And from what I do know about him, he might have said it for the attention.) He turned himself in, waived his Miranda rights, and confessed to everything. When the cops found him he was literally soaked in blood.

They had CCTV footage of him tailing her through a park and footage of him buying beer in a shop, still unconfirmed to this day being our shop as they blurred out the surroundings. \n\nAnyway, as we had a TV in our shop switched to the news channel as it was a rolling story local to us, we started to discuss the guy, if we saw him on the day she went missing, that kind of thing. We hadn\u2019t, but it was at that point when one of my staff, a young girl, who had previously said to management that she didn\u2019t want to work the closing shift anymore because there was \u201ctoo many creepy men around\u201d, told us that he used to stare at her when he came in to the store in a way that made her uncomfortable enough to not want to be on the floor when he came in. \n\nThey never got to question him about the murder as he was found dead in a local park a few days later. He\u2019d hung himself.",
            "I went through primary and high school with a guy in the year below me who seemed a little... distant. We lived near each other and caught the bus from the same stop. He was a bit of a bully but it was something more. Like you could tell he wasn\u2019t a bully because he was hurting inside or because he felt threatened in some way, he was a bully because he did what he wanted to do and didn\u2019t realise that it hurt other people. Like the kind of kid who enjoyed pulling wings off flies. \n\nNot long after I left my hometown I heard that he had been charged with the murder of a 2 year old. Apparently his girlfriend at the time left her daughter with him for an hour or so while she ran an errand. He couldn\u2019t deal with the toddler crying anymore so he beat her. He caused severe internal bleeding and she died in hospital not long after. He would have been around 22 when he did it. He was sentenced to 36 years with a non parole period of 27 years.\n\nEdit: this happened in Australia around 2014",

Let's call him Steve.\n\nI knew him through scouts. Now, to preface, our scout troop was pretty laid back. We didn't tend to bother with badges and the two troop leaders were pretty cool guys. Mostly we played silly games like crab football, built catapults to fire stuff across the hall at each other etc. You get the picture.\n\nWe were a little bit a gang of misfits. But Steve was really weird. First time it came out was when he would do this thing where he'd get his butt out and dance around. At first it was like outrageous and funny, and he kept getting told to stop. When he kept doing it got a bit annoying (none of us were keen to see his bare arse...), then it got boring, then just outright weird when its not remotely funny, no one wanted him to do it and he continued.\n\nHe also used to bring in print outs of super gross porn (obviously confiscated and thrown away). Again, he was clearly trying to gross people out for his amusement. \n\nA few times he was suspended for a week or so but give we were quite laid back and the troop leaders were good guys, they probably couldn't bring themselves to bin him off completely. \n\nIt was a long time ago so I can't recall all the details but I recall him being quite childish in mentality but also veeeery creepy. \n\nWhen I found out i was shocked, but not surprised.

They had mentioned to me before he got there that he was always controlling and had hit the girl before. \n\nTurns out controlling was an understatement. She came home one day and he was digging a hole in the backyard and she asked what he was doing and he replied \u201cdigging your grave.\u201d He hit her, said if he can\u2019t have her,  nobody could have her, all of that. So eventually she left him and had to get a restraining order and everything. He somehow persuaded her to get in a car with him on her work break and they went missing for a few days. Turns out he stabbed her to death, threw her in a river and killed himself. \n\nI met the girl only a few times and him only the once but the face that I was in such close proximity to someone capable of that gives me chills.

She was my neighbor (couple houses down) and everyone loved her, she grew gigantic pumpkins, was always outside, so everyone interacted with her a lot. I moved away and a few years later and was shocked to hear everything from my family and friends who still loved in the area. \n\nThe story: \nShe was married to a man, I knew him from my time living there too. One day, he was just gone. She was all beaten up. She said he beat her up (we always suspected this happened before this incident) and had left her because he got a woman pregnant a few towns over. We never heard from him again, but didn\u2019t really have a reason to. She would mention every once in a while that he was still harassing her and was even beat up on another occasion after his disappearance. He was self-employed and didn\u2019t really have any family, no one suspected anything. Three years later she was dating another man. While dating this man, the police had been investigating her for stealing money from the grocery store she worked at. They went to the boyfriends cabin, where they both were, to arrest her. She came to the door, said ok, let me go put on some clothes. The police waited at the door (I obviously wasn\u2019t here for this part, so this is what I hear). The police then hear two gunshots. They run inside and she had poured gasoline and set the house on fire then shot her dog then herself. It took some time to get the house fire under control. Once they did, and began investigating, they found another body in the basement that didn\u2019t die in the fire, but several days earlier. The body in the basement was her boyfriend. Then, they began investigating further, and found a blue 55 gallon drum in her backyard that contained her husband. So, she killed 2 people and her dog, and all she was suspected of was stealing from the grocery store.\n\nEdited to clarify that the body in the basement was the boyfriend and to correct the timeframe between the husband\u2019s disappearance and her dating the boyfriend.

I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be a surprise but he had a terrible/tough life according to my buddy and that was well known by the people in his neighborhood/town.",
            "It probably doesn\u2019t actually count but I want to tell someone about this anyway.\n\nWe (partner and I) had some neighbors move in across the street, a young couple in their 30s. The guy would come over almost every day to chat with my partner. My partner told me he would say things about being raped by his brother as a kid and that people didn\u2019t care about him. His wife was weird. She just sat on the porch not talking to anyone or doing anything. Just... sitting there. All I knew about her was she didn\u2019t have custody of her kids.\n\nA few months ago, our street was filled with cop cars and ambulances. Being the nosy cunts we are we just watched out the window for hours as cops busted down the door, fucked with the couple\u2019s lawnmower, and eventually we watched as two body bags were loaded up into a vehicle right in front of our house.\n\nTurned out they\u2019d killed themselves, or I guess one killed both of them with consent. They turned the lawnmower on in their house and died from the fumes. Their dog died, too. \n\nMy partner and I felt so bad for them because the landlord dumped their stuff into the street *the day after* and only one person came by grieving. We also felt angry at them for killing their dog. I tried finding the obituaries but couldn\u2019t.\n\nMonths after this happened, I was on Reddit and saw a video (unrelated) of a man beating the shit out of a registered sex offender who was talking to his daughter. I went to family watchdog just to see, and guess whose mugshot came up? It was her. The wife. And she had a different last name than I thought she did, so I googled her name to see if she got an obituary. She did. There was also a news article about how she and her ex-husband raped all three of their own kids and only spent four years in jail. The man who did it with her is still out there somewhere. I knew she was weird but... damn. \n\nWe didn\u2019t feel AS bad for them anymore. So yeah, that was an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add details\nEdit2: Someone twisted something I said so I want to add: Of course I still feel bad that the guy went through what he did but he knowingly married a child rapist and killed his own dog... Edit 3: I can\u2019t believe how much this post blew up!\n\nEdit 4: [This](https://ibb.co/album/y0SLpW) is the only proof I have. I didn\u2019t know how they died at first so I posted on my city\u2019s subreddit asking if anyone knew. It was a long shot but someone actually did message me, saying their dad owned a business nearby and heard. I also included a screen of me messaging my friend about it with a timestamp.",
            "I knew someone when i was in my early twenties in India. He was a dirtbag, but a fun guy under the right circumstances. I made sure to talk with him and be as pleasant as i could, while keeping him at an arm's distance. I moved away and then my mum tells me several years later that he and his four brothers were hired killers.\n\nApparently- two people got into a fight over a property and one of them hired these bunch of thugs. They waited for their victim to get home, get changed and relax, when they exploded an oil can in front of his house. When he came running out to see what was going on, they threw red chilli powder in his face to blind him and chopped him to bits with large sickles. Apparently, the body was in multiple pieces at the funeral. I knew the victim as well. Guy had two daughters. Fucking crazy.",
            "OH man. I am WAY late on this, but I could have answered this question very well.  It was my brother. He died when I was 13. He was 18 at the time.  I knew he was capable from the time I was 6 and he was 11.  He used to play death games. He would sit on my chest, use his knees to hold down my arms, suffocate me until I passed out, and then wake me up and do it again.  There were days where he did this for an hour or more.  That's on top of the other kinds of abuse: any you can think of it happened.  I was regularly raped, beaten, and suffocated for a year. One time, he made stand in front of him while he punched me in the balls repeatedly. He wanted to \"make me a man\" and he wouldn't stop until I didn't flinch from the pain. I couldn't tell any of this because I was more afraid of him than confident my parents could or would do anything. He was my primary babysitter. \n\nAfter that year, he moved out. My mom worked nights and my stepdad was a truck driver.  One night, my brother decided that he would feed me garbage. He cracked an egg onto a plate, put coffee grounds and other crap from the garbage can onto it. When I refused to eat it, he put salt and pepper and said it was now more appetizing.  The resulting mess was still there when my mom came home and she wasn't happy. She told us both that if we couldn't keep the house clean, we weren't allowed to eat her food. He balked at this, and moved in with other family. I was finally free for a short time, though I didn't eat anything but school lunch for 2 days until my uncle found out and put a stop to it.\n\nAnyway, from 12 to 18 my brother got in a lot of trouble. He was arrested multiple times for assault.  He was in and out of alternative programs like Outward bound and Boot camp. Finally at 17 he was sentenced to 2 years in juvenile detention. He spent a year in and came out to live with a preacher in another nearby town.   Eventually they convinced the parole board he was rehabilitated and over the objections of our local police let him off all probation and parole.  That preacher introduced him to friends of his who my brother eventually moved in with.  He also met a girl.\n\nThey met right before summer started, and he was in love. To her, it was a summer fling.  When she broke up with him, partly due to his controlling/abusive behavior, he lost it. He came back home one weekend to meet up with some friends. He also came to see us. Later my mom would say she knew something was up with him, but that is all hindsight.  Sunday night, he went back home.\n\nMonday night, he killed his 3 roommates execution style with a gun he got from a friend that had perpetrated a burglary of our local hardware store. He also stole one of the victim's cars. He then drove 8 hours to where his ex was in college. He arrived pretty early Tuesday morning and somehow got into her dorm room.\n\nTuesday morning, he found his ex and shot her in the foot, threatened to kill her, and then locked him, her, and a few of her dorm mates in a room.  A 6 hour hostage standoff with police ensued.   \n\nEventually, he stuck his head out the window one too many times and a police sniper shot him right in the neck.   He tried shooting at the cops as they stormed in, but he was dying.  He died later in the hospital and my family became national news for a short time.  \n\nWhen did I know? I knew the the moment I was 6 and the bad times began. I thought I'd be his first victim.  The day he died, was the first day of my real life.  A day without terror.",
            "Had a friend who, for some reason unknown, stopped taking his medication, I think it was for bipolar schizophrenia? Anyways, he ended up stabbing his mom and little sister to death and drinking their blood. Later, after he had been arrested, they found him eating and drinking his own feces and fluids babbling about how their menstrual blood sustained him. He got back on medication, and the state said he was mentally fit for trial and they convicted him. I don't even remember for how long, I thought the entire situation was wrong. \n\nIt's kind of crazy how one month you know someone and they're just normal, laughing, and living their life and the next they're doing something terrible.\n\nEdit: looked him up to find the details. He was sentenced to 80 years in prison. He used a carving knife and a fork in the murder, and his sister was only 6 years old.",
            "Not mine, but my wife's story.  She attended Columbine HS at the time of the shooting. She said she never could have expected the shooters to do what they did.

            "A kid in high school killed his grandmother one day before school. I didn't really interact him much, we weren't in the same grade so didn't have many classes together or any mutual friends, but I did remember seeing him quite a few times as I was working in the library during my lunch periods that year. Just a quiet, didn't talk much. He would sometimes just be sitting there and then get frustrated at himself or whatever he was doing and kinda flip out a little. Like a little bigger than \"this math problem is really pissing me off\" and a little less than full on flipping out. But it would seemingly be about nothing. He wouldn't have any pencils or paper so I don't think he was doing homework when he would do this. Sometimes he would have a book in front of him. But also again, didn't really pay too much attention to him.\n\nBut yeah. One morning he killed his grandma with a lamp before school. I forgot the reasoning. I think it was something like she caught him sleeping in and he went crazy on her. It was extremely sad. And I went to a really good school that you had to test to get into, so he had to be like kinda book smart at the least. That was devastating though\n\n\nEdit: Yeah I was right. She caught him skipping school and he killed her. The details are a lot more worse than I remembered though :(",
            "I am the survivor of an attempted family annihilation. I didn\u2019t like my stepfather from the moment my mother introduced him. Every time I was around him, I was afraid. Just constant dread. My stomach and chest would tighten and I\u2019d feel like I couldn\u2019t breathe. He had these blue eyes that looked like something you\u2019d see in a taxidermy animal. No life in them. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my mother because I wanted her to be happy, and I was afraid she\u2019d think I was being dramatic and dismiss it if I tried. He started beating us both shortly after moving in. They got married in May of 1996 and he murdered my mother and tried to kill me in January of \u201898. He\u2019s still in prison. He last came up for parole in 2012 and the board was evenly split as to whether to release him or not. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll release him next time he comes up in 2022.",

I stopped playing because he kept trying to rape all the female NPCs/player characters. When we got back from deployment the FBI and NCIS were pier side waiting for him. Him and some other guys had raped and killed a woman who's husband was on deployment. Also had some friends who tied up an old man who they suspected of molesting one's younger brother when we were teenagers. They tortured him for hours, then killed him and tried to burn the body.

He was always a bit controlling and a lot out of control, but as soon as he started doing serious drugs around 17 was when he became a serious concern. He ran away from home and disappeared only for his mom to get a call that he has killed someone.

            "He was the son of my Dad\u2019s coworker/friend.  Before my father got laid off this year, they had worked together for 32 years.  So, we did occasionally see each other while growing up.  \n\nThe son was my age, went to the same middle school and high school as me.  I know that he had some kind of mental disorder involving impulse control.  \n\nFor example, on his way to our middle school one day, he saw a baseball bat lying on a front lawn and decided to use it to smash in the windshield of the car in front of that house.  \n\nHe was also obsessed with death, and would talk about wanting to see someone die.  Obviously, I was not a big fan of him, and did not seek out a friendship. \n\nA friend of mine- still my best friend today- felt bad for him and would talk to him before classes and such.  One day, she was pulled into the principal\u2019s office and told that they found a list he had made of people to not kill in his imagined school shooting.  She was on it.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure what happened with him after that, but I didn\u2019t see him again until high school.  After graduation, I got a part time job at a corporate office downtown where I was tasked with making lunch runs.  \n\nThe local restaurants where I would pick up food had a missing person flyer for a boy my age.  He was mentally handicapped, and his family was worried that he had wandered off into the desert- according to the diner staff that I talked to.   \n\nA few weeks later, I see my old classmate\u2019s mugshot on the local news.  He had killed the missing boy.  Apparently, he and his small group of friends had befriended this kid and driven him out into the desert one night.  My old classmate shot him with a crossbow and then slit his throat.",
            "It was a gradual progression of crazier behavior. \nMy ex seemed normal at first, but a little narcissistic about how great he was, and how confident he knew people, and what was going to happen. He told me I would always be his. I laughed and said \"haha, what if we break up, I marry someone else and have kids?\" He said it didn't matter, that I, and that kid would be his. I thought maybe he thought it was romantic, but it creeped me out. \n\nA month or two later we broke up, I moved far away and got married. I knew his sister and she told me how he kept saying I will be his no matter what. Something in that moment made me believe he would find me and kill my SO. Like, you never want to believe someone would kill, but my instincts told me to be afraid. Luckily it seemed his interest in me died down over time.\n\nI realized I was a transgender male, got help, and hormone therapy to transition. Once he heard through the grapevine, he seemed officially put off all together, which gave me a huge feeling of relief, really. \n\nIn 2018 (about 2 years after coming out as trans) I got a phone call from an old mutual friend. They asked if I heard about what he did on the news. Of course I didn't, but I had a bad feeling. He apparently worked at the airport and kept trying to ask a woman out who had a a fianc\u00e9 and child. She refused him many times. Then he waited outside her home for her fianc\u00e9 to show up. Once the fianc\u00e9 drove up, he ran up to the driver side window and shot him. The fianc\u00e9 didn't survive. My ex didn't make it far before he was caught by the police and thrown in prison, likely to be tried for life since he laid in wait. \n\nThat poor woman lost her love and father to her child because of his sick, twisted version of his own reality. What the FUCK did he think was going to happen?! She was going fall in his arms once her husband-to-be was murdered?! \n\nI'm going to post the news link and his name in the responses if you'd like to read more.",

He just stared at the ground and nodded as he walked out. The next day after he made the news, the FBI shut the place down and combed through the dumpsters for evidence. Weird and crazy stuff.

He wasn't one of those humanist LaVeyan satanists that don't actually believe in god or the devil. He believed the bible was real, he just chose to worship Satan. He was  also a violent drunk who hated women, but that never seemed to stop women from dating him. I always thought it was strange that whenever he got a new girlfriend, a lot of his ex's would come out of the woodwork trying to warn the new girl that she should stay away from him. This happened all the time, but they would always get brushed off and accused of being jealous. When he got to his last girlfriend it was business as usual. One day she had enough and called the police to report him getting drunk and slamming her against the wall. While she was on the phone he went to get his gun. I heard the 911 call.

After serving several years, though not his full sentence, he was released this summer.  Apparently years of prison did nothing because he was arrested about a month ago for possession and identity theft.  He apparently gave the police my name and address when they stopped him. It is actually disturbing because I have moved since he was locked up and have had no contact with him.  The fact that he was able to rattle off my new address does not sit well with me.  We caught him casing our old house when he knew I was at work.   Anyway, the police were obviously easily able to determine who he really was.

He pretended it was an accident every time, but I knew he was trying to cover up the fact that he had wet himself.\n\nOn the playground, he would go up on the hill behind the school and lay out in the sun with his legs spread, hoping it would dry before recess was over.\n\nI felt bad for him\u2014I had enuresis at night until I was 14, so I kind of understood. Obviously, his social life was more affected by his incontinence. He ended up becoming something of a bully\u2014he would get really mad on the playground or in gym class if someone beat him fairly, and he would swear at them and try to pick fights with them.\n\nThen he moved away, and ten years later I read in a newspaper that he had killed his girlfriend while she was asleep\u2014she had a daughter who was only 1-2 years old. \n\nA few years later I read an article about the link between enuresis and homicide\u2014apparently, some studies had been done that showed enuresis was one of three major warning signs that someone might commit homicide later in life, as it may be indicative of stunted development of the amygdala, a part of the brain that partially controls bladder function, but also enhances emotional learning, conditions fear-responsiveness, and amplifies external stimuli.\n\nEdit: I just looked him up to see if he was still in prison, and apparently he has committed suicide.

            "Girl I used to work with 10 some years ago was killed by her ex-boyfriend. He tied her up to make it look like a suicide but according to her parents the autopsy said she was dead before she was hung. Dead people don\u2019t hang themselves up. She also was not suicidal as far as anyone could tell. Happy girl with dreams to finish her degree, had just bought herself a new car & house, and was starting to date again. Police just filed it away like nothing happened though. Gotta love small towns. \n\nAnyway, he was always off. He was your typical narcissistic, controlling, abusive SO. She constantly had bruises and scratches from his explosive violence. He sent her death threats at work, harassed her coworkers, threatened violence to her family & friends, all that. A week before she was found he had broken into her house and almost strangled her to death. No surprise he would kill her with the violent temper he had. \n\nHe began dating another one of my coworkers some years later. We who knew his first girlfriend warned her constantly of what he was like and what we suspect he did. She told us the ole sob story of \u201che\u2019s changed.\u201d Apparently he was a great boyfriend until he chased her and their 2 kids into the bathroom with a knife, barricaded them in and set the trailer on fire. They\u2019re fucking lucky to be alive. The neighbors had called the police after hearing some yelling and threats so they were able to get out but I think the whole trailer burned down. They stayed together and had another kid but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not with him anymore.",
            "One of my friends was a convicted gang member had petty charges for weed and other things. Mind you he is now 20. About two months ago I flipped on the tv and he had stabbed his step father 40 times and he\u2019s still alive he\u2019s looking at a life sentence for attempted murder as of last week. This guy was a bad ass mechanic in high school and always there to help",
            "One I can actually answer. \nThis guy I went to school with was always a dick. He didn\u2019t like to take no for an answer on ANYTHING. It almost got me in trouble one time but luckily his mom showed up. Anyway, after that I knew it was only a matter of time before he killed someone. A few years ago, 2018, he killed this girl and dumped her body in the woods. We are from a small town so it didn\u2019t take long for him to get caught. Apparently him & this girl were having sex and he put a zip tie around her neck and she died so he put her in the trunk of his car and beat her with a hammer in the head and then dumped her body. Everyone from the town was like \u201cI can\u2019t believe he would do that.\u201d I was like y\u2019all are stupid. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t do this earlier. His excuse is the girl put the zip tie around her own neck and he freaked out bc he was on drugs.",
            "A man from my church ended up killing 3 or 4 prostitutes. My dad knew him pretty well because they had similar jobs in our church and he was always very nice and normal seeming. Then his wife left him and he spiraled (I\u2019m guessing there were some major issues or she probably wouldn\u2019t have left). He started doing drugs and binge drinking. Then he was arrested and confessed to picking up prostitutes and killing them. So crazy!\n\n   Another guy in my neighborhood growing up kidnapped his soon to be ex wife from her college campus and held her hostage in a hotel room for 3 days while beating and raping her. His nephew helped him. He intended to kill her but the nephew finally let her go. The husband wrote her a letter from jail a year or two later explaining how he would finish the job when he got out. He got some time added for that. She had to have tons of reconstructive surgery because her face was just destroyed from the beatings. I wouldn\u2019t say I knew he would try to kill but I always got a really creepy feeling around him and made sure I was never alone with him.",
            "Normal family. Dad, mum and three children. They lived in front of the house where we moved to when I was around 11. Everything was normal. We weren't the closest neighbors, just an always greet them with a smile kind of relationship.\n\nWhen I was around 16 he killed his wife with a knife, in his house, in front of his children. They were kids, I think their brains made up a story about a monster when they were in court.\n\nThey still love his dad, visited him in jail, and moved back with him after he was released years after.",
            "My dad is from a small village in India. And apparently there was a disagreement among 2 families over farming. 2 brothers from one family tried to attack the other family with swords. And the other family shot them down. All this happened in the middle of the village and my dad was 7 and he saw all of it. Apparently the 2 brothers are somehow related to me.\n\nAlso, apparently the 2 brothers challenged other family to a \"manly duel\" with swords, and they quite literally brought guns to a sword fight.\n\nBoth families were quite prideful so my dad said he know something like that would've happened.",
            "After he did it, I was able to look back on multiple odd things and sort of add it up. We were teenagers and I thought of him as a good friend. I originally brushed off the weirdness: his collection of dead animals in jars of formaldehyde, his collection of 8 x 10 glossy head shot photos of the girls he said he had slept with neatly pinned in a row next to his bed, his narcissism, impulsiveness, and manipulative behaviors.  \n\nOne night he tried everything he could think of to get me to drive off alone with him when we were at a party. Some other dumb teen aged guy I liked was there, and I wouldn't leave. Pretty sure that's why I'm still alive. He just wanted my car, and didn't think my life was of any consequence. \n\nHe murdered his grandparents a few weeks after that and took their car. He got into Mexico before having any contact with anyone. He called his dad and then turned himself in. He did 25 or so years in prison and now he's out there presumably having a life of some kind. He used to want to be a nurse. I feel like that could have gone horribly awry too. \n\nAnyway, I do hope he got some help for his mental health if that's possible. I never want to see him again. It hits me sometimes that he was most likely going to strangle me with his bare hands and leave me in the woods, just so he could drive off and be \"free\" of his grandparents he was living with for a couple of short years that would have passed so much faster than 25 in prison.",

            "Not a super interesting story but my brother hung out with one my my moms friends sons. A few months later he ended up killing his mother and her body was there for about 3 months before it was discovered. The boy ran away and made it to a different province (we\u2019re in Canada). He was eventually caught and we still don\u2019t know why he did it. His mother seemed like a very caring and sweet person but we don\u2019t know what goes on behind closed doors I guess. My brother only hung out with him once and he said he was very weird. My brother said he gave off just weird vibes and he was very awkward and quiet.",
            "A friend of my mother stabbed his boyfriend to death who was her even closer friend. He called her after the murder to ask if he could take a shower at our house. Realized something was off in that moment lol. Before that I actually liked him. My mom told me later, though, that he would make inappropriate comments about my brother and I when we were in high school- which is why she never invited him to the house. So that's probably when she noticed he was a little off.",
            "Never.\n\nBack in 2011, I was working as a front desk clerk for a motel while I was finishing up my senior year of college. I normally worked the morning (7AM to 3PM) and afternoon (3PM to 11PM) shifts, while we constantly struggled to keep the night auditor shift (11PM to 7AM) filled. (It takes a special breed of person for that role.)\n\nLong story short, we ended up hiring [Shayne Riggleman](https://www.thedaonline.com/local-man-kills-five-shoots-himself/article_96f10343-5e19-504c-ab09-b21c942e2123.html) as the night auditor. The guy always seemed a little socially awkward, but he was completely courteous and non-offensive to me.\n\nThe morning of his killing spree, I relieved him from his night shift. Everything was business as usual, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then, I got a call from our manager to turn on the local news...\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to not think about the possibility of being included in his rampage. Apparently, he\u2019d been planning it for weeks. I\u2019m forever grateful that I treated him with respect and gave him conversation when I\u2019d see him, even though it was only for 3-5 minutes between the shift change.\n\nMy heart goes out to the families of the victims.",
            "In 7th grade I was a shy, fat, lonely kid in a new town. Friends were few, and most of my out of school time was speant alone with my NES.\n\nA few weeks into the school year I was approached by another kid in my class. He was shaggy haired, messy, and carried an air of outgoing wildness that was strange to an introverted only child like myself. He liked video games too, and basically invited himself into my life. We became friends quickly. He didnt really give me a choice.\n\nA few weeks later we were given a school project, to create a paper mache mountain range. He invited me to his house to work on it, the first time I had been there.\n\nI remember being uncomfortable immediately. The town house his family lived in was located in a rough, dirty area, and though it was less than a 10 minute walk from my apartment home, it felt like a different world.\n\nHis home was dirty, cluttered, full of unwashed dishes and garbage. The mess was offputting, but the lack of embarrassment, or apology for it was, I believe, what was most strange to my 12 year old, sheltered, self.\n\nWe couldnt have been working long when my friends step father made himself known. I dont remember why he was angry, but he was. Small, angry, drunk and mean.\n\nLittle is clear to me from that day, these 29 years later, but I will never forget how, in front of a 12 year old stranger, the small drunk, angry man took a butcher knife and stabbed the paper mache mountain we were, at that point, painting. I dont remember staying long, after that.\n\nBut, that was when I knew something was off with my friends step-father.\n\nYears went on, and my friend travelled in and out of my life as he moved between living with his two parents. Whenever we did see each other he was unfailingly underfed, unwashed, and yet always happy, outgoing, and good natured.\n\nEventually, my parents, who were kind people, and observant enough to know the type of life my friend had been stuck with, invited him to stay with us. He was living with his mother that week/ month/ year, who had recently moved into the same apartment building as us, so it wasnt a complicated transition.\n\nHe hadnt been with us long before I witnessd the second incident with his step-father, which haunts me.\n\nIt was a school day morning, and my parents had left for work. I was getting ready, when\u00a0 I heard a commotion. I left my room to see my friend, on the ground inside the open front door, with his step-father on top of him. My friend guarded himself as best he could from the beating being rained down on him, while his step father slurred accusations of theft.\n\nIn my fantasies I go and grab a knife and stab the small, mean son of a bitch in the neck.\n\nIn reality, I creaked out as strong a \"Get the fuck out of my house!\" as a 14 year old could hope to. He left, eventually.\n\nMy friend moved again soon after that. He never finished high school.\n\nWe fell into different circles, lived seperate, very different lives, but remained friendly, if not close friends. \n\nI eventually got married, had kids of my own, and lived a good life. So did he. \n\nI got to keep living a good life.\n\nHe, his wife, and his youngest son were killed by his step-father while hosting a birthday party for his oldest son. \n\nHe died of stab wound suffered while trying to protect his family from a mentally unstable monster who had made his life hell for years.\n\nMy friend was a good person. He was raised by incompetent, broken people, and paid the price of other peoples ingnorance.\n\nHe never made it to his 30th birthday.\n\nhttps://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/3519122-woman-s-panicked-911-call-heard-at-oshawa-inquest/",
            "As a kid (13 at the time), I had a friend, who's older brother (about 19 then) was known and respected for his \"gangster\" lifestyle.  He was nice to everyone, except my older brother, whom he had fought with a lot growing up.  My brother knew something was evil about the guy and didn't trust him.  Even though it ruined my brothers social life, he knew that there was way more at stake than just \"losing his social life\" if he kept hanging around this guy.\n\nNearly 20 years later, I'm at a friend's house, buying some weed.  There's a big roided out guy there, rambling on and on about having to \"silence some witnesses\".  He described how him and a friend hid in a person's bedroom closet, and waited until they were sleeping to terrorize and threaten their life if they testified.  He stated his name, \"I'M JOE SMITH! (I've changed the name) I'm untouchable!  Who do these witnesses think they're dealing with?!?  My heart skipped a beat...it was the same guy!  I texted a friend in the room with me, warning him to not call me by last name, as it might set this guy off.  It was nerve-racking to say the least.  A narcissistic psychopath.  Being in his presence set off fight or flight responses big time.  Options of escape quickly filled my head, and within seconds, I was ready to jump out a second story window onto concrete to get away from this guy, if need be.\n\nFast forward a couple years, and the guy is found guilty of murder.  Apparently, he stuffed his victim into a barrel and left it in a creek.",
            "I work with murderers for a living. The thing that's really bizarre is how normal most of them are. A lot of them committed their crime a long time ago (sometimes before I was born), so they're completely different people now. Or they were on drugs at the time, and once they sobered up, they completely went back to \"normal.\" Generally speaking, I like spending time with the first-degree murderers much more than some other types of felons. The worst are the domestic violence/first degree rapists.",
            "I (Female, 25 at the time, more than 20 years ago) never had the faintest suspicion that the young man I gave a back massage to, was later to drug, rape and kill a girl a few years later.\n\nHe was eager to meet people, a little shy but that's it.",
            "It's interesting to think about actually. He was in a relationship with a friend who was vulnerable... And he was very controlling and would make these impulse decisions that were irrational and weird. But he seemed like your typical insecure dude who found someone even more insecure to have control over. I'm glad we gently advised her to end the relationship, which she did. \n\nNot long after the news was reporting the \"body in the barrel\" murder... Then they found his body within a few days. He'd murdered his old boss then killed himself a few days later. \n\nI guess the hindsight lesson was his need to control... He had zero tolerance for not getting his own way. He was literally a 20 something year old that would throw a tantrum if he didn't get what he wanted... And he never, ever compromised at all.",
            "One of friends in highschool tried to convince my crew of friends to join him in \"rolling queers\" in Daytona Beach. His plan was to pose as a male prostitute and lure the John to an alley way and rob them.  Crime wasn't really my thing and turns out most of my friends didn't like the idea.   About a week later I was home and my parents were watching the news and his face came up on the screen.  17 year old charged with murder kinda thing and both my parents turn at me while I stood in kitchen and asked \"wasn't he just over at the house\".  I honestly thought he was just talking out of his ass but he was dead serious.  I joined the Navy shortly after that and never returned to Central Florida.",

They broke the news to him that someone had killed his wife. She was hundreds of miles away in Liverpool. We were all sorry for him and shocked, until it turned out he hadn\u2019t gone to bed tired that night, he\u2019d driven all the way from portsmouth to Liverpool and murdered his wife and driven back the same night. He got caught because his car was caught speeding by a speed camera. Always found the guy very weird anyway",

I only went because our mutual friend also came. Turned out I was seeing Toy Story 3 while sitting next to a person who had murdered 3 old people in that month. He paid for the movietickets and snacks with the money he had stolen from his victims.",
            "I honestly didn\u2019t find him very creepy - he was a member of my night shift crew when I used to be a fast food manager, and while I never knew him well, he seemed like a quiet guy who laughed at the same inappropriate things everyone else on the closing/overnight shift did and smoked weed with everyone after work.\n\nMy \u201ccousin\u201d (aka my mom\u2019s old best friends kids that were always called my aunt/cousins while I was growing up - twin girls and a brother) ended up dating him, got pregnant, they got married.

            "There was this guy who stabbed a young brunette woman 37 times and then raped her post-Mortem. It turned to a cold case for 9 yrs, they finally caught the guy a couple years ago. Crazy thing was, I (a young brunette woman) worked next door to the bar where this guy drank every night. I also was a raging alcoholic and got blacked out drunk and walked home from there on and off nights regularly. Almost every night. (Almost 2yrs sober now, thank god). \nHowever, I knew something was off about this guy the minute I laid eyes on him. I read people like a mf, and I just knew he wasn\u2019t someone to know. I talked to everyone who frequented that bar but I never had a single conversation with him, and if I was out on a smoke break while he was outside I just never felt like I could turn my back on him. When they arrested him due to one of his relatives adding their dna to a genetic testing site, I straight up got chills down my spine for the first time in my life.

He would invite us all over to his awesome game room to play Warhammer, and would use his massive allowance to buy us Warhammer boxes, just so he could have more people to play with. He ended up getting his own house right after high school, and we all hung out there for movie and videogame nights, and gladly shared spare bedrooms he let us crash in when we needed a place to get away for a while.\n\nHe's now serving 300+ years for four counts of rape and a murder. Apparently he killed a girl during a bout of extreme breath play, and when she passed out, he...ahem, *prioritized* his own needs before her need to get an ambulance.\n\nWe had absolutely no idea he was capable of doing such a thing. Really shook me up, just knowing I hung out with him so much and he bought me so much great stuff that defined my high school years.\n\nI still have the Warhammer figures in a closet. I'm tempted to throw them out sometimes, just to fully remove him from my life. But at the same time, I remember these figures brought a ton of great memories with my other friends, who have killed less people than he did *combined*, and when I look at them, those great memories are the ones that come to mind. I see the endless summer afternoons of us all painting figures and tearing up the tabletop together, I don't see the guy who bought me the box they came in.",

He made me prioritize him and it was a seamless transition. I was seeing my family less. Talking to my friends was monitored. And he\u2019d started getting weird in the bedroom. Forceful. Wanting me after I was crying, inconsolable from arguments. Holding a pillow over my face. \n\nAnd he was constantly talking about owning a business for gun design with his brother.

It was reported as a suicide and I didn't know about it untill after my grandma died. To be honest, she is not a hero in this story, though. Grandma was very mentally ill and abusive my mom's whole life. Sounds like she did it more out of jealousy than anything else. My mom was about 14 at the time, grandma had her clean up the blood. Obviously this fucked my mom up really bad. I am so grateful that mental illness isn't as stigmatized now and is more readily available than when my mom was a kid. My mom is not very functional bipolar and it is HARD, I can't imagine what it must have been like growing up with that unmedicated and untreated. Though I don't think my grandma is the good guy, as I said, I do feel sorry for her because we know she had severe mental illness and all anyone did was lock her up in an asylum occasionally.",

The female is out of prison and married now, leading a normal life. I don't know about the guy. \n\nThe other one I'd known since middle school, and that situation really fucked me up. He was schizophrenic, and had issues with going off his meds and using meth. He wound up going on a bender with his on-again, off-again girlfriend after they started slamming it (injecting it), freaking out, and stabbing her to death. Once he realized what he'd done, he tried to overdose, but came out of his coma a week later. He wound up making a successful attempt a couple years later while in prison. \n\nI grew up in kind of a small town, where everyone knows everyone, and occurrences like these were shockingly common. I lost a lot of friends to things like overdoses, drunk driving accidents, and suicide. One of my ex boyfriends was murdered by his neighbor. In the span of 15 years, I lost close to 50 people I knew.\n\nETA: with the first instance, I never thought of either of them as being \"off\", but drugs have a way of changing people. As for my other friend, his mental illness and struggles were well-known to me, but I never thought he would have done what he did. Meth is a nasty fucking thing.\n\n2nd Edit: my first award!

            "In my case I grew up knowing the family so it all seemed \u201cnormal\u201d but even as a teenager I could see that there was something wrong with my friend\u2019s dad. \n\nA big group of us was going to a school dance and the dad asked for a kiss before we all left and the dad bit his son and he was bleeding for awhile. It was all shocking and upsetting but it was soon forgotten because he had done increasingly terrible things in front of us. So, the abuse was normal. \n\nHis second wife used to babysit me and my brother when we were little and we lived on base. My mom said she helped that woman leave in the middle of the night with her two babies at the time, but left the two older kids with the dad from another marriage. \n\nWhen my mother got out of her abusive relationship, we were beyond poor. She was working two jobs. I remember not eating sometimes at the end of the pay period. That man drew up a contract that my mom would marry him and they wouldn\u2019t have to sleep with each other until she learned to love him. Then went out and got me an my brother the best Christmas I ever remember to try and bribe her. Luckily she was not fooled!\n\nLater when we all grew up my best friend at the time dates the younger brother and the older brother went off into the military and got a dishonorable discharge for steroid use. Me and my stupid teenager self dated the older brother after he got booted from the military and all 4 of us moved down to Florida for a time. \n\nWhat I noticed is how they begin to isolate you. Turn you against others. Turn you against your best friends, your family. When the dad would come visit, everything like EVERYTHING is a big family secret, no matter how mundane. \n\nMy best friend and I had enough of the isolation and abuse so we took my car that I begged my dad to buy me and left. They caught up with us in TN as we tried to get home and followed us the whole way back to St. Louis. Where finally they left when we were back home with our families. \n\nWhile we were gone, the dad remarried and had a baby. What I gathered after the fact is she was planning on leaving and taking the child. He manipulates his two damaged and abused sons to help kill this woman and make it look like a drowning at the lake of the ozarks. \n\nI went to the funeral with my mom and we knew then. The dad didn\u2019t talk to his wife\u2019s family and sat next to us the whole time. When it was my turn to view her, I got this feeling of dread. His two sons had gone back to Florida and were not at the funeral. When we left, my mom and I sat in silence at an Outback Steakhouse. We were sure she was murdered. \n\nEnds up he had his oldest son, the one I dated, help hold her underwater while the other son who dated my best friend watched the baby from the shore or a house nearby. When my old boyfriend went back to Florida, he had confessed to his mother and his girlfriend at the time and turned himself in from the guilt. \n\nAbusive people are manipulative and hold many secrets. You always know what they are, but it happens so slowly over time, that you don\u2019t understand the scope of their malicious intent.",
            "Was friends with this one guy I met in hs, long story short he murdered another friend of mines, when his name came up as a suspect at the time it took me back to when me and him would go on about different murder cases and how he studied the zodiac killer, we used to talk about how we would dispose of a body if we killed someone \n(I grew up on alot of true crime because of my mother so at the time it didnt raise any red flags I just thought he liked true crime like me)",
            "Two lads I went to school with are now in prison for murder. Both came from a really disadvantaged area. One was really violent, always bullying others and fighting people for no reason. He threw a rock at my friend and smashed his skull, he required surgery. Eventually he made the news when he had a row with his buddy after spending the weekend partying and arrived back with a shotgun and killed him. \n\nThe other didn't seem as psycho but still displayed antisocial behaviour in school. Was an exceptional football player and apparently was going to be offered a contract at Celtic while on trial there but he ended up robbing jerseys so the club knew he was trouble and fucked him off. Same as the first guy, he left the school quite early and I heard it was into drugs and crime. He killed a guy with a hatchet and knife and got life in prison a few years back. \n\nBoth of these guys grew up in a toxic environment where antisocial behaviour was seen as \"cool\" by their peers. Gaining a reputation for being the \"maddest\" guy around was seen as a good thing. \n\nTbh I think in their cases it was more of a case of nurture than nature. Bad combination of being a bit tapped but also growing up in a dysfunctional environment.",

            "It was never confirmed he did it but (allegedly) my best friends dad killed his wife. He was a big shot FBI agent. She was an alcoholic stay at home wife. Every single time I was there, which was pretty much every day, they would be in an argument if some sort. The dad has an explosive temper and would get absolutely lose his shit on her. One day at school my friend gets called into the office and then comes back to class just stone faced. He grabs his stuff and leaves immediately. We had plans after school that day so his gf and I drove to his house to pick him up (this is right as cell phones were a thing so not everyone had one) we get there and the house is surrounded by cops, the corner, and a pastor. We walk up and my friend is sitting there in tears, his dad by his side with not one shred of emotion. His dad says \u201cDenise died\u201d perfectly even toned. The story is she was drinking as per usual and she drowned in the pool. He says he came home and found her lying face down already dead. He never showed any emotion at all. I remember being at the funeral (she was cremated almost immediately) and even during the eulogy he gave, he never even choked up. He was stone faced. Cold. Something was very very off. He remarried six months later to a woman much younger, who ironically, looked just like his dead wife. It was really creepy. Also, the quality of life drastically improved. Brand new Mercedes, new house in a gated community. Things just didn\u2019t add up. It was a play pool, no more than 6 feet deep. She was in that thing every single day, all day. It\u2019s what she loved doing. Having a drink in the pool. Come to find out he cashed in on almost a million dollars from her life insurance policy. My dad was best friends with him and stopped talking to him afterward because my dad was convinced he did it as well. He said he\u2019d make some really odd comments if he got a little too drunk. He was never even questioned or considered. I think my best friend suspected his dad had some involvement as well though he never brought it up. He sunk into deep depression and got hooked on heroin. He never recovered, sadly.",

            "My great grandmother was considered a serial killer. She would take insurance policies out on people down on their luck and then kill them to collect. After my grandma (her daughter) was killed when my mom was 2 years old, by getting shot in the head by her brother, she had the burden to take care of my mom and her 3 brothers. One day she set the house on fire with my mom and siblings inside. A local guy saved them from the fire and my great grandma had him killed also. She got out of prison by bribing the warden about his extra marital relations after being released to clean his home regularly. She was born in 1900 and died in 1995 after we dropped her off in Bradenton to visit her sister on our way to Disney world. When we picked her up and dropped her off to Fort Lauderdale and drove back to Miami, she had died in her sleep that night. There\u2019s more to the story that my mom doesn\u2019t really talk about but it made me think back to how she was an old calm lady that would call people MF\u2019s at the drop of a dime and had a heavy .44 magnum under bed.",

He would also talk about really gorey or sexual topics that I didn't understand at 8. \n\nAt 14 he sexually assaulted me on the school bus on the way to cross country practice. He apologized to me later and being a socially awkward teenager with a shitty social life I said fuck it.\n\nAt 17 he cut off all communication except targetted harassment, including cyberbullying an anorexic classmate, public harassing a friend whose parents were divorcing, and blackmailing me to the point where I deleted my Facebook account. He also stopped showering, got arrested for setting fire to a yard, and called for my help bleeding from the head claiming his dad attacked him with a 2x4 (I don't know how the injury happened now but I'm convinced his dad didn't actually attack him, his brother later said his dad did nothing violent, ever). He also got reported by a few other classmates for posting the Virginia Tech Shooter's manifesto on his Facebook page. \n\nI'm surprised it took until he was 23 for him to actually murder someone, stabbed a girl we went to high school with in the town's public library before stabbing a man in his 70s. Last time I checked he was in a psych ward awaiting trial.",
            "He was just a normal guy that used to work with my dad. Never saw anything wrong with him... So I learned a few years ago his son (about 20 years old at the time) tried to stop a fight at a bar, got shot and died. The guy who shot him was injuried and sent to the hospital.

He would talk about how he was a Knights of Templar or some shit and that he was chosen by God. He seemed absolutely crazy but it also felt like it was forced and he was making it up. Apparently when he was arrested he was making some doll thing in his house. It was all really strange and not really all that surprising that he killed this woman. What was scary though is that my mom found him in her house in the middle of the night after breaking up and apparently he had a knife on him. Thankfully my older brother was there and got him out of the house. Police were completely useless. I\u2019m glad he was arrested because I\u2019m pretty sure he would have killed my mom.",

Kind of would allude to being in secret military actions, definitely untrue. Our military leadership said he was so squared away I should be more like him. I being who I was couldnt care less and fucked with him about being such a squared away airman any chance I could. Turns out he was a security guard at Sears. He had a girlfriend and two very young sons. He then married another women apparently she knew nothing of his other life. I guess in his mind needed to get rid of his other life, so he drowned the girlfriend and two children. Came to work at the military base that night with the two dead kids in his duffle bag. He was going to bury them on the base, but was caught by the cops before he could. During my next review I asked my supervisor if I should still be more like he was.

            "My friend and I were in class together with this one girl that definitely at least had undiagnosed conduct disorder and some impulse control issues. She would frequently get in trouble for fighting and stealing whatever she could. However, since this was the inner city, this was fairly common and teachers didn't care and her parents were uninvolved. She also belonged to a gang and when she overheard rumors my friend was gay (in the 00s) she lost her mind, like she *could not wrap her head around the fact that some people are gay,* and just couldn't understand that it wasn't a directed personal attack on her. (This was really weird to me, since I was from a very religious family literally didn't care all that much - I thought something was off at this point. Like she just couldn't understand that someone's personal life/feelings/etc weren't in anyway connected to her.) We assumed she was some kind of sociopath or had a brain injury to where she just couldn't let go of things and was very egocentric.\n\nShe would stalk her around school and even followed her home once or twice, saying that she was going to jump her. Eventually we had a big enough circle of friends that she lost interest and backed off, failed out of school and we never saw her again.\n\nA few months ago (we are in our 30s) we saw that she had been arrested for multiple murders with several other people and is now in prison.",

Well, about a year later, the stepdad killed and dismembered the mom.\n\n\nBeyond that, I never met them, but my great-grandfather and his father (my great-great-grandfather) were both murderers. The great-great-grandfather was the worse of the two. He shot a 16-year-old girl in the face one time, claimed it was a hunting accident even though she was on her front porch, but that wasn\u2019t the murder (I think she lived). He later got into an argument with a man behind a bar and beat him over the head with a pipe. His father (great 3x) was also a piece of work. He was town council president of a very shady town and one newspaper article talks about him escaping his third lynch mob in his career. I don\u2019t remember if it\u2019s related, but he also threw a pregnant woman down some stairs for not paying rent. And he also let his son (mentioned above) out of prison after he shot the 16-year-old. As in he literally had a key to the jail cell and unlocked the door. Going back to the great-grandfather, he was by all other accounts a decent man, but at one point his wife died while they were raising his granddaughter (my aunt) as his own. He remarried quickly because he needed a woman in the house, but she was a drunk and he got tired of her shit so he drove his granddaughter to school and stopped at a park.

            "The murderer I know was a client of mine earlier this year at the mental health/substance abuse treatment center I was working at at the time. He was a 23 year old schizophrenic kid fresh out of jail for I\u2019m not sure what, court ordered to complete a treatment center as part of his release terms. His schizophrenia manifested in paranoia, and he constantly thought both the staff and the other clients were out to get him. For whatever reason however I was able to gain his trust and get through to him, and he saw me as an ally and a friend. It might have been the fact that we were both musicians (he was an aspiring rapper) or any number of things, I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nAnyway, he lived at my facility for about 3 months. At the time I was working anywhere from 50-65 hours a week and spent the majority of my shifts dealing almost exclusively with him. Not because I was specifically assigned to deal with just him or anything, but he just required a massive amount of effort to handle and I was the only one he would listen to most of the time. Truth be told, he needed a higher level of care than my company could provide and he should have been transferred to a facility better equipped to handle mental health issues like his (my treatment center was mostly focused on substance abuse, we had only just begun accepting mental health patients and were admittedly not as equipped as we should have been). Our facility was on a college campus and he would often wander off property and I would have to drive around looking for him to bring him back. A few times the police brought him back. \n\nHe liked to push my buttons and would constantly argue with me about trying to get an extra phone call or trying to get me to take him to the recording studio. Very often when I came in to start my shift he would immediately come to my office and start complaining about how one of my coworkers looked at him funny or he could \u201csense\u201d that the other clients were plotting to hurt him or something. If I\u2019m being honest, none of the clients liked him at all because of his antisocial tendencies (being rude or antagonistic for no reason) and none of the other staff did either. They thought he was way too much of a pain in the ass to deal with and sadly were mean to him fairly frequently. I had a soft spot for him however and dealing with him felt like a \u201clabor of love\u201d so to speak. When he would get all wound up and I could tell he was on the verge of exploding (his anger had manifested into physical altercations with other clients once or twice) I would take him to the park down the street and we would go for a jog so he could let off some steam. For weeks he pestered us to take him to Walmart to buy a basketball so him and I could play at the park, which we eventually did. He used to tell me that when he makes it in the music world he was going to \u201ctake me to the top\u201d with him and he always referred to me as his manager and producer. It was touching in a way. One day he wanted to do something nice for me and make coffee for the start of my shift, so I came in that morning to find him stirring coffee grinds around in a pot of boiling water because he had no idea how to make coffee. That still makes me laugh to this day. \n\nFast forward to a few months later when his stay at my facility abruptly came to an end. He had a psychotic episode one day while I was on shift, and I was tasked with finding a hospital that would take him in because it was obvious we could no longer provide him the care he needed. Him and I drove around for hours and got turned away by probably a half dozen hospitals until we finally found one willing to admit him to their crisis unit. As I was filling out his paperwork he kept wanting me to assure him that he would be ok. He was scared and didn\u2019t know what was happening but he trusted that I was going to help him so he complied and went along with the process. \n\nAs he was being prepared to be admitted and I was fetching his belongings out of the van to turn over to the hospital, he floored me with a gesture. He wanted me to keep his basketball. I joked that he should keep it or else he\u2019s gonna annoy the shit out of the staff at his next facility until they buy him a new one, but he insisted. I still have it in the backseat of my car to this day. \n\nWhen he was finally being admitted, a team of doctors flanked by armed police officers came to escort him into the unit, which I guess is standard protocol for a crisis admission. This terrified him. As he was being physically led away by the officers he turned back to me and shouted that he loved me and asked me to tell him he\u2019s gonna be okay again. It broke my heart seeing him lead away like that. He had his issues and was literally the biggest pain in my ass the 3 months he was my client but at the end of the day  I genuinely enjoyed working with him and would miss him. \n\nThat was the end of that saga until about 2 months ago when I saw him on the news. Him and some other kids broke into a house with the intent of robbing the people inside for their weed, apparently. Somehow it escalated and the 2 people in the house were shot in the head and killed. My ex-client was the one who pulled the trigger on both of them according to the news. It was honestly devastating. I knew he would probably never be able to thrive in the outside world and felt it was a mistake for him to be cut loose from treatment, but I never imagined he would do something like this. Obviously I\u2019m shocked and disgusted by what he did and don\u2019t want to make excuses for him, but I think it was also a colossal failure by whichever institution deemed it safe enough to turn him loose unsupervised like that. \n\nThat\u2019s my story of knowing a murderer. He\u2019s facing life in prison and was denied bail so him being out in the world won\u2019t be a problem anymore, which I think is for the best. I do hope he gets the help he needs though, through medication for his schizophrenia and whatever else. I know this was a long ass story but there are a lot of emotions tied to it and I never really got to tell this whole story before. Thanks for taking the time to read it!"

            "It is a bit of a long story and not sure I can talk about it, but..a few years ago I was needing some tongs to cook with. I noticed there was a flea market so I stopped by there.\n\nI love going to these things I ended up buying a couple of books, a pack of baseball cards, and met this old man there who has a cooking utensils booth.\n\nHe was packing up for the day and had what looked like the perfect pair of tongs. I asked him how much and he said \u201cSon, those tongs are older than I am, and you don\u2019t want them\u201d.\n\nAfter some negotiations he said I could have them but said \u201cThey aren\u2019t regular tongs, so be very careful how you use them\u201d.\n\nI was like \ud83e\udd14 \u201cThey are just tongs right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are special\u201d he said. Left them for me and I helped him carry out to box to his truck.\n\nI got home and decided I would cook a steak on the stove, so after I put it on I started to clean and wash the tongs.\n\nThere seemed to be something odd about them but they are just tongs right.\n\nAs I dried them off I clicked them. Everything went black.\n\nI feel a rush around me and see the black smoke rising against the sky. I could hear people screaming in pain and the smell of burning flesh filled my nostrils. I began to puke.\n\nWoman rushed over and said \u201cShe is burning. She is burning. She needs your help.\u201d\n\nQuickly I was rushed to the town square where a woman was being burned at the stake and they said that the tongs were needed to turn her over. They sprayed them with holy water and as she screamed more..\n\nAs they reached for the tongs I heard a screeching alarm.\n\nIt was my smoke alarm and my steak was burning.\n\nI quickly took it off the burner, opened the doors and windows to let fresh air pull out the smoke from the house.\n\nI got rid of those tongs that night and ordered a pizza.\n\nI will never click tongs again and I suggest you do so at your own risk as still to this day on occasion I can smell the burning flesh that lingers in the air from hundreds of years ago.\n\nDon\u2019t click tongs folks it is not worth the risk.",

            "I realized last year WHY we click the tongs. It\u2019s a calibration check. Each pair of tongs are different. And each time we use a pair, even if it\u2019s the same one we used yesterday, we ourselves are different. Maybe we did a workout, and were a little stronger than before. Maybe we just sat and binged Star Wars, so we\u2019re a little physically weaker but mentally stronger. No matter the circumstances...\n\nTongs are very likely to be used when delicate handling of food is required. You are trying to pick up a piece of food without ruining it. If you apply too little force, the food falls through your tongs\u2019 grip. Too much force, and you damage the food. No one wants a burger patty that\u2019s ripped in two. No one wants a piece of perfectly toasted bread with a massive indent in the middle. The test clicks help us get a feel for exactly how much pressure will be required to achieve the objective this time, with this precise make and model of tong. \n\nIn conclusion: cLicK cLiCk = liFe",

Dropped tongs do not need to be washed if the fall on grass if clicked rapidly after.  Science is real.",

            "This reminds me of that classic Aussie Joke:    \n     \nThe Tong-Master Griff was at the barbecue and Joel was at the barbecue and I was at the barbecue; three men standing around a barbecue, sipping beer, staring at sausages, rolling them backwards and forwards, never leaving them alone. We didn't know why we were at the barbecue; we were just drawn there like moths to a flame. The barbecue was a powerful gravitational force, a man-magnet.     \n     \nJoel said the thin ones could use a turn, I said yeah I reckon the thin ones could use a turn, Griff said yeah they really need a turn it was a unanimous turning decision. Griff was the Tong-Master, a true artist, he gave a couple of practice snaps of his long silver tongs, SNAP SNAP, before moving in, prodding, teasing, and with an elegant flick of his wrist, rolling them onto their little backs. A lesser tong-man would've flicked too hard; the sausages would've gone full circle, back to where they started. Nice, I said. The others went yeah.     \n     \nKevin was passing us, he heard the siren-song- sizzle of the snags, the barbecue was calling, beckoning, Kevinnnnn ...come. He stuck his head in and said any room? We said yeah and began the barbecue shuffle; Griff shuffled to the left, Joel shuffled to the left, I shuffled to the left, Kevin slipped in beside me, we sipped our beer. Now there were four of us staring at sausages, and Griff gave me the nod, my cue. I was second-in-command, and I had to take the raw sausages out of the plastic bag and lay them on the barbecue; not too close together, not too far apart, curl them into each other's bodies like lovers -fat ones, thin ones, herbed and continental. The chipolatas were tiny, they could easily slip down between the grill, falling into the molten hot-bead-netherworld below. Carefully I laid them sideways ACROSS the grill, clever thinking. Griff snapped his tongs with approval; there was no greater barbecue honour.     \n      \nP.J. came along, he said looking good, looking good -the irresistible lure of the barbecue had pulled him in too. We said yeah and did the shuffle, left, left, left, left, he slipped in beside Kevin, we sipped our beer. Five men,lots of sausages.     \n     \nJoel was the Fork-pronger; he had the fork that pronged thetough hides of the Bavarian bratwursts and he showed a lot of promise. Stabbing away eagerly, leaving perfect little vampire holes up and down the casing. P.J. was shaking his head, he said I reckon they cook better if you don't poke them.     \n      \nThere was a long silence, you could have heard a chipolata drop, and this newcomer was a rabble-rouser, bringing in his crazy ideas from outside. He didn't understand the hierarchy; first the Tong-master, then the Sausage-layer, then the Fork-pronger -and everyone below was just a watcher. Maybe eventually they'll move up the ladder, but for now - don't rock the Weber.      \n       \nDianne popped her head in; hmmm, smells good, she said. She was trying to jostle into the circle; we closed ranks, pulling our heads down and our shoulders in, mumbling yeah yeah yeah, but making no room for her. She was keen, going round to the far side of the barbecue, heading for the only available space . . . the gap in the circle where all the smoke and ashes blew. Nobody could survive the gap; Dianne was going to try. She stood there stubbornly, smoke blinding her eyes, ashes filling her nostrils, sausage fat spattering all over her arms and face. Until she couldn't take it anymore, she gave up, backed off. Kevin waited till she was gone and sipped his beer. We sipped our beer, yeah.     \n      \nGriff handed me his tongs. I looked at him and he nodded. I knew what was happening, I'd waited a long time for this moment - the abdication. The tongs weighed heavy in my hands, firm in my grip. Was I ready for the responsibility?     \n      \nYes, I was. I held them up high and they glinted in the sun. Don't forget to turn the thin ones Griff said as he walked away from the barbecue, disappearing toward the house. Yeah I called back, I will, I will. I snapped them twice,    \n     \nSNAP SNAP, before moving in, prodding, teasing, and with an elegant flick of my wrist, rolling them back onto their little bellies. I was a natural, I was the TONG-MASTER. But only until Griff got back from the toilet.",

There was always a beat to click your tongs to, whether in your own mind, sounds from nature or actual music playing. The tong clicking ritual lasted years. Every time I picked up tongs, I clicked them. Then one day I realized that the tongs had a power over me, a power that made me do things I didn\u2019t want to do. On that day, I picked the tongs up. My hand started to constrict around the two handles, but I stopped it. I looked at my hand with wonder. How did I do it? I didn\u2019t click the tongs. I put them back down and then picked them up again. As before, my hand started to tighten around the handles. But through sheer concentration, I stopped myself again. It felt really good to overcome this obstacle in my life. Now I compare other situations to the day I overcame the tong click and it acts as an inspiration to overcome any difficult circumstance.

            "I mean I'm late to this party but damn have I got a story.\n\nSo.. for years I've had these dreams and when I say years I mean since I was a teenager. \n\nThere was always this girl, she was never clearly seen. Always just at the edge of my vision. I would chase her and she would let me catch up and run along side of her. Like two wolves in the light of a full moon. She represented freedom and the escape from the world itself. Solitude and silence, ecstasy and joy. But as I woke she would be gone. \n\nI never really believed she was a real person obviously, that would be madness. A sort of insanity reserved for only poet's and drug addicts. There seems to be a line there that is often crossed between the two but I digress.\n\nA 5 year relationship with my fiance ended. \"I feel we are just friends who sleep next to eachother\" she had texted me, while working up north having been away for 10 days at that point. I couldn't argue the point, she was a queen and I a consort at best. Striving towards her goals and putting mine to the wayside. It had never truely been love, just two people clinging to the idea of it.\n\nAs I moved out and changed cities I was not broken but renewed in the belief that maybe, just maybe there was a purpose behind the whole of things I was now being tossed into.\n\nA place to stay and a better paying job fell into my lap without effort. I tired away work being my only purpose. A friend told me I should get back out there, try to find someone new. A silly notion I was fine as a solo act. Why ever would I risk making the same mistakes again falling for a girl who didn't share my interest and beliefs. \n\nBut I installed tinder.\n\nIt was a week of waiting and looking at pictures, I swiped left on every single woman who came across my screen. None of them seemed right, a filter from snap chat, she has a cat (allergies) or just not my type. \n\nThen I stumbled on a girl, sat on her couch, her dog resting his head on her knee, not in the claiming of ownership manner most dogs would. But in a manner that suggested this woman was his world, all he cared for. Complete and utter adoration. \n\nShe was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen, perfect in any way i could imagine. \n\nSo I swiped right, my first. The screen shook and it was a match. My palms remained dry however, I didn't start with a pickup line or a joke. I spoke to her as if I knew her, because somehow I felt as if I did. She responded in the same manner, neither of us questioning the reality we had just met because in every manner besides what is normal, this was not our first meeting. A memory of a stranger.\n\nThe first weekend we spent together after talking for nearly a month was camping in the winter snow. Where she led me into her bed after a day filled with hiking and fires. \nThe next night was spent at her home in her bed and as I slept the woman of my dreams appeared, she wore white as we raced through a grand cathedral. As I felt myself begin to wake i called to her.. for the first time by name. \n\nShe turned and smiled and I knew her face. I woke and looked into those same eyes and knew I was home. Finally after all these years. I'd found her. She lay there staring into my waking eyes. She smiled as if in on the secret.\n\nSo yes.. I'd gladly tell the press. I'd gladly tell the world.\n\nEdit: TLDR: met the literal girl from my dreams on tinder.",

Due to how wrestling is, the team itself are rather comfortable with each other, are not afraid to do stuff that the normal straight high school male would be too afraid to do. Stuff like take naps on top of each other, put holds on people laying down, ect.\n\nDuring sophomore year, our coach drove us up state for a two-day tournament, and got rooms from a cheap hotel. While settling in, two of the wrestlers decided that they wanted to take a bath but wanted to save time and water. So while in nothing but gym shorts, they proceeded to take a bath together.\n\nThe funniest part is when our coach was checking up on us to make sure we get to sleep, he asked where those two were, and we pointed to the bathroom. He entered said bathroom, and upon seeing the two chilling in the tub, he yelled \"What in the fuck are you two doing!?\"\n\nAnd the older wrestler, in all his wise glory, just simply smiled back and went \"Hey coach.\"\n\nSo yeah, two perfectly straight guys, who I think also had girlfriends as well, decided to take a bath together.

            "I was 19 and my good friend at the time was 18. I had just broken up with my girlfriend and he was broken up with by his girlfriend like three days before this. \n\nWe decided to have a guy night at his place and enjoy some secret drinking, he still lived with his parents, just me him and our other friend. Our other friend never showed so the two of us enjoyed the rum I brought and the whiskey he stole from his parents. \n\nHe lived at home with parents but had a pretty chill space, his room was big and the garage was a converted apartment off of his room and the door was wide and kept open so it was all pretty spacious and private. \n\nWe were drinking and complaining and missing our prior girlfriends while taking turns playing different grunge/rock jams off of our phones. \n\nWe were hanging out on one of his beds talking, dri king, and trading jams out of no where he asked \"you ever think about doing anything gay\"? I was taken aback but to be honest every guy, no matter where they are on the spectrum from 100% straight to curious to gay, has thought about it.\n\nI have the standard answer of \"I don't know... Why\"? He responded with \"I don't know, just wondering\". There was a several second silence that felt a little longer than comfortable while all of that just hung in the air. Fueled by alcohol and stupid humor I said \"why want me to suck it\"? and I laughed. \n\nTo my shock and surprise he didn't respond to a joke, he responded literally \"sure try it if you want\" and started to unbuckle his belt before he stopped all of the sudden and looked me in the eyes. His expression seemed to convey the shock of his alcohol induced haste and honesty in offering and his hands frozen on his pants having undone his belt, button, zipper and having started to pull his jeans off slightly. \n\nI had no idea what to do and just looked at his eyes. They seemed to be bigger and larger than I realized like they were so huge until the instant I realized why as I felt his lips on mine. To this day I don't know who moved in for it, one or other other or both. But we were making out and wrestling for control of the situation back and forth as we rolled on his bed one over the other, him on top, me on top, both pressing our lips and tongues hard into each other as our hands relaxed into running through each other's hair and massaging each other's back and shoulders while pulling ourselves into each other. \n\nHis pants were already on they way out since we began and I felt him kicking them off of his ankles and his dick hard as steel pushing against my leg and mine which was following the lead. \n\nSince I asked my stupid question I think he wanted to run with it because at one point when he was on top his hands left me and before I knew it I realized they were taking off his own boxer briefs. All of the sudden his mouth was off of mine and he was positioning to sit on my chest as his dick found my lips. \n\nI kept my lips closed in shock but as his head pressed against them they opened and all of the sudden I was blowing him. I went from depressed about missing pussy to a 2am drunken blow job being face ridden and used by my friend. I have to admit, I fucking loved it and did everything possible moving my tongue and lips over all the places I knew I had always like when getting a blow jobs from girls to his dick and pleasure. \n\nAll of the sudden he shoved it into my mouth harder than at any point so far and I was shocked for a moment before I realized what it was... he was about to cum. He burst like a volcano into my mouth and throat. Whatever I was expecting, I want expecting this at all really, it was nothing like the combination of sweet saltiness that I tasted shotgunned onto my tongue and down my throat. I let him keep going as he pumped so much into my mouth. \n\nWhen he was done he came off of my chest and sat on the bed. I was sucking and swallowing clearing my throat and we just sat for five or so minutes in silence and have breathing. He pulled his boxer briefs back on, then his jeans, and reached over to one of our bottles and a coffee mug he had been shotting  out of and made and took another shot. \n\nThen he said \"want a smoke\"? I said yeah, we went out and smoked in quite for a few minutes and we then mentioned it was late, decided to head off, him to bed, me back to my car and away we went. \n\nWe never mentioned it again.

            "I was 15 and my friend was 13. It started when we would have sleepovers and late at night one of us would hint that they were horny and wanted to touch themselves by pulling up porn or showing each other our erections through our pajamas and comparing sizes. This would lead to us watching videos together and jerking off under the blankets until we both came.  \n\nEventually after multiple sessions like these one of us was curious as to what another persons hand would feel like on our penis. So we experimented by stroking each other off while watching porn. It was interesting to say the least to feel another penis, I distinctly remember his penis being much thinner in circumference than mine. He was also circumcised and I was not, so this thinner, tighter penis felt odd in my hand. This was our usual from then on as we would do this often when having sleepovers and would just start touching each other when we were in bed to initiate the jerk off session. We even started to sync our orgasms so we could finish at the same time.\n\nWe were Jerk off buddies as they call them.\n\nThis went on for a couple of years and at one point we almost sucked each other off when my friend hinted that he wanted to feel what a mouth felt like, but at that point I didn\u2019t feel comfortable and told him that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do that. I think that\u2019s when I figured out I was straight for sure. \n\nWe are still very close to this day and we both have had long term girlfriends. We haven\u2019t brought it up since it\u2019s happened, but honestly...I don\u2019t feel weird about it when we hang out, we don\u2019t even think about it. The way I see it, we were just a couple of kids experimenting our sexuality in a safe environment with consent. I have zero regrets.",

It went on and on.\n\nSo I look over to him while laughing and I was like, \"hey hey HEY HEY STOP!

I love it. \n\nHuman meat is very close to pork. So lightly seasoned and glazed with something sweet like honey, plum sauce, apple sauce or maple syrup. You would have to cook it very well, and make sure to properly sear it, and cook it relatively quickly as human meat is around 7% fat, so quite lean for red meat. Since human skin is quite thin, you could easily make crackling with it, so that would be something to watch out for.\n\nThe legs especially would make for good long cooking techniques with the thighs being good for a quick roast and the calves being better for braising or stewing. The muscles of the back could make good grilling, with the lumbar multifidus being somewhat akin to filet mignon. The arms, in general, would be good for general purpose meats, along with the abdominals, though, the latter would need to be cooked far longer. The shoulders would be particularly fatty cuts prime for stewing or braising.

            "This happened to me in Uruguay.  But I've been told a similar tactic works in the US.\n\nSuppose I'm evil.  And I have money.  Not a huge amount of money.  But a healthy six digit number in the bank.  And I see someone else.  This someone else maybe doesn't make a lot.  Maybe he has a lot of kids.  Maybe it's a recession and he's having a hard time finding enough work.  Who knows.  But he's barely making it.  Paycheck to paycheck.  But he has something of value.  He owns his family farm outright.  And it's worth a small six digit number.  But he relies on this farm mainly to provide a rent-free place to live.  If he had to pay rent for a place to live, he wouldn't be anywhere close to making it.\n\nSo I'm wealthy and evil.  I contact my lawyer and say, \"Hey, I know this guy.  He doesn't have any money.  But he has this property.  Let's sue him.  He'll be required to immediately come up with cash in the sum of 10% of the value of the lawsuit in order to defend himself.  His property is worth $100,000.  So we'll make up some crazy excuse to sue him for $100,000.  He won't be able to come up with the $10,000.  So we'll win by default.  And we'll force the sale of his property.  Then you get 20%.\"\n\nSo the lawyer sues on contingency.  In other words, the wealthy person doesn't have to pay anything to do this.  In order to improve the odds, I bribe/convince a judge to include non-standard language in the official notification of the law suit.  If the guy doesn't reply within 10 days, he loses by default.  Then we throw the paperwork in the dirt in front of the house and hope no one finds it before it's too late.\n\nI was the poor guy.  The legal documents sat in the mud in front of our house for a week before anyone saw it.  I managed to come up with the $10,000 and file a response the day before the 10 day deadline.  The lawsuit took more than two years to complete.  I won.  But it still cost me $25,000 to defend myself.  And the evil guy?  It was a 70yo grandma type friend that we had trusted and considered to be a part of our family.",

            "I disowned my father. I don't believe that it nearly as difficult a decision as disowning a child, but it was tough.\n\nI grew up in an upper middle class perfect nuclear family. My parents were high school sweethearts. My dad was an operator at an oil refinery, my mom was an accountant turned stay at home mom. I am a middle child- I have a 3 year older brother and a 3 year younger brother. \n\nWhen my older brother was about 10, my dad's drinking got out of hand and be became extremely physically abusive. A few years later, my mom divorced him after 23 years of marriage because she was afraid for our lives. \n\nMy dad went off the deep end. Started doing drugs, stealing, etc. Was involved in a few hit-and-runs. My older brother, who had received the brunt of the physical abuse, was manipulated into a relationship with my dad for a few years. To a lesser extent, so was I. He seemed to take an interest in us for the first time since we were little, but in hindsight it was just more manipulation and gaslighting. \n\nWont go into all of the details, but my brothers and I eventually got wind of just what kind of sketchy stuff he was involved in. My little brother and I, who both had aspirations to get into law enforcement, cut him out of our lives completely. My older brother took a while longer- he was a kid who always just wanted his dad to love him and so he was wearing blinders. He did eventually see the light, and cut my dad out as well. \n\nA few years ago, my dad was living with his mom. My grandma had been manipulated by him for years, and they had a symbiotic co- dependent relationship... she was a prescription addict and he was an \"everything\" addict. My grandma had a reverse mortgage on her home. She was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 6 months to live, and moved into a nursing home. My dad kept squatting at her house, despite the bank coming to (rightfully) claim the home. Cops got involved, and he was arrested. \n\nMy grandma slipped and fell 2 days after moving to the nursing home. She developed a brain bleed and died a few days later. \n\nMy dad had a seizure his first night in jail and was brought to the hospital, where it was determined he had a burst brain aneurysm. The doctors theorized that the aneurysm was the result of his drug use, and when he was scuffling with the cops during the arrest, his increased blood pressure and/or jarring caused it to burst.\n\nHe's now in a nursing home, and functioning at about a 6 year old's level. He has some inkling that he's fucked up royally and it is all his fault but he really doesn't understand the specifics. He can kind of communicate, and hold conversations but they're bizarre and wander all over and a lot of very strange words make their way in.\n\nI visit him a few times per year. I only do it because the person he became with addiction is dead. I believe that karma caught up to him, and he's earned his hell. I truly would not shed a tear if he dropped dead tomorrow- he's been dead to me for a decade. I do have some compassion for a sad, confused 58 year old man who is alone in a depressing nursing home with no visitors. He knows he has kids, and a wife (he doesn't understand they're divorced) and sometimes he even knows he has grandkids he has never been allowed to meet. So he doesn't understand why nobody visits him. I've started occasional visits not because I have any interest in having a relationship with him, but because unfortunately the doctors saved him when his aneurysm burst and we're left with a person who is paying for crimes he doesn't know he committed, in a world he doesn't understand. He sometimes cries when he asks to see pictures of \"that little boy\" (my nephew- his grandson) and I have to explain, yet again, why he isn't allowed to meet him. He asks me questions about \"that cop\"- my little brother, whose name he can't remember. He looks so proud when I tell him that his son is rising through the ranks and just became a K9 officer. It's like a shard of the dad he was 25 years ago has surfaced, and everything in between only exists as a convoluted fever dream. It tears my heart open as a human to see his suffering, but in a really twisted, sick way gives me satisfaction that his actions caught up to him, which makes me hate myself even more than I already did. \n\nI doubt anyone has read this- it wasn't supposed to be a novel. But that's how I disowned my dad, then kind of developed a minimal relationship with the ghost of his former humanity than now occupies his body. My heart goes out to people who have had to disown a child. I was extremely fortunate to have an incredible mom and extended family to support my brothers and me, yet I am still damaged from my time with him. Having to choose between compassion and love for a flawed person and your own or your other loved-ones' physical and mental wellbeing rips something open inside of you and leaves you permanently scarred.",
            "I'm not a parent, I've never disowned a child. My parents disowned my oldest sister. I'm the youngest of three girls. My oldest sister had a horrible relationship with my father, blames me for getting in the way of their relationship. She had her first baby (to spite him) when she was 16 years old. My father refused to give her money because she met a deadbeat child predator, and got pregnant again, the again, and again. She constantly put herself and deadbeat before kids. Dad would send money to girls for Christmas and birthdays and never heard a thing, he finally gave up... She's 30, has six daughters, and lives in a mobile home in North Carolina. \n\nWe hadn't seen or heard from my sister until June of this year. My oldest niece contacted me asking to come to Florida (where I live) for the summer to get her and her sisters out of the trailor. I agree, contact sister and she agrees, I set up plane tickets and organize the rooms they'll stay in. When they got here, they were completely disheveled. Clothes visibly dirty, smelled foul, so covered in lice that my white towels stained gray from removing them. My niece informed me that they had been without water and electricity for 6 months. They live in a 2 bedroom mobile home, there are holes in the roof, bugs and rats everywhere. As a family, we decide the girls aren't going back to North Carolina.\n\nWe tell my sister to come to my parents house in Florida to get her life together and get back on her feet. She refused because deadbeat is not invited. Ironically, she found out that deadbeat is cheating on her. She confronts him and he kicks her out of shit hole trailer. Deadbeat said \"I would rather be homeless than live with you\". Sister now works for the dollar store and doesn't pull her weight with kids. At least the girls are safe now...\n\nEdit: I never really finished my point with the story. My parents had disowned my oldest sister when she moved to North Carolina with deadbeat for six years until my niece reached out to me through Facebook. I had never even met my two youngest nieces until this event. I regret turning my back on my sister. I really hate her and what she put her babies through, but if we stayed in her life for those six years we maybe could have prevented this.",
            "My siblings and I have stopped interacting with my oldest brother. We found out that years earlier he had molested at least two boys. He was an adult at the time. He showed no remorse, and turned the story around to say that those boys were at fault. It was so disgusting to watch someone you grew up with treat people so poorly and show such a blatant disregard for others. \n The good news is that the remaining four siblings have become closer and we now are able to appreciate the good we see in each other. It\u2019s true when they say that if you could pick your family it would look much different than it is!",
            "Not me, but my great grandma. This story is really sad but also interesting, so I thought I'd share it.   \nShe was a young creole teenager- french creole was her first language, and she was a quarter-to-half black like me, with tan skin and loose brown curls. She was born in Florida, but when things started getting worse for black people in Florida, her family relocated to Texas. For those who don't know, creole people tend to play heavily into colorism. Although they are definitely mixed race, they prioritize light skinned people. The looser your curl, the lighter your skin, the more white you look, the better. Her parents had high expectations for her to marry a wealthy, light skinned man who would take care of her.  \n\n\nInstead, she met my great grandfather. A poor, dark-skinned man jumping from job to job working for farmers and trying to make a living. The two of them fell in love. They were just teenagers. Her parents threatened to disown her if she continued seeing him, and like a rebellious teenager, she refused. They wanted her to do better. She wanted to be in love.   \n\n\nThey might have broken up eventually, if she didn't get pregnant. But she did, and that was the end of it. Her parents basically said \"you've ruined your life\" and disowned her right there. The whole family disowned her. No one would speak to her- aunts, uncles, cousins, not a single person stood up for her. So she had no choice. The two of them moved to California, so he could get a job picking oranges. He built a house. They had their first daughter. She was 16. She never saw her family again.",
            "My parents disowned my oldest sister. She always struggled growing up more than us (she became a teen mom with a bad older dude, partied a lot, etc), but my parents helped her a lot. They do okay for themselves, but had a no-co-signing rule for all six of my siblings and I. Still, they co-signed for her house so she could get a head start. \n\nShe didn\u2019t pay the mortgage for almost 3 years before my mom got served in front of all the other nurses at her work. \n\nMy parents worked tirelessly to try to work out deals where my sister and her family kept the house and got some leniency, but to no avail, because my sister never showed up for court dates. During this time, she paid $12k for IVF and got pregnant with her fifth kid. \n\nWhen my mom demanded some of the money back, she accused my dad and my brother of beating her sons when my parents took them to Disney World (he didn\u2019t) and said she\u2019d file a police report if he asked for money again. They kept asking, cause it wasn\u2019t true. \n\nShe awkwardly joined us for Christmas, and punched my brother in the face during the meal for \u201chumiliating\u201d her oldest son by asking him if he wanted to work at my brother\u2019s company for good pay. Her oldest son is in and out of jail, and my brother was trying to help him after his release, but her son said he didn\u2019t want a job and got mad. She then called the cops and told them the same brother had illegal guns in his truck, and they came on Christmas night and searched his truck (no guns found!) \n\nNeedless to say, she is not welcome anywhere near any of us and my mom still cries about it, but refuses to talk to her again.",
            "My mother and her sister were both adopted into a great family. \n\nRecently, my Grandfather fell ill and we were told to prepare to say goodbye. So the family gathered. My Grandmother has had a hard time with her memory since she had a brain hemorrhage, but she welcomed my aunt into her home during this tough time. \n\nWhilst my Grandfather was in his final week, Wendy (aunt) took my Grandmother's atm card and proceeded to spend well over a thousand dollars on herself and get herself a motel room. She alsp attempted to steal their car. When my uncles found out, she basically disappeared into the wind. \n\nAfter my Grandfather passed and his funeral was all sorted. My Grandmother went to an attorney to write Wendy out of any inheritance she would get from their estate when she passes. She didnt press any formal charges, because the whole process would have been lengthy and more painful for her. She didn't need the extra stress.\n\nI'm pretty sure one of my uncles also threatened Wendy to make sure she stayed away from my Grandmother from now on too.",

            "My ex wife disowned my son.\n\nWe both married young when I was in the military (high school sweethearts). She became pregnant 6 months into our marriage. I don\u2019t think she connected with him at all after he was born. The most she did with him was Instagram photo shoots where she painted herself as #1 mommy. When he turned 3, I left the military. A year after that, she ran for the hills. I remember it like it was yesterday. I sat down with her at a local restaurant to talk divorce plans. We split all of our financials and material items down the middle. We finally got to custody for my kiddo (something I dreaded to discuss because fathers never gain custody in my area) and she tells me \u201cI want absolutely no responsibility\u201d. I was taken back and I asked if she was sure. She was. That one sentence hurt me more than anything else that happen during that time. My biological father wanted nothing to do with me and now I was seeing it happen with my own child but with his mother. I received full custody and she married within a year afterwards (she had another child too). Her parents try their best to be apart of his life but she still does her best to avoid him. He\u2019s 7 now and used to it, but I know it weights heavily on him. Shit sucks ass but it\u2019s life I guess.\n\n*I just woke up and saw all the upvotes, messages, comments, and awards. I want to say thank you so much. I didn\u2019t expect this level of response. I don\u2019t usually share something as personal as that. My kiddo is a very awesome kid that has shown great resiliency beyond his years. He has rolled through the tough times better than even I. I can just hope he doesn\u2019t question his worth because of what his mom did. I know I questioned mine due to my own father leaving and that has left scars that will not heal. Well.....thank you all again and you all have a wonderful day.",

            "Not my kid, but my sister I raised for several years. I was a senior in HS when my parents had my sister - completely unexpected. They were 58 and 55. I never really got to know her much as I went away to college when she was 5 months old, and was in the Air Force by the time she was 1 1/2. I saw her twice on leave, and got pics, but the way life was working out we never really got time together. Fast forward, our dad dies when she is 2, and my stepmother is raising her. She was a terrible parent, like the kind that saw one of her kids run away at 16 to halfway across the country, another runaway at 15 and get married, and one that is just a loon who spent his life bouncing around whatever hot MLM program was out there as a career. She also convinced my dad to send me to a pray away the gay camp in TN. when I was 15. So when my sister was 11 and begging for help, I took leave and went to her. Surprisingly, my stepmonster was happy to get attorneys to draw up the paperwork for me to become my sisters guardian, and even pay for it.\n\n\\-- So I'm raising my sister and things are okay until she is about 14. Then I caught her doing these videos online talking dirty trying to get guys to jerk off. So that was a mess of trying to get those down and suing the people that hired her to do them.-- Ran away for a week, hiding out at a friends house, found her when she was caught shoplifting.-- A B&E charge at 14, trying to steal the phone of a boy she was dating to se if he was talking to other girls. It happened on base and I managed to talk it out of being a bigger thing.-- A second B&E charge with friends breaking into the NCO club to try to steal beer. I was told I had to leave base housing at that point, my secuirty clearance was suspended to make sure she wasn't putting me in a position I could be compromised.-- still 14, arrested with a stolen military ID trying to get into a bar.-- 15 escapes rehab.-- 15 escapes rehab again-16 things seem good and she is taking school seriously.\n\nAt 18 she was accepted to RISD, graduated with honors, and had an actual decent paying job with a web company with benefits and everything. Started getting stoned a lot, lost her job. Sold her car to pay bills. Lost her apartment, still hadn't bothered looking for work. Got her trust fund at 24, blew over $400k in two years, nothing to show for it. Had multiple cases against her for drugs.

Got picked up for hooking and possession out of state, was returned to RI where she was detained and somehow released pending trial yet again. While awaiting trial she was caught holding enough packaged for sale heroin to qualify as a distribution charge.By then, I hadn't heard from her for almost 7 years, and only managed to keep up with her reading the police blotter or from rthe ocassional attorney that she had contact me to verify I would pick up her legal tab - I wouldn't. Against any logic, she was out of prison in under three years. I heard she dimed a bunch of people out to make it happen. She showed up at my house, asking for a place to stay. I said I couldn't have her in my house, but I'd get her a place for the night and then help her locate a place of her own. That night she broke into my house, nearly got shot by me while doing it, and tried to spin some story that she was looking for something she dropped in my house earlier that day, despite never actually entering my house. I told her she had to go, she threatened she would call DCFS and tell them I was abusing my kids if I didn't go with her to an ATM and give her all the money I could withdraw. Told her to GTFO before I exercised the castle defense law and dropped her.\n\ntook out a restraining order the next day, and in doing so found she once again left state when she wasn't supposed to have and violated her parole, so back to the clink. Since then she's been dead to me.",
            "A little different, I was disowned, but I deserved it. I was an addict and a mess for a long time, my mom couldn\u2019t keep bailing me out of trouble and watch me self destruct anymore. I wasn\u2019t living at home, she came to see me one last time to tell me she was done, not to contact her, she would no longer have anything to do with me. She was in pieces, I can\u2019t imagine how hard it must have been for her. But it was the best thing she ever did for me, once she cut me off my rock bottom came hard and fast. After a little while of living on the streets and my addiction consuming me, I made my way to a detox center, got a few days clean under my belt and never looked back. That was almost 15 years ago. After I was clean a little while I contacted my mom, and little by little we built a relationship again, and now we\u2019re really close.

            "Drugs, violence, theft, repetitively trying to destroy his younger brother, becoming a danger to myself and others, mental health issues that he refuses to deal with any longer or take his meds for anymore. Just plain off the chain behavior that was too much for all of us.  I wouldn't call it disowning, as much as putting down boundaries and setting up fences to protect people who don't deserve his treatment.  He also tends to be very manipulative and leans toward narcissistic behavior, in that he will habitually lie about you to others and try to play the victim. This can be very damaging to relationships with people that don't understand what's going on, so I'd rather just not bring myself into the equation anymore, because it's too costly and it's not worth it.  He lacks empathy and doesn't know how to stop himself from his harmful behavior due to a developmental disability, although he will also admit that he knows what he's doing and he knows that he is manipulative and playing games at times. When he was younger and was under the rules of being a minor, then he had all the help in the world and it was easier to deal with.",

He\u2019s almost 14 (next month) and he\u2019s currently out of our home at a treatment facility.  He\u2019s averaged two arrests a year for the last two years, and he\u2019s attacked my wife several times, our daughters several times, and the neighborhood kids several times.  He\u2019s run away from school, run away from home, and tried to push me off the roof of our house (after threatening to jump off and hurt himself).

That\u2019s like putting walls around a tornado and expecting it to stay inside the walls.  A lot of what has occurred he had little control over because of the way his mind is (where he\u2019s constantly at war with himself, structure versus chaos), and my wife and I have tried desperately to give him the best life we can while keeping ourselves and our daughters safe, but **I\u2019m tired.** It\u2019s been 8 and a half years we\u2019ve been going through this with him and I\u2019ve been ready to throw in the towel on him for a while.

The issues escalated quickly. When he was 7 he hit our dog with a golf club. We had to keep him away from our dog and our cat. The cat disappeared - we assumed she got out and ran away. Found out years later that he killed it and threw it in the woods. The last straw was when he burned our home down. We sent him to a residential treatment center where he stayed for 2 years. During that time, he molested a roommate and became extremely violent. The insurance company told us that they wouldn\u2019t pay anymore and we\u2019d either have to pay for him out of pocket ($40k a month) or bring him home. We have younger children and it wouldn\u2019t be safe. We ended up telling the state we wouldn\u2019t bring him home. So now we have a verified abuse report against us because we wouldn\u2019t bring him back (even though the therapists agreed with our decision). I don\u2019t love him.

I tried not to show it, and behave as normally as possible because  he was a child at the time and couldn't possibly understand what I was going through.

            "Alright, so this is a family secret that I revealed and got my mother's family to disown me. Which honestly is for the better.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my uncle, molested me repeatedly over a summer I was with my grandparents. It really fucked with my sexuality and took me into my late teens, early 20s and years of therapy to accept that I'm gay. Still working on trying to even trust men as whole, in part because of this.\n\nAnyway, when I was about 14 I told my mother because I just needed to get the secret out. I was in a situation I'd have to be alone with him again, and I was scared. Although looking back I was more scared trying to tell her, what her youngest brother did. When I did I learned that, this is a pretty common thing in her family and it happened to her by my grandmother's second husband. Well it happened to her and her three other sisters. My mother apologized to me, telling me she was sorry for sending me away that summer and that the family curse caught me as well. Honestly I needed to hear this because I hated her for letting this happen, but she had no way of stopping it or even knowing it'd happen to her son. Always been something that happened to the girls but never the boys. Aren't family traditions grand (sarcasm)?\n\nWe went to the cops, and because it had been so long and across state lines. There wasn't much they could do, it was my word against his. My mother family acknowledged that stuff like this happens in their family, and that I should blame the devil for this happening to me and not the person. And really I should feel bad for him because all of this was hard on him as well, he took this time to officially come out of the closet, and they all, minus my mother, let him know how brave he is for admitting his illness. And subsequently blamed me for turning him gay, keep in mind I was still trying to process if I was gay at this time. I was then accused of wanting to get molested and that I needed to repent what I had done and for trying to destroy his life. My mother tried to argue back, but at this point it was my mother's family versus my mother and I. My mother ended up giving slightly and told them we need time to process this. They let off and...\n\nWe got the hell out of there and never looked back. It's been about ten years since I saw any of them. They blame my mother for raising a devil loving son, which didn't get helped when I finally came out. The last thing they told us is that they'll let both my mother and I back in, if and only if, I admit that a nine year old wanted to be molested and of course convert back to being straight.\n\nI think they are still surprised I haven't taken them up on their offer. Idk, and idc. My family is super small now, and I couldn't be more pleased.",

He also had a new gf and her family to look after apparently and he had no issues leaving us. When my mum passed away when I was 14, my brother, grandmother, him and I met up to discuss who I was going to live with (the plan was my brother and his family, father was never considered) and he showed up and declared that he was in the process of going to court to legally emancipate himself from me. He went out of his way to legally declare that I was no longer his child. Just so that my brother (22yo with a wife and 2 young children already struggling on one paycheck) couldnt seek child support. \n\nNeedless to say it stung coming only days after my mother's funeral..",

There are parts of this that are weird too.  My mother initially lied to her parents and said she was dating an Arab man.  This was fine but they found out she was lying leading to her being disowned.  I guess in the early 70s Arabs were ok but blacks were no nos.  \n\nThey disowned my mom but it was fine if we came over.  My older sister was close with them but me and my younger sister always felt weird going over there.  They adored my older sister though and she stayed over and went on vacation with them among other things.  I remember asking my grandfather why he didn't like my mother when I was about 8 or 9 years old at a cousin's birthday party.  He just walked away.\n\nThese same people who essentially pushed her out of their lives were the same ones she took care of and comforted in their darkest times. She sort of went back to them and they didn't push her away for what I am assuming is they knew the end was near and they were trying to right their wrongs. I have no idea just an assumption.

I told him that I don\u2019t want to see her ever again and I won\u2019t do anything with him if she there as well. The day came when my father and I wanted to meet for lunch. As I arrived I saw her sitting there with him. I went to the place and said that she had to leave or I\u2019m gonna leave. He became mad at for that and I left. He tried to do the same move again.

I remember my dad having to go to the hospital because he had really high blood pressure due to the level of stress she was causing one night and she thought he was faking it. Besides that, she was one of my biggest bullies I had growing up. Our fights would turn into fist fights. When I was 19, my parents and sisters (I have an older and little sister) and I had our first family therapy session and I basically laid out everything I have been feeling about her and my relationship with her.

            "I can answer for my mother. I cut contact from her but from what I hear nowadays she hates me for ruining her life. \n\nFirst awful thing I did: my mother purchased her first home when I was 12. She had always had this vision of me having a house and playing in the backyard as a child, and I think she felt like I was missing out by living in apartments all my life. Thing was, I had no desire to move out of where we were, and probably more importantly, she couldn't really afford a house plus this was just around the housing crisis as well so the price was super inflated and dropped significantly a year later. We only lived there a year before moving in with her at the time boyfriend and renting it out. I apparently was the sole reason that she purchased that house, she did that for me. So it was my fault that she bought a house she couldn't afford.\n\nSecond awful thing I did: She got pulled over while driving to a nearby city because she was swerving on the freeway. I was 13 at the time and had fallen asleep, but got woken up by the car shaking back and forth and almost hitting a semi, while she was asleep at the wheel. I woke her up and she insisted on pushing through, and not too long after she was pulled over by an undercover cop. I watched as she was failing the sobriety test hard, she fell a couple of times trying to walk in a straight line. I cooperated with police and gave over the prescriptions she had in the car with her. So basically that was an act of betrayal. She was in the medical field and was struggling to find/keep a job that would hire her with a record (charged with child endangerment). So she was driving while heavily medicated, but I took most of the blame because I wasn't loyal to her and sold her out to the police. \n\nSo now her finances are in shambles and can't keep a job in her field because of the awful things I did as a teenager. Her career is ruined because of me. A lot more happened to damage our relationship but I think she would identify these two things as the main reasons having me as a child ruined her life.",

Living with him was a nightmare. \n\nThe last straw was him walking out on his kid and her mother, and starting a gang fight at our house over a drug deal gone wrong. Things got really violent and I\u2019m pretty sure weapons were involved. He left the house, and on that very same night, he came back because he needed a place to stay. When my dad said no, he started fighting my dad. I stepped in at that point and almost beat the hell out of him (no one fucks with my dad, no one). It ended with my dad having to hold me down to stop me from killing him, and my brother walking away down the street yelling obscenities. Haven\u2019t seen him since. This was 6 years ago. \n\nAt this point, he\u2019s either in jail or dead. I may have every reason in the world to hate him for everything he\u2019s done, but I don\u2019t. He\u2019s a tortured soul who has let his demons get the absolute best of him, plain and simple. I just hope that he finds some kind of peace, even if it takes death for him to do so. \n\nBill, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re my brother and I still love you, and I hope you\u2019re okay, wherever you are.",
            "My father disowned my older sister when she was in high school. She had been raped while walking to a friend's house and he blamed her. She later tried jumping out of a moving car because she was depressed and suicidal. My dad never liked my sister and refused to go to any father-daughter dances. He was distant to her for seemingly no reason. He finally said he disowned her after she was taken to a mental hospital to help with her behavioral issues stemming from the rape and literal daddy issues. He called her \"broken goods\" when he disowned her. Because she was disowned, she got pregnant at 17 to spite him, and it sealed the deal for my dad.\nMy sister is jealous of me because I was the younger, beloved child that my dad always wanted. But she doesn't see that he treats me like a doll and makes degrading comments when my looks aren't up to his standards. My sister grew up with a voice and a free will. My father hated that. The only reason he loves me is because he not only broke my free will and my ability to choose, but thinks of me as clay that he can \"mold into the perfect daughter\". \nNow I'm trying to break the mold and ignore him now that I'm an adult, but it's hard accepting it's okay not to be perfect. My sister still has mental issues from everything my father has put her through. She's become literally crazy and she requires meds and a lot of therapy even now.\n\nTL:DR\nMy dad disowned my sister because she was a free spirit, imperfect, and \"damaged goods\"",
            "I signed away my parental rights to my daughter. It sounds terrible, but here is the backstory-\n\nMy ex-wife and I separated for a while. Then we briefly reconciled. We had sex exactly once. We were working things out and then she says there's been another man in the picture and the kid isn't mine. She wants a quick, clean divorce. I refuse to proceed with the divorce until paternity is sorted out. \n\nDNA test is finally done and what do you know? It's mine. I deploy to Afghanistan. When I get back, finally get a hearing for the divorce. It took a judge's order to finally allow me to see my daughter. She was already walking when I saw her for the first time.\n\nFast forward 1.5 years and I am flat broke, killing myself to travel 600 miles on weekends to see my daughter for just a few hours, if at all. (The ex was pulling no-shows and showing up late for my scheduled visits.) \n\nWhen my daughter called me \"other daddy\" I knew I didn't have a chance. I knew that my ex was going to bad-mouth me and undermine me every chance she got. \n\nI signed away my rights shortly thereafter. She is 16 years old now. Once she is 18, I'll be able to contact her.",
            "I disowned my grandparents on my dad's side. My dad's parents are both divorced and remarried to different people. His father is great, lovely guy and super helpful when we need it. His mother and her husband are a real piece of work. \n\nShe moved to Spain when I was maybe around 11 year old. When I was 16/17 my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer. My grandfather and Nana were super helpful. Took him to appointments, picked my brother and I up from activities, generally being a great help in a difficult time. \n\nMy grandmother and her cunt of a husband, however, flew back from Spain just to tell us that they will not be helping with anything. That she is mainly focussed on her knee replacement surgery in Spain. \n\nSo at that point I decided I wanted nothing to do with her. I haven't as much as spoken to her in over 6 years and have no intention of speaking to her again. She as good as disowned my father in his most difficult moments and that cannot be forgiven. \n\nMy father survived his cancer. He's healthy and happy now.",
            "My parents got divorced and my mother decided she didn't want to be a mother any more so she neglected my sibling and I and kicked us out of her house.  Because the court system favours the mother, she got custody despite nobody asking us or looking too far into it and my dad had to give her the house and child support.\n\nDespite this, she didn't do anything for us and we ended up living with him anyways and she spent our child support on world travels and wouldn't ever buy us anything.\n\nShe met a guy, sponsored him, he had a son and that became her son.  I was now nothing to her.  \n\nThey divorced, he stole all her money and she ended up homeless until family took her in and it's been shaky since.\n\nShe went off the deep end about a year ago and I tried to get involved to help her but she kept being demeaning and went crazy, got arrested and I cut off ties.  She threatened to come shoot me and I called the police and even went to try and make a police report but nobody would listen to me and the guy at the counter at the police station laughed at me.  It was very bizarre.",
            "Okay, so far everyone is disowning their parents, but no parents disowning/no longer loving their children. Interesting. Because it\u2019s a younger demographic or do parents not want to talk about it?",

Worst than my ex fiancee who cheated on me, lied to me, then tried to make it my fault because im in the Navy and across country.\n\nShes a drug addict, narcissistic, drunk, and abusive. The worst traits of our abusive ex stepfather. She may or may not be carrying on the tradition in my family of teenage pregnancy, no one in my famiy talks to her so i can't confirm it but I dont doubt it. She blames my mother for everything bad that had happened to her, claims i molested when we were 9 or 10, claims i planned a sexual assualt that happened to her, etc etc etc. She cannot be anymore diffrent from me and my siblings, and cannot stand that me and my brother are no longer traumatized by our childhood. She has blocked 90% of my family and no one misses her.",
            "My sister was disavowed. She was a perfectly normal and happy person until she turned 16, and then out of nowhere she joined a gang of druggies and started breaking into houses and all kinds of crazy shit... stole all of our stuff on multiple occasions... punched grandma in head over $10 etc etc etc.\n\nThe Police had her drug tested a dozen times and she was always clean... parents spent $10,000 on a stay in a psych place to try and find out if she had a mental disorder or had been sexuallly abused or something, and there was no indication of any kind of underlying issues.\n\nOne say she came home and said that she needed money for \"**Another** Abortion\" and my parents lost their shit... no one had known she was ever pregnant, let alone multiple times.  They said that they would take the baby but she refused to go through with the pregnancy, so they cut her off then and there... and then it was like she literally never existed. \n\nI asked her why she was living her life this way the last time I saw her, and all she could say was \"Because it isn't boring\".",
            "My parents disowned my brother for basically being a huge piece of shit.  he stole a lot of my mom's expensive jewelry and pawned it, stole about $1,000 worth of my video games and pawned them, stole a lot of my dad's tools that he uses for his roofing business and pawned them, he used my parents vehicle as collateral for a loan that he defaulted on, and on top of that, even though this one isn't all his fault, he had sex with a friend of the family's wife and cause them to break up. So nobody in my family talks to him anymore",

            "My grandma disowned my father because of the way he acted towards the family. He used to tell my mother that his father once chained him in the basement when he was a teenager and his sister secretly brought him food. He also told my mother that his father used to beat him. \n\nBut around the time my parents seperated, he suddenly started arguing it was all his mothers doing. However his sister was a witness back then and saw everything that happened. Plus his father (my grandpa) was always very shady. Eventually my father disowned my grandma first, so his sister and my grandma disowned him as well.\n\nMy grandma keeps saying until today that if he gets help with his psychological problems, changes and comes back on his own will, she would acknowledge him again and accept him back into the family with open arms. \n\nJust that my father will never do that because he keeps dwelling on the past that he made up with his own mind. It's pretty obvious because he also keeps twisting things concerning my mother where I obviously trust my mother way more than him.\n\nTL;DR My father disowned his mother (my grandma), so his sister and my grandma disowned him as well",
            "My grandfather disowned his daughter-in-law and grandson after my uncle passed. The actual reason given was after my uncle passed, his widow reduced communication between the kid and my grandparents. A few months later, my grandmother passed. Total communication black out. Nothing to acknowledge birthdays, Christmas, nothing. My grandfather would try to call every couple of weeks, on the same day and time he and my grandmother always called them. Never got an answer. Sent birthday and holiday cards to the kid, no response. After about five years of this, he cut them out of the will. Kid only got a tiny bit from my grandmother's will since she still had him in there.\n\nThe woman was not a great person, so while I'm sad my grandparents lost contact with one of their grandchildren, I'm glad the last few years of his life my grandfather didn't have to deal with his son's widow.",
            "Oooh I can definitely answer this, but from the other side of the story. \n\nMy father has always been hotheaded and violent when I was growing up. I always dreaded coming home and as a result, I couldn\u2019t wait to be done with high school. I then moved out at 18 and have been living on my own since. This did not stop him from sending me long lecturing texts, calling me several times a day to check where I was, getting verbally aggressive when I don\u2019t pick up the phone fast enough, and nearly getting the police involved when I was attending a school banquet because I wasn\u2019t back at my dorm by 7pm, or leaving absurd long comments on my Facebook profile pictures about how to be a dutiful daughter. \n\nAt the beginning of this year, I introduced my long term boyfriend to the (both immediate and extended) family. I let my parents know that I was planning a 2 weeks long Europe trip with my bf 2 months in advance. That. Really. set my father off. He wrote me a letter, recorded me an audio, yelled in my face through gritted teeth at a public restaurant, and told every family member that he was extremely ashamed of me.  He explained that I was born to serve my parents, and doing this (going on my trip that I paid for without asking for his permission) is no different than betraying the social norms and displaying to the world how disrespectful I am of our culture. He has since cut all communication with me. I\u2019m 25, Asian female, independent, working toward admission to grad school btw.",
            "A cousin of mine was disowned by his parents and the rest of the family. He was a real piece of shit and did numerous things that eventually culminated in him getting disowned. Some of the things he has done:\n\n-got involved with a loan shark that was also linked to a gang. He owed some serious money and it got to the point where family members were being threatened by either beatings, stalking, or even kidnapping kids. Thankfully his dad is a well respected man and a successful businessman and brokered a deal. The piece of shit didn't think anything was wrong with what he did.\n\n-He molested and abused co-workers at his father's company. This lead to some long trials and eventually it was agreed that the family would fire him because he was too much of a liability. \n\n-He has abused his family name and family status against authorities, friends, and family to get what he wants. He dragged his family's name through mud and even tanked business relationships because of it.\n\nThose are some of the things he's done that were big. He has a list of other shit that even I may not know of or that are smaller in scale and caused problems for his direct family and relatives. Eventually his dad gave him some money, a car, and a one way ticket to the US. Told him if he thinks he can make it and thinks that he (his father) is holding him back, then he can go. Haven't heard from him in almost a year now, but some shit occasionally crops up regarding him.",

            "NOT ME but,\n\nThe son had a serious knee injury at age 16 in the late 90's.. when the new opiates were being sold as the amazing  non-addictive pain meds for all ages. I personally think he came out of the double knee surgery addicted. After that he fell into drinking, pot, and opiates whenever he could get them. \n\nHe begged, borrowed, and stole to get percodan, vicodan, hyrocodone. Moved out at 18 because his parents were interfering with his life too much. His mother was out of town on a business trip and he kicked in her front door, stole all her jewelry and anything else he thought he could sell or trade easily.. at age 19.\n\nRehab'd at divorced parents expense, all sorts of favors called in to get him into a vocational apprentice program. Did okay for a few months, until he stole the general contractor's tools from the warehouse to sell/trade for opiates.\n\nTo protect themselves, his siblings, and the family friends he's basically disowned.  Everyone has been warned to never let him into your house, car, or place of business for any reason. \n\nIt's been an education. \n\nYou can't fix an addict.

            "I have technically, I guess, disowned one of my siblings. Older sister, four years older, who created more trauma and grief for me growing up than anyone has fully realised as I was never able to fully explain or voice it.\n\n\nWe're part of a big family and I remember turning about 9 or 10 years old and it appeared she suddenly had such an overnight distain for me. She was vaguely sisterly beforehand, I can briefly remember. But past the age of 9/10, she just appeared to despise me. Absolutely hate me. \n\n\nThe only thing I can think of as a cause looking back now all those years later is either she had a strange jealousy of my closeness to our father, or perhaps it was a simple case of her being angry/unhappy of our parents divorce and I was weak and quiet and an absolutely easy target. \n\n\nIt started off small, just her being short with me - possibly normal behaviour for a girl transitioning into her teens. But it slowly got vicious, whereby she'd purposely wind me up to the point of tears and grin quietly when I got so upset and would lie with absolute ease about it. I was so shit at voicing myself that I'd get upset then give up so my mam wouldn't really persue it. Also by that point she seemed to be getting very good at being aggressively manipulative. I remember once we had a small argument (NOBODY knows about this) and she was sitting down at the top of the stairs at the time\n\n\nI remember she said hurtful shit to me and I was very young and I went to walk down the stairs to cool off and I distinctly remember her glaring at me, then sticking her leg out just as I passed and I flew down those stairs. How I only ended up with a little mark I have no idea. I remember her panicking and \"comforting\" me whilst telling me not to tell our parents. Of course I didn't. \n\nIt started increasing then as I got into my early teens. Just general mocking me silently and sneakily so that my parents wouldn't notice. Would laugh at the way I dressed (I went through a goth phase lol). So many fuckin lies about me and I just never understood. \n\n\nAnd then when things got really bad with our parents divorce I internalised massively. I started to secretly self harm (not anymore of course) when I was 13. By aged 14 my older sister noticed.\n\nPerhaps that could've been an opportunity for comfort and advice and safety.\n\n\nShe laughed at me. Told me I wasn't \"as ill as she was\" and for me to cut deeper next time. I remember truly feeling alone and desolate by that point. Not only was I getting mercilessly bullied at school for that and for all other reasons but home was no longer safe either. \n\n\nThen me and my mother had an argument and my mam told me to leave when i was 16 (she says she regrets this now (we're much better these days and I've never stopped loving my mother). Anyway my older sister surprised me the day I was thrown out. I was crying ofc and she actually...comforted me? I remember being so confused by that lol. She said not to worry just leave as our mother had said etc. It was oddly nice and alien to have that.\n\n\nA few days later our older brother calls me shocked to hear I've been thrown out. He asked why - I explained we had an argument and she threw me out simple as.\n\n\nHe then called me back angry, telling me that's not what really happened bc he talked to my older sister (who was there comforting me at the time) and she said otherwise. And long story short that started an argument with my older brother and I. We haven't been right since.\n\n\nSpeaking of, I've watched as older sister has brought my older brother to tears...she once even accused us both (I was around 14 at the time) of having an \"inappropriate\" relationship because we were \"close\". Fuckin disgusting.\n\n\nOver the years (I'm 26 now) she has does a LIST of small, painful things to me. Directly at me. About me. The things I've had to find out that she's spread about me to dumbed down family members who buy into her bullshit. The hell it's brought me the isolation the loneliness. The anger the injustice!!!! Nobody believed me and she fucking got away with it!!!\n\n\nShe did once tell me when I was a teen that I'd amount to nothing and never get a job. I'm halfway through my postgrad with a good job in therapy and she's been unemployed for ten years living at home whilst I live with my partner. \n\n\nSpeaking of, she even tried it with my boyfriend. Tried antagonizing him but unlike her, he's direct and basically told her to fuck off. Lol.\n\nOf course she ran him down to the idiots who'll believe her every word.\n\n\nMan I legit do not have the word count to explain the details of every cruel, personal, vindictive thing she has done to me. Hacking into my FB account and posting shit about me. Things like that. And nobody ever ever stood up and told her to fucking STOP. JUST STOP.\n\n\nWhen I needed mental health support I was absolutely utterly alone, young and vulnerable. Now I'm older and I work with vulnerable children I can't believe I am still here. She rubbed salt in my wounds and smiled. And got fuckin away with it too. I don't know how she has no guilt, none at all. How could she. I was a kid. A self harming loner kid who got bullied tf out of and struggled in school. I remember through all the rubbish going on, I landed myself into some boy trouble and once again, she mocked me for it. Laughed at me. But when she laughed after she discovered I had been cutting myself...well I still can't understand that one. She didn't know I'd been hiding it for a year or so by that point. She just found it hilarious. I can't bare going into the house I once grew up in knowing she's there lingering about. \n\nShe's not just been this way to me, however. I firmly believe to this day she directed the majority of it to me, yes. However I am very sure the more I study psychology and the more I work first hand with personality and mood disorders, that amongst the genuine illnesses she has, she absolutely has a form of a personality disorder too. I've seen her do things to others too. \n\n\nMost people around her simply excuse all of this behaviour with 'awh she's not well bless her'. I was fucking unwell at one stage in my life and I wouldn't have dreamed treating others like that. And yet I still got kicked out!\n\n\nLol I genuinely haven't thought about her or her bullshit bullying in so long. I'm so far away from it now and so freed...OP, your question got me riled up lol. \n\n\nTo anyone else out there who's had to cut poison out of your life...it may suck at first but god you heal so much quicker from it. Ive never said out loud how deeply she affected me. How much I carried it all with me. How for so long I truly allowed her to infect me and burrow into my skin. How she turned so many of my uncles aunties my own grandmother against me...and all for what!! Power control? One thing I can say is it nearly broke me, I've had many wobbles since but now I have started to truly appreciate life more than ever and be grateful I'm still here and thankful for my other siblings who have good, true hearts, who I adore with all of my heart. I'm sorry for her in some ways sure. But my sympathies don't stretch that far when she almost truly broke me and I was a fucking child. Shame on her. Others may never find out and that's fine I don't need them to. I know what truly happened and so does she.\n\nIn fact, despite not talking to her now for only a few years I know she's in the past sent me strange messages via reddit. She made such an effort to burrow under my skin that she used to look for my diaries when I was younger. I was so lonely and confused and hurt that I'd pour my heart out in my diaries. Anything from how I felt about myself and hatred or even confusion such as sexuality or whatever. Anything that popped into my head I thought I finally found a safe release. Nope.\n\nShe would snoop, read my most intimate thoughts then announce it to me and laugh and mock me and crush me further. I also remember writing how I totally thought I was bisexual (simply young hormonal confusions) however she of course found that and read it. One evening me her and my mother were watching TV and I always remember this. She looked directly at me, smiled, then looked at my mother and said \"hey did you know mollypop is bisexual?\" And just watched as I squirmed and as my mother looked dumfounded considering I was approx. 13. I hated her so badly for that. It was the smirking and smiling. \n\n\nChrist I better stop now otherwise I'll carry on all night \ud83d\ude02 I have kept an awful lot of this in. Oddly enough I truly barely think about all this or think about her much anymore as I know she has no power anymore. However it's interesting to think these things. It does remind me I've come a long way on my own. All she has against me is just...angry words to gossip with others I guess? That's it now. Hey you might even be reading this right now. If so...why? What else is there left for you to gain now? Aren't you done already?"

A week later I was sent to the hospital. A week passed by and I was slowly getting worse, I didn\u2019t care about my hygiene anymore. Another week passed by, nothing helped.. I felt like this just didn\u2019t work for me so I asked if I could leave. They (the workers) said no. I didn\u2019t understand because I thought if you voluntarily entered the hospital and wasn\u2019t in any danger to yourself or anyone else, you could leave whenever you wanted to... but no. So another week passed by. I was desperate at this point. I started to feel suicidal and was begging them to let me out. They just treated me like air, like I was nothing. Occasionally they came in to get out their anger on me. Calling me awful things, and telling me what kind of awful person I was. I started to plan out my suicide and was ready to die at that point because I\u2019d rather die than be locked up in a cell like I was a criminal. After 2 months I got a bad ear infection and just slept on a mattress all alone in my \u201croom\u201dmy parents came to visit me and felt bad for me so they took me with them home, then returned me to the hospital when I got healthy again.. but finally my therapist came to visit me and saw how horrible and beat up I looked and told the workers that I could leave. \n\nIf my therapist didn\u2019t come, I would probably have to be there for a year (until I turned 16) because when you\u2019re 16 you can leave whenever you want.",

From my German point of view the two party system and electoral votes is seriously fucked up and even the moderate democrats are pretty right-wing.\nAlso, the recent handling of protesters and even the media, combined with Trump seemingly preparing the notion that the election will be rigged and he might not accept it, really feels like a third world country going back to a fascist regime.

            "Have you tried turning your country off and then on again?",
            "Roosevelt said that hungry people are the stuff of which dictatorships are made. Obama said 'democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn\u2019t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.'\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis revealed to a lot of people that the economic and political systems were rigged against them. The 'American dream' had turned into a nightmare - low wages, insecure employment, expensive housing, ruinous healthcare costs, unsupportable student debt, tax cuts for billionaires, poor public services, a social safety net that's full of holes too easy to fall through, crumbling infrastructure. You can't buy a house, but they can buy a Senator. \n\nThe Occupy movement was an initial response to this feeling - a resurgence, after 40 years of anaemic identity-driven liberalism, of a social-democratic, economically-left, agenda in US politics.  The billionaire class was ruffled, and put its resources into stopping it: the first manifestation of that was the Tea Party, an astroturfed far-right libertarian movement that set out to stop Obama in his tracks in the 2010 mid-terms, and succeeded. However affable and statesmanlike Obama was as a head of state, he could never drive through a domestic, economic policy agenda that would make a difference to working people. \n\nIn 2016 people were offered a choice between more of the same (Clinton II) or someone who would break a system that did not seem to be working (Trump). Folks in critical rust-belt states chose Trump. Some of them were no doubt racists and xenophobes. But we forget that underneath all the hateful rhetoric and coarse despicable antics, Trump in 2016 made the right noises to reach out to these people: he promised - although without any intention of delivering - to rebuild infrastructure and create jobs. This allowed some to overlook his flaws (I don't think he can pull the same trick twice, but we'll see). \n\nTrump is just the front-man for powerful economic interests who want to asset-strip a dying America. His job is to keep up the anger and the hate and the division, while others destroy what is left of public service provision - the postal service, education, environmental regulation. It's all alt-right in presentation, oligarchic capitalist in substance. \n\nThere seems to be no limit to how far the billionaire class will go to protect its economic interests, or how low their enablers will stoop to ensure that the blame for the pain experienced by the working class is shifted towards the outsider - migrants, minorities. \n\nI feel as if the integrity of the American soul, and with it of the Republic, is at stake - if the political system cannot be turned back towards some notion of a shared common good and public interest, then it is only a matter of time and opportunity before it spills out into a second civil war. Trump losing the election but refusing to accept the result and leave office could be enough to trigger that.\n\nIt's a mess. But here's the thing: the US Constitution itself is not blameless. Its built-in blockages - from the electoral college to the misapportionment of the Senate and the timing of mid-terms - have made it very difficult for government to deliver on its promises. A country with a parliamentary constitution - like Canada - would have had single-payer healthcare decades ago. It is in the inability of the government to act decisively for the public good that frustration and alienation arises, leading to what we see today.",

You've gone from slowly solving race problems to making them a billion times worse (and it's spilling over here), anyone that doesn't agree with you is either a Commie or a Nazi (depending on which side of the aisle you're on)\n\nIt's fucking insane.  My admiration for America has seriously dwindled.  I hope you come out of it.  I want to admire Canada's big brother again, not be scared of it.\n\nAnd no I don't blame trump.

            "I just read through some of the comments, and I am probably a bit less shocked about the current situation than most. But a few things that still has surprised me:\n\n- Some US citizens still defend your insanely expensive healthcare system. In spite of being in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. \n- Some US citizens treat being told to wear masks as being stripped of all their basic human rights.\n- Black lives matter (edit: the organisation) is a [spiritual movement involving praying to ancestral spirits](https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/life-examined/religion-slavery-black-lives-matter/black-lives-matter-blm-melina-abdullah-hebab-ferrag-interview), according to (among others) one of the founders. Which really surprised me, as I thought it was a pure secular organisation.\n- Many don't see the potential power of strong worker's unions. Which could give the working poor a liveable income. And give all workers paid sick leave, including those who have had to go to hospital with Covid-19. (Edit: spelling)",

            "Shock.  Horror.  Anger.    \n\n\nI'm in the Army.  I'm a Citizen.  I love this country while recognizing all of it's problems.  I love her regardless, and I love her enough to stay here and try to change them, to help my fellow Americans.  I'm an actual Patriot; not a nationalist and I get that because I'm a recovering MAGA douche.    \n\n\nI was about 'the emails.'  \nI used to stupidly think Pres. Obama wasn't an American.  \nI wanted to Make America Great Again.  \nI wanted to Drain the swamp. (Granted, we need to, but not like this).  \n\n\nI remember 2016 me letting 'Grab her by the Pussy' and jokes about a man with a disability and the sexual assault and the Trump Legacy of ripping people off and the funneling money from a child's charity and just...everything that he is, which is a horrible human being from a (mostly( horrible family. (I listed to Mary Trumps Book.  Jesus jumped christ what a dumpster fire).  I accepted all this because 'Hillary.  Benghazi.  MAGA.  Drain the Swamp.  Get rid of the Individual Mandate.  Gut ObamaCare.  And frankly I rode that ignorance all the way through to, frankly, the firing of Ge. Mattis (Ret).  \n\n\nAnd then I started to read, and study and watch and listen and it's like that scene in most cartoons where Wiley Coyote realizes the anvil is coming and he can't stop it.  And the more I discovered, the more I lost friends because I 'didn't support the President and everything he does' or because I wouldn't fall in the 'Republican line.'  The republican line hasn't been that since Teddy.  At least.  At this point, JFK is more of a Republican than anyone who wears the Red Pin these days.    \n\n\nAnd then the Pandemic hit.  And I think according to my friends, who are no longer my friends, I went full 'Socialist.'  Why do we not have Universal Healthcare?  Why are we not paying teachers more? Why are we not introducing UBI?  Why are we paying companies to imprison people?  Why have administrations going back to Clinton separated families at the border?  Why can't we BALANCE THE GOD DAMN BUDGET?  As a member of the Armed Forces, I will scream until my lungs fall out that we need to CUT military spending.  Jesus christ we are the military but slowly we're turning into Boeing and Co's sugar daddy.  Why are we 21 Trillion in debt?  Why are we 26 TRILLION in debt?  How can we deploy the DHS in blank uniforms to snatch American citizens up in Vans?  How have we let those bad cops go as long as we have? How are we letting Police Unions basically become the Praetorian Guard of the 20th Century? Who is Guarding the Guards?  \n\n\nI'm honestly just lost and shocked.  I love America. I  will die for this country and this flag and it's people if I need to.  But I sit around every day reading the news or looking at the paper or just listening to people talk, not just Americans, but immigrants and people who live in other countries. And I don't know where to start.  People expect America to be better.  They expect us to build big things, to lead the world in regards to the fact that if America isn't around, China and Russia and Iran and other actors are just waiting to fill the gap.  It makes me hurt to hear my friends in the EU say \"We're worried about America.  You're America!  We expected more.\"  I'm not hopeless, but I'm lost.  I couldn't even figure out WHERE to begin.  I'm a Citizen, and I swore to defend this country.  I will not MARCH against my fellow Americans, I will not do a lot of things people think I do because 'MAGA.'  But most of all, I'm fearful of the blind nationalism that has overtaken some of my millennial generation, and the generation before us.  \n\n\nAmerica needs help.  But there is no country, or military that can help us.  We need to help ourselves and I'm afraid that the 'Karens' and 'Kens' of my parents generation, or too fat, stupid, and ignorant and would happily sit on the tip of the Titanic because 'It's not my problem I'll be gone.'",

It\u2019s not a recent thing, probably had its roots post WW2. The US realised it had the power and technology to rule the world to its own benefit and it went for it. The golden years of the 50, 60s and 70s have been followed by thinly disguised corporate and personal greed. All of this on top of a 2 tier difficult to crack race ceiling that in some states is allowed to persist unchecked. \n\nThe US is now in a pretty open rolling low level civil war, fuelled by a an idiot that the GOP is allowing to rule because they just want to cling to the status quo of the military industrial complex. Trump is an Emperor, with his princess and princes. Everyone with any insight or brains can see it, but there are a lot of supremely uninformed Americans in the Rust belt, the south and parts of the north who have been fed the line from Fox and Facebook that he is their saviour. \n\nMost of the West is happy to let America sink, tired of Trump and the US\u2019s decades of foreign policy meddling. \n\nFor Russia it\u2019s an old game for them, easy and cheap social media manipulation which is not discouraged by the GOP. \n\nFor China they are cleaning up.

The people that (peacefully) protest this violence are met with accusations of being unpatriotic and are suddenly on the receiving end of violence and murder, while other people think that is not a huge problem by itself. Which leads to more protests, which leads to more violence.\n\nAnd everything on top of a pandemic in which the US successfully show the world how an uncontrolled regime just drops the ball on every possible occasion and then there are so many people that just moronically state that the virus doesn't exist. That people are to blame themselves when they are shot by the police or shouldn't protest if they don't want to get hit with something, led by a president don't just seem overwhelmed but seems like he doesn't care (quote \"it is what it is\") and it all makes it look like the US is filled with stupid people which I know it's not.

To see a once great nation plunged into chaos and insanity, being ripped apart by a disease that is going unopposed, and is even supported by the country\u2019s own President, and many citizens.\n\n\nMy country is going well all things considered, but I\u2019m a bit scared that it\u2019s going to make its way to us. We\u2019re protected by a thin border and border patrol really. The American tidal wave could be disastrous to us if we let them through. We need to keep the borders closed for non-commercial travel. \n\nI\u2019m also a wee bit scared that they\u2019ll export their stupid politicians and political radicalism to us, but that\u2019s besides the point. Here in Canada, you see populist conservative Doug Ford working together with social democratic PM Trudeau to solve the virus issue in a unified effort. In general our politics is much more civil and calm. Meanwhile in America it\u2019s protest and riot central, and the Federal government can\u2019t even unify  itself, Nevermind the nation, to deliver an effect response. \n\nI really hope that long-term we won\u2019t find ourselves emulating them in this area.",

            "The story of Daniel Inouye, a WWII vet and later senator from Hawaii. His story reads like a bad, over the top action movie.\n\nAs soon as Japanese-Americans were allowed to enlist, he dropped out of med school and signed up. Within a year, he became a sergeant and headed a platoon, getting deployed in the Italian campaign.\n\nIn the battle to save the Lost Brigade, he was shot directly above the heart, saved by a silver dollar kept in his pocket. He was promoted to Lieutenant, the youngest officer in the regiment.\n\nIn the battle of San Terenzo,  he led from the front.\n\n>As he led his platoon in a flanking maneuver, three German machine guns opened fire from covered positions 40 yards away, pinning his men to the ground. Inouye stood up to attack and was shot in the stomach. Ignoring his wound, he proceeded to attack and destroy the first machine gun nest with hand grenades and his Thompson submachine gun. When informed of the severity of his wound, he refused treatment and rallied his men for an attack on the second machine gun position, which he successfully destroyed before collapsing from blood loss.\n\nHe stood back up.\n\n>As his squad distracted the third machine gunner, Lt. Inouye crawled toward the final bunker, coming within 10 yards. As he raised himself on his left elbow and cocked his right arm to throw his last hand grenade, a German soldier saw Inouye and fired a 30mm Schiessbecher antipersonnel rifle grenade from inside the bunker, which struck Inouye directly on his right elbow. The high explosive grenade failed to detonate, saving Lt. Inouye from instant death but amputating most of his right arm at the elbow (except for a few tendons and a flap of skin) via blunt force trauma. Despite this gruesome injury, Lt. Inouye was again saved from likely death due to the blunt, low-velocity grenade tearing the nerves in his arm unevenly and incompletely, which involuntarily squeezed the grenade tightly via a reflex arc instead of going limp and dropping it at Inouye's feet. However, this still left him crippled, in terrible pain, under fire with minimal cover and staring at a live grenade \"clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore.\"\n\n>Inouye's horrified soldiers moved to his aid, but he shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. As the German inside the bunker began hastily reloading his rifle with regular full metal jacket ammunition (replacing the wood-tipped rounds used to propel rifle grenades), Inouye quickly pried the live hand grenade from his useless right hand and transferred it to his left. The German soldier had just finished reloading and was aiming his rifle to finish him off when Lt. Inouye threw his grenade through the narrow firing slit, killing the German. Stumbling to his feet with the remnants of his right arm hanging grotesquely at his side and his Thompson in his off-hand, braced against his hip, Lt. Inouye continued forward, killing at least one more German before suffering his fifth and final wound of the day (in his left leg), which finally halted his one-man assault for good and sent him tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge. He awoke to see the worried men of his platoon hovering over him. His only comment before being carried away was to gruffly order them back to their positions, saying \"Nobody called off the war!\"\n\n(From wikipedia)",
            "The Marathon at the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis.\n\n* The first place finisher did most of the race in a car. He had intended to drop out, and got a car back to the stadium to get his change of clothes, and just kind of started jogging when he heard the fanfare.\n* The second place finisher was carried across the finish line, legs technically twitching, by his trainers. They had been refusing him water, and giving him a mixture of Brandy and Rat Poison for the entire race. Doping wasn't illegal yet (and this was a terrible attempt at it), so he got the gold when the First guy was revealed.\n* Third finisher was unremarkable, somehow.\n* Fourth finisher was a Cuban Mailman, who had raised the funds to attend the olympics by running non-stop around his entire country. He landed in New Orleans, and promptly lost all of the travelling money on a riverboat casino. He ran the race in dress shoes and long trousers (cut off at the knee by a fellow competitor with a knife). He probably would have come in first (well, second, behind the car) had it not been for the hour nap he took on the side of the track after eating rotten apples he found on the side of the race.\n* 9th and 12th finishers were from South Africa, and ran barefoot. South Africa didn't actually send a delegation - these were students who just happened to be in town and thought it sounded fun. 9th was chased a mile off course by angry dogs. Note: These are the first Africans to compete in any modern Olympic event.\n* Half the participants had never raced competatively before. Some died.\n* St. Louis only had one water stop on the entire run. This, coupled with the dusty road, and exacerbated by the cars kicking up dust, lead to the above fatalities. And yet, somehow, Rat Poison guy survived to get the Gold.\n* The Russian delegation arrived a week late, because they were still using the Julian calendar. In 1904.\n\nSeriously. This needs to be a movie. \n\n(If this sounds familiar, I'm reposting myself)",

She was already so skilled with the sword at this point in her life (quickly surpassing her new lover) that audiences sometimes would not believe that she was actually a woman. In fact, when one drunken onlooker proclaimed loudly that she was actually a man, she tore off her shirt, providing him ample evidence to the contrary. The heckler had no comeback.  \n>  \n>If La Maupin had one overriding flaw, it was an allergy to boredom. In fact, she soon dumped the wandering swordsman, pronounced herself tired of men in general, and seduced a local merchant\u2019s daughter. The merchant, desperate to separate the two, sent his daughter to a convent \u2014 but again, our heroine found a loophole. La Maupin joined the convent herself, and started hooking up with her intended in the house of God. Shortly into their convent stay, an elderly nun died (from unrelated causes, it would seem), and La Maupin reacted the same way anyone might: by disinterring the body, putting it in her lover\u2019s room, and setting the whole convent on fire.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>Her behavior amped up even more when she became an opera singer \u2014 basically the rock stars of the day. In true theater major fashion, she alternately fucked and fought her way through her stage contemporaries, and audiences loved her for it. Three stories of her time in Paris:  \n>  \n>1. \u201cI, alone, have architected your ass-beating!\u201d Another opera singer named Dumenil started talking shit about a number of women, including La Maupin. She responded by ambushing him, pushing a sword in his face, and demanding a duel. When he refused (on the grounds that he was a wimp), she beat him with a cane, stealing his snuffbox and watch. The next day, she caught him complaining that he had been assaulted by a gang of thieves. She called him a liar and a coward, threw his watch\u00a0 and snuffbox at him, and declared that she, alone, had architected his ass-beating.  \n>  \n>2. One night, while out carousing on the town, a particularly ardent man named d\u2019Albert began crudely hitting on her. She\u2019d just finished singing for the crowd, and he let loose with the one-liner \u201cI\u2019ve listened to your chirping, but now tell me of your plumage\u201d \u2014 a come-on which I take to be the 17th-century version of \u201cdoes the carpet match the drapes?\u201d She was, shall we say, unimpressed. In short order, she got into a fight with him and two of his buddies, won, and ran her sword clean through his shoulder. She felt a bit bad about that, so she visited her impaled victim in the hospital and hooked up with him anyway. Although the relationship only lasted a short while, they were apparently lifelong friends.  \n>  \n>3. She attended a royal ball (thrown either by Louis XIV or his brother) dressed as a man. She spent most of the evening courting a young woman, which earned the ire of three of the woman\u2019s suitors. When La Maupin pushed things too far and kissed the young lady in full view of everyone, the three challenged her to a duel. She fought all of them \u2014 outside of the royal palace, mind you \u2014 and won. According to some accounts, she actually killed them.

Who is on what side is too complicated to even say, almost everyone switches sides, France is supporting two different side at one point. \n\nWhy? Because they have Uranium, and a lot of it.\n\nSo this is a mess, and who is suppose to help clean up the messes of the world? The UN of course, so UN peacekeepers are sent do their thing. Pretty much totally unprepared of course.\n\nSome of the soldiers sent are Irish. Ireland had yet to fight a war as an independent country, they didn\u2019t have scores of WW2 vets like everywhere else in the world. So their soldiers were not exactly high regarded or very ready.\n\nSo 155 Irish soldiers are sent to protect an area in the Congo. They\u2019ve got rifles, machine guns, and some light mortars. Not much, but they aren\u2019t suppose to do any real fighting.\n\nBut just in case, the commander has them dig defenses around the perimeter. The previous UN troops hadn\u2019t, but it was better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThen comes the mercenaries of one of the competing Congo states, Katanga. Many of them are French and Belgian, veterans of WW2 turned soldiers of fortune. There are also a substantial number of native cannon fodder under their command. There are in total about 4000 of them.\n\nThey attack when the Irish at Sunday mass, but this attack is driven off. Just like the next one. \n\nAnd the next one.\n\nDespite having more men, heavy mortars, aircraft, and actual military experience, they can\u2019t seem to beat the bloody Irish.\n\nEven the jet fighter sent to dislodge the pesky Europeans was met with a hail of machine gun fire when it got too close.\n\nThe Katanga use under handed tactics, like a false white flag suppose to be for collecting dead.\n\nBut no one can survive a siege forever. They are surrounded and cut off. Reinforcements and resupply can\u2019t get through to them.\n\nThe whole situation had gone to hell on an international scale, the Secretary General of the UN has been most likely shot down flying to the Congo to try solve this issue. Other UN troops had resorted to tactics of WW2, some thought too harsh by the world for the situation they were employed.\n\nThey had lost much of their ammunition to the bombardment when the shed they kept most of it in exploded.\n\nDuring the last attack they had set traps and let the enemy get close before detonating them, because they didn\u2019t have the firepower to stop them anymore.\n\nThen their commander was shot by a sniper. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fatal wound though.\n\nBut they were completely out of options. No rifle bullets. No mortars. No grenades.\n\nThe men had come to what they saw as a obvious conclusion; they would just have to use their knives next.\n\nBut their commander said No.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t have his men die for what would be an inevitable defeat anyway.\n\nAnd they surrendered. \n\nIt made the situation more difficult internationally, as there were now prisoner to worry about and the shame of the UN being defeated.\n\n**But every single Irishman survived**\n\nThey took out probably hundreds of the enemy.

            "The destroyer USS Willie Dee was assigned to an escort mission during WWII to take FDR to French North Africa for a meeting with Churchill and Stalin. \n\nThe crew was entirely incompetent.  Upon leaving Norfolk to meet up with the task force, they forgot to retract their anchor and hooked the ship beside it, shearing gear, life boats, and railing off of it. \n\nOnce in formation in the Atlantic, FDR (aboard the USS Iowa) requested a demonstration of how the task force would respond to a German submarine attack. The exercise started with depth charge drills. A depth charge was left unsecured and armed on the deck and ended up rolling off the deck. It exploded, sending the task force into a tizzy, making them believe they were under attack. Once it was made evident it was an accident, they started torpedo drills. \n\nThe Willie Dee during the exercise used the USS Iowa (the ship with FDR on board) as a practice target. They conducted the drill, but ended up firing a live torpedo at the USS Iowa. \n\nUnder strict orders to maintain radio silence, the USS Willie Dee sent a signalman to the bridge to communicate through light Morse code that the Iowa had a live incoming torpedo. He accidentally communicated that the torpedo was headed in the other direction. Upon realizing his mistake, he attempted to correct the message, but reported incorrectly instead that the USS Willie Dee was now headed full steam in reverse. \n\nWith time of the essence, the USS Willie Dee decided to break radio silence and informed the USS Iowa of the incoming torpedo. Informed of the danger, FDR requested to be wheeled up to the deck to watch. While on the deck, the Secret Service drew their pistols and tried unsuccessfully to shoot the torpedo. The torpedo barely missed the Iowa after it had conducted an emergency hard turn. The torpedo exploded in the Iowa's wake.\n\nThe Iowa, fearing an mutiny and assassination attempt had just taken place, turned their guns on the Willie Dee and told it to leave the formation. The Willie Dee sailed to Bermuda and upon docking in port, all crew members were arrested by armed Marines. This was the first and only time an entire US naval crew has been detained. \n\nOnce it was determined the episode was an accident the officers were reassigned and the ship was redeployed to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. There while in port, a sailor got drunk and fired a main gun shell, with the warhead landing in the front yard of the base commander who was hosting a dinner party for officers and their wives. \n\nWith the war in its climax, the Willie Dee was sent to fight in the Western Pacific. There they shot down a Japanese kamikaze. It hit the water but was going so fast it floated under the ship and blew up. No sailor was killed. \n\nAll of this was declassified in 1958. For the rest of its time in the US Navy, it was hailed by other ships with \"don't shoot, we're Republican!\"\n\nTL;DR\nA US Navy destroyer damaged another ship by hooking it with its anchor, let a live depth charge roll off its deck and explode, almost killed FDR with a torpedo, fired a shell at a navy base commander's house, and was damaged by a submerged kamikaze.

            "I was the fat kid in the class growing up. Technically the second fattest but since I was also the poor kid, I was the fat one. In third grade I was given the gift of another poor kid. He was awesome to me. He lived a couple streets away. I had a friend. (Call him PK)\nIf we hung out at school we would get picked on gang style, with everyone shooting verbal and physical jabs. So we would hang out separately in school, make the bullies split up. We did this for years. Unconsciously almost. We never developed this plan. It formed organically for survival. \nIn sixth grade we started football and this kid who had parents that owned a bowling alley (Ill call him BA)  invited all the guys to his house for a sleepover. Surge. N64. Call some sex hotline and hang up. Normal boring shit. I hated these kids and BA. I was, surprisingly good at football, and I remember thinking that I like deserved to go. I'll fit in. We all play football. Blah blah. \nI hadn't spoken to PK about this sleepover since we didn't talk about the other kids. Even though he played football I figured PK wasn't invited or wasn't going. \nGet to the party. Sleeping bags. Space jam posters. Finished basements. Potpourri. Entire team shows up. Even the lone Hispanic kid. No sign of PK. \nThree hours in Im sitting with no one, letting my tum digest way too much local pizza.  Doorbell. PK and his mom. She drops him off. He comes down to the living room. We make eye contact and both look confused. He looks scared, unsure. He parks his bag on the other side of the couch, away from me. \nThe kids didn't make fun of him. They didn't tease or poke him. They got him pizza. They gave him the phone for prank calls. Laughed at his jokes. Were interested in his ideas and thoughts.  Showered him with compliments and handed him drinks. It was insane. I couldn't comprehend what this was but I was young and happy that I was being ignored and he was having a good time. \nAround 2 am they all woke each other up and They ambushed him. They beat amd kicked PK through his sleeping bag. Eleven kids stomped on him, grabbed him, pinned him, spit on him. Some put oranges in pillow cases and whooped him with them. He just screamed. Crying STOP. Over and over. Please. I still fucking cry when I think about how scared he was. They didn't wake me up. I wasn't in on the plan. I woke up too late. There were too many of them. I was a fucking baby. I'm still wrecked I didn't do more. \nFinally stopped after maybe five minutes. BA's mom comes down. Lightly scolds all the boys. PK is bleeding and bawling. Calls his mom. She picks him up. He gets home. \nWhole thing was fucking awful. \nHe switched schools the next year and we met back up in high school and we were friends throughout. I have never talked to him about that night. Probably never will. He grew up to be an awesome man and an incredible human. \n\nTL/DR Jocks invite poor kid to party. Nice to him until he fell asleep.

She was actually a really nice person, she just didn\u2019t feel the need to rebel like most kids.\n\nShe went to a party with lots of booze and drugs and didn\u2019t do any of it.  She walked around with a coke can.  Some of her friends decided she was too stuck up for her own good and needed to \u201cloosen up\u201d.  They figured if they could show her what she was missing, she would join them so when she went to the bathroom, they slipped something in her drink.\n\nShe ended up in a coma for over ten years, brain dead, until her body finally gave out.  Her parents paid for private care all that time in hopes she would eventually wake up.  Before you ask, no, they never found out what was slipped into the drink.  They tested the coke can (but who know if it was really the one she was drinking out of) and declared it was a rare reaction to presumably a street drug or possibly a stolen prescription drug.  The \u201cfriends\u201d did not seem to know what they had actually slipped her.  Thought it would just be something to loosen her up.  One got it from someone who got it from someone who got it\u2026you get the picture.\n\nFucking completly ruined a beautiful life just because she didn\u2019t act exactly the way they wanted her to.\n\nEdit:  Because several asked, no I never did find out what, if anything happened to the kids who did it.  This was around 35 years ago and things were often kept hush hush.  I can imagine even more so in this case since it was an affluent area and a lot of kids drinking and doing drugs at someone\u2019s house.  Most of what I know I heard the varioud adults talking.  I was a very quiet child and it was not unusual for them to not notice I was there.  Hell the doctor started talking about stuff while we were visiting her in the hospital.  But I never did find out about the kids.  We moved away about a year later and I did ask my Mom some years later about it but she didn\u2019t know either.",

He looked shocked for a moment and then sheepishly said that it was just a prank. Next break his two friends came over to my desk to laugh at me. I wasn't bothered by their words, just sad that the first time I thought I was wanted was only a prank. That weekend I ended up looking over all my life choices and getting depressed. About a month later, I no longer gave a shit about anyone's opinion on me and my 'rebellious' phase started. It lasted about two weeks, I gained 'friends'. Then the lockdown hit and none of the 'friends' tried to send a message or anything to make sure I'm alive and ok.

Being conscious and stuck in place while observing every second of every minute of every day for even 20,000 years would be torture. 1 million years would sap you of all sanity. It would be unfathomably torturous. This is at least 3x longer than the modern human species is known to have existed.

            "Think about the idea of being locked somewhere populated like NYC. You get to see the best and worst of humanity, milling about like insects on the sidewalk as they go about their daily lives. You\u2019ll see it all, friendships form, relationships begin, thrive and fail, random acts of kindness and of evil. You get to watch humanity evolve.\n\nBut then the inevitable end happens. Humanity falls just like all species inevitably do, and the bustling cityscape slowly changes from a crowded statement of humanity\u2019s progress to a ghost town, the city itself becoming an empty and lifeless husk just like the bones of its former residents. Time moves forwards as it always does, and you get to witness something that no one else ever will, the slow but unrelenting progress of the natural world. Life overtakes the decaying corpse of a long forgotten civilization, inch by inch, gradually consuming this relic of the past and returning it to a state reminiscent of the way it was before humanity had taken over.",

            "I lived for a long time in different places around the world, and something that I really missed when moving to a new town was the lack of a US-style bar where it was easy for a stranger to meet people. Outside of the US, it is rare to find  a bar where everyone just sits and faces the same direction, whether or not a sporting event was playing on the television.  Instead, they have a more 'pub-like' environment, where everyone is sitting in groups at their individual tables.\n\nThis makes meeting new people extremely difficult. Think about it,  with the \"table-style\" bar, in order to strike up a conversation with a stranger, you literally have to approach them while they are sitting at their own table with their own friends. It's almost impossible to not look like a total freak! In a proper \"Cheers\" style bar, you can just say some random phrase to the bartender and if the person sitting next to you wants to talk, they'll just join in on the conversation. \n\nBasically, In non-US bars, if you aren't invited ahead of time by someone, you are damned to sit alone in some corner of the bar.",

Nope. I was forced to walk on minor-to-fairly-large roads almost all the time. I had people call out to me from their gardens to ask where I was headed and reply with incredulity when I told them it was about 10 miles away. I had a lovely old woman almost hold me hostage and force me to let her give me a lift to my destination because she couldn't understand that I genuinely preferred to walk and I wasn't trying to get to help from my crashed car or something. I had a really nice policeman pull up in his car next to me and ask me where I was headed, if I was lost, if he could give me a lift - he laughed at me in a these-foreigners-are-crazy sort of way when I said I was alright.

            "Travel, especially at an early age. I came from a very small south Texas town filled with exactly the kind of people that description probably calls to your mind. Luckily, my parents loved to travel, and almost always brought me along. I also went on one of the People to People student ambassador trips when I was in highschool, that took me to several European countries, along with kids from a couple of other states. It was through all these experiences that I got to meet people from all walks of life, get new perspectives, and most importantly, take a good hard look at the kind of person my town was turning me into. I firmly believe that without getting to travel and amass these experiences, I'd probably have ended up as the exact kind of hate-filled townie that 70% of my graduating class ended up as.\n\nIn an ideal world, everybody would have easy access to travel from an early age.

            "I was living on my own in an apartment for the first time, and one of my first investments was a sheet (100 doses) of acid. I was gobbling them up at an insane rate. Tolerance builds pretty quickly to acid, so by this point I wasn\u2019t seeing acid-y things anymore, but I was thinking acid-y thoughts. \n\nLike for instance, I wasn\u2019t taking trash out because I thought my building would see me hauling out a bunch of trashbags and think, \u201cThat dude\u2019s got a lot of trash! He\u2019s a dirty dude!\u201d And that then they\u2019d either kick me out or call the police on me, so I opted instead to let the trash pile up around me.\n\nI also thought I was going to be a writer for The Simpsons.\n\nAnyway, it all came to a head about two months into my heavy acid use. In about eight weeks I had eaten about 80 tabs of acid. I was feeling pretty fried, and I was trying to make myself some pancakes. I had this plate that was covered in pancake batter and I thought, \u201cMan, fuck this,\u201d I gave up, and threw the batter covered plate into the dishwasher and turned it on.  I heard, **CLICK** **CLICK** *gurgle* *gurgle* *gurgle*. \n\nI walk over to check, and find that I\u2019ve broken the absolute shit out of my dishwasher, and now there\u2019s black water pooling up at the bottom of it.\n\nThe new paranoid thought was that my building would charge me to replace the dishwasher. I was freaked out, until I had a master stroke of genius, \u201cWhat if,\u201d I thought, \u201cI just throw away all my dishes?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d asked the last rational part of my brain, to which acid brain responded, \u201cHear me out, hear me out, here\u2019s the plan. Step one, we throw away the dishes. Then, when the apartment building asks, \u2018Did you break your dishwasher?\u2019 I can get real indignant and say, \u2018*What?* Break my dishwasher? You fools! I don\u2019t even **own dishes**!\u2019\u201d And then I threw away all my dishes. That was several years ago, and I still haven\u2019t replaced all of them.\n\nEDIT: I wish it'd occurred to me yesterday to use this to plug my stand-up comedy, [but for anyone that thought this was funny you can watch me do stand-up here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrzV5W9uQsQ)\n\n\nSUB-EDIT: I've officially done the filthy business of going through each comment telling me this was funny (and one guy who said it wasn't funny) and plugging my stand-up.

It felt like I was on a different plane. It felt like I was having a stroke. \n\nSo then my question became, *who is Eric?? And who is scamming whom??*\n\nThe popular theory in the store was that Eric was essentially a method actor, doing research for a book or script. I came close to asking him about it a few times, but I was so afraid that I was wrong. I imagined myself over and over asking, \"Are you a method actor, or are you really and truly this stupid?\" It just wasn't something I could bring myself to risk. I wonder about him all the time, actually, and who he might be terrorizing today.",
            "When I was an intern, there was this old shrew who would call people into her office (my cube shared a thin wall), gossip, then call those people in to tell them what was said, etc. \n\nShe would try to frame people for shit she did wrong.

            "My worst co-worker was one I worked with when I was a cashier at Walmart. She approached me and asked me to cash out her paycheck. I was still new at the job and never got training on how to do that function. She was sympathetic, so she walked me through how to do it. Transaction over and done, I go on about my day.  \n I get called back a couple of days later by my managers and they circled me in an office and accused me of stealing. After tears, video tapes, and telling them what happened they told me that apparently this coworker of mine had stolen not only from me, but several other people that day as well. They just wanted to confirm I wasn't in on the deal.  \n\n\nFuck Walmart, and fuck that bitch for almost getting me arrested.",
            "No contest.  It was the literal crackhead I worked with for 4 months that was also secretly living in the office and being completely nonsensical when he was actually \"working\".  We found a mattress folded up in the warehouse after he was let go and an actual, brand new crack pipe (with a price tag on it, to boot) squirreled away back there.\n\nHe and his family (not just him living in the office!) left discarded food everywhere like pizza crusts in the toilet brush holder in the bathroom (wat even) and they left hair in the sink in the bathroom as they were obviously bathing in there, too, as we had no actual bathing facilities in the office.\n\nOne day during his tenure, he sent an e mail saying his alarm didn't go off and he'd be in at x time, which kept getting moved back later and later.  He eventually showed up at 4:40 pm and we closed at 5 pm, lol.  See comment above about secretly living in the office.\n\nThere's so much more I could go into; it was a wild 4 months, that's for sure.\n\n\\*Edit- this blew up in a way I did not anticipate and I've gotten a few responses that I'm making this up, but let me tell you, I really \\*wish\\* that I were.\n\nHis girlfriend was always around at work and she would move in a way that you would absolutely never see her face (we thought maybe she had a warrant out for her arrest or something).  I think only one of us saw her actual face and she would also sit behind the warehouse bay door in their Nissan Altima, with it running, all day (for the A/C) when she wasn't back there with him.  He wanted us to hire her to help him, which wasn't happening.  Our warehouse area was concrete flooring which didn't get cleaned often at all and she'd walk around back there BAREFOOT.\n\nAs mentioned before, he was completely nonsensical at work as well; he suggested to my coworker, who scans our old documents to PDF via a feeder on our copier (of course), that she should take a picture of each page with her cell phone and do it that way.  I got multiple e mails from him that made no sense at all and I eventually had to just forward some to my boss so he could see what was going on.\n\nIt was a sad situation, but also a WTF situation for the rest of us.  He brought his gf to the interview and asked if she could sit in on it because it was so hot outside.  Now, if we didn't have a Wal-Mart and a huge shopping center within spitting distance, that might have made sense, but that was pretty unprofessional and they STILL hired him.  All we did was lose money by employing him.  He worked on one pro-bono job we did and managed to fuck that up.\n\nThis was at an engineering firm, by the way.",

            "For a few summers in high school and college I worked as a groundskeeper at a large hotel complex.  As a seasonal employee, I was paired up with the year-round full time groundskeeper during my shifts and then he and I would work alternate weekends. He retired suddenly when I was at school so by the time I returned for the summer they had hired a replacement. \n\nEd was a lateral hire, having previously worked in the hotel\u2019s kitchens. He was in his 50s, but based on his maturity and intelligence he wasn\u2019t more than a teenager. I heard some rumblings about him being a little off but didn\u2019t pay them much mind since I knew I\u2019d be spending the whole summer with this guy and didn\u2019t want to go into our relationship with any preconceptions about him. \n\nThe first thing I discovered was that he was dumber than a box of rocks. He used words he didn\u2019t know the meaning of so of course they didn\u2019t make sense the way he used them. Whenever the subject of music would come up, he\u2019d never fail to mention that he didn\u2019t like \u201cthat rap crap bullshit\u201d (fifteen years later and I can still hear him saying that phrase). He laughed at the dumbest little things. He put an ice cube on my seat in our golf cart (which we used to get around the property) and I\u2019d sit on it, notice it instantly, and stand up and brush the seat off. Wouldn\u2019t even get my pants wet. But he\u2019d laugh his ass off as if it was the prank of the century.\n \nOur golf carts had roofs on them. It only takes one time to bang your head on it in order to avoid doing it again. But not for Ed. The first time he hit his head was a doozy. He had to stand there crouched over for a few minutes to regain his composure he whacked it so hard. I felt really bad for him. A few days later he did it again and I was again concerned. But it became a weekly occurrence. My reactions went from concerned to confused (how does this guy keep doing this???) to amused. By the end of the summer I would lose my shit laughing whenever he hit his head. There was no other way to react than to laugh. If this guy didn\u2019t learn the first dozen times he hit his head then there was no hope for him. \n\nOne time Ed was helping the boss move an extension ladder. They lifted it up and put it on the roof of a golf cart. The ladder was longer than the cart so it stuck out both the front and the back sides of the cart. No sooner did he place his end on the roof, he turned away, then turned back, and walked face first into the ladder EXACTLY WHERE HE JUST PUT IT. My boss asked him if he was ok, but then as his mind processed what just happened he asked Ed how he ran into the ladder he just put there. \n\nHis immaturity was the next thing I noticed. Sex jokes/comments at a frequency that made me think I was back in middle school.  One day we had these iron stakes in the back of the cart. We were driving around and Ed grabbed one of the stakes and let it drag on the ground (like you would a stick on a fence as you walk by to make noise), making a scraping noise on the asphalt. It was annoying AF. I asked him to stop so he lifted it up, waited ten seconds, then started dragging it again. I again asked him to stop, which he did again and restarted shortly after.  That particular day I wasn\u2019t in the mood for his bullshit so I just stopped the cart in the middle of the street, took the key, and walked away. He ran after me and begged me to come back and that he wouldn\u2019t do it again. Fortunately he didn\u2019t. \n\nMy coworkers told me stories about how he was on the days I wasn\u2019t there. More of the same. Constantly tripping over stuff, falling down stairs, banging his head. They eventually started referring to him as Homer (Simpson) because he was such a doofus. \n\nI could feel myself getting dumber every day I spent with him. His childish antics drove me insane. By the end of the summer I had had enough. I decided to find a new job for the following year because I knew I couldn\u2019t spend another summer with him. \n\nLast I heard Ed got injured by getting his arm stuck in the cardboard bailer and couldn\u2019t work for several months. How he did that I will never know since you can\u2019t turn those things on unless the safety gate is closed so it\u2019s not like it was running when it happened.  He ultimately was never medically cleared to return to work so I don\u2019t know what became of him. I was Facebook friends with him when I was in college but got sick of all the candy crush and farmville invitations from him that I just unfriended him.",
            "It's my time to shine! Sorry it's long!\n\nAbout 2 years ago I started work as a receptionist in an audiology clinic. So we do hearing aids and hearing tests. The only thing I knew about hearing aids before I took this job was that my grandpa had one.\n\n8 months after I started - so at this point I have 8 months of experience with anything related to hearing - they hired a new provider, who I would later discover knew nothing about anything. Not hearing aids, not basic you-should-know-this-if-you've-had-a-job-ever, not how to handle talking to bosses, patients, people over the phone, etc. \n\nExample: we had one patient who left her hearing aids with us to be fixed. She would call every once in a while to check on them, and I would say \"I'll ask the provider to call you and update you\", which I did. FOUR MONTHS LATER the same patient calls and I discover the provider had been ignoring me every time I told her to call the patient, and she just straight up didn't call her ever.\n\nAnother example: she could NEVER, EVER remember to clock in and out. Ever. It was a daily struggle with her. She would have to send in time card adjustments like every day and then complain to me when our boss was annoyed.\n\nShe didn't know to fill out repair forms so every time we had to send something out, I would have to double check and make sure everything was filled out correctly and legibly- again, she is the provider who is credentialed in this field, and I'm the receptionist who has 8 mos experience with hearing aids.\n\nShe wouldn't do chart notes for weeks, literally. She would have patient charts stacked in the corner of her office for days, forget to make chart notes, put in the incorrect dates, spell the patients name wrong, so I would have to double check every chart before putting it back on the shelves.\n\nIf she didn't know what to do with a patient (which was common), she would just do nothing. So I would have to pick up ALL of that slack, deal with the patients, take their complaints, talk to manufacturers over the phone. There were even times where I had to recommend hearing aids to patients because she just wouldn't.\n\nShe would constantly forget to have patients sign paperwork. I would put a post it on the chart \"PATIENT MUST SIGN\", I would tell her beforehand, and yet she would STILL let them leave without signing purchase agreements and medical waivers.\n\nShe could NOT keep track of the time. She would be going 10-30 minutes over appointment times and I would have to deal with the pissed off patient. I would tell her \"hey time warning\" and she'd say okay and then ignore me. She would keep elderly patients in for her new patient appointments for like 2 or more hours- usually an hour and a half appointment. Sometimes patients would have to tell her they needed to leave because they were tired or their feet hurt. These people are in their 80s.\n\nAnd the best: everything that went wrong was my fault. She would blame me for her poor job performance, her inability to retain patients and sell hearing aids, everything. \n\nAfter 6 months of this I finally spoke up. I hadn't said anything up to this point because she was a really nice person apart from work and I felt bad for her. But everyone has their limits, and also our company was starting to zero in on her because she wasn't making them any money.\n\nShe was put on daily zoom meetings with our boss and trainers. When this happened they finally realized why she was making almost zero money (she was suuuuper incompetent obvs), and they fired her. They told her they were shutting down the clinic altogether, but instead they hired a new provider with loads more education, experience, someone who is confident and young and knows how an iPhone works.\n\nThe only thing I got from this experience was a 30 cent raise (at the end of the year) and a major increases in my anxiety med dosage. Also I guess I learned a lot about my job lol. Also the new provider and I are BFFs so my job is much more enjoyable.",

He was a visiting researcher from another country, and he spent a lot of time asking tons of non-work related questions, to the point of disrupting others' work. In the course of a year, he designed one very basic experiment, and didn't actually do it. Just designed it. He was above doing bench work apparently. He picked fights with everyone doing any experiment related to the one he was planning, because he didn't want to have to share credit for anyone. He wouldn't clean up after himself, wouldn't pick up things from the floor. He actually called me in from another room because he wouldn't take a string-less tea bag out of his mug. Also on a different occasion, because he'd knocked some things off a hanger on the back of the door and for whatever reason wouldn't pick them up. It was kind of like working with a child. He must've had servants where he lived. I don't know how but he was there for his PhD. Boss fired him. He was one of two people in her 30+ year career that she'd ever fired. \n\nedit: 90 messages, woah. In the interest of not inspiring/reinforcing any stereotypes, I won't name the country.

            "I worked at a grocery store and one of the scheduling ladies was a total C-bomb.  When you work at a grocery store you expect to have shifts all over the place, that's part of the job so i'm not complaining about that.  Just about 2 years into working there i had an accident and broke my thumb/hand (not while at work unfortunately lol) and needed surgery.  I went to apply for Employment Insurance (EI) and they required a Record of Employment (ROE) so i asked the woman in charge of that (the aforementioned scheduling lady) if she would mind sending that off so i could still pay rent while i was off work recovering (btw she told me she already had).  So i go back to the EI offices and they told me they still had no ROE so i go back to my old work and ask her a second time, this happens until i asked her to do it 4 times.  This resulted in me having to borrow money from my parents for christmas in order to pay my rent.",

After sharing with another coworker that I was planning to go to school to become a vet, she (the receptionist) laughed at me and said \"I don't think I could see *you* as a vet.\" I was only 16 years old, mind you; I had big dreams and goals, *and* I was taking solid steps towards achieving them. I remember standing there, taken aback, and honestly holding back tears or any indication that I was upset.\n\nI was accepted to vet school at age 18, and I am still in school actively pursuing that dream. Guess I\u2019m gonna prove her wrong.\n\nEDIT (to clarify): I was accepted into an Early Entry Program for vet school! That is how I was accepted at 18.

She was fresh out of college and believed that she was smarter than myself and our other team member because of that. She totally discounted anyone's opinions except her own and one manager that let her do whatever she wanted. She was the worst one-upper than I'd ever met. Even for stupid things, like going to a coffee stand, she'd chime in and say how her friends work at a coffee stand and they know her order by heart. Just stupid stuff. She thought she was adorable and charming but was incredibly grating and worthless. She constantly messed up on her job but if you tried to help or give any constructive feedback, she'd cry and go to her wet nurse (aka the one manager that liked her.) She lasted almost four years, which blew my mind. She was furloughed at the beginning of Corona, but will not be returning as her position is being taken by the owner's daughter. The company split about two years ago, I went to the new company and she and awesome dude stayed at the old one.",
            "In the interview... something along the lines of \"you're quite young, how do we know you'll be responsible enough to work with our team?\" (As if she was running an Olympic team and not a fast food joint. I know this is not an unusual question but her attitude spoke more than her words). Well I was technically homeless, a young teenager at the time, staying in a shelter. I explained this being my motivation. I needed a day program, wanted a permanent place to live, and some day be comfortable enough financially to go back to school. \n\nBefore I was homeless, I had amazing grades in school, volunteered with the red cross and a few other organizations, babysat for many families, had my babysitting course and first aid training. So it wasn't as if I had a terrible resume. But she talked down to me as if I should be kissing the ground she walked on, just because she provided me with an interview. \n\nWell a week or two went by and I didn't hear back from them, so I assumed I didn't get the job. Third week I get the call and was told to come in later that week for training. Once again, such attitude, she didn't ask, she didn't offer, she demand I be there. Well I had gotten another job, but was more than willing to work two jobs, to achieve my goals. \n\nMy very first day, on my very first shift, I was given the most basic instructions. Read the employee handbook, then come get her. It took me no time. She was adamant I was illiterate because I was so quick, so I must not have read it. She was pointing to random words getting me to read them. It was annoying... but goals... homeless and all. \n\nShe walked me over to a till, put me in a headset, and told the other woman at the till to make me do all the work. I tried my best, but zero training on ANYTHING,  no guidance, on a weekday lunch rush in an industrial area, it went bad, fast. Mid order she grabbed my arm and dragged me into the office. She berated me for a solid 10 minutes on how I was just some pathetic disgusting homeless scum with no manners, no wonder no one wanted me, no wonder I was homeless, how pathetic, honestly, it makes me cry thinking about how cruel and harsh she was. She had no idea I was homeless because my parents were beating me, starving me, neglecting me... no. She just knew I was this young homeless piece of shit. I took it. Not a fucking tear in front of her. I knew if I cried... well let's just say had I had a therapist then I would have been diagnosed with battered women's syndrome much sooner. I knew not to cry. \n\nFinally she was done. I took off the headset, went to the staff room to change, grabbed my stuff and left. No one said a word to me, I just left. \n\nOnce in the parking lot, just far enough away to be in the same  lot, but in front of another business. I fell to my knees and began crying. Rage crying, sobbing, crocodile tears, full on breakdown... you know the kind, it feels like you won't ever stop crying. \n\nSomeone came up to me and put her arm around me. I just cried in her arms. When I was done, I finally saw who it was. It was the assistant manager from the exact place I just left. I was flustered and furious and embarrassed. She just looked at me and told me \"MANAGER is a bitch. So much so she is actually being fired this week, and I will be promoted to her position. What she did was so wrong. If it's okay with you, I would still like to hire you. I think you would be a great asset.\" We had a brief discussion about the current manager, how the owners would hear about what she had done to me, and if I still wanted the job she would contact me later in the week to arrange a schedule for me. \n\nI went in that Saturday, met the owner's before a staff meeting where they introduced the newly promoted manager, explained the previous manager had been let go, and introduced me to the team. I was offered the job, with a slight wage increase (I think minimum wage was around $2.25/hr and I was given $2.45/hr). \n\nI worked there for nearly 10 years. I got my high school diploma, went to collage, literally became an adult there, and worked my way up the chain of command. Well as high as I could since the manager was so incredible the turnover rate was crazy low.\n\nLiterally, my best and worst bosses of all time at that place. Being almost 25-30 years ago, obviously no FB and I haven't kept in touch with much of the crew. But some days I think back on that place. The staff, the customers, the friends, and hope they are all well.  \n\nSorry for the long story.",
            "It's funny, but I don't have a single worst person as much as a worst...archetype? At every single job I've had, there has been a middle aged woman who's been there a ridiculously long time and complains about literally everything. Just belly aches nonstop. Every new thing is an unnecessary imposition. Every day is a titanic struggle. She moans. She pouts. She grumbles under her breath. She's not nearly as good at her job as she should be after having done it for 25 years. She shares inappropriately detailed information about her personal life, whether that means who she's dating, her health problems, or her out-of-control teenaged or adult kids. (It's always at least one of those though.) She usually also openly defies the bosses but nobody will really do anything about her because she's been there longer than any of the management and somehow they're all kind of scared of her. Makes no sense.\n\nBut there's been one at every job, no matter what kind of job. I've worked a lot of different jobs since college in a lot of different fields. Every office, every warehouse, every coffee shop and call center has this person. No exceptions. \n\nI've come to the conclusion that this kind of person is inevitable, and somehow integral to every workplace in some way that I can't grasp, in the same way that mosquitoes are important to an ecosystem in ways you wouldn't understand unless they went extinct. And you wish fervently that they would go extinct when you're covered in itching welts after an otherwise lovely evening at the park, just like you wish fervently that goddamn Linda in accounting would just shut up and go work somewhere else if she hates it here so much. But there's an ecological niche that has to be filled. So even if she did put her money where her whiny ass mouth is and leave, a new Linda would ascend. Whoever was the second most tenured and jaded would take on the mantle and invite all the new hires out for lunch on their first day to \"tell them how it really is around here.\" \n\nIt's just the way of things. Not for me to know why. But there has to be one. At this point, I think if I ever got a job and didn't encounter this person, I'd spend weeks with an uncertain sense of dread about something I couldn't articulate, because a workplace where nobody stirs up drama like it's their job would feel wrong.",
            "Had a supervisor that LOVED to chew ass and harass.

            "I worked in a place similar to YMCA. They hired a tramp/gym coach who was great at those things. But Somewhere along the line she also picked up reception shifts. She was also dyslexic. \n   \nThis meant I would get emails I couldn't read with phone messages for obviously wrong names and phone numbers without enough digits or when I called them turned out to be wrong numbers. \n   \nThe workplace was too scared to move her off reception in case it was discrimination. There was plenty of other work to be done, she didn't need to be fired or anything. \n   \nSo instead of taking a job, that wasn't meant to be her job, off her, the rest of us had to cop abuse from upset clients because we weren't going to blame her mild  disability for us not calling them back.",

No one - and I mean literally not a single one of my other coworkers - likes the guy.  \n\nHowever, he's a family friend of his division manager who hooked him up with the job. Someone once complained about the coworker to that division manager, and that person got dressed down for doing so, so now no dares say anything.

And why was I here?\n\nThere was one lady. A blonde mom (she told me so) in her early 30\u2019s. I was ringing up her items, mostly groceries. When I felt that pang in my stomach.

But since he's been coding in a vacuum with these people, nobody knows how shitty he is. They have nothing to compare it to. They just think that's how things go - that normal coders don't paginate tables so it takes 4 minutes and 2gb of ram just to load a page. Because of that, and because he shits on any progress I try to make engineering wise, he makes more than me, will be listened to more than me, and I have no way to move past him.

If you binge and overfill your tank, it doesn't do anything (you excrete it out as waste), and you can't expect to go the next several months without gas just because you tried to overload it before. You're going to still need to get gas. Same goes for your fruits and veggies.\n\nHad someone tell me he went vegetarian for a few weeks, which meant he was done for the year.

Prevention is becoming more and more important in medicine, and treating a disease in its early stages is a lot better than catching it late. If you have family members who had ovarian or colon cancer in their 30s, that is very significant for your own risk. The screening and tests we run might change, depending. If you want to start the pill, it's important to know about breast cancer, DVTs, clotting disorders in the family. If you're a bit overweight and have no metabolic syndrome problems in the family, compared to a bit overweight but both your parents have type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the management priorities change. Asking your family about any recurring diseases or diseases that occurred early (20s, 30s, maybe 40s) can be helpful. \n\n\nThere are certain common conditions that are underdiagnosed but easily fixed.

But people don't bring it up because they don't want to be a bother, or think the symptoms are too vague. It's not a bother, and often (but not always) these conditions have simple treatments which can really improve how you feel.",

When you don\u2019t get regular checkups and take regular care, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll notice something bad happening right away. Just like how you won\u2019t notice a missed oil change a couple thousand miles later. But diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, alcohol dependence, etc, they all sneak up on you. Just like how eventually, that engine won\u2019t run as smooth. \n\nThe second thing is that your body isn\u2019t like a TV remote, where you pop out the old batteries and put in some new ones. You can\u2019t expect to come into a hospital and walk out feeling 100%.

It\u2019s not drugs. It\u2019s not surgery. 50% of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics do not require anything more than diet and exercise. Cessation of smoking is the second best thing you can do for your health, and every little amount you decrease smoking has a profound impact. Again, you won\u2019t see it now, but you\u2019ll see it down the road (like the oil change). And if you do need meds (like how most will eventually need meds for their blood pressure), don\u2019t play around with it. Take it every day. Hypertension is called the silent killer. You can\u2019t really feel your blood pressure. But it\u2019s slowly damaging every artery and every organ in your body. \n\nAnd that comes down to the last point. Exercising is the key to a better life. If you put in the work, there is no upper limit. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, but the findings of a landmark paper that made news everywhere last October.[Not exercising is worse than smoking, diabetes, or coronary  artery disease. ](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2707428). It is the single best thing you can do for a healthier life. \n\nYour health is a shared responsibility, and we\u2019re here to help. This may not be the flashiest Reddit comment. But this one may actually save your life.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nEdit: so I\u2019m getting a lot of great questions on what are good exercises and how long should you be exercising. This is probably the single most asked question I get from my parents friends and random strangers. Unfortunately it\u2019s a bit complicated. I could go on quoting tons of papers from a variety of sources, but that would be difficulty to parse though. An exercise regimen should ideally be set by at a medical professional specifically for you. It may vary based on your age, occupation, underlying health conditions, fitness goals, etc. I couldn\u2019t give a 60 year old with COPD the same instructions as a 25 year old. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say something in a reddit comment that would end up hurting you or your loved one, so I won\u2019t go into specifics. The generic advice we give to our older patients is to \u201cwalk at a brisk pace, enough for a mild sweat\u201d. There is some evidence to show that even normal walking can significantly help improve your cardiac health. I\u2019m only focusing on cardiovascular health here, and there are other things to consider with exercise. I don\u2019t want to sound annoying, but I really feel it\u2019s best you talk to your doctor about what else you can do to improve your health. We\u2019d be glad to walk you though a plan made specifically for you. \n\nAlso, regarding number of steps per day. The [10,000 steps  number is unscientific and largely propagated by the pedometer making industry ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39041576/10000-steps-a-day-is-a-meaningless-fitness-goal-says-science). First it should be age adjusted. It also doesn\u2019t directly correlate with losing weight. However, personally, as someone approaching 30, I do like 10,000. It\u2019s a nice clean number and I can make a game out of it for myself. It is important to note that this is not for everyone.",

            "That the immune system is an incredibly complex and nuanced organization of cells that communicates readily to destroy anything deemed hostile within the body. It helps explain why vaccines are supposed to work, why allergies come and go, and why transfusions/transplants are hard to successfully pull off.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people are asking how allergies work, so here is a brief explanation using pollen (allergic rhinitis) as an example:\n\nYour immune system senses pollen in the body. It doesn't appear to be one of your cells, so the B-cell collects samples of it, relays it to a Helper T-cell, which in turn helps specialize the B-cell to become one of two cells: effector and memory cells. Effectors mass produce antibodies, while memory cells are reserved for future invasions (this is why initial exposure to a new substance may not necessarily trigger allergic responses - the signal is still weak as the immune system is still acclimating to a foreign particle). Antibodies flood the pollen particles and signal for basophils/mast cells to release histamine, the hormone responsible for inflammatory responses. This is where the runny noses and sneezing come into play (and for more severe allergies, anaphylatic shock).\n\nAllergies may fade out overtime for several reasons. When exposed to a non-threatening level of an allergy for a long enough time, the body decides that it's not really a threat anymore. Furthermore, as people age, the immune system weakens, making it harder to detect and overreact to allergies.",

            "I'm not an MD, I'm an RN. Here's some real advice: do not let yourself grow old and obese. I will forgo any talk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes; that's inside stuff and while I'm well educated on it, I want to talk of the outside stuff that will make your life miserable. I'm talking arthritis, skin breakdown, lack of hygiene and the depression that goes along with it. \n\nThe arthritis starts because your bone structure is in no way designed to carry 3 to 4 times the normal body weight. The joints wear down, the bone spurs develop, the spinal stenosis kicks in, and you find that every movement is an orchestra of multiple different minor but irritating pains all shooting off at once. You can't get out of bed or up from a chair without several body parts giving out little screams of pain. You will get used to it, but you will not like it. And you will start moving less and less; you'll start weighing the decision to get up and go do some social activity versus the pain it will cause you and at some point, the pain wins out and you start going out less and less. In the most extreme cases you will start to alter how to go the bathroom or clean yourself because a trip to the toilet and all the maneuvering it takes will just be too much. \n\nAs you start to move less and less, you start to clean yourself less and less, and the skin excoriation and fungal infections start to form in your various folds and crevices. You also have trouble fully wiping after a bowel movement, or you spill a little on yourself as you've adapted to using urinals instead of the toilet. Eventually your lack of movement and inability to clean yourself and exposure to bodily fluids leads to various ulcers that are painful and take a long time to heal. In the worst cases you can get a pressure ulcer that doesn't go away, is constantly exposed to fecal material, an infection starts and you eventually go septic and end up in the ICU. \n\nSo with this lack of movement and ability to fully clean self comes the obvious result of just smelling bad. I'm not trying to be an asshole here, but the lack of hygiene will cause friends and family to avoid coming over, or going places with you, or just having any social contact beyond a phone call. The isolation will escalate, the depression will increase, your world becomes smaller and smaller and you just hate yourself for the trap you're in. It sucks but other people can only take so much. \n\nAnd on top of it all, even at rest, you won't be comfortable. You can't breath properly when sleeping so you get a cpap at home, and while that takes care of properly oxygenating yourself while at rest, the aching joints and muscle spasms will prevent you from ever having a satisfying sleep again. You will always be tired, this just exacerbates all the problems I just mentioned.  \n\nAnd in the end, severe depression. Severe self hate. Feeling trapped in a body that's become a prison and at your age there's no way out. You're isolated, you're alone, and the friends and family you do have avoid visiting. When they do come around, you have to either ask them for help with all the things you've neglected to do because you physically can't (which they start to see coming, so they up and leave or just don't come by at all), or you just sit their and have a sad conversation that dances around the elephant in the room that is what's become of your life. It's sad, just all around sad. \n\nSo I didn't write this to be an asshole, I wrote it because I see these types of people in the hospital and in home care regularly. In America the obesity epidemic is so prevalent, and it affects every aspect of a persons life. Obesity is a prison cell in and of itself. Now as an RN and as a human being, I'm not trying to judge you for why it happened, it is what it is, but please if you are seriously overweight or obese, now is the day to start doing something about it. Do not wait any longer. Do not hope for a magic cure. Do not deny what is happening. Make the changes, you are worth it.\n\nedit: thank you for gold. I want to really make sure that my post is not causing anyone shame or giving them regret or anything negative. My intention is just to be real about something I see daily and wish I didn't. I myself am no paragon of health, and in my teens, 20s' and early 30s' I ate and drank like a beast and my body paid for it.

            "Not a Dr. But l do have some advice. \n\nIf you're ever short of breath and it's unexplained ( not running while being a fat smoker like me)\nGO SEE A DR. NOW.\n\nFor about 4 days prior to this past Christmas (2018) my wife (f29) was short of breath and felt generally crummy. \n\nWe didn't think it was anything but a cold/allergies etc. \nChristmas day she felt worse, didn't move much. So I told her that if she doesn't show improvement by the next morning (12/26/18, yes the dates are important, you'll see why)\nThat I would be forcing her to go to the ER and get checked out. \n\nShe didn't have any improvement. Only worse. \n\nI took her to the ER around 4pm that day. When they took her back and got her hooked up she was at 40-45% O2 saturation. Which is bad. She was then sent by ambulance to the nearest hospital with an ICU. \n\nFor any Dr's in the house, there was about  a golf ball size part of her lungs that showed black on the x-ray, the rest was white........\n\n\nBy 10pm that day she had dropped to 10-15% o2 saturation and was immediately put on a ventilator and was kept asleep for 2 weeks. She was, at most, a few hours from dying.\n\nShe had pneumonia and sepsis in both lungs. \n\nDue to the amount of meds they gave her, and being dehydrated already her kidneys took a hard hit. She had dialysis 6 times in the hospital.\n\nAfter 37 days in the hospital, 14 of which she was in and out of consciousness, she remembers not being able to talk and trying to write some stuff on a paper, she was released.\n\nLast week (July 1st ish) we got blood work back that her kidneys were finally back to 99.6% function.\n\n\nEdit; the good news is that at our local hospital you can check into the ER online and they'll take you back pretty much as soon as you get there.

            "Doctor here.\n\nBeing admitted to ICU is no guarantee of survival. If you have many significant medical co-morbidities (bad heart/lungs/kidneys, dementia, widespread cancer or very frail), your body may not tolerate the invasive measures they use to sustain life. It may not be appropriate for you to be admitted to ICU if you became sick because your chances of recovery with a period of intensive life support are very poor and therefore your doctor may take a more conservative approach and suggest they manage you in the ward environment. As an example, someone with poor lungs is unlikely to be weaned off a ventilator and therefore would become dependent on it and may never leave the ICU.\n\n This would also avoid invasive procedures like intubation, invasive lines in the neck and wrist, which can be very disturbing and aggravating for patients requiring them to be heavily sedated.\n\nSimilarly, CPR has been made very Hollywood on shows lime Grey's anatomy and House MD. It only works on 20% of patients in hospital (and that's the healthy 20% who have relatively good health and well-functioning organs). CPR is chaotic, undignified and fraught with risks e.g. rib fractures and organ injury, and even surviving it may mean you have permanent damage to your brain/heart/kidneys from lack of oxygen while your heart was not beating. Doing CPR is unlikely to be successful in the majority of frail elderly patients and patients with severe medical problems, as they can be allowed a more gentle and dignified death in the company of their loved ones. We can give medications to help with pain, breathlessness and agitation so comfort can be maintained all the way to the end.\n\nMany patients wish their loved ones to have all the care that can be provided for them which is understandable, but as a doctor, this is not always the right decision for every patient. For some people, a more gentle approach does the least harm. Please consider your doctor's judgement and feel free to talk to them about it.",

When he made it to a hospital in Nagasaki he was so burnt a childhood friend didn\u2019t recognise him. Neither did his family.\n\nDespite his wounds he made it to work the next day. He started giving his boss a rundown on what happened, and his boss thought he was crazy. There was no way one bomb could destroy a city. Suddenly, a bright light lit up the room.

Just blood and bits of flesh everywhere, and a cracked and bent grill. I got lucky, so I filled out a report with my company, and took off for a shop to see about fixing the grill, and hopefully a truck wash.\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know, there\u2019s an open weigh station just ahead. \n\nThe DOT officer came out to see me as soon I was in sight, and waved me over to the inspection area. He immediately starts laying into me about why the hell the front of my truck is covered in blood.\n\nAnd I am just laughing. I mean I couldn\u2019t get a single word out, every time I tried to say something, I got a few words out, and just burst out laughing. \n\nFinally his partner starts inspecting the truck, and finds a piece of a hoof. I slowly manage to calm down enough to talk, and we got it all sorted.\n\nLuckily the DOT officer was having a good day, because he decided not to write me a ticket, and let me use their water hose they had on sight to wash most of it off before I took it to a shop to repair the grill.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t quote chapter and verse, but some people are asking, so here\u2019s an answer. \n\nSome states have weird laws protecting wildlife, so if you hit them, you can be fined. I\u2019m pretty sure this for specific animals like eagles, but I also have an ongoing fear of getting tickets every time I get inspected, so that was more of something I was relieved did NOT happen.",

One person was relating the story of her older teenage daughter who, in a manic episode, grabbed a flashlight and took it upon herself to stand in a downtown intersection and direct traffic, until she was picked up by the police and taken to the hospital. (I kind of covered my mouth and pretended I was having a coughing fit and excused myself to go to the restroom)\n\nEDIT: Another person her younger teenage daughter was in the emergency room getting stitched up after an episode of self-harm. One of the nurses was mean and implied she was a waste of space as opposed to the \"real\" patients and said \"You're just doing it for attention, right?\" The daughter, irritated, said \"Yes, now gimme!!!!!\". I was able to not laugh at that one, but it was a close call.\n\nEDIT 2: Younger teenage daughter getting her blood draw (done once a month) to check her lithium levels. Normally she absolutely hated to have it done to her and squirmed and sobbed and even put up  a bit of a fuss, but this time she was kind of super calm and detached and blas\u00e9. \"OK\" mom probably thought, \"getting this thing done is finally going smoothly for both of us\" Then out of nowhere the daughter  asks \"can you please take a few more of those tubes \\[full of my blood\\] and give them to me so I can do an art project?\". The nurse of course said no, and the mom was so startled and mortified she was speechless.\n\n(Lithium carbonate is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder that requires frequent blood testing to make sure the level in a particular person  is between \"effective\" and \"toxic\" because this range is much, much narrower than most medications.\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks for the awards!\n\nEDIT 4: I'm getting  PM's asking the name of the support group.

Difficult job. Bushes and shit in the way, loose rocks. Quite exciting.\nWe get him out, and remove the straps holding him to the basket.

While on the ladder, and halfway through the ceiling panel inspecting an air duct, his loosely secured hammer will catch on the ceiling and fall out of his utility belt. The head of the hammer will land promptly on top of the miniature rubix cube; the weight applying pressure to it in a way it was not designed for. Within less than a milisecond, the cubes will fire in every separate direction that physics and their surroundings will permit. The cube that causes my death will fly in to my open right eye as I turn to see what is happening. With the velocity at which it is traveling, sharp corner forward, it will by some marvel, manage to pierce its way almost all the way to the occular nerve. At that moment I will jump up, and recoiling in pain I will trip over an untied shoelace, cracking my head against the corner of my desk and knocking myself out. The maintenance worker doesn't notice me passed out unconscious sticking halfway out from under the desk, and is wearing noise canceling earphones blasting Pantera, so he has no clue what happened. Because I am alone in the office today after he leaves, nobody will find me until the custodians make their rounds doing the Friday vaccuming and emptying trash cans. At this point, I am still unconscious. I do not wake up from the head injury for another day actually. When I come to, I am in the hospital. The doctor standing over me lets me know that they still need to monitor me, and they have done what they can for my eye. A large bandage covers it now. I look to my left  and through my remaining eye, I see my Fiance getting up from her seat, eyes welled up with tears, and rushing towards me. Fast forward about two months, and I have been released from the hospital for some time. It is about 7pm on a Friday, just after the sun has set. I get in my car to make a last minute trip to the store after having run home to feed our cats, since my fiance is working a later shift. At the second intersection I come across a red light. Once it turns green, I gun it, excited to finally be able to enjoy the feeling of my turbocharged car once again. Just past the middle of the intersection, while I am distracted by my A-pillar mounted boost and AFR gauges giving unusual readings (possible boost leak?), I get anihilated by a runaway semi truck doing about 90 mph that hit me from my right. Apparently the driver had a heart attack at the wheel, lost consciousness, and his foot somehow became wedged against the gas pedal. My lack of peripheral vision in my right eye (caused by the little orange square on the miniature rubix cube), coupled with a distraction ultimately led to my death.\n\n((Boy, it was a stretch figuring out how this one would work.))",

            "Hitman 2. \n\nEveryone already knows God of War is amazing, everyone is already playing Red Dead... Hitman 2\u2019s release was kinda drowned out.\n\nIf you like games made by developers who actually care about how enjoyable their games are, Hitman 2 is for you. IO have even decided to leave in certain bugs/issues because of how fun/funny they are, and how much fans seem to enjoy them.\n\nThere are no micro transactions. There is no in-game currency. All items must by unlocked by PLAYING the game. Granted, there is time-limited content such as Elusive Targets, but I defy you to find a more thrilling, anxiety-inducing gaming experience than when you have covertly assassinated someone in a building full of armed guards and the only thing standing between you and a shiny new suit reward is making it to the exit without being compromised. \n\nIO went through hell to get the game made- they got dumped by their long-time publisher Square Enix but did everything in their power to obtain the rights for Hitman from SE so they could continue to develop Hitman 2- because they love Hitman, and because they had already promised it to players.\n\nThey had to lay off a ton of staff and take some shortcuts such as not animating cut scenes in order to get the game made, but they did it. \n\nIO listened to fan feedback and did away with the episodic format of 2016\u2019s Hitman game. The brought back the weapons briefcase, because fans wanted it, even though they had to rebalance the whole game to make it work. They\u2019ve added tons of features and items requested by fans, and they\u2019ve even designed maps based on what players have been asking for - the Whittleton Creek map being the most obvious example of a map designed purely as fan service, considering it features nearly everything suggested and requested by fans, AND is named after arguably the most beloved mission of the franchise which also takes place in a suburban neighborhood- A New Life (the new one is called Another Life).\n\nHitman 2 is a labor of love, and an example of a developer who cares more about its fans than about making money. They EASILY could have monetized the content in the game- the inventory screens are set up PERFECTLY for micro transactions - but they opted to stay true to gamers. Might even be the reason SE dropped them.\n\nBuy Hitman 2. IO deserves your money and we need to reward their type of business model.",

I'm saying that MHW has DS/BB ish combat. The 'ish' means it holds similarities but isn't the same. Both are action rpgs with a focus on tough boss fights. In both games your move set comes from your weapon choice as opposed to class selection and instead of unlocking more abilities as you level up, you learn the nuances of the weapon you are using. Combat in both series is slow and mediated when compared to most other action rpgs on the market, button mashing will get you nowhere and is completely unsatisfying, instead both games use a stamina based system where timing, positioning and countering are necessary and rewarding.\n2. YES I KNOW THE MH GAMES PREDATE DS GAMES. Some people seem pissed that I would dare use DS to describe MH combat because the MH series predates DS... That's not the point, most gamers know what DS combat is like, MH not so much because until world it hasn't been very accessible to most gamers.\n\nThis thread asked people to post their personal game recommendation of 2018, Monster Hunter World is mine, don't be pissed if it's not yours or you didn't like the game. Furthermore, most of the hate for this game seems to come from DS fans that are disappointed this game isn't DS with a different skin or from veterans of older MH games who's expectations haven't been met with World or think a few hundred hours of content isn't enough. My blanket recommendation is that people should actually learn a little bit about what they're buying before they buy it and complain it isn't what they wanted (it's not like anyone's being forced to buy).",

            "**Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice**. It's a celtic girl's story who suffers of severe phsychosis and who is the sole survivor of the destruction of her village by the raiding vikings. If you ever, ever had suicidal thoughts, suffered from depression or you or anyone you care about have diagnosed or suspected psychosis, you absolutely need to play to this game. Not only to understand the creeping, seemingly unbeatable darkness within many of us that we fight every hour in our real lives, but to help yourself or someone you love to find a way out of it through understanding the experience we go through, to find strenght in yourself. Be prepared that you have to speak english well because turning on the subtitles for this game is a huge no-no. Not only because there is so many sources of voices it's impossible to give subtitles to all of them, but the subtitles as written, linear text is something you mustn't have in this experience. You have to let the voices, the whispers, the screams surround you, become part of you, and immerse yourself in the inescapable nature of it, and something as simple as having your attention focused on a reliable spot on the screen where you know text will appear is something that you don't yet know how important it is, and how important it is NOT to have that minimal sense of safety while you experience this game. It's beautiful, disturbing, heartwarming, horrifying, touching the soul gently and also terrorizing it down to the core.\n\nPerhaps the most important game the industry have ever produced, right next to NieR Automata. Not only it is a cinematic masterpiece with very carefully and thoughtfully handled camera and sound design that all play crucial role in allowing anyone to experience the desperation, isolation, pain and hopelessness of the mental state many suffer from in the real world like Senua in the game, through all these tools it teaches empathy, compassion, strenght, love and communication in a fantastic story that stands on it's own, triple A quality and by no means an artisitic nieche game that isn't for everyone. It is for everyone, it was made with the intention so that everyone can play it to make the world a better place.\n\nIt's not horror by any means, I can't even take the stress of Doom 3, but I had no problem going though Hellblade in two sittings (7-8 hours overall). It will get under your skin in a very different way, it will fuck with your sense of reality within the game to an alarming level at times (which is the point, this is real experience for real people out there) but all I can say without spoilers is don't worry. There is a way out from your darkness too, and you can find it, believe me if I could, you can. No, you *will*.\n\nPlay it alone, play it in dark, and I cannot stress this enough, use headphones.

People behind the bar hear a lot of your conversations, they usually know whats going on before you do. I've had to escort more people than my job required off of the premises.

            "So im a line cook, not bar staff, but at my last job, we had cameras in the bar area (cash register) and i was talking to our night bar gal.           \nShe said a guy had asked for a taxi because he felt dizzy and disoriented, and didn't feel safe, his GF was chiding him , BUT it turns out it wasn't HER that spiked the drink! The cameras caught the guy NEXT to this couple, putting something in his drink, for HIS GF, and he screwed up which one,  because they both had the same drink!       \n So, two couples, one guy accidentally doses a guys drink by mistake!!.  The girl for the dosing guy left without him (apparently he was impatient when it wasnt working). THE WORST PART? We thought he a was cool guy, he was a regular. They caught him next time and called the cops and showed the tapes and last i heard he was being charged with attempted sexual assault....       \nEdited for a bit more clarity",

I walked up to him to see how it was going and he explained while she was in the toilet how much a of a bitch she was being to everyone.\n\nHe came up to me, said how good the whisky was he just had and I knew straight away (he's a beer man through and through) he wanted to bail. I asked him if he would stay if he didn't meet her, he nodded.

Seems normal. They appear to be hitting it off.\nOut of nowhere this gal starts flipping the fuck out, couldn't understand most of what's coming out of her mouth. Screaming about this guy trying to date rape her, phone in hand, threatening to call the cops, involving other women and shit.\nHad to settle this lady down for a sec and grasp whats going on, no dice, won't chill out, she runs out of the bar at full speed and takes of in her car.\n\nNever saw her in the bar again.\n\n I know this guy didnt do anything, but had to talk to cops anyways.

            "I work in small cocktail bars in Sydney, Australia, prime date night joints. We have something called 'ask for angela', where the idea is you just ask the bar staff if Angela is working tonight and that'll be the hint to keep an eye on things or even call a cab.\n\nI've only had one customer, man or woman, ever use it, a nice younger guy on a date with an older gentleman. The issue was threefold. \n\nA venue at the time had quite a few backpackers on working holidays that were completely unaware of this protocol, we had a lovely Chinese girl who went by Angela working that night, and that the date was going poorly in such a fashion that to the untrained eye, it looked like two work acquaintances having a drink. There was that little chemistry between them.\n\nApparently the order gentleman followed the younger in the bathroom and copped a feel, prompting the ask for angela. It was a huge runaround to be honest. It took quite a while for a native English speaker to tune into the argument behind the bar where Angela was explaining that she had no idea who this guy was. So eventually he got some help.\n\nHe ordered two cocktails at the bar, as de if Angela was working tonight, saying she made them the best. We ended up ordering an uber for him while he feigned an emergency, and brought their drinks out in time that the older bloke sorta felt obligated to stay and finish them, just as his uber arrived. \n\nUnfortunately a lot of bars have joined the ask for angela campaign (it's government sponsored), posted the signs in their ladies rooms, and called it a day. No staff training. This is because it puts you on a government list of 'safe bars' and, well, nobody can give up free publicity. Very disappointing. I also believe it needs to better extend to men on poor dates as well, I rarely see the posters in men's rooms, just unisex and ladies.",
            "Not quite the same but I worked in a coffee shop on a busy high street this year and had a similar sort of thing happen. We noticed one customer had come in, ordered, and sat opposite the counter, which meant that he was staring at me and my other female  colleagues for about 30 mins straight. We wondered if he was high as he didn't seem aware of himself, but his gaze was following me as I walked up and down the counter, which was about 8m long. We then closed and the customers sitting inside left, including a very nice, young couple who walked up the street away from the shop, as did the weird guy. About 10 minutes later, the couple came back to the door, which we had locked, and knocked, saying they'd left a phone behind. They came in and told us that the man had followed them for 10 minutes towards their home. So they came back to hide.",
            "Only had one incident of a man using Ask For Angela (UK safeword scheme). Gay kid on a bad date. His date had been extremely overbearing and even having to witness it from the bar was extremely uncomfortable. We smuggled him into the kitchen and out the side door while his date went to the bathroom and called him a taxi. \nDate came back from the bathroom, asked where the kid was, I just went \"dunno\". Date started getting aggro with me, so supervisor ended up throwing this guy out by the collar. \n\nIt honestly doesn't get used enough, by either men or women, especially here in the UK. It absolutely sucks, especially when you as a bartender can't really legally do much or you risk not only your job, but the bar's reputation.\n\nEdit: Just for clarification, the victim was 19. Legal age of drinking alcohol in UK is 18. So yes, he is still technically a kid.",
            "Worked in a pub in Ireland as a bouncer. Not a common thing here to have the 'get me outta here' shot. So no signs or that but there was some Facebook post calling them angel shots that did its rounds. Girls would say they've to go to us and we'd know. No code words or shit. \n\n  \n\n\nAnyway one night I'm doing my thing in this nice bar, and a guy approaches me infront of a group of friend being abit boisterous from a fancy restaurant across the road and he says he needs an angel shot. So we let them in but I hold him there 'questioning his ID' as his friend make fun of me and him as I'm 22, this guy was maybe 35ish and I was a \"kid telling a man no\". So they hang about for him (so I can't ask him what's up) I tell him no he's had too much tonight, I hail a taxi down and he pretends to resist getting in so I basically pick him up and carry him into the taxi. He throws me \u20ac50 into my jacket pocket discreetly and the taxi goes off then. Nothing big.\n\n  \n\n\n2 days later I'm working again same bunch of guys from the restaurant come over. The angel shot guy isn't there.\n\n \n\n3 days later angel shot guy comes but very early and explains it all to me. Turns out his friends where doing coke (all professional people) and a girl was raped in the bathroom. He said at first she wanted to have sex with one of them but then two guys came in, then she wanted out and couldn't, this guy tried to interject but couldn't and then felt uncomfortable and didn't want a part of this so wanted to leave but was told if he did they'd hurt him and the reason they all returned 2 days later was his going away drinks that he didn't attend (obviously). The guys where then charged like a month later? Can't find public info on it anymore. \n\n  \n\n\nOnly time I ever had to use the 'get me outta here' shot.\n\n\nEdit: Use to us\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the silvers.",
            "Not a bar staff, but I have a happier version of this:\n\nMy brother-in-law once had a bunch of friends declare that \"tonight we are getting A drunk\" and that they were going to buy all of his drinks for the night. A (my BIL) is a pretty big guy, careful with his drink, and his friends had never seen him drunk.\n\nTheir mistake was that they let him choose the venue. He chose the (at the time) only cocktail bar in town.\n\nBIL went there ahead of time, explained to the bartender, and asked if he could make a non-alcoholic drink just for him. Bartender agreed, and told him to order the \"House Special\". Non-alcoholic, but with enough flavour and pepper to FEEL like a strong drink.\n\nIt went as expected. BIL had a few beers with his mates, then started ordering Specials while the others drank regular liquor... \n\nAnd that is how my BIL could match everyone drink for drink, and still put everybody under the table. :-)",
            "Not an exact \u201cAsk Angela\u201d, but it happened to myself and my mates  on a night out. \n\nWas out with a few mates and the gf at the time. As my GF went into the bathroom of the club. I sat outside near a table with the boys a few moments go by, i had this guy approach me discretely acting as a long lost mate at first till he said \u201cI\u2019m being harassed and threatened by my ex and her new bf, I feel like I\u2019m going to get bashed can you help me get out of here?\u201d \n\nDude was young and fairly drunk and I didn\u2019t believe him for a moment. Then I saw this big fuck off giant with rage in his eyes staring at him from the dance floor. I walked him away and down stairs flanked by my mates who clogged the stairwell until we got to the sports bar and approached a bouncer. He called through on the radio and got him a cab away home and the agitator and his ex kicked out.\n\nHonestly, just everyone look after everyone. If someone needs help or assistance help them get to staff or help them get to staff. So  they can ask for help or help them leave safely and quietly. It costs nothing and you might help save a life or prevent violence against them.  Just be a decent human/bro and make this world a better place bro.\n\nTLDR: stopped some guy getting attacked by his ex\u2019s new giant bf. The real moral to the story is, Just be a bro to everyone. If we (guys) need help and ask for it (men/women) just help without judging it costs nothing.\n\nIf it was you, you would want someone to help you.",
            "I work occasional shifts at a gay bar, where they don't really have a safeword drink because where would they advertise that without the other party knowing? But there are still other ways that people surreptitiously ask for help, like writing something on the receipt or on a napkin. One guy, probably 19 or so, walked up to the bar and asked if he could charge his phone. When he handed it to me, he had already dialed in 911 (or, well, our equivalent). \n\nAnd I'd say we get someone walking up to the guards or to the bar to complain about a creep at least once a week. Especially when they're pretty young.",
            "Yep, I work in a nightclub in a small city in England in Lincolnshire. I once had a guy who seemed to only recently turned 18, ask if Angela was working (Ask for Angela is a UK scheme that helps prevent violence, sexual assaults and date rape). I knew about the Ask for Angela scheme and immediately I brought him into the glass wash room. Turns out there were a bunch of lasses encouraging this one lass into seducing him, grinding up on him, trying to kiss him and groping him. This apparently continued even after the man had walked away into other parts of the nightclub after showing and saying he wasn't interested.\n\nI had reported this to my supervisor who was a little hesitant at first but eventually called the bouncers into the back room too. We explained the situation to them. Now these guys are basically 200-300 pound tanks who you would expect to joke about this and tell this guy to man up and enjoy it but to my suprise, they took it seriously as well.\n\nThey managed to track down this group (5 women including the one who was doing the grinding) and they escorted all of them out of the building. Meanwhile, a taxi had already been prepared by my supervisor and the taxi firm was literally down the road, so it didn't take long for it to arrive. I escorted the man through the back stairs that continues down to the stock cellar but leads off to the side exit of the building near the bins. A taxi was parked just outside.\n\nIt would be a rare occasion when someone uses \"AskAngela\" where I work, let alone a man so I'm really glad that all of the staff took it seriously and helped as much as they could.\n\nEDIT: Wow! I didn't expect this to blow up. To those curious, it was in Lincoln. Brilliant town for a night out tbh.",
            "I have been manager of a night club in holland for 1.5 years. We got good night out trainings. This is a training that helps you recognize when someone is getting sexual harassment and/or assaulted and how to react to the situation. We would put up the good night out posters all over the venue. So if we miss it, people know they can trust the staff and tell us.\n\nBecause it is hard to really recognize this in a night club we had more people that would go to the bar and ask for help. They would just tell us, we had no safeword. If this happend I was called and I stopped with everything I did and started helping this person.\n\nA LOT can feel as haressment. So we would always take it seriously. First I would try to take them off the dancefloor and backstage so I could sit down and hear their story. After that I would always ask them if they want to press charges. If not they could point the person that was harassing them to me and I would kick them out. If they want to press charges I had to call the police and also try to find the harasser and hold them until the cops arrived.\n\nThis would not happen a lot, maybe once every 1/2 months. Still to much but for a night club it could be a lot worse.\n\nIf someone tells you they are getting harassed always take it serious. He/she already feels ashamed and had the balls to tell you about it.\n\nEdit: The [Good Night Out Campaign](http://www.goodnightoutcampaign.org/)",
            "In our bathrooms, there's an option to ask for \"Angela\" at the bar however these posters are only up in the women's bathrooms.

I noticed this group sat down, one girl with her shoes off all over this guy who was staring forward and tense. Clearly uncomfortable. She was very drunk so I managed to ask if he was okay without her noticing, he shook his head, I radioed for a bouncer and she was removed from the venue. \n\nEven if someone is unaware of the safe word or knows that the person they're trying to get away from knows the safeword, most bartenders and bouncers will try and keep an eye on people and make sure everyone is having a good time.",

Just as the man got in the taxi, the woman he had been there with came running out towards the taxi and yelled profanities, calling the man she had been with \"fucking white trash\" and \"he'll never amount to anything\" and some shit like that.\n\nLast I heard, she was banned from that bar (and several others) while the man who got help became a bit of a regular.\n\nEDIT: This was around 4-5 years ago, so the details are a bit rusty.",

            "I had one really bad date that stands out. I knew the bartenders because I was a regular, she was from out of town (20 minutes away, not far) and when I met her a few things stood out. First off, she was nothing like her ok cupid profile (common thing I've learned over the years, for everyone). Second, she kept talking... like.. idk, saying weird stuff and using weird words like \"it's all ok, when I die I'm going to levi-orsk up to god\" and she kept using words that have no relevance to English to describe the act of dying or being dead. I've dated religious people, wickens, all kinds of stuff, but I've never found another psycological specimen quite like this one. The thing that really broke the camel's back was when she took the tomato off her burger and fucking THREW IT ON THE FLOOR, saying that \"all vegetables taste like dirt\" was what got me. I asked Chuck, my bartender if he could distract her, and he did. I left a 100 and promptly left. The barstaff got a 40 dollar tip and they never forgot that. To this day they still make me good drinks and cut me good deals. Love them all. That girl probably tasted like dirt, and her personality belonged next to that tomato, on the floor.",

He then repeated \"Do you know where Angela is?\" whilst giving me a funny look with his eyes.\n\nWe had just had a new starter at the company called Angela who was working in the kitchen (the bar I worked at is in a restaurant). The fact he referred to her by name and his facial expression made me think he was a friend/spouse of hers, but he was unsure if she was working today or that he was at the right restaurant.\n\nI told him I'd check the back for her. She was in the kitchen, so I went back to the bar and told him to follow me. I then pointed him towards Angela and he glanced over to her and said \"Oh, right. Cheers.\" and then ran out of the fire escape next to her (one of those ones with a bar to open), setting a loud alarm off.\n\nMy manager came running in asking what was wrong, and I told him what had happened. My manager stopped the alarm and informed me that 'Where's Angela?' is a new scheme the police have brought in, but he hadn't got round to telling us.

Wanna go out for a smoke?\u201d (I was a smoker back then but later found out he wasn\u2019t. Never mind either way because it got him away).

She was just being overly threatening and quiet to me.  At a point during the lunch, our waiter thankfully positioned himself behind her and mouthed the following words to me: \"Are you okay?\" I kind of shook my head no because I was afraid of leaving when the time came.\nWe paid the check and were about to leave when the manager appeared with the waiter. The manager stood between my ex and myself and told her, politely, that she needed to leave on her own. Before she could become belligerent, the manager explained to her that he had called the police and that she needed to leave immediately.  He then asked me, quietly, to have a seat and wait.

A very sweet, kinda nerdy guy got up from the bar and quickly walked towards the bathroom. On his way, he started crying. I walked into the bathroom with him and asked if he was okay. He said his date texted her boyfriend that he didn't know about, and some of his friends to come jump the guy because he couldn't afford to pay for all 8 of her Cranberry Vodkas. He said she was probably serious because he was peeping at her texts as she was nodding in and out (definitely the bartenders fault for letting her get so fucked up).\n\nI told my manager, we put his tab on hold and escorted him out if the back door and hid him in the owners truck (he was drunk enough that we didn't feel comfortable letting him drive, and Uber may take too long if this ass beating actually comes along). \n\nSo I smoke my cigarettes and almost immediately after walking back inside, I hear a douchebag pull in. You know, a guy doing a burnout into the parking lot in his burgundy 1996  Honda Civic with mismatch bumpers/fenders and half of the hood spray painted matte black. \n\nI grab my manager and we pretend to have a conversation outside. He walks in (he was alone thankfully), grabs the skank from the bar and walks out. They ask if we've seen the guy she was with and we told him he was throwing up really bad so we called him an Uber (I know we should've said no, but there were only like five people at the bar at the time, everyone definitely saw him walk through the back door of the kitchen with us). Dude gets pissed off saying his girl isn't paying for the tab AND STARTS THROWING ROCKS AT OUR FUCKING WINDOWS. Owner grabs an old pool cue from the back and holds it above his head ready to kill this dude until the police got there lmao. Super-Douche and Cranberry-Hoe speed off after a few more rocks and a half ass swing at the owner, which resulted in a full-power pool cue to the wrist.\n\nWe eventually really did call the dude an Uber, paid for the chicks drinks for him, he insisted he paid for his and the Uber so we let him. Police were upset that we let the victim go before they could get a report and asked to watch our video tapes, which we only have inside unfortunately. I don't know what happened after that as I quit shortly after for a better position. Fucking craziest day at work though.",

I'm a bigger guy, as was he, so I guess he felt \"the need\" to tell me but it was things like;\n\n\"Man you could totally fuck a skinny bitch if you wanted to\"\n\n\"Skinny bitches love big dudes man, I'm telling you, they love to feel protected and shit\"\n\n\"Don't think because you're a bigger guy you couldn't fuck a skinny bitch cause you totally could if you wanted to\"\n\nAll out of nowhere.  Hadn't talked to the guy all night.  One of my bartender friends turns around and she says \"he doesn't need to fuck any skinny bitches, he's married.\" And shows him her wedding ring.  The guy starts profusely apologizing and I guess he had a moment of clarity cause not too long after he got a cab and left and I haven't seen him there since.\n\nGot one more time the same girl saved my ass, gotta love making friends with bar staff.",
            "I had a woman at a bar on business one night... She came up to me after about 20 minutes after I sat down alone. I was having a rough day, she apparently was having a great one. Sitting there drinking my beer, she kept talking to me, grabbing me, and kept asking for us to leave because she would \"fuck my brains out\". Mind you, this woman was an obvious regular/bar fly and had been overserved. At one point, I got up and pretended my Asian buddy across the way (actually a stranger) was my best friend. She eventually made her way over and kept touching me. I asked the bartended if she could help me. She actually pretended to be a friend of mine also, said I was a part owner of the establishment, brought me into the office and let me sit there with her and the guy in the office. They gave me free food, let me finish my drink, had a good conversation, and some to-go food too. They felt terrible that a new guy had all these problems I guess, but they treated me well and got me out of there unscathed. I can still see her whacked out hair style and the cigarette smoke that she stank of. \n\nCool of the bartender to do that.",
            "Anti-Help story of bar staff and bouncers:\n\nEx was roofied at big nightclub..  Random guy was asking her if she wants to go and wanted to drag her with him. She pulled away at first, and felt she is starting to lose conscious and ability to walk.\n Tried to get help from bar and ask them to call for the ambulance, because she felt very strange. They said if she doesn't leave immediately they will throw her out, I think she looked and sounded drunk to them. \nShe had bought a drink, went dancing with girlfriend, came back, couple of sips, dancing and then felt she is going to pass out soon, tiny girl. Couldn't find her friend also.\n\n She called me. I was in town that night about 15 minute walk away. Just sat in the table with friends and ordered my first beer.\n First, I was surprised for the call. We hadn't communicated about a year. She was talking so strangely, and I had known her for 5 years. It felt very very  off.  She said a guy is trying to grab her.I felt such a rush of blood when she talked to me and asked for me to come. I knew what was up. Lately in media there were lots of articles of guys drugging girls at nightclubs. My male friend was also roofied a month ago.\n\nTold her to go to women toilet and lock herself in. Kept her on phone until she managed to do it. Told to stay there and only open to my voice.\nTold my friends I need to leave immideatly and left.\n\n Wanted to get a quick taxi, but impossible on Friday night. So I just ran there in 5-6 minutes will full speed, because I knew it might be matter of minutes. I had to buy a ticket for nightclub because they didn't believe someone is in trouble. I didn't want to argue so yeah bought ticket and rushed to women's toilets. There was bouncer near so he looked me very strangely when I started to go in and wanted to stop me. I explained my girlfriend feels sick and I need to get her home. He was keeping an eye for me. Ex opened up and, and I didn't care for looks and comments of girls there, took her and looked at her and started to walk out slowly. Bouncer came to me and said we need to leave or they will throw us out..  , same thing happened with another bouncer when we were almost out .. ffs a#\u20ac&\u20ac--#\n\nAnyway, I managed to walk/carry her out. She didn't want me to call ambulance tho I asked every couple of minutes, because she was throwing up every now and then and was very limp. So taxi was out of question.\n\nSo I carried her home over my shoulder for almost an hour and stayed till morning  sitting in chair next to her, because I thought she might suffocate or smth if she starts throwing up. She woke and didn't remember half of the things, but remembers s creepy dude and she called me.\n\nTold it a week later to my current  girlfriend, because she found out I had left my friends.\n\nAlthough she is a uber jealous girl sometimes, she said I did the right thing and never questioned me.\n\nedit: thank you kind stranger for my first reddit gold ever, that came unexpectedly, and I'm glad the post received it was meaningful one, not one of random comments I've written.",

            "I have few friends at a bar I visit (bartender, female and a bouncer, male).\nIm pretty good friends with the bartender as we live really close to each other. Anyways., I was hanging out in the bar talking to the bartender and the bouncer when this really, really drunken woman came to sit by my side.\nShe started saying that I looked lonely and her group of frienda noticed me and she came to ask if I wanted to sit at their table.\nI politely declined saying that I'm fine and don't really feel like socialising with random people.\nShe proceeds to tell me that one of the women in the group wanted me in her bed that evening.\nAgain I politely said no and the woman seemed to understand and went back to their table.\n\nAfter awhile the woman who wanted to sleep with me came over, again really drunk, and started to ask me inappropriate questions like \"how big are you?\" and \"I will fuck your brains out tonight\".\nThen she started to grope me, slapping my ass and trying to get me to feel her breasta and stuff.\n\nAt this point my bartender friend came over and asked if I would go on a break with her and noticed the woman.\nMy friend put her arm around me and straight up kissed me and called me \"babe\" and stared at the woman really intensly.\nAt that point the bouncer noticed what was happening (as he knows that the bartender has a boyfriend and its not me) and pushed himself between me and the harassing woman. This annoyed the woman and she tried to punch the bouncer who in turn did some sort of Chuck Norris esque move and flipped the woman around and basically carried her by the neck and pants outside :D\n\nIt looked so glorious and the group quickly left. Later found out that the group was a bachelorette party for the woman who wanted to sleep with me so I dodged a whole lot of drama. It pays to have friends in bars.",

            "OK I'm gonna use this post as a pedestal for this information for those of us in the industry.  As a restaurant person who is a barely functioning alcoholic, if you have a friend in the industry who is drinking at your bar and asks for a shot glass of water, PLEASE give it to them.  Keeping up appearances in the industry is incredibly important.  I do one shot and one beer with my crew when we go out, then the rest is nursing a bucket of ice water with a few stirrers  and a lime in it so I don't get shitty.  I truly believe that the industry is perfect for people with a certain set of priorities, but one of the tolls is drinking and casual drug use.  It's often easier to fake than to bail.

            "Yes, and she was a friend, which was suuuuuper awkward. \n\nHim: software engineer at IBM. Clearly a nice but rather retiring guy, mid-30s, didn\u2019t go on a lot of dates by choice. Very soft-spoken, low key, just looking for a nice dinner after work sort of thing. \n\nHer: recently-ish (6 month prior) got out of a long term, rather ugly open relationship in which they were both toxic and abusive to each other. She\u2019d been going to therapy, and was looking to \u2018start over\u2019, ie date a new type of guy in a new type of way. She was a friend from high school, so I invited her to come by our place, since it was a suburban wine bar and restaurant mostly frequented by retirees and couples with kids. Very much not the sort of hard-drinking, hard-charging place she used to do. \n\nThe Date: I was busy and not watching but it apparently went down in flames from the get-go. Her first four topics of conversation were 1) how she hated her ex, 2) how she liked rough sex, 3) how she hated religion, 4) how his \u2018very boring\u2019 dress was a \u2018change\u2019. She then started in very aggressively on how much she likes Krav Maga and how *no man will ever resist her again*. At this point, he was done, and feeling mildly threatened and went to the bathroom, then came to the bar and ordered a safety drink. \n\nLike I said, she was a friend, so I was fairly surprised, but safety drinks are something you have to treat with utmost seriousness, so I ordered him an Uber and two minutes later he was gone. I then had to go break the news to her. \n\nI thought she would be fine, because friends and all, but she *flipped*. Like literally - flipped the table and chairs, started throwing shit, and had a total Kyle meltdown. All while screaming about all the ways she had been planning to finally get laid. She\u2019s about 5\u20198 140 and I\u2019m 6\u20191 225 and have had a few years of training myself, so if it came to a fight I wasn\u2019t afraid, but I also wasn\u2019t paid nearly enough to fight someone with 8 years of Krav Maga at work, so I just watched and tried to talk her down. The police were called, and she was ultimately tazed and arrested. Guns were drawn. It was really ugly. \n\nSemi-happy ending though. Turns out, she had just started Varenicline along with the SSRI antidepressant she was already on, and that can have a rare but known adverse reaction that causes very violent behavior. So she ultimately wasn\u2019t charged, apologized profusely, paid for everything, and even sent the guy a really nice note. They didn\u2019t date again or anything but it was at least nice to see that I hadn\u2019t grossly misjudged her as a person in the long run.\n\nAlso: mad props to him for situational awareness. Like, damn he read things well.",
            "Not a bartender, but I have known many, here is one of the stories I recall from an exbartender pal.  An older woman used the safe word drink, and as he was calling a cab for her another bartender told him not worry, the guy she was with was her husband and she must have misspoke or he misheard.  So he made the drink and brought it out to her, she never went back up to the bar, but he remembers her looking surprised by the drink.  He felt that if it was a mistake she would come back up.... That night her and her husband died in a crash, he was driving, his BAC was well into the .1s.  My buddy tried blocking it all out, but after a couple more years he switched careers to animal rescue.   He still thinks about that night, and will randomly bring it up at gatherings.",

She even continued to bother me while I took a phone call!  Thankfully, the bartender noticed and walked over.  I asked him if he knew when a random flight was supposed to leave.  He apparently had a plan in mind, knowing that I really couldn't leave the area.  He walked over to two gentleman at the other end of the bar, and promptly returned and told me that they \"knew\" me.  I look and they're waving me over.  I picked up my drink and walked up to them like they were old friends, and magically that lady started to leave me alone.\n\nTurns out these random guys saw what was happening and had previously told the bartender that I looked like I could use some help.

I only ever heard a couple of words come from her mouth, but the way she was fighting the police, saying those thigns and then eve trying to smash the police car window open when leaving was enough to tell me there was a huge power struggle between her and that man i saw leaving, crying and even 'dead behind the eyes/gray faced'",
            "I used to own a bar and we were the only cocktail lounge situated in between a bunch of nightclub style places. They were loud and we were lively but not deafening. We would have quite a bit of overflow with hammered guests from these clubs and it was a pretty weekly occurrence for us to have some sort of nonsense spill over into my bar. Granted no one asked for the code word or Angel Shot I just happened to notice something strange. In the middle of our 1am rush I see this guy pull a chair from the table and set it at the entrance to a hallway where our restrooms are. I grabbed a female bartender and asked her to check on the female bathroom and see if there was a girl in there with anything weird going on while I went and checked on the guy. I ask the guy how he is doing and if I can get him anything and he tells me to fuck off and he is just waiting for someone. I step away and my bartender informs me there is a girl in there crying and hiding from this guy who was following her from bar to bar and she stepped into ours to hide. I have her go get the girl while me and another bartender inform the guy he can\u2019t have his chair there because of fire code and he has to move. He resists so we assertively walk him out of our bar while the girl is walked out our kitchen door outback where my staff parks and my female bartender gave her a ride to her car. In a busy rush we never saw a girl just going to the bathroom so sometimes in these situations you have to watch for the other signs which could be anything. It was just a weird guy moving a chair that time",

            "Not a bartender but a bouncer still am. It fucking disgust me when these scenarios do happen, they are so damn common at least the place I work at. I work at a night club on the weekends in California, it's on the high class end, its probably the worst crowd combo you can mix together, rich people in suites and gangsters with all the drug money/drugs you can imagine, anyways fast forward to what happened last weekend had a group of girls maybe 5-6 go to a vip table with a group of guys, I remember talking to one saying it was her first night at a club for her 21st birthday before they went inside, none of groups knew each other, different parties. Fast forward another 2 hours later into the night I see the same group of guys from the vip table in a corner next to the pillar, kinda formed a circle position like they were doing a line of coke but it was pretty obvious that they were doing some shady shit. 2 of the 5-6 girls that were inside the circle, 1 was passed out/being groped while the other one girl had her panties off(didn't see this till later) from the guy that was with her while the another guy from the same party had his  hand on her mouth, I made eye contact with her to see if she was okay, her eyes blared out me basically crying for help. I pretty much knew what was going on at this point, I grabbed the guy by the neck and pined him against the wall saying your fucking done, all of his boys in the circle jump on me then the rest of the staff comes and kicks the whole party out. One of the from the females from the party wrote down on a piece of napkin\"please walk us to uber\", I'm not sure why they weren't verbal with it I think they just didn't want to get embarrassed or English was bad, 15-20 mins later I waited till their uber came and the one that wrote me the note on the napkin gave me a really aggressive huge/ crying at the same time saying thank you she was studerring really bad. Poor girl she was probably terrified as fuck I felt really bad for her. Imagine almost being raped for your 21st birthday present, people fucking suck ass. The sad part is these people have so much money, most likely bribed the police officers, no police report, nothing filed no arrest no dog shit anything happening to these fucks, yet they are probably going to do the same thing at a different club next weekend.",

I felt really uncomfortable around her and told her I had a girlfriend but she still didn't back off. She later grabbed my ass when I was leaning forward to order at the bar.

            "Not an angel shot but I was in a lingerie (adult) store one time looking for a corset for a costume piece for something. The store is clean, bright, and very welcoming- not at all the seedy kind of place a lot of people picture when they think of adult stores. I got there and the store was empty except for the staff and one other customer who was checking out when I came in. After browsing for a little bit, a guy who I guess had come in after me comes up to me and tries to start a conversation. Being a (generally) nice and sociable person, I chat with him a little bit about the corsets I was looking at and we introduce ourselves. So far it was a little awkward but it just seemed like he wanted to chat and I'm not a totally rude person so whatever.\n\nThen he started asking me about toys and telling me about the toys he just bought. This immediately set off alarms in my head, so I tried to walk away in order to diffuse the situation organically, but he kept following me and asking me questions. Eventually, I grabbed a random corset, walked over to one of the staff members quickly enough to put some space between us, and loudly asked him if they had it in any other sizes, and then whispered \"this guy won't leave me alone please help\".\n\nThe staff member asked me if I wanted to try the corset on and took me to a dressing room with a locking door. I went in and after a few minutes I called the store from my cell. The other staff member who was working, who was the back for the first half of this ordeal, picked up, and I asked her if the guy was gone yet. She said no, he was still waiting for me, and apologized profusely. Apparently this guy follows girls around the store and then asks them to go have sex in his car. He's banned from the store, but she didn't realize he was there and the other staffer was new and unaware.\n\nI wound up being stuck in the changing room for another ten minutes until they said the guy left. I came back out and chatted with the staff for a few minutes because the guy was still sitting in his car in the parking lot. Apparently the creeper had gone up to the (very, very clearly openly gay as he was wearing pride attire) male staffer while I was in the changing room and asked him if he thought I was cute.\n\nAfter a while, the male staff member finally said the guy had left, and I gave it two or three minutes before I started to walk outside. In that time, however, apparently the creeper had come back and was now parked directly in front of the building, probably waiting for me to come out.\n\nHe sat there for another 10 minutes before he finally drove away. I did make sure I got a good look at his car before he left so I could be aware if he was following me home. The female staff member tried to call the store owner, but he was too far away to do anything. If the guy had stayed any longer, we were going to call the police. I'm still annoyed that I didn't wind up calling the police when we realized he was waiting for me outside, but there's nothing that can really be done at this point. But yeah that's the closest I've come to having an experience like that.",
            "The one time I've ever had someone ask for Angela was a bloke. \n\nThis guy was in some kind of a rush and wasn't exactly in the best of ways. As he gingerly made his way in, I could see past him and saw three rather large men following in behind him and were walking with a purpose.\n\nHe came right over to me and said he needed to see Angela if she was in so I took him to the office out back and sat him down. \n\nTurns out this guy had started started dating one of the three men's little sisters and he didn't like that because he \"wasn't one of them\" they're the not so nice traveller type.

            "Hi, born profound deaf person here. Sorry for the long post! omg o_/\n\nBefore I got surgery for my cochlear implant/before learning ASL, I don't exactly recall knowing about any \"mental functionalities\" like using a thinking voice. Most of my mental uses were re-imagining images in visual thoughts (if I wanted a hotdog, I'd visualize a hotdog). Besides that, my dreams were like silent films (and 95% still often are silent even after my surgery to help me hear).\n\nAfter that and being able to hear for some years, at some point, I developed an \"inner voice\" which just... doesn't have any clear *vocal sound* to it? Yet, at the same time, kind... of... does? Kinda weird/hard to explain. It's a jump between \"muffled 'speaking' sound as I think\" and \"hollow echoes\" for my normal thinking voice, and when I read fiction with characters, for those who have pre-set voiced I re-imagine them in my head as to how they would act it out and it would 'sound' just like the tone I'd hear from the media they're from. For the stories that aren't adapted into any audio format, I make them up in my head and try to make them sound distinct if I felt like it, haha.\n\nMy friends (non-CI) have told me they either don't mentally see/\"hear\" anything at all and have no idea the concept I'm trying to explain or they visualize floating hands signing to them in their mind space. I don't think in the latter at all, except when there are signs I'm trying to remember/reference.\n\nalso side note btw, back to my dreams thing, I sometimes dream them with semi-transparent CC/subtitles hovering what I'm seeing (sometimes at the bottom or near people's heads like in some video games just without the speech bubbles). Or none at all, but my dreaming brain \"narrates\" my dreams to me, telling me info somehow? idk if that's a deaf thing though. but I've always found how I dream kind of fascinating. The very rare sounds I \"hear\" in my dreams is kind of hard to explain as well, I can't tell if they were close to authentic [to a deaf person with hearing] that my brain produced for my dream or just my brain trying to \"reimagine\" the sound in my mental voice while I dream?? But it felt like there was legit real sound to it, but on the disorienting/surreal side.\n\nedit to add clarifications before I head to sleep now:\n\n* I was 2 and 1/2 yo when I got the surgery (fairly early into my human development, so my time with cognitive learning before that was very limited/fuzzy)\n* I do think in clear sentences in my head at my current point in life, sometimes accompanied with pictures/motion pics (like gifs) sometimes, other times only words; I \"read aloud\" the text a lot of things I read, I have to manually force my mind to shut up and read but then I lose a lot of brain processing information if I read too quickly and don't retain anything I just read... lol. So I'm a slow reader",
            "It should be noted that, even among the hearing, not everyone has an internal monologue.",
            "A deafie here - naturally we can't even describe what it sounds like as we don't really understand sound in the way you do. Maybe the basics like deep and high pitches but the difference between notes or octaves are something only understood through theory (i.e. reading about them). \n\nWe don't understand what makes a singer good but we for sure know how to tell if it's a good beat (provided it's loud enough to feel).\n\nAs such, speaking for myself here - my inner voice is more literally like thinking. A mixture of instinctual understanding and the words that describe the meaning I want to express. \n\nI am a writer so words are quite colorful to me. They convey a myriad of imagination. I also am a philosopher so I admire and observe closely the metaphysics at play here. \n\nWords can occasionally come out in English as it is best expressed through English. Some come out as sign language as there are sayings that only make sense in sign language. It's a blend of both as well as the raw emotional output that form my thoughts.\n\n Also, there is the silence in between the thoughts. Depends on how much you pay attention I suppose.",

            "Was born profoundly deaf. Wore hearing aids from 6 months old and replaced it with a cochlear implant at 15. I only have one, don\u2019t hear out of the other ear unless I opt to get another one for bilateral hearing. I was never taught how to sign. I was raised in a hearing world. People don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m deaf most of the time until they see the implant. I\u2019m a bit of an outlier I guess. I\u2019m not involved in the deaf community though I do have a couple of deaf friends who both talk and sign.\n\nMy voice sounds a lot cooler in my head than what it really is, probably the same for most people lol.",

            "I recently learned that deaf people (at least in my country) often speak sign language as their first language and do not appreciate the assumption that sign language is just \"a signed form of the country's language\". The two languages usually have different grammars and morphology. I think your question is very interesting OP, I just wanted to add to it, maybe this helps understand that not everyone has an acoustic language as their inner voice. I think it's hard for a hearing person to grasp this concept because language is so bound to sound for us but as Steven Pinker said: we shouldn't make the mistake of mixing up thought and language, most of our thoughts are more diffuse than language.",

            "Obligatory \"not me, but...\" here.  My mom's doctorate is deaf education and literacy, and my twin brother was born with massive hearing loss that wasn't well identified until we were toddlers. So i grew up in a DHH (deaf or hard of hearing) household, surrounded by a very active deaf community in chicago, while i had hearing but my brother had trouble.  Interestingly, we both needed similar speech therapy, though his was more intense and probably fruitful. \n\nFrom my mom and prior experiences, i've learned a fair bit that might help answer your question,  Including:\n- Not every person born deaf doesn't subvocalize. See, if hearing isn't fully lost, for example, someone can be legally 'deaf' without actually having NO hearing, or people might have younger interventions, allowing a simpler period of language acquisition and development.\n- People with limited or much reduced hearing often subvocalize less 'crisply' in their head, aaaaand they often don't have a consistent voice internally because that's not how their brain learns to identify most language.  Some have said they 'see' signs, while another older student of my mom claimed to see written language instead, though this is purely anecdotal. \n- The voice in your head is that 'subvocalization', which is often reduced in those with hearing loss. In fact, you need to remember that before you had language, you still had thoughts.  They just went organized the same.  Language provided greater ability to organize and understand even your own thoughts, and the deaf and hard of hearing are the same.  In fact, many signers in my country (USA) have stated that they *think* in signs (ASL/ American sign language), or finger spelling.\n- People whose deafness comes later in life will tend to keep subvocalizing, and even their muscles will react to the mental speech (minor jaw movement, tongue movement, etc.) Despite their loss of hearing. This is widely claimed to be a result of information processing and memory, and because of how they've 'learned' to think. \n\nHopefully that helps.  For those who are born hard of hearing, they might develop an internal voice, or might just communicate in their head via ASL or signs, while most fully deaf people state that they don't have that same internal voice subvocalizing verbally, but think in visuals or signs.",

I do have an inner voice because I have spoken since the age of 3 so basically had a similar start as a hearing person almost, I'm guessing. And I've always loved reading when growing up so always been very literate, not like some deaf people who are native BSL users, usually but obviously can't speak for all. Although i do speak better than I can hear if that makes sense! So my inner voice is pretty much my voice but as I have started to wear my cochlear implant considerably less, like almost never- my voice is slightly different, a bit more distorted. But I still think in words and have a voice narrating my thoughts. My dream is a mixture of speaking and just pure visuals although I haven't really remembered my dreams all that much recently.

This now extends to online brokerage websites like greenfield and puppyspot. They\u2019re like Amazon, a few clicks and a puppy will be sent to your door, and these puppies are coming from the exact same place as the pet store puppies. Because of people\u2019s need for instant gratification, [these facilities with hundreds to thousands of breeding animals](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/2021_HorribleHundred.pdf) persist. They are the best cash crop you could hope for.\n\nNever believe a store who claims they only sell puppies from responsible breeders. No, not even if the owner has visited the breeders and \u201cknow\u201d they\u2019re good! By definition a responsible breeder would NEVER send their puppies to a pet store. Even pet stores that claim to only have rescues need to be scrutinized because some mills will use a shell rescue to [\u201cpuppy launder\u201d](https://caninechronicle.com/current-articles/puppy-laundering-the-unsavory-big-business-of-rescue-for-profit/). \u201cLicensed and certified breeders\u201d should be a red flag - depending on the state, a breeder only needs to be licensed if they have a large number of dogs, are selling to brokers to go to pet stores, or to people \u201csight unseen\u201d (online). YMMV depending on the state.\n\nPeople sometimes justify their purchases as \u201csaving\u201d puppies from a pet store. But that is still investing in the industry and funding their operations by giving them profit. Legislation hasn\u2019t stemmed the tide. Only a loss of profit will make mills move on to another hustle.\n\nSo please educate yourself and anyone you know who loves dogs and might ever be tempted to purchase a puppy from a pet store or online.

            "Pugs.\n\nFirst off, I have no ill will towards anyone who adopted a pug. You are a lovely wonderful person for giving that little boo a good pampered life. I appreciate anybody who makes the effort to caring for a dog like family. My issue is with pug breeders.\n\nThey're not a naturally evolved dog breed, they were selectively bred to have flatter faces and bigger eyes over the last few centuries. What resulted is an animal that not only couldn't survive in the wild, but an animal that cannot survive without humans' modern medical intervention. Pugs suffer from [a myriad of significant health complications](https://vethelpdirect.com/vetblog/2021/03/17/do-pugs-have-health-problems-things-to-know-before-you-buy/#h-there-are-breeders-and-pug-enthusiasts-who-are-working-hard-to-improve-pug-health) their entire life, they really struggle just to exist, and it's pretty sad to think millions of these animals were born into these deliberately manufactured genes because they look so cute.\n\nAgain, if you own a pug, no judgement. Obviously. I'm not going to be a dick and shame people for loving their pug. Quite the opposite. I'm certain they put a ton of effort and money into giving that little love muffin the best possible life, like any member of the family, and I hugely respect them for doing so. But when that sweet angel fulfills its life and gets its wings back, I would recommend a bit of pause before the replacement pug.\n\nYou could just try a different toy breed, not only to reduce the demand for more pug breeding but just for the variety in dog owning experience. You can get a pug cross-breed, which would reduce the amount of health complications they have. Or, you could do some in-depth research and become a part of a pug breeding rehabilitation initiative, which is a growing association of pug breeders trying to genetically undo the health complications that have arisen over the last couple centuries.\n\nEdit:  \nPeople seem to be misreading this post (getting very irrationally triggered), and thinking this is some kind of competition for \"which dog breed is the most unhealthy overall.\" I did not single out the pug because I believe they suffer the worst from medical problems (they do not). I chose the pug because of the breed's shockingly rapid decline over just a couple centuries, all for the purpose of visual appeal to human owners. The pug was an otherwise healthy and capable breed not too long ago, one that has existed alongside humans for several millennia. What breeders have done to them in such a sickeningly short timespan is abhorrently cruel, and with this information in mind, I plead prospective dog owners to make alternative considerations to reduce the current breed's market demand, and increase demand for healthier cross-breeds or healthy rehabilitating breeding efforts.\n\nI also recognize that the pug isn't the only dog breed to have been detrimentally genetically modified for human aesthetic appeal. The French bulldog is also a victim of such terrible breeding practices, and my feelings towards their breeders and owners is the same. The reason why I chose the pug over the French bulldog is because, in the interest of an AskReddit thread, they asked for just a single product, and the answer would carry less impact if I wrote a generic \"designer dog breeds\" answer (leaving a lot more room for semantic nonsense). I also feel people identify more strongly with pugs than French bulldogs, because pugs are more distinct and iconic in culture.",

            "Douching products. I'm not talking about a particular brand because they're all as bad as each other. Douching for one isn't necessary as a healthy woman's vagina is pretty much self-cleaning making such products unnecessary. Douching also puts women at risk of all sorts of things such as bacterial vaginosis, UTIs, and yeast infections. If she already happens to have one of these it can push the bacteria causing the infection further up into the fallopian tubes, uterus, and ovaries. It's a useless and dangerous product that has probably caused countless infections yet still sells by the million in developed countries because there seems to be no one saying that a product tied to so many health concerns should be banned. I personally think they should be banned due to the harm they cause. I however realise that this argument could be used to ban all sorts of the things like cigarettes, alcohol, junk food yada yada and that isn't going to happen. I do however, think that perhaps this is different because those things aren't targeting one specific group especially with the idea that a woman's vagina is automatically disgusting, foul, smelly etc and needs fixing (a foul odour is a sign of an infection not a need for douching). One group (women) specifically are targeted here not society in general so perhaps that makes it different.",
