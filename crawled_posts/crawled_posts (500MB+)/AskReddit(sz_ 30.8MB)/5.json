            "  \n\nWithin a decade or so there will be an explosion in the number of people in their fifties and sixties that require a place in a residential nursing care home.\n\nIf you look at the age of the population in care homes at present they are mostly very elderly people that in their youth and middle age had active jobs or lived active lives without even really trying. They walked to the store, walked to work or cycled, and the housewives were active in their day to day activities, not to mention the amount of people in manual labour. They also ate fairly healthy diets and in the main were not obese. \n\nToday many people sit at a desk all day and eat rubbish. The vast majority do not keep themselves active or do any kind of resistance and cardio workouts to balance that. Obesity rates are such that we have people in their mid forties that find it difficult to mobilise themselves and have pain when walking or getting out of a chair.\n\nI was speaking to an orthopaedic surgeon a while ago about this issue (connected to my work) and his view was that a lot of people are focusing on Diabetes as the ticking time bomb health wise when in reality the amount of health and mobility issues caused by obesity will hit just as hard.\n\nSo within a decade or two we will see the youngest population ever requiring nursing care due to immobility.

            "Malaria vaccine. There are dozens of promising candidates in early trials right now and hopefully at least one will be highly effective and affordable. This will be not only a huge gamechanger for eliminating malaria and improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people, but it will also mark a huge scientific success as the first vaccine against a complicated parasitic organism. Hopefully we will gain key insights from this process to be able to develop new vaccines for other complex organisms, such as HIV, TB, and Influenza!\n\nAlso if you are an anti-vaxxer, fuck you.\n\nEDIT: holy shit, this blew up\n\n1) There is a currently approved vacccine RTS,S https://www.who.int/malaria/media/malaria-vaccine-implementation-qa/en/ that has completed stage 3 trials. It was approved in 2015, but is now rolling out in a pilot program to 3 major countries this year! However, the efficacy is non-optimal (prevented 40% of malaria cases in children over 4 years). Not to poo-poo this effort, but there are literally dozens of other competitors targeting different stages of the malaria lifecyle, and it is very likely at least one of these (or perhaps a combination of several) will be much more effective. https://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/Global_malaria_vaccine_pipeline_2015Sep.pdf?ua=1\n\n2) To those worried about overpopulation (which is a very valid concern) check out this video by Bill Gates https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obRG-2jurz0 (tl;dw: improving health does not lead to population growth, but rather population stability as families have less children)\n\n3) As many have pointed out, a malaria vaccine is just one part of a multi-pronged approach to malaria elimination. We also need mosquito population control (despite growing insecticide resistance), better anti-malarial drug treatment (despite growing drug resistance), and new methods of detection and surveillance (such as rapid-diagnostic assays). Elimination this disease is one of the greatest challenges our race has faced, but I believe that we can do it.

            "A Pakistan-India war that could result in the use of modern nuclear warheads. Tensions have been building consistently between these two countries and straight-up nuclear war is a distinct possibility.\n\nEdit: To clarify what this means, what\u2019s likely is an escalation in conflict. Legitimate all-out war, but not likely nuclear attacks. Neither country benefits from the get-go by doing that, and it\u2019s even more likely that their own destruction would be guaranteed. However, it\u2019s still a possibility, especially if one side appears to be catastrophically losing. \n\nIndia lost 41 troops in a single terrorist attack recently, and Pakistan still appears to be funding these groups. Two warplanes were shot down, and overall the situation appears to be escalating far above the regular skirmishes on the hotly contested border. \n\nThat being said, you shouldn\u2019t be incredibly afraid of nuclear war. Nukes are quite simply a last resort, and basically a suicide pill for any country that uses them. All in all, don\u2019t expect them, but don\u2019t expect sunshine and rainbows over there either.

            "Renewal: A Short Story\n\nI had been putting off the re-registration paperwork for a month. It was the summer of 2032, and Sara was on that trip to Mexico with her sisters, so I had the weekend to myself. Sure, it was common to see a counselor in the time leading up to a couple\u2019s re-registration date, but  I was still nervous. I remember walking into the office and thinking how much it looked like my dentist\u2019s office: old magazines, fake plants, and the whole works. \n \nIt wasn\u2019t so much that I couldn\u2019t see myself with Sara for another year. We had settled into a pleasant, comfortable place in our relationship. Yet, each year, in the months leading up to our anniversary date, I felt anxiety and doubt creep into my thoughts about re-registering our relationship. For one, there was the monetary cost of having to hire a lawyer to help with re-registering the relationship. On top of that, there was the long wait at the DMV and the awkward, 15 minute interview with the government officiant. \n \nBut it wasn\u2019t these specific points of friction that stressed me out. I just couldn\u2019t help but think of the anniversary as a potential stopping point for a relationship that I wasn\u2019t 100% sure about. I tried to communicate all this to the counselor.\n \nLook, this is actually something I\u2019ve worked with a lot of people on. You\u2019re not alone here, she assured me. Now, I\u2019m not here to point you to the right decision, but I do want to make sure you\u2019re making an informed decision. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve heard of data consultancies?\n \nI had, I responded. I knew where she was going. With the hundreds of millions of data points that the government had, data consultants could actually come up with a fairly accurate prediction for any given relationship. Because the government wanted to promote improved decision-making in relationships, appointments at data consultancies were fully covered by universal health care.  \n \nSara and I were old fashioned and had never considered going to a consultancy. But maybe, now was different, I thought. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIn the 1950s a group of Harvard researchers began a decades-long study on happiness with the goal of finding the main drivers of happiness in people\u2019s lives. The study had two main findings. \n\nThe first finding was that relationships were the key driver of happiness in people\u2019s lives. Other factors like career or financial well being paled in comparison to having healthy, fulfilling relationships. This finding was mostly just a confirmation of what most people already knew intuitively.\n\nThe second finding from the study, however, was more surprising: the vast majority of relationships began by chance and were maintained by inertia. For example, one participant met his future wife when they happened to sit next to each other at his high school band class. They got married 3 years later after an unplanned pregnancy, and they proceeded to remain in that mostly unhappy marriage for the next 40 years.\n\nThe Harvard researchers uncovered many stories like this. As a matter of fact, they found that 80% of participants\u2019 close relationships were formed simply out of chance. In addition, they found that participants\u2019 unhealthy romantic relationships continued for an average of 7.3 years before action was taken to end a relationship. \n\nEssentially, the Harvard researchers concluded that with regards to relationships, people were dealt a random hand, and they largely stuck to it. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAn average of 1.8 years and a median of .8 years, the data consultant had muttered half to himself as he viewed the results on his computer. I remember staring at him blankly. \n\nThe data consultant turned to look at me and cleared his throat. We have this predictive model that\u2019s been trained on nearly a billion couples, and there\u2019s millions of them that are reasonably similar to you and your partner: couples between ages of 25 and 30, Asian male - Latina female ethnic combination, similar responses to the questionnaire, 4th time re-registering, the whole works. And on average, their relationships last 1.8 years or a median of .8 years after the 4th re-registration.\n\nI frowned. That doesn\u2019t sound too good to m-\n\nThe consultant interrupted. My job here isn\u2019t to make a value judgment one way or another. Anyways, I\u2019ve just emailed you the exact distribution of potential outcomes for your relationship. You can examine that later. \n\nI pulled out my watch and began looking over the summary statistics and visualizations that he had sent me. \n\nHe continued. While it is not my job to provide you with a recommendation, it is my fiduciary duty to help you gain as much possible information before making this re-registration decision. Now, there\u2019s a lot of data out there that can help you see how good of a fit you and... \n\nSara, I said. \n\nYes, Sara\u2026 Anyways, using your social media data, I can help you find a set of highly compatible potential partners that are in reasonably close proximity. You can then view the compatibility scores of these potential partners alongside the compatibility score that I assign to Sara. With that information in hand - \n\nBy then, I had tuned out. Sure, I had heard all about those academic studies that found a connection between higher compatibility scores and longer, happier relationships. But I had also heard about the rebuttals that claimed this connection was a self-fulfilling prophecy. These detractors argued that couples who knew about their high compatibility scores would naturally feel more confidence in their relationship. That confidence would translate to more re-registrations and longer relationships.\n\nMy thoughts turned to Sara and I. If we had an absurdly high compatibility score, would I feel more confident in our relationship? And if we didn\u2019t, did that mean we couldn\u2019t improve our compatibility score moving forward? \n\nThen, it clicked. I got up and began walking out of the office. The consultant must have thought I was upset from the results he had shared with me. But as I left the office, I couldn\u2019t stop smiling. \n\nCompatibility scores were a static measure of something that wasn\u2019t. Compatibility grows, evolves, and changes. Over time, I found that Sara and I had begun converging. I began going to church with her every now and then. I also noticed her listening more to the same Jazz artists I listened to. Our compatibility had grown over the course of our relationship, simply because of time. \n\nSure, Sara and I may not be the absolute most compatible partners for each other today. There are billions of people in the world. There\u2019s bound to be some woman out there who\u2019d have a higher compatibility score than Sara. But fast forward 20 years from now, I bet Sara\u2019s going to be the most compatible partner for me. Give a healthy, happy relationship enough time, and you\u2019ll both naturally become the best possible partners for each other. \n\nI got into my car and just sat there, grinning to myself. Better get started on that re-registration paperwork, I thought. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBefore the 1970s, price flexibility was a standard assumption in economic models. This assumption was predicated on individuals responding quickly to changes in market dynamics. Beef prices go up, burger vendors quickly increase burger prices. In the 1970s, however, economists from Berkeley found that this was not the case in many situations. In the case of the burger vendor, having to change prices on a menu could be enough friction to prevent the burger vendor from raising prices. In short, these economists discovered that human decision-making can be affected disproportionately by minor friction points. \n\nThe Berkeley economists also explored how the power of friction could be harnessed for good in society. Given the seminal research on happiness conducted by Harvard researchers in the 1950s, these economists were primarily interested in using friction to improve people\u2019s relationships. Soon, they began to work with government officials on this topic of friction. \n\nIn a country with growing inequality and stagnating growth, government officials were eager to explore new levers that could improve welfare in society. Through several randomized control trials run in parallel across different states, economists partnered with local governments to test their various ideas about how friction could improve relationships in society. The results of these experiments, the economists hoped, would provide the government with new tools for boosting people\u2019s well being.  \n\nMeanwhile, critics accused the government of collaborating with ivory-tower academics to strengthen its grip on people\u2019s private lives. The majority of people, however, were quite apathetic about letting the studies on friction and relationshiips go on. After all, these studies would take decades, people reasoned, and it was unlikely anything would come of them. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSara and I never re-registered our relationship for that 4th year. When she got back from her trip with her sisters, she was dead set on not re-registering. She had also seen a counselor and a data consultant, but had reached different conclusions than I did. \n\n\u201cJack, look at me. I promise you, this will be the best for the both of us. You won\u2019t know it, but I\u2019ll be praying for you,\u201d she had said. Those were her last words to me. I haven\u2019t seen her since.\n\nBut Sara was right. A year or so after Sara and I broke up, I ended up going back to that data consultant. Given my social media accounts and the government\u2019s data, they were able to find 23 suitable partners around the area who were deemed \u201cextremely compatible\u201d. On the 23rd date, I met Kate, my current partner. It\u2019s been 30 years, and we\u2019ve never looked back. \n\n(continue below)",

(Other than the fact that divorces usually end up favoring the woman, but that is more a divorce related issue not an actual issue of marriage.) \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is this. If you plan on marrying someone, you have to marry them as they are. Do not expect them in any way to change and do not want to change them. You have to look at the person you are marrying and think \"If they were exactly the same forever, would I be okay with that\". If the answer is anything but some form of yes, you are not ready to marry that person. You have to love that person as they are. Otherwise you are doing yourself and your partner a disservice.\n\nAs for the actual topic. It'd be okay I guess. I wouldn't partake in it and wouldn't need it.

            "I am an extrovert. Having a conversation, to me, feels a little like passing a ball. In a situation where the conversation is going well, I finish my piece, and then I pass the ball.\n\nIf I don\u2019t pass the ball, I feel very rude - to me, I feel like I\u2019m hogging the conversation. I don\u2019t like being on the other side of it where I never get the ball. \n\nSo with an introvert, you have someone who doesn\u2019t always want the ball. Maybe they\u2019re content to watch others play ball or to watch you dribble and bounce it around. Maybe they want nothing to do with the ball and wish the players would fuck off somewhere else. So that\u2019s what I have to figure out.\n\nI would never ask \u2018why are you so quiet?\u2019 but my conversational style is driven by the urge to pass the ball. So I\u2019d ask a question about the topic, what your opinion is or if you have anything to add, or I\u2019d ask about you and how you\u2019re doing, or if there is anything you\u2019d like to talk about. \n\nEdit: for the latter, that is only appropriate really if you\u2019re talking to someone you know wants to talk but doesn\u2019t know when/how to interject! \u2018Anything new? Read anything/seen anything/etc\u2019 \n\nJust like introverts don\u2019t want people to assume they\u2019re rude or lonely, it makes me a little sad to see some of the responses here. It seems like the attitude toward extroversion is pretty negative. I don\u2019t think extroverts spend as much time judging you in their head as you think they do - people pretty rarely pay much attention to any of us for long. Those who tell you to smile or ask \u2018why are you so quiet?\u2019 are entitled - not because they are extroverted, but because they feel they are owed something from you, and that\u2019s wrong.\n\nSo, you know, I think most extroverts are just trying to play ball. Those with good social skills should be able to pick up that you don\u2019t feel like playing. I have introverted friends who I bring  with me, because they like watching the game and occasionally announcing the score, and as long as I know they\u2019re content, that\u2019s good enough for me.\n\nEdit: I should add that I\u2019m an extrovert who truly adores my introvert friends and the calm they bring my life. They often have a lot hobbies or interests that I have never been exposed to and I love to learn. They might send me a supportive message, or recommend me a book or a recipe or a documentary, and I might make a phone call for them that they were really dreading or help them write a cover letter. \n\nSo if you take anything from this post I hope it\u2019s that introverts and extroverts both have a lot to offer each other.",

            "I don\u2019t know if this helps you, OP, but as an actual adult extrovert, I\u2019ll give you my two cents. \n\nFirst, I don\u2019t ever ask why someone is so quiet. That\u2019s rude. However, I\u2019ll intentionally interact with people who look like they\u2019re uncomfortable or distancing themselves from others. I want everyone at the party/group event/dinner/whatever to have a good time. I was a shy kid with an inferiority complex and I don\u2019t ever want someone that I\u2019m socialize with to feel that way. \n\nIf I see someone hanging back, I\u2019ll go talk to him. I\u2019ll ask questions that get him talking about himself. If after a few minutes I get a vibe that he\u2019s perfectly happy just hanging around the edge of the group and doesn\u2019t really want to interact, I\u2019ll keep it brief and move on.\n\nIt helps that my best friend and my very nice boss are introverts, and they\u2019ve explained to me that there\u2019s a difference between being introverted versus shy versus socially awkward. The shy or socially awkward people seem to appreciate being approached individually or included in group conversations. I always make sure to ask them questions if we\u2019re standing around in a circle talking but they never have a chance to contribute.\n\nIntroverts, on the other hand, don\u2019t have the energy to engage with lots of people and/or for a long period of time. With people who I know are introverts, I\u2019ll ask if they\u2019re doing ok, if they want to leave, if they need a wingman to help them exit graciously, if they\u2019d like me to sit with them for a while or if they\u2019d rather be left alone, if they want to are a run to the snack table or to refill drinks, etc.\n\nEDIT for two things:\n\nFirst, thanks everyone for the awards. It seems like we\u2019re all having a good time at this party!\n\nSecond, it occurred to me that I didn\u2019t mention that when I start talking to someone and asking questions, I genuinely do want to hear what they have to say. I\u2019m doing it to engage them and to try to help them enjoy themselves, but I\u2019m also actually interested in what they have to say. I learn lots of new things and get opinions and perspectives other than my own.",
            "I think there is a common misconception that introverts are rude and standoffish.  It\u2019s hard for some people to be social, and that\u2019s perfectly ok. Maybe just a smile and a friendly \u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s just the way I am\u201d should work.",
            "I was in a long relationship with someone who could not stand silence and would never stop talking.

            "Not many extroverts answering, so I'll give put my two cents in. \n\n\nAs an extrovert I'm fairly easy to read in a group setting. You can tell when I'm having a good time, or tired, or even bored. Its fairly obvious when I'm not interested in the conversation because I stop engaging. Introverts are harder to read, especially after a few hours of hanging out. They could have been interested at the beginning of the night but now its been 4 hours and their starting to wane. Or they're not. Who knows! \n\n\nI like to check in to make sure they're okay. I try not to use \"Why are you so quiet?\" as a question but it does come out of my mouth sometimes as a \"Why are you so quiet (at the moment)?\" Most of the time I try to ask something along the lines of like \"We're not boring you are we?\" And YES my introverted friends have answered \"I'm thinking about heading home, my energies spent.\" or \"This conversation is boring, I'm waiting till you all finish.\" while browsing on their phones (As an extrovert, browsing on my phone means I'm straight up not having a good time).\n\n\nHowever, I really only do this in group setting of like 10 or more people, since at that point its easy for some introverts to get lost in the shuffle. \n\n\nBut honestly, I know some talkative introverts. They are relatively talkative for a few hours, then have to leave because they're drained. I don't know many introverts who sit in a corner and just stare at everyone. Some do, but that because they're shy or anxious, not because they're introverted.\n\n\nBut the misconceptions about extroverts online is insane. I'm an extrovert to can go all night and straight into day if there's a party going on. I'm usually one of the last to leave and love talking to people. I can talk one on one with someone for HOURS. I've been on the phone with a friend 10 hours before and its happened multiple times. However, I also love being alone! I find it relaxing to sit in silence  and read or scroll Reddit. I love playing single player games and hate multi-player ones. The quarantining didn't bother me one bit even though I only saw friends/family a few times this year. I can be loud in certain situations but people make fun of me for being Daria because my voice is so monotone most of the time. And I don't hate introverts. They just experience the world differently than I do.",

            "There seems to be a common misconception that extroversion = social and introversion = quiet. \n\nIntroversion and extroversion (at least in a psychological sense) is more about whether engaging with your external environment decreases or increases your energy respectively.\n\nHence you can have some very social, bubbly people that are introverts. However, after a period of socialising those introverts will want to recluse away from those environments to recover energy.\n\nAlso note that it is generally argued to be a sliding scale so it is likely everyone can kind of empathise to some extent with being an introvert and being an extrovert. I would even personally argue that anecdotally the trait can be quite temperamental.",

I've had a couple of instances where people actually got angry at it, even close to fisticuffs.  I think they see it as a threat or a slight of some kind, maybe because they can't read the person, which makes them uncertain?\n\nIn any situation, it's a terrible question to ask.",

How much have you seen goods increase in price in the US over the past two years? Because inflation has remained at a historic low of about 2.4%. Meaning relative to pay, goods haven't really changed. Jobs have continued to grow, the stock market hasn't collapsed, etc. While in China the stock market has halved, exports are down significantly, jobs have moved out of the country, people have been forced to close their businesses due to lost sales, private debt forfeitures have increased steadily, etc. China is feeling this trade war whereas the vast majority of Americans aren't.

This was all to secure oil, probably lots of oil, which was and still is very important. Reinstating the Sjah showed a lack of vision. \n\nThen you support Saddam Hussein, another man of \"great statue\", to start a war against Iran that costs many billions and many many lifes. But most of that money flows back to American weapon manufacturors, and those lifes are not american so who cares. Oh and cheap oil! \n\nThat war is lost or not won, but at least Iran is set back another decade or two, and Iraq is still more dependent on the US. \n\nNow you got an Iran that is out of control, although I still think the *people of Iran* are still a reasonable, rather liberal and friendly people - friendly to the west as well. \n\nBut well, that doesn't matter, so you retract from the nuclear treaty so you know for sure that those nuclear bombs are coming. \n\nVerdict: the US probably haven't run out of stupid ideas, and certainly haven't done the right thing here.",

This discovery led to the development of many of the early over-the-counter pregnancy test kits currently available.

After this venture, she recognized that her power was begining to wane so she decided it was better to cash out while she had the leverage (one of her fleets had turned on her during the period among other things) She managed to negotiate for literally all of her men to be given amnesty, be allowed to join the chinese navy, to keep the stuff they had stolen, and for her *to be able to keep several ships to be able to have a buisness in the salt trade.* She then ran a gambling house and died peacefully in her sleep. \n\nBesides a fucking kickass story, she has also had some lasting consequences. Her absolute domination over the chinese navy showed just how much the empire had neglected that wing of the military, and the British picked up on this. It was a big part of why they were so willing to fight a naval war across the entire planet at a time when even messages would take a year and change just to make it back. The opium wars were fought because of this, and the treaties that resulted are called by the *current* chinese government as the start of \"the century of shame\" and are a major touchstone in the governments image of itself. They are invoked today when negotiations with the west breakdown as a reason that China ought not bow to outside pressure. \n\nFor any canadians (of which I am) , its on the level of Vimy ridge in our national conception.",

            "Astronomer here! The foundations for modern astrophysics and what we understand about the universe did not come from the pre-eminent astronomers of the 19th century, but rather a group of women called the [Harvard computers. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers) This is because at the time only men were allowed to use the telescopes and Harvard was experimenting with the first astrophotography, and they hired women to look at those first images, and it then became the women who made the first discoveries about things like the hydrogen line in stars, spectral binaries (two stars orbiting each other so close you can\u2019t see them by eye), and half a million variable stars, some of which were used as \u201cstandard candles\u201d to determine the size of the universe. All *years* before real computers of even electricity! (Oh and two of the women were deaf.)\n\nAmong my favorites I want to shout out to [Williamina Fleming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming) who ran the group of women- she started out as a single mom maid to the observatory director, who got mad at his (male) students\u2019 analysis of the images and proclaimed \u201cmy maid could do better!\u201d And she did! She not only ran the group and discovered many variable stars and nebulae, she discovered a supernova (SN 1895B) that I studied in my own research published this year! Good science never dies! (Oh and in her spare time she made dolls as a hobby and was friends with Andrew Carnegie\u2019s family and gave one to Carnegie\u2019s daughter.)\n\nTrust me these are amazing astronomers!

Wells was a born a slave, freed by the emancipation proclamation, her parents died, she worked as first a teacher to support her family.\n\nThen, later on, she worked and *co-owned* the ***'Memphis Free Speech and Headlight'***  newspaper. She reported covered incidents of racial segregation and inequality. \n\nUsually, lynchings of back people in the Southern 1890s were not seen as a big deal. Ida B. Wells brought these crimes to light, often risking her life, receiving death threats, and once, when she was out of town, a white mob destroyed her printing press and office, further threatening her and telling her to never come back to Memphis.\n\n She exposed lynching as a barbaric practice of whites in the South used to intimidate and African Americans who created economic and political competition\u2014and a subsequent threat of loss of power\u2014for whites. \n\nIn fact, Wells mostly got into reporting these crimes and lynchings, because her friends, black store owner, Thomas Moss, were competing in popularity with another white-owned store.\n\nThere was an argument between a black boy, Armour Harris, and a white boy, Cornelius Hurst, and they got into a fight.\n\nHarris was winning when Cornelius's father came and began to hit Harris. (thrash)\n\nThe employees of the black-owned store (William Stewart and Calvin McDowell) rushed outside to try to defend Harris when one thing led to another and soon there was a whole mob.\n\nThe white store owner, Barret, went to their store the next day with the deputy, looking for Stewart.\n\nHe met McDowell and when McDowell said that Stewart wasn't here, frustrated and angered than this store was competing with his, he said, 'Blacks are thieves,' and hit McDowell with a pistol.\n\nMcDowell wrestled the gun away and fired a Barrett, narrowly missing.\n\nMcDowell was arrested.\n\nI think in March there was an attack, a group of white men was met with a barrage of bullets from Moss's store, wounding the Sherrif and a civilian.\n\nThomas Moss, William Stewart, and Calvin McDowell were named conspirators and arrested.\n\nLater on, they were taken from their cells and killed.\n\nIda B. Wells began to investigate lynchings, arrests, and murders. \n\nShe often talked about black men being wrongly imprisoned for raping white women.\n\nShe wrote I think, two books titled, 'The Red Record,' and 'Southern Horrors.'\n\n  Facing continued death threats, she moved to Chicago, married, and had a family while continuing her work writing, speaking, and organizing for civil rights and the women's movement for the rest of her life. \n\nWells was outspoken regarding her beliefs as a Black female activist and faced regular public disapproval, sometimes including from other leaders within the civil rights movements and the women's suffrage movement. She was active in women and the women's suffrage movement, establishing several notable women's organizations. \n\nDuring the women's rights march, she refused to stand in the back and stubbornly stood in the front alongside the other white women.\n\nShe travelled internationally and toured around Europe, going twice to Britain, giving speeches and hoping her fellow Americans would follow as well.\n\nShe was one of the founders of the NAACP, yet her name was deliberately not listed.\n\nShe brought into light the many crimes and cases of injustice that were brushed under the carpet.

Lovecraft.  And while she financially provided for herself, her daughter, and her husband, she also handled editing, publishing, and distribution of Lovecraft's work through her already successful magazines.  She even ghost-wrote some of Lovecraft's stuff.  On some occasions, Lovecraft would just lose stories he was working on (because he was a disorganized mess) and she would just rewrite his stories from memory so he could publish them.  Sometimes he would come up with ideas that he was too lazy to realize into full stories, so she would write them herself for publication.  She was so good at it that there is actual debate over how many of Lovecraft's stories are actually written by Greene, and how many of those may have been her original works published under her husband's name.\n\n\nThis chick had like three overlapping successful careers while raising a kid, and then just decided to raise Lovecraft and manage his career too, just for fun.\n\nSonia Greene is arguably more responsible for the success of H.P. Lovecraft than Lovecraft himself.\n\nWithout Greene, Lovecraft is just some weird loner, buried in a pauper's grave, leaving behind a bunch of unremembered, half-finished, handwritten ideas for spooky tales.

            " My parents tried to force me to be what they wanted me to be. I was never going to be that person. It bothered me late into my adult life that I was never the person they wanted. All because I wanted different things out of life. It caused me years of depression, anxiety, and apathy.\n\nBecause of this, I swore I would never force anything upon my children. I swore I would give them every opportunity to be themselves and be a part of whatever activity they wanted to do. For the most part this has worked out, I only struggle with one decision by one child.\n\nPart of what my parents imposed on me was forbidding everything. I wanted to play sports, act, and sing. None of those things were allowed. So naturally when my kids wanted to act, play instruments, sing in chorus, and be on sports teams I was overjoyed.\n\nThe trouble is I have this one very talented football player who doesn\u2019t want to play football. This has been very difficult to accept but I have pushed down my own desires. Again, it hasn\u2019t been easy. The boy isn\u2019t just good. He is All-State as a freshman good. He is able to compete against guys in higher leagues good. He won a nice stack of trophies while he was playing. And now he says he doesn\u2019t like it. I can see him playing football to earn a free college degree. I can even see him having the potential to be a professional. And it\u2019s not me making it up. He is for real. But he doesn\u2019t want to play. My dream would be to be in his shoes. But he simply hates everything that surrounds football.\n\nSo I stuff down the disappointment of not getting to watch my son play football at a high level and replace it with pride that he can stand up for himself and say what he wants. He is facing tremendous peer pressure to continue playing. Grown men are calling him stupid. His mother is offering him money to play. But he wants to do other things. And I\u2019m not going to be the one who forces him to do something else. If I respect his wishes and let him decide his own life he may lead himself back to football. Whether he does or does not will not make a difference to me now. The hardest thing as a parent is letting go.

This caused me to be extremely critical about my own looks, picking apart every actual and perceived flaw.\n\n\\-I was (and still am to a degree) very sensitive.

I assure you that whenever my mother or my father comes near me I would have a panic attack and wished that they could disappear because I felt an unpleasant feeling within me. It was a really mixed emotion and I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it so all I did was just endure the pain mentally. I was certainly lucky that I didn\u2019t know what I was feeling so one night I told my mom how I felt about the situation she didn\u2019t know how to handle it but she told me that she was sorry and that she loves me. I didn\u2019t know how much I cried since that moment but it really felt like a truck load was lifted up my back. Now that I\u2019m older I think what I had experienced was anxiety as a child.

            "[That Diana Ross and Smokey Robinson are Michael Jackson's actual parents.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnAmericanScheme/comments/fjn2ql/an_american_scheme_youtube_channel/) That's why he was the talent in the Jackson family and why there were rumors that he was Evan Ross's father (they both look like Diana). Smokey would've been 18 and Diana 14 years old when Michael was born so Berry Gordy arranged to have the kid given to his old boxing buddy and fellow musician from Chicago, Joe Jackson, who he would fund leading to the formation of the Jackson 5. Joe had a big family where Michael would get everything he needs while training him to be an entertainer and Motown could protect their image by taking the child out of the picture.\n\nIt turns out the kid is a talent and as we all know the Jackson 5 make it to Motown, but even before that there were several documented instances of Diana Ross in Gary, Indiana such as at the school talent show where the Jackson 5 performed. She has said multiple times on live television that Michael is her baby/child, says she's doing it all for him, and joked about him playing her son in a future movie. She has also said publically she was in love with Smokey Robinson growing up, living on the same street as him in Detroit, which is odd because he had a girlfriend during that time who he later married. Diana also changed high schools around the time Michael was conceived (when she would have gotten pregnant). She was going to Cass-Tech to study home economics and Smokey also enrolled in an engineering college around this time, because they were soon to be parents and Motown hadn't broke big yet. A decade later the Jackson 5 auditioned for Motown in Detroit, then did a second performance at a Motown get-together at Berry's house, and Michael has stated that at that point Diana told them she wanted to take special interest in their career.\n\nThere's a movie called Double Platinum which stars Diana Ross and is about how she gave up her kid for her career and later reveals to the kid she's her mother when she sees that the kid has talent, then goes on to help her with her career which would parallel the real life story with Michael. Her daughter in the movie also wears a dress that has the same design as the shirt Michael wore for Billie Jean at Motown 25. It's written by Michael in his autobiography Moonwalk that he and the Jacksons lived with Diana Ross in Hollywood Hills when the Jackson 5 first signed to Motown and moved to LA, and her and Michael used to go out almost every day, just the two of them. This would have been when Diana Ross revealed to Michael she's his mom, he would've been about 10 years old and that's why he became quiet and shy from then on. (This wouldn't be her only time doing this, when she had a daughter with Berry Gordy she didn't tell her who her father was until she was 13.) Smokey Robinson also stated when he was leaving the Larry King interview shortly after Michael passed away that one of his fondest memories of Michael was when he used to go golfing at the age of 10 or 11 with him and Bobby Taylor, who is said to have discovered the Jackson 5 even though their first album at Motown was presented by Diana Ross. \n\nThis was also what Michael meant in the song Billie Jean when \"this happened much too soon, she called me to her room\". Diana was the one who said \"I am the one, but the kid is not my son\". She meant I am your mother but you're not my son, you're a Jackson now. Diana Ross is Billie Jean (Diana plays the singer Billie Holiday in 'Lady Sings the Blues' which came out a few years before 'The Wiz' with MJ). This is also what the song Dirty Diana is about, it's about Diana Ross the groupie who seduces Smokey Robinson, who she grew up on the same street as, conceiving Michael. Then there's the song Who Is It which is about a mystery person who abandoned Michael, and in the music video he holds a card that says 'Diana'. The song Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' also talks about how \"if you can't feed your baby, then don't have a baby\" and again refers to the mystery Billie Jean character. He references Ain't No Mountain High Enough in the song Leave Me Alone and says \"Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama\". He also references Ain't No Mountain High Enough in the songs Baby Be Mine, Speechless, and Keep The Faith. This is all also why you see a weird sexual dynamic between Michael Jackson and Diana Ross but you will never actually see a picture or video of them making out.\n\nRecently a video surfaced of Diana Ross singing You Are Not Alone to Katherine Jackson; just like how she probably used to sing Ain't No Mountain High Enough to Michael when he was living with her. This is seen in the aforementioned movie Double Platinum as well, Diana sings her lost daughter to sleep with a famous song. And in TMZ's video \"The Last Time We Saw Joe Jackson\" an old senile Joe says \"I raised Michael, he's my son and Quincy Jones knows better. I don't talk about it, no way.\" He's defending the supposed fact that Michael is his son for a seemingly unknown reason, and even in past interviews he always emphasized \"he's a JACKSON\". After MJ's death, Joe when interviewed said he was doing great, meanwhile Smokey Robinson went on the Larry King show and praised MJ as an artist.\n\nThis theory explains why Michael not only [looks like Diana Ross](http://imgur.com/gallery/uBQB2DO) and has the [same features](http://imgur.com/a/HDLEza5) and [eyes as her](https://youtu.be/lwDF66GUerA), but also explains why his [facial structure looks like Smokey's](http://imgur.com/gallery/IlxojfH) & [their profiles and ears are completely identical,](http://imgur.com/gallery/Rn6Vfhd) and why he was a musical prodigy who had the stage presence and songwriting abilities of his real parents (Diana, Smokey & Michael are the only three musicians besides the Beatles who have two stars each on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - one for being a member of their original groups and one to celebrate their success as a solo artist), as well as having a very soft voice which both Smokey and Diana (and Evan Ross!) have in common. [Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/6lAYMTB) you can see how much different his eyes looked from his brothers and how much they look like Ross eyes. Now you can see why his personality developed the way it did. It's why he acted like an orphan and called himself Peter Pan and built Neverland to help disadvantaged kids, why he isolated himself from his family and could never manage to have a normal relationship with women. It absolutely explains why he had such a severe identity crisis. And it explains why Diana Ross is second to Katherine Jackson in his will regarding who would take care of his children, and why Joe Jackson has been known to dislike Diana Ross. At Michael Jackson's public memorial the first person that comes out is Smokey Robinson reading a letter from Diana Ross, who writes that she's mourning so hard that she cannot attend the memorial and that Michael was \"part of the fabric of her life\". When Smokey speaks about MJ later he calls him his little brother, which would imply blood relative. In the movie Hitsville USA: The Making of Motown, Berry Gordy jokes with Smokey about how some of the babies that the groupies were having were his & that MJ reminded him of a little Smokey. Also, the movie An American Dream was about the Jackson 5 and would've been propaganda to reinforce the coverup story. \n\nSo, it wasn't that Michael was ever trying to look like Diana Ross like people thought, he was actually displaying features and mannerisms that he INHERITED from her. In one of the clips below she says he has the same features, skin tone, and bone structure as her. Now you might say well Janet looks a lot like MJ, but growing up in his shadow she adopted many of his mannerisms and used makeup and plastic surgery to replicate his appearance (like Latoya did) but their vanity was merely deception. Joe and Berry branded and marketed the Jacksons a certain way to make Michael seem related, such as with the matching outfits and afros, but if you look at their features it's clear the only similarity to Michael is the way they smile (a learned trait). MJ has much more defined features and is rail thin like Diana Ross, and his [nose & chin](https://imgur.com/gallery/cRjoLIs) match Smokey's. Now it's clear why Joe told him he had a fat nose and singled him out so much with the abuse.\n\n[MJ does a photoshoot with Katherine, Joe, Diana, and Smokey](http://imgur.com/gallery/paJffQB)\n\n[Diana Ross calls MJ her child, says she's doing it all for him](https://youtu.be/7Q0wST2bdX8) (skip to 15:56)\n\n[Diana Ross jokes about Michael Jackson playing her son in a movie](https://youtu.be/FR9RZ74W4-U) (the intro downplays her role in starting his career, an important part of the coverup)\n\n[Diana Ross confesses her relationship with Smokey Robinson, which would have been when MJ was conceived and when Smokey was dating Claudette](https://youtu.be/y4CskzRdu1g) (skip to 8:40)\n\n[Diana Ross jokes about her and MJ having the same facial features and bone structure, \"he could be part of my family\"](https://youtu.be/jl6tWjt4k6k)\n\n[Diana Ross calls Michael Jackson her baby](https://youtu.be/jImFqAwYV7o)\n\n[Smokey Robinson recounts how MJ used to go golfing with him and Bobby Taylor as a kid](https://youtu.be/fC3GSlGU8yA)\n\n[Evan Ross says MJ was like a brother to him and that Diana was a mother figure to Michael](https://youtu.be/sEegez0DZJA)\n\n[Joe Jackson defends the fact that Michael is his son when confronted by paparazzi](https://youtu.be/lXjVWUF2VBM)\n\n[Smokey Robinson reads Diana Ross's letter at the beginning of Michael Jackson's memorial](https://youtu.be/tylsIvGK6cg)\n\nThis theory is from a YouTube channel called [An American Scheme](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrVF7iUNgd-U15IfdHHDuoLYOpxPg6Pg).

            "I was on the fence about this one until I watched 'The Last Narc' but now I absolutely believe the theory about the CIA being responsible for the death of DEA agent Kiki Camarena. His death in 1985 helped spark the war on drugs because he was allegedly murdered by mexican drug traffickers and the DFS, which was a largely corrupt police force at the time. However some people think the CIA actually murdered him, or at least helped the drug cartel kidnap him. There are multiple witnesses who were there during his murder who place a CIA agent there. The motive would have been because agent Camarena was close to uncovering the Iran-Contra affair, or something similar involving the CIA using drug money to fund arms sales. The evidence presented in the doc is pretty damning and I was fully expecting someone to have discredited the witnesses or called out shoddy research or something after it came out, because it's just so wild, but so far everything presented seems on the up and up.",

Parts about the cold war and the spread of Communism are referenced (everybody's Russian) and to top it all off, in the hotel that morning JFK declined a breakfast of sausage, eggs and toast for a bowl of Bran Flakes instead (got to have my bowl\u2014got to have cereal). Also, the following Monday JFK was supposed to sign a bill into law requiring all public schools to provide bus transportation for their students (got to catch my bus...)",

            "I hate to say this one because it\u2019s probably the most ridiculous but I genuinely believe that Trump family being time travelers is **possible**.  The background behind the conspiracy is somewhat uncanny and all the sources are incredibly legitimate. But I never hear about it. \n\nPretty much, it starts with an author from the late 1800s (Ingersoll Lockwood) who wrote a handful of books. The first is a fantasy book called \u201cThe Marvelous Adventures of Baron Trump\u201d about a \u201cBaron Trump\u201d who was mentored by a \u201cDon\u201d. \u201cBaron\u201d and \u201cDon\u201d are technically titles in the book, but also the name of Trump and his youngest son. The book touches on some issues with power and vanity by leaders in power, and creates a huge parallel between fantasy and generally shitty/arrogant people. Not a lot of connection there except the names and essentially describing Trump in the fantasy characters. \n\nThe other important book is the one that hits home, \u201cThe Last President\u201d, by the exact same author, is about a wealthy man in NY who is elected president, but he wasn\u2019t expected to and people are incredibly upset, rioting, etc., mostly over capitalists taking over the country. Chapter one literally opens up with riots overpowering police after an election on **November 3rd**, 1896, saying that \u201cthe 5th Avenue hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob\u201d.\n\nNow, some connections beyond the obvious:\n- November 3rd, 2020 happens to be Election Day this year \n- The 5th Avenue hotel mentioned in the book has been replaced by none other than Trump Tower\n- The secretary in the book is \u201cLafe Pence\u201d\n\nCoincidence, right?  Well, fast forward a bit because in the 1940s before he died, Nikola Tesla had made tons of other invention claims, like perfecting his \u201cdeath beam\u201d, progress in a time machine, etc. Also during that time, the FBI had an \u201cOffice of Alien Property\u201d (like foreign - not UFOs) from which the assistant FBI Director Foxworth had sent people to seize all of Tesla\u2019s research shortly after he died, in hopes some of it may be useful. \n\nWelllll, after seizing it, they hired none other than Dr John Trump (Donald Trump\u2019s uncle) to solely analyze all the paperwork under federal custody to keep privacy.  Dr. Trump publicly claimed that the research was only speculative and \u201cdid not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results\u201d. The Tesla papers were never published and, after a few decades, majority of his research was deemed \u201clost\u201d by both the US government and the Soviet Union and what remains is somewhere in Yugoslavia, I believe at a museum. \n\nSo essentially, the idea is that Trump\u2019s uncle discovered time travel through Tesla\u2019s research and hid/copied what was valuable (or dangerous) to keep out of government control. Then him, Baron, or someone (or all?) in the family has used it to create the wealth that the Trump family has. Theoretically, time travel may not work like we see in movies so what they can accomplish could be limited to a few good choices and leaving their mark behind in these books. \n\nEDIT:  That was a long type so I\u2019m not going to go start copying/pasting sources on mobile, but the books/author can be found scanned free to read on the Library of Congress website and the info about Trump\u2019s uncle is in multiple spots all over the internet. I absolutely recommend reading The Last President. It is short and mirrors current society very much. The quotes referencing Trump tower give me chills.",

A guy standing up in the back lurched forward and pulled the trigger by accident. This shot hit the president. He had already been hit twice and was pretty much toast, so it didn't matter.

The prosecution claimed the injuries were consistent with two knives being used and produced a stiletto knife -good for stabbing but not cutting- and a Swiss Army knife -not really good for hurting anyone other than yourself.

The only evidence found in O.J.'s home were a few drops of his own blood which were contaminated with a preservative used in blood draws.\n\nJason did it: \n\nMeans: Jason was employed as a sous-chef and had his own knife set and also owned a double-edged combat knife.\n\nMotive: Jason was cooking alone at his restaurant that night and had specifically invited Nicole to come see him cook. She stood him up and went to Mezzaluna where Ron Goldman worked. Jason was known to be bothered by Nicole seeing men other than his father.\n\nOpportunity: Jason's timecard that night was handwritten for a time much later than when the restaurant shut down. His alibi changed multiple times, but the last time anyone can definitely account for him is around 9:30 that night.\n\nThe kicker? The day after the murders, O.J. retained one of L.A.'s top criminal defense attorneys for Jason and did not hire his own defense attorney until several days later.",

In my previous relationship I felt awfully critiqued for just being the person who I was, and that critique would often make me feel guilty for not meeting the standards set for me by my SO.

This was very new for me at the time and hasn't changed.\n\nAfter 20 years of marriage he still accepts me 100% yet makes me want to be a better person.\n\nPlus he's funny af.

I walked out of the bathroom and he was standing in the doorway of the room and said something like \u201cis everything okay?

And lastly, I\u2019m a veggie, so he started ordering plant based meals when we were out (I love sharing food because I hate picking one thing from a menu), and learning to cook food I can eat - no judgement or expectations to change.",

            "I\u2019ve (26M) been in abusive relationships before this, and it was not until this partner of mine that I really understood what it was like to be in a completely happy, safe relationship. \nI knew that I wanted to spend more time with this girl the instant I saw her, and by the time we met a second time, we were already joking about marriage. Soon enough, it wasn\u2019t a joke.\nWe listen to each other and respect each other. If something is getting too much for me, I still have the ability to tell her and for her not to feel bad about it. She goes out of her way to try the games and shows that interest me, even if they\u2019re out of her comfort zone. She actively asks me what I want to do and she\u2019s perfectly happy to do them, simply because they\u2019re with me. \nMore than anything, it\u2019s more that we both have this solid idea in our head that whatever we do, ultimately we want to be with each other. There\u2019s no doubt, or suspicion, or feeling that doom is just around the corner. We want each other, and we\u2019re willing to work for it. And I think this is the first time I haven\u2019t had to settle for someone loving me less than I love them. Because when you love someone, it\u2019s not wrong to want them to reciprocate what you\u2019re doing and feeling.",

We have had some challenges in our marriage, but we are still going strong into the double-digit years.",

Which means if things need to be unequal in one way or other, we work on balancing it out. \n\nI've never been able to be as completely myself before, as I can be with her.\n\nConsidering we'd been dating six weeks before lockdown came in, and threw caution to the wind and moved in together for the duration (yes, all the lesbian stereotypes...), I feel like I've used up all my luck for the foreseeable on this one!",

I have bipolar and it sent me into a really bad depressive spiral. He dealt with it amazingly - stayed with me when I needed it despite me being a useless lump, respected when I didn\u2019t want to talk/do anything, helped me with the gross part of depression (aka lack of showering), etc. It was above and beyond and I never would\u2019ve expected that kind of treatment from anyone let alone someone I had met a month ago.

Like, not that \"I just cleaned the place for the first time in months\" look but \"I'm a neat person in general\" look. He'd also made a lasagna from scratch for our date. \n\nFor me, the fact that he was a grown man, living on his own and he knew how to keep his place clean and to cook was a green flag. This was not a man I was going to have to \"mom\" or argue about the disparity of chores. \n\nMy exhusband was the exact opposite so it was a breath of fresh air.",

She is literally the best.\n\n* She is extroverted, I am introverted. She totally accepts me being quiet in front of others and has yet to be negative about it.",

If they can listen, explain themselves, and care about your feelings, and understand why you might be thinking the way you\u2019re thinking, they are keepers. I feel like lately we are programmed to think the worst of people. Voice your concerns. Communication is the number 1 key to a great relationship I feel.",

He encourages and supports me to do my best and follow my dreams, even if that makes things tougher for him for a while (he supported me while I was/am studying). We both have the exact same stupid sense of humour and he makes me laugh every single day.

She was still close with several friends who she'd had since childhood, high school, college, etc, despite having moved inter-state multiple times, and she was still making new friends. \n\nKeeping friendships active takes a lot of traits that are important in a relationship partner: good communication, being able to articulate your feelings, empathy, etc.\n\nThe only downside in having a partner like that is that their guest list at your wedding is huge!",

            "Right from the first date, I had a good feeling. \n\nWe have really similar tastes. He could stomach embarrassing the hell out of himself and roll with it. Similar humour, willing to listen. We could talk and talk forever. Politically speaking, I lean fairly liberal whereas he\u2019s more libertarian, so we balance each other out. \n\nWe\u2019ve worked out some toxic traits that we brought to the relationship, and we are always striving to grow together as a unit. We moved in together fairly quickly, around four months after we  started dating. I was escaping a toxic home life, and he stepped up to the plate, took a leap of faith with me. I never forgot it.\n\nWe lived in a studio apartment at first, so there were no doors to slam. It was one hell of a crash course in cohabitation and conflict resolution. We came out of that situation much stronger for it, but I know that lack of privacy/space can break a couple. \n\nWe\u2019ll be celebrating six years together in January, and got married two and a half years ago :)",

The green flag that pops out the most is when I biked to the restaurant we met at, she noticed my helmet straps were loose. They\u2019d always been sort of messed up. Anyways she spent a good 5 minutes fixing them and finally got it to strap properly. It\u2019s silly, but I just loved that she cared enough about my safety to do that. \n\nOther than that major green flags for me are: not arguing that much at all (some people say it\u2019s healthy to argue but we just don\u2019t disagree on much at all), if we do argue we always, always resolve it and make up before going to sleep. \n\nWe also were long distance for a couple years and would talk on the phone/Skype for 30 mins- and hour every day. Strengthening our communication like that was a definite green flag. I used to have a little notepad where I\u2019d write things I wanted to remember to tell her about on our daily call. \n\nLastly, early on a big green flag was her being proud to show me off to her friends and family.",

His ex was trying to get on disability after him having supported her for years. He moved out, but kept working and sending her most of his money for over a year till the disability payments came through.\n\nMost people thought that was gullible of him, but it was a gesture of pure kindness. He didn't want her to lose her housing or anything just because they didn't work out. I started falling for him because of that. I knew that even if we didn't work out, he wouldn't leave me destitute or stranded. I felt safe taking a chance on him as our relationship developed.

I found out what he's like when he wants something, and how he is when someone else wants the thing he also wants.  I found out how well he can follow instructions, and how much he can be a team player.  I watched him raid for six months before I asked him out and it was a fantastic decision.\n\nIf you don't play MMOs, take your partner to a difficult escape room, especially one that needs multiple people acting together to solve.

            "Even early on, I would notice that my husband would do small little things (without telling me) that would help me in some way. Randomly check my fluid levels in my car, grab the nicer piece of meat for my plate, get the brand of coffee I like rather than the one he prefers, etc. It became obvious that he would literally give the shirt off his back for me at the drop of a hat; which I know is how he expresses love. He is very selfless in general, which is a huge green flag to me bc I can see that he is very empathetic.\n\nThis, and he is an extremely good tipper.\n\nEdit bc I forgot a really good example: his job has 24 hour shifts, and the day before he goes in to work, he will make me a full dinner to heat up the next day while he\u2019s gone. Not extra dinner from what we\u2019re having that day, a whole separate dinner that he\u2019ll never get to eat, because he wants to make sure I have something nice to eat while he\u2019s gone (he loves cooking)\n\nEdit again: also, he does things with me that normally he would think were cheesy or stupid, like having a snapchat streak or having a birthday party for our cat. It\u2019s not his thing, but he\u2019ll make any exception to spend time with me and make me happy!\n\nLast edit: wow, I really love my husband!!",

If there's a pattern of worrisome behaviour from either of us , we discuss it as a concern and adjust but he never blames me for mistakes I've made. \n\n* listened and followed through when I said he needed to speak to a doctor about his mental health and anxiety.

Granted, other people have had it much worse than me, but I'd never been in such a one-sided, heartless, untrusting relationship before and it had hurt me. I had come out to my (now ex) girlfriend about being pansexual, and after a week of the silent treatment, she broke up with be because she \"couldn't trust that I wouldn't be attracted to guys while dating her.\" This affected me more than I'd like to admit. I had been slowly growing comfortable in my sexuality and this was a low blow. I felt worthless. Although I was glad the relationship was over because, to be frank, I had just been scared to break it off with her for weeks, but the explanation she gave me struck me to the core.\n\nThen came the best relationship of my life. We met on Tinder (I know, very romantic), and when I had swiped right, I was sure there would be no way she would too, because from what I could tell by her profile, she seemed exactly my type. Shortly after we matched, I told her that I was pan and she was instantly accepting. Our first date was in a tiny little study room at our university library, but we hit it off so well that we stayed in that room until around 2 AM, moved the date to the musical practice rooms nearby, and remained drunk in each other's presence until about 4 AM. Neither of us went for a kiss or anything, but the date felt perfect to me. My cheeks hurt from smiling and I almost felt as though the date had been too short.\n\nThis December is our 1 year anniversary! I know it may seem early, but I'm already itching to propose. Of course, I'm going to be responsible and wait to do so until we're both emotionally and financially ready for a commitment like that (probably at least 3 years down the line), but I just can't wait. I feel like I've known her for a thousand lifetimes but also like I haven't come close to spending enough time with her. She graduated last year and moved back home with her family in another state for quarantine, so I've seen her in person twice since February. It seriously hurts, but it makes every time I see her that more amazing. \n\nTo answer the question in a more cohesive manner that isn't a lovesick ramble, the biggest green flags were that she accepted me for who I am from the get go, and that the first date just felt absolutely perfect.",

My temperature regulation was completely off, too. I'd be cold and shaking after returning from a bathroom trip, and after warming up in bed I'd be too hot and feeling sick because of it. I didn't start feeling human again until literally 7pm.\n\nDespite feeling worse for wear himself, he was a saint. He knew exactly when to give me space, when to snuggle up to me, and when to be verbally sympathetic and supportive. He didn't get annoyed by me coming back to bed ice cold and wanting to steal his warmth, or only being able to lie on one side because the other side made me too nauseous, or generally being miserable and no fun and incapable of doing anything. He kept me company all day and we watched a fuckload of Brooklyn 99 on Netflix.\n\nHe offered to order me Subway for lunch, and when I said the thought of food was making me feel ill he just ordered for himself and ate it downstairs so that the smell didn't bother me. And ordered surprise cookies in case I felt better later.\n\nAnd then when I was finally feeling up to food, he went to the supermarket in search of ice lollies and ravioli, which were the only things I felt my stomach could handle. \n\nI was utterly miserable and it was all my own stupid fault, but he was so sweet and made me feel so loved and cared for. \u2764\ufe0f",

When I met my now-husband, I would try to pick fights with him, because I thought that's just how life was, arguing all the time.  He would just calmly talk me through it, and after a while of that, I realized that yelling all the time wasn't actually normal.  \n\nThat, and the fact that his parents were (and are) still together and still loved each other.  It actually took me a couple years to convince myself that they weren't faking it, and actually did get along.",
            "We met on an English teaching course. One of the other teachers hadn't made friends with any of us and he was the first to notice. After we went for a dinner (all the teachers) he invited this guy to join us for the day (about four of us who had also just met - we weren't dating yet) \n\nI saw how good he was teaching the kids and giving up his time for them.\n\nHe joined in with all the embarrassing silly tasks we had to do to entertain them (on one occasion we acted as Shrek and Fiona, another he had to dance).\n\nOne day I was stressed as I had to fill out an important form which wasn't loading and he realised as he walked passed so he came over, sat with me and started trying to help.\n\nOne night he was sleeping in my bed for the first time (it was a shared room so it was me and a friend in the room normally but this night he was there too). I wasn't entirely comfortable enough to sleep under the blanket together as it felt too serious and so he slept on top of the blanket with me for me. When I got cold he gave me a jumper without me saying anything. \n\nHe also got me out of a situation where my drink was spiked one night and half carried me back safely.",
            "I told him about my abuse and he cried thinking of how I suffered. \n\nHe puts his face on our cats to feel the fuzzy and baby talks my cats.\n\n He usually is my voice of reason when Im upset and usually first to say sorry even when the fight is my fault (I take stimulants for cfs, and bunch of meds for a chronic virus I have and makes me moody).\n\n I'm often sick and he will cook, clean and help me in any way he can including back rubs and neck rubs especially when my emergency prescription migraine meds don't help. \n\nHe always does the dishes everyday, answers the phone when I or his parents call and makes sure our cats are well taken care of. \n\nI got really sick and our sex life has suffered, I started feeling extremely insecure and lost my job because I could barely stay awake at work regardless of sleep amount. He stepped up, pays for 75% of everything, has been extreamly loyal despite our sex life suffering, and goes out of his way to show he cares. \n\nHe makes sure I drink enough water everyday. \n\nHugs are daily. \n\nOnly time I've ever seen him truely angry is when I was at risk of safety or belongings. \n\nHe's a terrible cook for veggies and sweets but tries anyways lol but he does cook meat well usually. It's mostly he's bad at seasoning and is often times a charcoal chef, but he tries. \n\nHe's always willing to learn 'how to be a better boyfriend' even if I've not improved. \n\nHe's stuck it out 4 years despite me being sick, not once has he been disloyal. \n\nHe's always trying to help me feel better, and holds out hope I'll get better. \n\nHe's got a wildlife biology degree lol idk big green flag to me is a guy who loves animals. \n\nHe's very fit and mentally stable, he litterly lifts his depression away lol about 250-300lbs of lifting \n\nHis phone is full of cat pictures and candid photos of me or me sleeping\n\nHe always helps his parents when asked \n\nSleeping cat on the bed means he's probably snuggling them and will reposition to make sure cat is comfy \n\nHes slept on the bedroom floor few times when cats and I take up the whole bed and he wishes to not disturb. \n\nHe rarely if ever swears \n\nHe reads a lot of books\n\nHe's very kissy \n\nIf I'm asleep and he's not, he makes sure anything is quite, and usually has the urge to snuggle for awhile\n\nHe's really snuggly \n\nHe's never raged \n\nHe respects my opinion, and listens even if he doesn't agree\n\nHe is 1ft 2 inches taller than me and uses it to play pranks on me but also always comes to reach things I can't without a stool because it's safer. \n\nHe always helps the old ladies at the grocery store to reach items too. (He's asked a lot too lol) \n\nHe's very shy despite being well above average in looks. \n\nHe sleeps holding a pillow if he's not holding me. \n\nHe hates driving but does most the driving still. Not because I'm a bad driver lol I'm almost 30 and never had a car accident and no tickets, he just does it to be kind. He also had a squeeky clean record. \n\nHe is usually honest even if it's not what I wanna hear. \n\nIf I ask for help he usually does it. \n\nHe tries his best to understand why something is important to me, even if he doesn't understand he tries to help or do it. \n\n\nI probably have a longer list but overall, he's got plenty of flaws to I'm not dating Mr perfect so don't try and steal him lmao but he has plenty of good qualities.\n\n\nBut my most defining moment I saw him as good is the fact he cries anytime I tell him about my difficult past or the idea he could lose me to illness."

Fairly easy, no splashing, no over stretching, didn't even have to push. Overall, 7/10.",
            "They're actually how I decided to use Reddit.

            "All I have to say is,\n\nHi YouTube",
            "I've talked about this on a silimar thread, but I think it's weird, especially since I've had a lot of my comments on them that I was not aware of.\n\nIn the past people used to reach out to me asking for permission to feature my comment on their YouTube channel, for example Top15s, with almost 3.5 million subscribers, was one of them. I'm totally okay with that because they asked and they would send me a link later on to the video so I can check out how they used my comment. Usually these channels make some sort of effort to make the comments come alive using stock videos/animations and a great voice to read them.\n\nNow people just rip threads and use text to speech to say all the top comments with absolutely no effort at all. I don't care for that at all. If you're going to take other people's comments without permission then at least show some effort. But then again Instagram meme pages have been doing this for years now and people make a living doing this because it's so easy.\n\nWhat's even weirder is some people have bots or alt accounts that message you after the fact saying something like, \"Hey check it out, you're in this video! Totally awesome!\" making it seem like random redditor reaching out that saw you, but it's not. I know because I've recieved the same message 4 times from different accounts linking to the same YouTube channel they are trying to grow.\n\nI took [a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/qAfOHy8.png) the last time something like this happened, but to be fair to this guy he did say he would delete if asked, but who knows if that's true since they were using two throwaway accounts.",

            "I prefer actual human voices over robotic voices. Also, I bet YouTubers who only upload those kinds of videos are going to freak out after seeing this post.",
            "I fucking HATE them. They use absolutely NO discretion whatsoever and only want to make money. One of them took comments from a post called \"what was the most hurtful thing someone has ever said to you?\" which is not something to make money off of. They took my comment about something that was one of the most traumatic moments in my life without giving a damn about me is is now making money off it. I didn't even know they did this until I started getting a bunch of private messages on Reddit one day regarding the comment that I made a few months prior. I started asking people why they were randomly messaging me and they pointed me to the video. I tried to get the guy who made the video to take it out of the video because it's not something I want out there without my prior approval and they basically laughed, said they were enjoying making money off of me and pointed me to some page on Reddit that said comments made belong to Reddit once they are posted, not the person who posted them. So I can't even delete it now (I should have been more careful, I know, things on the Internet tend to stay on the Internet). I still get comments from people trying to \"comfort\" me about it and pry into my life. I've even gotten a few really creepy private messages from guys who are like \"I'll make you feel better, baby.\" which is all the more traumatic and fucking creepy. Fuck those Youtube channels. I hope they rot.",
            "I like them. [I've even been in one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o3yne5jL3M&feature=youtu.be&t=269)\n\nWhat I don't like is the ones that use a robot voice. If it's just a robot reading a reddit post for me, I could just open the thread myself and let Google have a shot at it. But with a human reading it out in a fitting voice? With a short reaction inbetween stories? Yeah, I'll watch that occasionally.\n\nI like to put my phone in a clear ziploc bag and hang it on my shower curtain rod and run one of those videos to have something going on while I shower. (My showers take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes so I might as well listen to something.) Only annoying thing is trying to squint at the screen and tap through the bag to skip the ads... I'm nearsighted as fuck and the bag fogs up / gets water droplets on it so it's hard to see and hard to hit without my glasses.\n\nActually, other annoying thing is that I like to read the subreddits I like to listen to, and sometimes get duplicate stories. Skipping them in the shower is also hard.\n\nTL;DR text to speech can heck off but human reading it out loud can be entertaining",
            "I am morally opposed to anyone earning money for content they neither created nor have obtained permission to repackage and sell.\n\nIt\u2019s like justifying shoplifting because you\u2019re only stealing penny candy, even though you\u2019re doing it by the handful, several times a week. And I\u2019m *more* upset by the *narcissistic disregard* it shows than I am about the monetary factors.\n\nAnyone doing it can only do so by lying to themselves that it\u2019s not a big deal, and not important. The *only* person who is allowed to make that decision is the one infringed upon, no matter *how many* others can\u2019t be bothered to care. And yes, content rights are signed away all the time in Terms of Service/User rights agreements, but note the key word here: __agreements__.\n\nYour rights don\u2019t vanish in a puff of smoke just because you\u2019re walking around in public. No one can grab a scrap of paper out of your hand because they think your going to throw it away. Auto repair shops are *required* to honor your request to return broken parts, or it\u2019s outright stealing. \n\n:::::::::::::::\n\nImagine you\u2019re a beginning, struggling sketch artist, and you join a casual, open-membership critique group. You know anyone could show up, but you have a very specific idea of who is actually *there*, and it\u2019s one of the strongest factors that determines *what* you share.\n\nSay (for the sake of the analogy), that someone asks you a question, and you create a quick sketch in about five minutes. Maybe you surprise yourself with the subtlety you managed this particular time, or maybe you don\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s a portrait of a long lost friend, and you capture a facial expression of theirs that you forgot they used to make, or maybe you don\u2019t. Maybe you\u2019ve poured a deeper part of yourself into it than you thought you would, or maybe you don\u2019t. In any case, none of that is relevant, so you say nothing about it. Since the sketch was a response to a question, you hand it over.\n\nNow the questioner asks to borrow the sketch until the next meeting, so they can carefully study your answer to their question. You\u2019re hesitant (or maybe you\u2019re not), but it\u2019s not a big deal, so you give no indication of whether you have any hangups about lending it for a week.\n\nNow imagine that you\u2019ve forgotten about the sketch, and don\u2019t realize that it is never returned. Now, maybe it\u2019s the first sketch in which you mastered a particular subtlety, and it captures the essence of your view of a particular technique, or maybe it doesn\u2019t. Maybe, if you\u2019d never lost it, you would have hung it on the wall as a beautifully sincere distillation of a single facet of the human condition, or maybe you wouldn\u2019t have.\n\nNow imagine, years later, you find out that the questioner has somehow found a way to market and sell amateur art as \u201csincere\u201d, \u201creal\u201d, and \u201cfrom a place of unrefined passion\u201d. He is a city-wide curator for such art, and eeks out a living finding and making prints of sketchbook-quality doodles that *just so happen* to transcend the original artist\u2019s typical skill level.\n\nYou read an article about him in the news, and right at the top is a large photo of him standing by his fireplace, with your sketch hanging over the mantle. In the article, he tells the interviewer that your sketch was one of his earliest acquisitions, and he even states your name, though it\u2019s a very common one that doesn\u2019t do a lot to distinguish who you actually are.\n\nAnd then he tells the interviewer that your sketch is one of his most popular, selling dozens of prints a month. He phrases the story in such a way that readers will assume you gifted him the sketch, because he convinced himself that the handover was casual and vague\u2014because *you* never imagined that casual, vague handovers required written contracts, *especially considering that the borrower stated, categorically, that they would return the item in one week*.\n\nNow imagine that his vague language concerning the provenance of all his acquisitions allows him to subtly convince his customers that vague handovers are as good as a contract, and that several artists have come forward and stated that, while they had intended the works to be on loan, the unauthorized change-of-ownership is no big deal, now that they consider it after the fact.\n\nNow imagine that some tragedy has occurred in your life very recently, and seeing that sketch again, in the newspaper, has rekindled memories you\u2019ve long forgotten, and you weep for *hours* at how well that sketch captures *exactly how you feel right now*. Or maybe no tragedy has occurred and you don\u2019t weep. But you remember the sketch, and that he said he was only going to borrow it for a week. Or maybe you don\u2019t remember the sketch, even after reading the article and skimming past your name.\n\nBut one thing is certain: you never would have tried to make money off of it\u2014sharing is one thing; commercialization is something else entirely. No one else gets to decide why *you* shared it, and then assume they\u2019re unerringly correct about your intentions or valuations.\n\nThe fact is, how much that sketch influences your life, even *after* you forget it exists, has absolutely __NO__ bearing on the situation. \u201cPublic square\u201d communication has always been made without expectation of privacy, but no one assumes their personal/apersonal life stories are going to be printed onto t-shirts, posters, and coffee mugs. Indeed, it\u2019s illegal, and the perpetrators, benefactors, and a small sample of nonplussed victims are the *exact group of people* least justified in deeming the theft as \u201cno big deal\u201d.",

Was always trying to fit in, kind of a poser but in an insecure way. I'll call him PumpkinPie for privacy reasons.\n\nSo one day PumpkinPie had the genius idea to impress his class and make them like him more... To get the chem/geography teacher and retrieve the exam question from his school account.\n\nHe used a USB stick with a program on it that retrieves saved passwords from most browsers - chrome, IE (edge wasn't a thing yet), firefox, etc. He waited for the perfect moment to plug it in; the teacher was taking a quick bathroom break.\n\nThe whole class saw it and he made up some excuse, don't remember what he said. Everyone kind of forgot about it.\n\nHe checked the teacher's school account every day for a couple months, until finally the teacher uploaded the exam questions.\nPumpkinPie downloaded the exams, then - and this is where he fucked up - he gave them to people in his class that he liked. Those people started talking, and eventually people from other classes started asking PumpkinPie if he could get the answers for their class too.\n\nSo then exams came round. He asked his classmates not to make it too obvious that they knew all the answers. Of course, they did. They all had way higher graden than usual.\n\nOne day he received a call from the school, which NEVER happened before. Basically they said \"Hi PumpkinPie, you need to come to the school and talk to the principal right now\". He asked \"why\"? And then his heart dropped as she said \"because it looks like you committed fraud\". Apparently they saw the discrepancy in the grades and went looking in the logs of the teacher's account access and found that it was accessed from an IP address which PumpkinPie also logged in from. Dumb fucker didn't even use a VPN.\n\nThen he realized how much he had fucked up - see, he had just turned 18, which meant that he would be treated as an adult should the police ever get involved.\n\nAnyway, he went to school and had a really hard decision to make. Either the whole class would have to redo the exam, or he gave the names of the people he gave the exams to and only they would have to retake it.\n\nHe chose the latter, and everyone hated him for it. Him and the classmates involved weren't invited to the graduation ceremony...\n\nOh and the hacked teacher was considering pressing charges for privacy violation. Somehow he managed to convince the teacher not to, he's so fucking lucky. \n\nAnyway, he was already insecure and at this point he just could look any of his classmates in the eyes anymore.\n\nHe ended up moving countries eventually...\n\nAnd now he uses a dumb alias online whenever he talks about it (something with a pumpkin), not sure why at this point since it's pretty obvious he's talking about himself.",

They occurred in the classroom and on a bus he drove for Sunday School kids.\n\nHe had a potential history of this stuff, but the school overlooked it. Creepy AF.\n\nEdit to add since this kinda blew up:\n\nIt was 400+ counts over 2 school years. Same girl. She was the daughter of another teacher/church staff who had already been abused by her grandfather in the past so she was an easier target due to previous abuse. \n\nI feel icky saying this: she was a minor and obviously this is all statutory rape, but her history made her more \u201cwilling\u201d to be used, which is why this went on for so long. She was sexually promiscuous in the community too, which isn\u2019t inappropriate in and of itself, but that sort of behavior is often the result of past trauma. Sexualized kids seem to think that acting in a sexual way somehow validates them as people or gives them power or makes them \u201cmore adult.\u201d It is a coping mechanism; someone took their power through sexual behavior, and they can try to \u201ctake the power back\u201d by being sexual \u201cas a \u2018choice,\u2019\u201dwhich is its own issue. Not to be too graphic, but if someone forces you to perform oral sex on them, that feels like\ngiving up power. *Choosing* to blow one hundred more guys (or one rapist one hundred times) to feel *powerful* when making that choice is a trauma response. You shouldn\u2019t have to do that to be \u201cin charge\u201d of your own sexuality.  **NOTE:** I say this as a person with a professional career in mental health AND as a survivor of sexual assault myself as an adolescent. I\u2019m not trying to armchair QB here, I\u2019ve lived this shit on both sides. I don\u2019t claim to have all the answers, but I will say I\u2019ve had several hells\u2019 worth of experience. It\u2019s a sticky subject, because every sexual assault victim will have a fucked up view of sex and intimacy if they\u2019ve had a history of sex being used to have power over themselves or they use it to feel powerful. \n\nThe situation ended when he was pretty much outed by another student or staff who left an anonymous letter demanding he resign or they would go to the police.

            "There were spiders and mice in my room which totally freaked me out so every night before I went to sleep I'd whisper a report of what the weather was outside to encourage them to go outside rather than stay inside and bite me in my sleep",
            "When I was in fourth grade (so around 9 or 10) at a private school, we used pinto beans as counters during math. Well, one day someone realized if you put a bean in water, it would sprout, and it became incredibly fashionable to keep a couple living bean sprouts hidden in your desk at all times. \n\nThis turned into a whole industry. Sneaking to the cabinet in the back and stealing the beans was risky, so people took on those roles. The beans were old, so getting them to actually sprout was valuable. Others would sneak the sprouts in and out of class to get sun. \n\nA boy's grandparents had bought him a science experiment kit that came with hundreds of these little plastic vials that stood up on their own. They were the perfect size for keeping a sprouted pinto bean, so he started trading them. Another two kids had water bottles with a straw that fit neatly into the vials and made it easy to water the sprouts. They turned it into a service. \n\nOne pretty talented group of girls started making houses out of paper and cardboard for the sprouts to \"live\" in. This allowed bean \"families\" to become a thing. Another girl realized that the houses meant there was a market for bean sprout furniture. Kids starting pulling textbooks out of their desks and stashing them around the classroom to make space for larger and larger houses. \n\nThe houses were a turning point, because they ran anywhere from $5 to $10, which was the first time anyone had charged real money for something instead of bartering. In addition, demand for sprouts went through the roof, since you could fit 4 or 5 in a house. The kid who had been successfully sprouting the beans is under immense pressure to produce, and we've crossed a threshold so people are willing to pay real money now. \n\nInto this high-pressure situation walks my classmate Julia. Julia brings a tiny bottle of purple liquid one day and tells bean-sprouter kid that it's the diluted slime of an extremely rare snail from the forests up north that she collected herself while camping with her family. It's such a strong fertilizer, even diluted, that one drop in each vial will guarantee that a bean will sprout; in addition, a drop to each already-sprouted bean will ensure a nice, green plant. There's enough for around 50 sprouts in there, but it's going to cost him $20 for the whole bottle. \n\nWell, if you're selling the sprouts at $1 each, $20 is a steal. So the kid comes back the next day with the cash, Julia gives him the fertilizer, and he puts a drop in each vial just before we leave to go home. \n\nThe next day, all his bean sprouts are dead, and he's pissed. Turns out the fertilizer was just Julia's mom's perfume, and it killed all the plants. Well, bean-sprouter kid is not the kind of person to take this laying down, so he goes to the teacher to tell her that he got conned. \n\nAnd the whole thing unravels. The teacher is upset that her students have been devoting hours of in-class time to beans. Parents are upset that money they thought was for snacks or field trips was for beans. The principal has to announce to the whole school that growing plants in your desk is now banned, which just confuses everyone else. And my class is angry at poor bean-sprouting kid for snitching and ruining everything. All their hard work is now in the trash. \n\nThe bean sprout industry never recovered.",

            "I used to eat tissues as a kid. My mum found out one day and yelled at me to stop, (as any sane parent would do) so I started eating them in secret. Sneaking away with a tissue box to another room to eat a tissue or two.\n\nUntil one day when I was about 5 years old I had to go to the hospital. I had no idea what was going on all I knew was that I had trouble breathing through my nose. Before my operation I was in the hospital and I overheard one of the nurses say that they just needed to remove the excess tissue in my nose. Naturally I thought that the tissues I had eaten had started getting clogged up in my nose and I never ate a tissue again. I made the realisation at 14 that it was muscle tissue in my nose and not the actual tissues I was eating.\n\nEDIT: I'm glad to learn that I'm not alone with my strange habit.\nAlso wanted to add that I saw some people mention getting tissue stuck in their ears and I had a close call in primary school when I rolled a piece of paper into a really small ball and put it into my ear (if you haven't realised I wasn't the brightest child) had to go to the medical bay to get it taken out with tweezers.",

            "For much of second grade, for some reason, my parents let me pack my own lunch. \n\nI had two sandwiches of choice- one was what I called a triple butter sandwich: peanut butter, apple butter, and butter. A little strange, but okay.\n\nThe other was a lettuce sandwich. White bread, mayo, and a few leaves of iceburg lettuce.\n\nI have no idea how they let me eat that for most of a full school year.\n\nEdit: Jesus christ this got a lot more replies than I thought it would. I have no regrets about the triple butter sandwich- apple butter, if you've never had it, is pretty delicious, and I'm relatively sure I put butter in there just because it made sense, because they were all butter, right? But it wasn't bad. Apple butter, to answer the frequent question, is sort of like an apple jam- basically imagine the process for making apple sauce but you cook it down longer and it gets all caramelized and concentrated, it's great.\n\nIt's more letting your kid make a sandwich from a little bit of lettuce that I question. (I appreciate a lot of people saying it was good parenting because they were making sure I had something I'd eat, but uh you're being charitable, it was more that they weren't great parents and probably didn't pay attention. I wasn't a fussy kid at all, unless you tried feeding me asparagus, I'd eat pretty much anything.)\n\nAnd to the \"concerned redditor [who] reached out to\" Reddit about me, that's kind of hilarious.",

In the middle of this she suddenly stopped and told me I needed to keep my eyes under control, because I had this terrible nervous habit of twitching my eyes when she was talking to me.\n\nIn actual fact, I was tracing out imaginary swear words with my eyes. Basically, drawing out things like \"PISS OFF\" and \"SHUT UP\", tracing the letters with my eyes as if they were right in front of her face.\n\nI didn't realize she could see my eye movements - I mean, I don't know why, as an adult it's obvious that my eyes were darting all over the place and looking crazy, but child me thought that it was subtle enough that it was unnoticeable, and that I was being super sneaky.\n\nAs soon as I realized she could see it, I stopped, but looking back, probably the funniest part to me now is how much it must have unnerved her. And she never did know the reason for it. To her, I must've just been the weird kid with the crazy eyes.",

So, instead of front to back (taint to asshole) I was back to front (asshole to taint). \n\nThat would cause irritation, which I called \"lightning in the butt\". \n\nSO, my solution to relieving the irritation was to lay down on the couch, put a round puff pillow over my butt, and have him sit on it and hop up and down as we both chanted \"lightning in the butt\" over and over again. \n\nSuffice it to say my dad and step mom put a stop to it, and I learned to wipe correctly over time. Thank god.\n\nEdit: so far (750 ish) this is the most recognition a comment of mine has recieved, just want to say thank you guys! The unfortunate part is Id love to show my friends how many upvotes I get, but its not something I really want them knowing. Oops.\n\nEdit 2: yes, wiping front to back is the most efficient way to wipe, especially for women due to UTI's. It does, however, give men some pretty nasty swamp ass on a hot day.",

This is really hard to understand. I technically do both but lean much more heavily towards words. For a lot of people the way your brain works is so dominantly preferential that you can\u2019t fathom the other way. Most people tend to think in words. To them the idea of thinking without words seems impossible, but before you understood language you had thoughts right? For others the words thinking seems like total schizophrenia because they have to translate their thoughts into words while talking. They typically have always regarded those \u201cechoey thought monologue\u201d sequences in anime were really strange and not relatable.

It was fairly innocent, i mean we were kids afterall but her brother who was a year or two older had this thing where he always tried to make us kiss and would always lift his sisters skirt if she had one to see my reaction, seems like it fits the theme of the thread, but it gets more weird. \n\nThey were moving far away and i dont think i fully understood it untill the actual day came for them to leave. I remember my mom said to go say goodbye and I didn't wanna. She said something like daniel has something for you so you better go get it sort of thing. Her brother basicially decided to give me a shoebox of her stuff to remember her by. So he gives me it and said to open it after they left but nope, i opened it on the spot.

They were not impressed. Months later I snuck into their house when no one was home, made myself a bowl of ice cream, wandered around, and then left. They talked about how freaky it was coming home to dirty dishes they weren't responsible for, but never suspected me. Vigilante justice I guess? Oh. And at 13 a friend and I played with barbie dolls, except they were all strippers trying to beat each other for the top spot.

He pretended to be scared and would whine about the \u201cscare\u201d that was coming. I guess he thought this was a cute gesture, and would refused to continue. It dragged a 5 mins scene into a 45 min production of his \u201coh no but I\u2019m scared, nooo I don\u2019t want to... this is terrifying\u201d.\n\nThis was a guy who told me that he LOVED horror movies. He was full of really weird contradictions, but this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\n**EDIT**: Holy cow, this really blew up! Thanks for confirming I'm not insane for being annoyed with his actions. Thanks for the comments - a lot of them were hilarious! There were a lot of questions, so I'll try to answer some of them:\n\n*What was the movie?* \n\nIt was an older J-horror movie called Kuchisake-Onna. I think the English title was something like the Carved Mouth Woman. \n\n*You mentioned he fast-forwarded, do you mean rewound?* \n\nNope, I do mean fast-forwarded. He would rewind, then fast forward to get to the beginning of the scene and then pause it and whine about how it was going to be scary. He would also study the paused scene and look at clues to determine what the \"scare\" was going to be. \n\n*Did you comfort/hug him?* \n\nIt was maybe the second time we'd hung out together, so even though I was interested in him, it was too early to say we were \"dating\" and I was pretty shy and kind of reserved, so no hugging would have happened even IF it all had gone well. \n\n*What were you doing during the 45 mins?*\n\nI remember thinking \"is he for real?\" then thought that somehow maybe he was trying to tease me (he's a man of a lot of contradictions).  So I played along for a while. By the time 15 minutes passed, I'm sure I was sighing audibly. I suggested that we stop and maybe watch something else. He refused. Close to the 30 minute mark I think I snapped and said words to the effect of \"come on, it's probably not that bad - let's just finish go through it and continue the movie. don't waste time\". He laughed and kept up the one-man show of \"I'm a sensitive man and I'm not afraid to show it\". I gave up and just started looking through my phone because this was such a waste of time - and finally I think he realised he'd gone too far and let the scene play out. \n\n*Did you end up finishing the movie?*\n\nNope because he tried the same thing at the next scary part and I made my excuses and got out of there. \n\n*Was he a child*?\n\nNope, fully grown male of legal age. \n\n*Why didn't you just stabby stab him?*\n\nI considered it but I wasn't carrying my Dexter kill room equipment and the blood would have been too messy. Just kidding. He was tall and I'm pretty short. Probably wouldn't have ended well for me.\n\n*Did you let him know why you didn't want to see him again?*\n\nNope, I never told him that this was the defining moment in which I lost interest. He was also kind of controlling and had a number of really weird quirks that I won't bore my fellow redditors with. Basically we just didn't talk as much after that and that was that.",

He came over and started talking about his weekend adventure of \"speeding down the highway doing shots\". Somewhere in there he ran on foot from the cops and hopped a fence.

I can't seem to eat much anymore. I get fluctuating diarrhoea and constipation. Menstruation gets more and more painful. I start losing enormous amounts of blood despite being incredibly small (less than 5ft).\n\nNow you would think any doctor worth her salt could figure out it's a gynecological problem. But my doctor (a woman by the way) at the time insists it anxiety and says she \"wouldn't bother testing for or treating a gynecological problem unless I was older and having trouble conceiving\". \n\nOver the next few years my gut and uterus symptoms slowly deteriorate. I get bounced around the system to dozens of different specialists. I get told it's just stress, anxiety, are you pregnant? ARe yOu SuUuUrE yOuRE NoT prEGnAnt???, every woman has painful periods, it's just constipation take this over the counter product, etc. Etc. \n\nMeanwhile my gut function slowly grinds to a halt. A functional gut test took 6 hours to pass an egg sandwich when it should have taken 90 minutes. I weighed only 40kg. It get's so bad I even start losing bowel control. No treatment seems to work. I was 24 and unable to work because I was literally uncontrollably sh*tting my pants. Doctors suggest I should maybe seek therapy and suggest I could be exaggerating\n\nAnyway one day I see a new GP for some regular sexual health tests but get an abnormal pap smear. Within 2 weeks I go in for an exploratory laparoscopy to rule out cervical cancer only to discover I am absolutely riddled with endometriosis. On my bowel. On my cervix. On my perineum. On some ligaments. Ovarian cyst the size of a tennis ball. It was even in my gall bladder. With excisions + treatment I had my gut function back within 3 months. I will never be able to have children.\n\nIf that woman when I was 17 had just done her goddamn job I wouldn't have lost 7 years of my life, my gall bladder, my fertility and my mental health",

After talking to her family and friends it became apparent that her symptoms were progressing unusually quickly. I remember seeing the point where her new hair growth met her bright red dye and also her grown out nails with hot pink polish thinking, wow, it really wasn't too long ago that she was not only taking care of herself but like, going to get her hair and nails done. The lady in front of me was so far from that. The neurologist I was training with recognized this, had her admitted and did every test including lumbar puncture. Workup eventually showed Creutzfeld Jakob disease (\"mad cow\") which there is unfortunately no treatment for. She died a few months later but at least we were able to prepare her family that she would only continue to decline so they could make arrangements. Really sad situation.",

            "(Not a doctor - but I had a half-assed dentist)\n\nI went to a dentist's office for several years, and was repeatedly told to get braces, and have my wisdom teeth removed.  Both of these pose an issue, since I play trumpet for a living, and performing at a professional level is difficult-to-impossible with braces, and having wisdom teeth out would put me out of work for at least a month during recovery.  The dentist was told this repeatedly, during every visit.\n\nI decided to get a second opinion about the wisdom teeth, so I went to an oral surgeon to have them look at it.  They took X-rays, and looked at the records from my dentist.  Then the conversation:\n\n**Oral Surgeon:**  So, you're experiencing a lot of pain in your wisdom teeth, according to you record.\n\n**Me:**  I am not.  At all.  I never have.\n\n**Oral Surgeon:**  ...So, I'm just going to assume your regular dentist falsified the rest of your record too, so I can put this folder down and do my job.\n\nHe then went on to explain that the way my wisdom teeth came in, they're sitting on a nerve that's next to impossible not to cut in the process of removal, which would leave me without feeling in the lower half of my face for the rest of my life.  As you might imagine, this would also be a major issue, given my career.\n\nI was advised that if they're not in pain, not to worry about them.  I do need to extract an adjacent tooth to one of my wisdom teeth, though, which my regular dentist completely blew off when I asked about it.  I never went back to my regular dentist, and will be starting with a new one soon.",

It started with difficulty swallowing, progressed to me having to swallow bites of food multiple times/regurgitating it, and then got to where all I could swallow was broths and mashed potatoes with no chunks. I went to the doctor multiple times, and was told every time it was acid reflux and part of my anxiety disorder. I lost 30 pounds (was only 120 when this started) and was just generally miserable. \n\nFinally my grandma was tired of watching me be sick all the time, so she called the GI doctor herself. They said we needed a referral, but she explained the situation and they got me in the next day. Did an endoscopy and my esophagus was 95% occluded at the gastroesophageal sphincter.\n\nFor some reason, some of my primary doctors notes ended up in my discharge paperwork (I guess they had to contact her to get my information) and she had told them it was acid reflux and basically I was being over dramatic. She stated she did not recommend them to do the procedure. \n\nNeedless to say, I switched doctors. Fuck that bitch. Was not a fun year",

            " I'm telling this a second time on Reddit but I hope it helps someone.\nI was 26 and found a lump in my breast. Planned Parenthood had taught me self checks and so I knew it felt different than a cyst. It felt exactly like the tumors I'd been taught to recognize.  First doctor says \"you're too young for breast cancer\".  I didn't accept that and went to a second doctor where I got \"it hurts when I mash it right.\" Uh no. \"It gets bigger with your period right.\"  Uh no. \"Sure it does!\". Third doctor \"You'll have an ugly scar if I biopsy it.\"  Fourth doctor I told him to call the police to get my naked topless self off his table because I wasn't leaving without scheduling a biopsy.   It turned out I had Stage 2 cancer and after surgery, 9 months of chemo, 3 months of radiation, and being told I couldn't have kids I survived!   I now have 3 kids and I'm 62 years old.

She seemed annoyed that I kept saying the pain is behind my eyes, in my temples and the pressure was insane. She gave me Imitrex and sent me on my way. \nI went to visit my eye doctor for a check up and she did the exam and asked if I get headaches. I told her yes, but it seems like I always had one. She told me my optic nerves were very inflamed and excess spinal fluid or a tumor can be the cause. She sent me to a neuro ophthalmologist where I had a brain MRI, a spinal tap and new medication to help keep my spinal fluid in check. The neuro ophthalmologist said I was about 6 months away from vision loss, that I was lucky I mentioned my headaches to my eye doctor. \nAfter the spinal tap, they took out about 100ccs of fluid and measured the pressure at 42, when normal spinal pressure is 8-16. \nBig middle finger to the neuro who shoved drugs at me.",
            "Not a doctor, but when I was 16 I was studying to be a nurse, and I got sent on a shadowing/work experience to a nursing home. The worst thing I've seen overlooked is loneliness.\n\nThere was a resident, I'll call him Mr R. I had a little free time on my second day so I went exploring to try and learn the lay of the land. On my walk I glance into one of the rooms which had their door open and see the resident inside coughing, and spitting up phlegm on his own shirt because he had nothing else to cough into. I run and get him a box of tissues. \n\nWhile he's wiping himself down I sit opposite him, waiting in case he needed anything else of me. He sees I'm new. He thanked me for the tissues and we began talking about the pictures in his room. He told me his life story; about his time in the army, how he met his wife, about how he missed travelling to Sweden every year, all the dogs he'd had throughout his life. He was the first person to talk to me in a friendly manner at the placement, and I really enjoyed chatting with him. He was funny, smart and overall just a nice person. He had lived a long and interesting life and since he had no children it'd been a while since he had spoken to a teenager.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes a member of staff knocked on the door and told me I was needed. I said goodbye to Mr R and promised to visit him again during my stay. I thanked him for making me feel so welcome, and he thanked me- and began to cry.\n\nHe said no one had ever done that for him. Mr R had been at the home for three years. In all that time no one had just sat down and talked to him, asked him questions and genuinely listened to him, made him laugh, made him feel heard.\n\nI ended up making several formal complaints and inquiries about multiple problems I witnessed and encountered. Man handling, neglect, unclean environments, belittling language towards residents and a general lack of care was just a few. It was the first time I had ever been both so heartbroken and angry. As a care giver one of the fundamentals is that you have to *care*, and for one reason or another those staff had forgotten. There were a lot of things I saw at that placement that I will remember for the rest of my life, but the hanging feeling of isolation was the worst.",
            "Here's my story:\n\nA guy came in to our ICU and was very septic but still talking. He had visited his primary care MD with complaints of a sore throat for a couple of days. Dismissed without any intervention since he didn't appear to have strep throat or the flu.  At this point he was having pretty severe abdominal discomfort, so we sent him for a CT scan. As the scan was finishing, he coded and had to be intubated, multi-organ failure, etc. The CT scan was horrible - he had all kinds of shit all over his peritoneal cavity.\n\nHis wife told us that he had choked on an ice cube the day before he saw his primary care MD. Evidently he swallowed a whole double half-moon shaped ice cube that perforated his esophagus with a HUGE linear 4.25 inch tear, allowing a significant portion of his swallowed food and drinks to get in to his peritoneal cavity instead of his stomach. To make things worse, he had some reflux that allowed stomach acid to get in there as well (likely while he was sleeping).\n\nOnce we realized what was going on, he went for extensive washout and exploratory surgeries to repair the damage to his esophagus and other organs. Thankfully, he made a full recovery, but he was very close to not making it.",

They told her she has leukemia and will need chemo, without actually doing any confirmatory tests. They admit her to my service, she is crying and screaming in fear, get more history and find out she was just started on a medication for her rheumatoid arthritis that can cause decreased blood and platelet cell counts as a side effect. Did some further workup and found no evidence of leukemia, stopped the new medication and within a week she was completely back to normal.",
            "Once when I was a medical student on surgery rotation, in trauma, we had a patient come in after he fell on the street and bonked his head.  Well apparently he had fallen once earlier that day and was discharged when the trauma workup at the other hospital was negative for injuries.  We examined him and noticed his eyes were kinda...Yellow.  so as part of our trauma workup, given that he couldn't give a great story and we couldn't be sure what happened, we CT scanned his abdomen, and saw his common bile duct was like 3 times normal size, could drive a truck through it.

            "Probably the worst story one can hear. My wife found a lump under her breast that was really concerning. It took her about 2 months to get a proper appointment to have it looked at. Doc diagnosed it as a cyst and fibroadenoma. She drained the lump and it was fine. Grew back a week later and was bigger. Finally after being in pain for weeks on end, the doctor said this is clearly not working, so we will do surgery and remove it. Upon going in for the check up, thinking theyd take a look at the scar and healing, it turns out that she had Stage 2A Triple Negative Breast Cancer. The surgeon was absolutely floored. The most upsetting thing was that while her main surgeon/gyno (who was fantastic) was on holiday another male doctor told her \"any surgery would be merely cosmetic and it clearly didnt bother her because he could touch the lump\". I almost laid that doctor out in the office. When she got the diagnosis he apologised to both of us for being an asshole. Unfortunately, this story didnt end well. Despite doing 8 months of therapy (chemo and radio), her cancer returned 7 months later and ultimately led to her death after it spread to her brain and spinal fluid. So many people told me \"ah breast cancer, thats one of the easy ones! my \\*insert relative nobody fucking cares about here\\* had it. She switched gynos twice because they wouldnt take it seriously. Its been 6 months now and not a day goes by where I wish I could have taken her cancer away. She was fucking 27 years old\n\nEDIT: First of all I'd like to thank everyone for their outreach and warm, loving comments and concerns. I've been using Reddit (which was my wife's favorite online past time haha) to help process everything and the support has been immense. So thank you all. To any one facing a cancer diagnosis or even a triple negative diagnosis, do not be deterred by this story, it is NOT YOUR STORY. Keep fighting and live for yourself, for my wife. Fuck cancer.   \n\n\nEDIT 2: To everyone wondering how I am doing: its been 6 months since she passed, though I have been grieving for a while longer (anticipatory grief they call it) and so considering everything, I am doing well. It was her birthday on Feb 28 and she would have been 28, so the week was quite solemn but other than that, I have found ways to move forward with her, not from her. Whenever I have a moment, I let it happen and then continue. I do have PTSD from her time in the hospital but I am learning to deal with it and when COVID calms down I will go to therapy. All in all, I am doing well, enjoying life as much as COVID allows and just processing all my feelings. I miss her everyday and will for the rest of my life.\n\nEDIT 3: Ive had a few people tell me to sue the doctor especially considering the cost of treatment, etc. I live in Berlin, Germany and despite that unfortunate initial diagnosis her treatment and care have a been breeze afterwards. She received care from the Charit\u00e9, Berlin, one of the finest medical institutions in the world and because of our healthcare system, we haven't paid a dime for any of her treatment. Its been a while and I am at peace with it all. I am not going to go down the litigation path and sue a doctor for something that happened in 2019. Though I do understand your concerns.

            "In my psychiatry residency, I was working in the PSYCH ER one night when we got a transfer from the main ER. Her family had brought her in for Altered Mental Status that had been getting gradually worse over the past 2 weeks.  She had been \"cleared\" by the ER doctors (all labs and vitals had been normal) and I was told she was likely having \"a mental break-down\" or psychotic episode.\n\nShe was rolled into our area and I went to assess her.  She was non-responsive, staring off into space, crying and shaking her head back and forth and mumbling.  She could not answer any questions and seemed to be having a tremendous amount of anxiety.  As a psychiatrist, one of the biggest lessons my mentors taught us was to assume a change in mental status is always a medical condition until proven otherwise and then you can think about psychiatric causes.  Within a couple of seconds of me seeing her, I had a gut feeling this was not psychiatric in nature.  I looked through her chart and saw she had a history of blood clots in the past.  Her vitals were rechecked and again they were totally normal.  At that point, I made an executive decision and ordered a stat CT of her chest looking for a possible clot.  The technicians who came to take her for the study were slightly confused as to why a psych resident was ordering this, and the radiology team even called me and wanted to make sure I had not ordered it by mistake.\n\n30 minutes later I get a call from the on-call radiology resident and she says, \"are you the psych resident that ordered this CT?\"  \"Yep, that's me\".  Thinking I was about to get some comment about wasting their time.  She continued, \"and this patient is in the psych ER ?\" \"Yes\". \"Well, you better call the ER and have her transferred STAT, cause this lady has the most massive pulmonary embolism I have ever seen and will likely code any second\".\n\nSo with that, we transferred her back to the ER, she was admitted to the hospital and treated for her clot.  Within a few days, she was back to normal.  From then on whenever someone would make a joke about a psychiatrist not being \"real\" doctors I would tell them this story and that would settle it.\n\n**TLDR:** As a psychiatry resident I caught a massive pulmonary embolism on a woman who the ER doctors had medically cleared and labeled her changes in behavior as a \"mental breakdown\".\n\n**EDIT:** Helpful redditor reminded me it was likely a CT I had ordered not MRI, yes correct.  I just had an MRI on my knee so it must have been on the mind.",

The first hospital he and my mom took me to, they said that there was nothing to worry about and babies just breathe like that. He was 100% certain they were wrong.\n\nThey took me to a second hospital, and they said there's definitely something wrong. But they didn't have the technology to help (1986). They recommended us to a third hospital, which was a couple hours away.\n\nFinally, the third hospital took me right in and performed surgery that day. Turns out I had *five holes in my heart*. They tried to go through my rib cage, but it didn't work. They had to crack my sternum and go directly through my chest.

She didn't know how it happened, but she started having horrible pain and her doctor said her ribs must be fractured. \n\nLong story short, it wasn't fractured ribs.

Turns out she had stage 4 colon cancer with 4\" tumors in her abdomen that were compressing her organs and causing the pain. She died a few months later.\n\nShe'd been seeing doctors about her symptoms for three years.

            "I am a psychiatrist, and I am frequently angered by the lack of care that our patients receive from some other doctors.  Emergency rooms can be the worst about this when they are trying to shuffle patients through to psych admits as quickly as possible, sometimes neglecting other basic aspects of care in the process.  Not every ED doctor is guilty of this by any means\u2013and some are remarkably good about providing appropriate care for this population\u2013but it happens far too often.  Probably the most egregious incident occurred a couple years ago while I was on overnight call at a VA hospital.\n\nSo it started with a relatively routine call asking to transfer a patient to our psychiatric unit from a community hospital emergency department for treatment of psychosis.  He was an older guy (I want to say early 70s) who had come in acting strange and delusional.  His son-in-law had told the ED staff that he had received care with use for psychiatric issues before.  I asked them to fax the transfer packet, a bundle of the assessments already performed there, and I started looking at his chart in the meantime.  However, what I found was that he had not actually been admitted to our psychiatric unit, he had been seen by our psychiatry consults team for delirium while he was admitted to the medical floor for decompensated heart failure.  For anyone unfamiliar, delirium can occur with any severe illness, where you brain basically isn't functioning properly due to the physiological stress your body is under.  Sometime it just manifests as confusion or disorientation, but sometimes it can get more dramatic, with delusions and hallucinations.  From what I saw in his chart, he had no actual primary psychiatric issues and had only been seen by the consult psychiatrist while he was delirious.\n\nSo i get the transfer packet for this guy, and not only has there been no cardiac workup for this guy who has a known history of heart failure, there aren't even vital signs on him.  The only labs are a blood count (pretty unremarkable), and electrolytes/kidney markers.  These chemistries are also not too abnormal, but I notice that his urea nitrogen is a little elevated.  This is generally a sign of poor perfusion through the kidneys, as reabsorbing this urea also helps the kidneys reabsorb every last bit of water they can when the body is dehydrated.  However, dehydration and low blood volume is only one possible reason whey the kidneys might see reduced perfusion; another possible reason would if some had uncontrolled heart failure.  So I call the outside emergency room and tell them that I will not accept this patient onto our psychiatric floor without at least a basic cardiac workup.  I tell them his history, that he has only had psychiatric symptoms in the context of delirium from heart failure and that the little bit of data they actually sent me points to that again recurring.  They tell me okay, they will get the labs and vitals that I requested and reach back out to me.  I didn't hear back from them after this, and I assumed that they had found evidence of cardiovascular decompensation and reached out to the medicine floor to transfer him there instead.\n\nSo I am going about my night, and a couple hour later I get a call to come evaluate someone in the ED.  I am down there and using one of the computers at their desk when I hear one of the ED doctors mention something about a patient coming in to medicine from the same hospital.  (For anyone unfamiliar, transfers to the VA pass through the ED first, despite this literally being illegal to do in other hospitals.  I don't understand the reasoning behind it, but it's what they do.)  Curious, I ask if it's a guy coming in with decompensated heart failure.  I am informed that not only is it the same guy\u2013who will probably be getting a psych consult for delirium\u2013but that he had ACTIVELY BEEN HAVING A FUCKING HEART ATTACK IN THEIR ED.  Needless to say, I was pretty upset that this outside ED had tried to send this guy to our psych unit, where it is a lot harder to get other medical treatments, without even getting vital signs on him or realizing that he was having a heart attack.  I tell this story to medical students who are rotating through psychiatry all the time to try to hammer home the point that just because someone is acting bizarre doesn't mean that you can just throw the \"psych patient\" label on them and ignore everything else.",
            "When in training I saw a child suspected of having meningitis. While I was new to pediatric medicine, I had a gut feeling just by looking at the 4 year old patient that he was too sick just to be a regular child sickness. The thing that tipped me off was the child having a slight delay in the pupillary reflexes. After seeing the child, I asked the head pediatrician to do a lumbar puncture to investigate the spinal fluid for signs of infection. \n\nShe said there was no need and all signs pointed to some airborne virus that roaming around that time. An unnecessary lumbar puncture can scar children for life and what not. While I didn't agree, I mistakenly doubted my own assessment and assumed the doctor with tens of thousands of hours of experience would surely know better than me. \n\nI shrugged I wrote everything down in the dossier and asked the pediatrician to read my evaluation afterwards. I went home after an exhausting evening, having worked almost 14 hours straight. \n\n3 days later the child came back with a fulminant meningitis that had taken a bad turn.

When he showed up at our ED, what he had was probably a dead testis missed at initial presentation weeks prior. \n\nPeople with testes, especially young men: if you have sudden-onset excruciating pain, sometimes without activity, often after/during activity, go to the ED IMMEDIATELY.

            "Not a doctor and this is about my husband.\n\nAfter we got married we struggled a lot and nearly divorced because he would go through phases where he behaved like a different person. I had kind of noticed it before marriage, but then I stopped working and it became clear that he really was struggling with something. He had had a lot of problems his whole life starting with getting a felony when he was still in middle school. By his early 20\u2019s he was in prison because he was doing drugs, burglarizing homes, drinking and driving like a maniac, etc. etc. He got a variety of diagnoses like Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Sociopathy, but never was really treated or medicated. One doctor told him he was untreatable. Despite all of this, my husband got out of prison, stayed sober for years, got a bachelors degree graduating with honors, moved to a new city... but then started struggling again with alcoholism before I met him. We partied A LOT in the beginning of our relationship.\n\nFast forward to a few years later when we are married and mostly sober and living in a new city, and my husband is periodically acting totally crazy and then going back to normal after about two weeks. I started charting his behavior and statements he made, because he would say things like \u201cI never need more than a few hours of sleep, babe!\u201d and then, two weeks later, he would say \u201cI always have a hard time getting up in the morning, babe!\u201d I had my own DSM IV from when I was a psych major in college, and I started comparing his symptoms to bipolar disorder. He met basically all of the qualifications. I was able to convince him to start therapy and BINGO! He got a bipolar diagnosis within a few sessions, especially after reviewing his history. Even so, everyone was reluctant to prescribe him medication. A full year went by and he was still really struggling. Then he went into a full-blown manic episode and started saying things like that he felt like he couldn\u2019t control himself, so I took him to the E.R.\n\nIn the E.R., I told the doctor I wasn\u2019t leaving until he got medication because he was clearly suffering and needed help *now.* The doctor not only 100% agreed, she actually called his therapist and lectured her for not trying harder to get him medication. He got a hefty dose of seroquel, we went home, and he slept for two days.\n\nHe woke up like his normal self again. It took another two years of trial-and-error before his medication was balanced out, but the difference is amazing. My husband had been considering surgery for a problem he had with excessive sweating, but it went away when he got the seroquel. Actually, a huge list of problems (like rapid heart rate, insomnia, difficulty keeping on enough weight, nausea every morning, and on and on) just disappeared once he was medicated for his mental health issues. Even his alcoholism just vanished, no joke. He struggles to finish a beer and rarely even opens one.\n\nNow he is basically as normal as someone without mental health issues and often wonders what his life would have been like if he had gotten proper help at so many different points in his life. He never stood a chance without medication, really. And then, even when we knew what was wrong, what would that year of our life (when we nearly divorced and my own mental health spiraled out of control) have been like if he had gotten medication right away? I know mental health can be tricky, but his problems were brushed aside over and over again by numerous mental health professionals. Ugh.",

One year passed and it didn't fix itself, it got more noticeable. My mother asked again to my doctor, she asked for an x-ray to make sure everything was fine and the doctor bite her head off for wanting to expose me to the rays. He insisted it was nothing but referred us to a specialist anyway. \n\nThe specialist suggested my parents put some wool around my leg that had the limp. Because wool would warm it up and speed up the growing process. Right. \n\nMy dad finally had enough. It was summer and my regular pediatrician was on holiday. His partner visited me because meanwhile the limping became really bad and my parents wanted another opinion. \n\nThe new doc measured my legs. There was a 4 or 5 centimetres difference between the two legs. They sent me to a specialistic children hospital to get it fixed right away. I had severe dysplasia... so severe my right hip didn't have a socket for the femur bone. 3 years and 3 surgeries later, months of physiotherapy to learn to walk again, I was normal. \n\nIf the second doc didn't catch it, I would have grown up disabled.

            "I'm not a doctor. But, when my son was 2 years old, he wasn't pooping normally. His stomach was getting bigger and he seemed to be always taking more food in than was coming out. We brought it up with our family doctor who suggested laxative or some natural remedy (I don't remember the details of the natural remedy, but when I mentioned it to another doctor later on, they were horrified). A few months later and no improvement, we brought our son back to our family doctor, she said the same thing. \"What if it doesn't improve?\", I asked. \"It definitely will\", she said. It did not improve. A few visit to the ER and a lot of doctors asking a lot of questions kind of franticly and we found out he had a condition called Hirschsprung's disease where the nerve cells in his colon are non-existent and his body doesn't know when he needs to poop. He went in for emergency surgery and is doing a lot better now. At the time, it was really scary for a while though. A short while after, the family doctor decided to retire early rather than face a disciplinary hearing from the professional board. I don't know the details, but based on how pissed off the surgeon seemed to be at how the doctor handled things and the timing of it all, I suspect the surgeon reported our family doctor for improperly handling things.",

I was training another CNA and I was like \u201cno matter what you do, if you see something, notify the nurse and chart that you notified her.\u201d \n\nThe patient was having a major stroke and the nurse was too far up her own ass and her own phone to do an assessment. The woman had to go to rehab and was not a candidate for any stroke \u201creversing\u201d drips as I had charted that she seemed \u201coff\u201d 8 hours before. The only reason anyone \u201ccaught it\u201d was because the night shift nurse insisted on bedside report. The nurse I had been working with yelled at me \u201cSTROKE??\u201d Like I hadn\u2019t been notifying her of symptoms all day.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the kind comments. Just remember to be kind to your local CNAs and try to answer some of those call lights, you\u2019ll never know how much we will appreciate and respect you for helping with the basics. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add that in theory \u201canyone can call a rapid\u201d but not every institution supports the policies they make. As I commented below: At this same institution I had a patient with a blood sugar in the 30s. Could not get ahold of the patients nurse or the charge nurse. Called the rapid, got scolded for \u201cnot giving the primary nurse the opportunity to treat the patient first.\u201d I saw this type of scolding happen at least 4 times before this instance, so the message was that if a nurse doesn\u2019t call it, then you\u2019ll be pulled aside and reprimanded for doing so. It\u2019s a pretty shitty hospital and I no longer work there.",
            "Here's another one, even worse than the other one I mentioned. I was on call COVERING via phone for the night for an acute psych unit. 30-some old female was admitted earlier in the day for psychosis, agitation. Tried beating up a security guard. Kept talking about a baby, didn't look remotely pregnant, right? Well...Urine pregnancy test was positive. She also had tachycardia and some abdominal pain. So, OB/GYN gets involved, orders an ultrasound. \n\nUltrasound is COMPLETED but no report is written up at about 1700. 1705, I receive a page from the nurses on the unit that the OB/GYN consultant is on the floor and recommending chemical abortion because it's an Ectopic pregnancy. They actually asked the nurse to relay to me to put the order of Methotrexate in. \n\nI go to look at the Ultrasound report. Nothing is in. I'm in the middle of a vigorous workout, and so I call back telling the nurse that that isn't how consults work. The individual consultant should put the order in for any recommendation they are making, as they are onboard and following (it's different at different hospitals. Across the street, it wasn't like that). I also called my on-call attending, apprised them of the situation; the program director, apprised them of the situation; and had the nurse document specific language used when the physician was conveying the request that I put in Methotrexate (MTX). I wasn't gonna. No way no how. They all concurred. \n\nHe put the order in. Hours later, the ultrasound comes back and it turns out that the OB/GYN had misread things, it wasn't ectopic at all but a viable pregnancy. All hell broke loose, and communication went on total shutdown. \n\nThe physician no longer practices in the same area. I was never informed officially of the results, but a buddy of mine said it was a scorched earth situation that threatened the hospital system altogether. They tried to rescue the pregnancy with some sort of counteracting agent or folate infusion or something, I don't know. I checked out and never looked at the chart again, because I was scared to death of the situation. \n\nTL;DR: Doctor almost made me order a chemical abortion on someone who had a viable pregnancy and was psychotic.",
            "Patient: While I was pregnant with my youngest I had really bad acid reflux. Like, I lost 20-30 pounds because I couldn't keep anything down, not even water. It was so bad that I would cry and throw up all the time.\n\nI got hospitalized for dehydration at the end of the pregnancy. My then nurse practitioner said that I was overreacting and it was good for me to lose weight because I was too big anyway. (I understand I'm not skinny but I'm not morbidly obese) \n\nI had the baby and it didn't get better. I was told it would. Popped those anti-acids like candy. Couldn't keep anything down and cried... A lot.\n\nOne night it was especially bad, I was vomitting blood and the taste/smell coming from my mouth was just horrendous. I was trying not to cry during all this... Anyway, made it to the hospital... Again... And the doctor there was like \"were you not here a few months ago?\" Of course I said yes. I got a shot of gravol in the hip and it didn't get better. They gave me something else and still, nothing.\n\nBy this point he's like Woah ok, she's not pregnant anymore so what gives? Calls a surgeon over, she orders x-rays and it's found that my gallbladder is super inflamed and needs to come out. Too far gone to save it. She ordered a mess of medication because finally, someone believed me when I said I was in so much pain. \n\nIt took a week before the swelling went down enough for me to get surgery. I am so grateful for this surgeon",
            "I had a doctor prescribe me with the wrong dosage of daily medication. By a lot. \n\nI've had epilepsy for close to 10 years now, it hasn't bothered me since I got the meds figured out. That took a while though. \n\nI got a new neurologist after I turned 18 (no longer pediatrics), and the way my body reacted to said medication alarmed this new doctor. He then said 'well it's because you're taking enough for a horse'. I thought he was exaggerating, so I asked him: \"So how big of a person would X dose be appropriate for?\" to which he responded \"I wasn't exaggerating, literally a small horse\". I'm only 150\\~160 lb....\n\nSo yeah, since I've been put on a more reasonable dose, I've had a pretty normal life. Really did bother me tho.",
            "Not a doctor, but actually the patient.  I had a doctor prescribe me birth control.  While in line to pay for it, i'm reading the paperwork that comes with it and learn that another medication i am on (permanently and everyday) completely voids out any effect the BC would have. I went back to the pharmacist and ask about interactions, and he says I may have side effects.  I ask  which ones, and he says \"Pregnancy\".  Pregnancy is not a side effect.  It is a lifelong commitment.  Then I call the doctor and ask why they would prescribe something they KNEW wouldn't work, and she said, \"butyou asked for BC\".  Like, yeah I did, but I wanted some that would work.  Silly me for not specifying that.",
            "Not a doctor, but my sister was the patient.\n\nShe had really bad lower abdominal pain for 3 years, to the extent that she could barely leave her bed that whole time. The doctor diagnosed her with colic (she was 8-11 through all this), and everyone decided that was final. Our mother decided that it was just that she was lazy and wanted to skive off school. \n\nFinally, after 3 years and much crying and desperation on my sisters part, the hospital threw all the scans at her to prove it was nothing. Turns out, her hymen was 4 times thicker than normal, so when her period started, it had no way out. Her uterus was on the verge of bursting, it was so full of blood and tissue. She ended up having to have surgery to suck it all out, then to create an opening so it wouldn't happen again. She still has issues with her womb to this day.",
            "Yet another \"not a doctor\" but my grandmother had a lump on her tongue and when she went to the doctors the person who examined her said it looked benign but didn't feel comfortable so said she should go to an expert lest it become malignant. A more senior doctor decided against that and blocked the proposition. A couple months later it is malignant and she needs half har tongue cut out plus tonsils.",
            "Reading all of these comments makes me realize I have something that needs to get checked out. I've had this dull pain and swollen feeling in my upper left abdomen for about 5 years now. I've been to my doctor and gotten a couple tests done but he said there's nothing wrong. I've always thought he was dismissive and arrogant, but now I know I need to get a second opinion soon.",
            "I'm the patient. \n\nHad a breast tumor found by an NP at a county health department. She didn't tell me about it. \n\nI found it while doing a self exam in the shower a week later because I've always been on top of that shit. I didn't go back to the doctor for months because I figured the NP would have told me. \n\n4 months later I'm diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer at 30. \n\nDo your self breast exams and don't let anyone tell you you're \"too young\" for anything serious.",
            "I'm the patient.\n\nMy fifth grade teacher left a note in one of my report cards. It was something like, \"At the beginning of the year, I thought SquareBottle might not be paying attention because he always put his head down on his desk. But I quickly realized that he was actually paying very close attention and participates a lot. He sits up straight to answer or ask questions and does well on tests. I think he's a great student and a strong auditory learner.\"\n\nNobody thought much of it.\n\nA few years later, my parents and I noticed that I was starting to get a little more tired, homework was starting to get a little harder, etc. I was also increasingly irritated by what I felt were busywork assignments. Everyone thought it was just the schoolwork getting harder.\n\nAt some point, we talked to my doctor about how I was feeling increasingly tired. I was also extremely underweight and ate very little, especially for a teenage boy. I was 5'7\"\u20135'9\" and had never weighed more than 104 lbs. Additionally, I wore a wool coat to school everyday because I was cold. This was in a sunny beach town in San Diego county, so my peers were wearing sandals and shorts. Furthermore, homework was taking me _hours_ every day. I had to start as soon as I got home and work until 9 or 10 PM, getting increasingly irritated the whole time because I just wanted to rest. My mom says I started putting my head down on the table during dinner whenever I wasn't actively eating.\n\nNeedless to say, it had become concerning. I was pretty much withering away as I dragged myself through each day. Eventually my doctor ran some tests, but she didn't find anything. I continued to get worse.\n\nMy increasingly desperate parents began taking me to increasingly \"out there\" types of doctors. A chiropractor, an osteopath, a naturopath, an acupuncuturist\u2026 I can't even remember them all. We'd go to each one for a few months. Each time, I thought that _maybe_ I felt _slightly_ better for the first two weeks, but it always proved to just be wishful thinking.\n\nMy parents had also started taking me to therapists, and I also went to some kind of specialist who made me do a bunch of puzzles to see if any kind of learning disability could be identified. None of them came up with anything.\n\nIt had been two years since the \"Okay this is serious\" realization. My parents were desperate. I only wanted to rest and spend less time on homework.\n\nThe last doctor during this period of desperate searching was a psychiatrist. At first, she floated the idea of depression, but based on her description, I didn't think I was depressed. _Some_ of the symptoms matched, sure, but overall it just didn't seem right. Eventually she moved from depression to ADD and had me start taking some medications. I didn't think this sounded like me either because I was focused and alert in class, just too tired to sit up straight. When I said that, I remember she snapped at me about having an attitude, which hurt me because I'm sensitive and all I'd done was point out which part of the diagnosis didn't sound right after she explained it. That closed me off from her a bit, but of course I still did exactly what she prescribed. Time went by, and it became increasingly undeniable that ADD treatment just wasn't working either.\n\nExasperated, the psychiatrist ordered some tests. Some of them were the same tests that my first doctor (who was still my \"regular doctor\" during all this time) had ordered way back when my problems were trivial.\n\nOne of the tests was a thyroid test, and it came back showing that I was _severely_ below the normal/healthy range of thyroid function. We got a hold of the first time I did that test years earlier, and you know what? It showed that I was below the normal/healthy range too! We asked the doctor about it because we'd had no idea, and she said something like, \"I don't put any stock in that test because I don't think the range is reliable.\"\n\nTo this day, I have no idea why someone would order a test if they were going to ignore the results. By doing that, all she did was make everyone else mistakenly rule out endocrine problems. It makes me angry just thinking about it.\n\nIn any event, we switched over to a doctor who was well-known for being particularly knowledgeable about endocrinology. We saw an endocrinologist too, but the new doctor was a \"regular doctor\" who just happened to be particularly interested in the endocrine system. He was pretty much _exactly_ what I needed in a primary physician.\n\nI'll never forget the first time I saw him. He and his nurse were going through their intake questions and doing their own in-office tests (reflex tests, blood pressure, something where he dragged a thin chopstick-like instrument across my chest to see how long it'd take for the little white line to turn red, and some others that I don't remember). The reason I won't forget it is because of the expressions on their faces. They were stunned by the results, but that wasn't the expression that made it memorable. It was the _pity_ in their faces. Every once in while he'd try to say nice things like how impressed he was that I was getting by. But most memorable of all was that by the end, his nurse \u2013 who was an older, very seasoned nurse who'd been with him for like 20 years \u2013 was actually crying and saying, \"You poor thing.\"\n\nTheir treatment started to help right away. It didn't fix _everything_ right away, but it made a big, big difference very quickly. I actually felt _good._ And the improvement didn't go away after a couple weeks.\n\nFor the next 10 years of my life, I continued to get better and better. I was and still am amazed by how much I've been able to accomplish. People hadn't even been sure if I'd ever be able to leave home! But thanks to this new doctor and his nurse, I was able to go to college, transfer to an elite university, graduate with honors, get a scholarship for a prestigious grad school, and worked at NASA for 8 months as part of my thesis. I graduate as soon as I finish writing it.\n\nI'm super grateful for every day, but still wonder what it would've been like to have been normal during my teenage years and early twenties. If only that first doctor hadn't dismissed her own test's result!",
            "Doctor here. You guys would seriously be surprised at how much ineptitude there is even within our ranks\n\nI once had a new admission come to me overnight in the hospital who was admitted by someone else the evening before. The patient very clearly had an out of hospital cardiac arrest at a local casino with a defibrillator used with return of spontaneous circulation. The history was clearly described by the admitting doctor however they called it \u201csyncope\u201d or passing out. They had ordered a cardiac stress test for the morning. I caught it early that morning. Ended up needing to go emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab and getting stent to heart artery which was the cause of their hearty stopping. If the admitting doctor had actually obtained a stress test on this patient, It would\u2019ve killed them\n\nI have literally tens of stories like this. It feels like half the doctors I work with are morons and literally don\u2019t care\n\nEdit:  this is getting kinda popular. I want to clarify something and also defend docs. Medicine is super hard. Period. It\u2019s one of those things where the more you learn the more you basically realize there is to learn and you always have a state of never feeling like you know enough. Also, there are limitations in modern medicine and we frankly don\u2019t know sometimes. Also, most people are truly trying their best so I don\u2019t wanna shit on all doctors. The system we have in the United States as you guys all know it\u2019s terrible, this also is on our side as well as practitioners.",
            "Not a doctor, as they say, but I have some experience in this area.  \n\nFirst, my grandfather.  He was a pretty good dude.  Fought in WWII at Okinawa and Iwo Jima as a radio man.  Coached football at a D3 school.  Then later in life, after retirement, he started having strange episodes.  \n\nIt began in an almost humorous way.  He was conflating the remote control with the phone, the dishwasher with the oven, spilling more coffee on the carpet than should be legal.  I lived within about an hour away, so I was the first to be called, and spent many nights checking in and cleaning up.\n\nDuring our time together, I noticed some particularly bizarre things, like the trail of coffee spills from his chair to the kitchen on the beige carpeting.  He pointed at it one day and said, \"You see that?  I remember that from biology class.  You know what those are?  Amoeba!\"  This was funny to 20 year-old me, but would turn out to be a clue to the actual problem.\n\nEventually, his condition worsened to the extent that he was going out alone at night in the middle of the cold WI winter, and even had a couple of bad falls on the ice resultantly.\n\nThe family doctor diagnosed this as dementia, and he was moved from his apartment to an Alzheimer's unit at the local nursing home.  We emptied his place, got rid of many of his belongings, and he was moved to a room that had a special alarm on the chair, because every time he stood up, he fell over.\n\nMy dad, who had been divorced from my mom for over a decade at this point, was not exactly his ex FIL's best friend, but he heard that he was having other hallucinations, such as thinking he lived in a house and town he hadn't been in since 1960.  Given my dad's experience with dementia and Alzheimer's, he mentioned it was quite strange that he would be having hallucinations, rather than memory loss.\n\nAs such, my dad had the person who analyzed the medication combinations for clients at his nursing home take a look at my grandpa's list of prescribed medicine.  Quite surprisingly, he had been prescribed a sleeping pill in the mornings.  We brought up the issue with his doctor of 50 years, and the guy wouldn't listen.  Instead, we fired him, got him off the pill, and no shit, two days later, he could not only walk, but gave a speech at the Friday night quarterback club meeting at the university, and was on point.\n\nThe amazing conclusion was that he was back to his \"old self\" well enough that he married his nurse from the Alzheimer's unit, and spent 15 years with her happily.  Fuck that doctor.",
            "I'm hitting my 30s and I have scoliosis. I was about 5 when my doctor told my parents. It was very mild and the doctor told my parents that its was normal. So they didn't think much of it. I grew up having mild back pains.  It got worst when I had my first child. My scoliosis is not severe but it's extremely uncomfortable. I have trouble sleeping and being pregnant is hell for me. I told my parents that many doctors have told me why I never got surgery or had a brace growing up since it could of been avoided. They always said growing up my pediatrician never suggested it or gave them info about what scoliosis exactly was. They always assumed I would grow out of it.",

            "Medical student here: on my surgery rotation we had a case where a kid broke his arm and went to the orthopedist who splinted it and put him in a cast. Follow up appointment he complained of lack of sensation in his fingers but could still move them. Ortho said it couldn't be compartment syndrome because that would be incredibly painful and not just lack of sensation. \n\nSpoiler alert: it was compartment syndrome and the loss of sensation was because his nerve fibers had already died (the theory was that he didn't really notice the pain because of the pain meds he got for the fracture in the first place) and soon he didn't have any movement in his fingers anymore. So our case was joint ortho and plastics trying to go in and salvage as much of the arm as possible after getting the cast off and seeing the damage. Everything on the inside was necrotic, but the kid really didn't want the amputation, so they ended up cleaning out the forearm so it was just radius and ulna plus the blood vessels to the hand, no muscle or nerve left to salvage, but this way the kid could keep his 100% useless hand if he wanted. \n\nSuper tragic bad call, last I checked the family was suing the original Ortho doc",

            "I\u2019m the patient in this story. Had my wisdom teeth removed a few years ago on a Thursday morning. The rest of the day was fine, but about halfway through the day after the extraction (Friday) I started having a lot of pain, which I realized was probably normal. \n\nBy Saturday I was in crying pain and started to have a lot of neck stiffness, and I could not open my mouth more than about a centimeter- just enough to force pills through my teeth. I called my oral surgeon\u2019s cell phone and he said to keep taking the antibiotics they gave me and keep irrigating the sites, and this was totally normal.\n\nBy Monday I noticed a very sore spot developing on the right side of my neck. Still couldn\u2019t open my mouth and couldn\u2019t eat. \n\nTried to go to work on the following Tuesday, but was sent home immediately by my boss because of how bad I looked. My surgeon was out of town that day, but I went to his office and was seen by the office manager, who is a nurse. She told me to open my mouth, but I couldn\u2019t. She got pissed and said \u201cif you\u2019re not going to open your mouth then I can\u2019t help you.\u201d I LITERALLY could not open my mouth. She tried to pry it open with a tongue depressor but it snapped and I screamed in pain. She pulled my immensely swollen cheek out and said that my incision sites don\u2019t look infected, but if I wasn\u2019t magically better by that night she would get me in to see a different surgeon, since mine was gone for the week. She said she thought me not being able to open my mouth was out of \u201cfear that it might hurt to open it. You\u2019re just gonna have to force yourself to do it.\u201d\n\nThe next day the right side of my neck had a lump the size of a golf ball protruding from it, I could barely swallow because of the pressure and pain, and I was taking 20 pills a day for pain (Tylenol/ibuprofen/prescription pain med). I went to the ER that night. They did a CT with contrast dye and found I had developed a huge abscess in my neck from the lower right extraction site and it was starting to close off my throat so I couldn\u2019t swallow.\n\nSaw a different surgeon the next day (Thursday), and he also tried to pry my mouth open, to no avail. Scheduled me for surgery that day and said \u201cI bet your mouth will just fall open once we get you sedated.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t. It took the surgeon and two nurses in the OR to manually open my mouth while I was sedated because I had developed trismus so bad that I truly could not open my mouth beyond that centimeter. They drained the infection, and I had to have a subsequent incision and drainage (I&D) under general anesthesia. \n\nI ended up having 3 surgeries in 13 days, had 3 different antibiotics, lost 15 pounds in a week and a half, weeks of facial exercises and massages, and took a full month to recover from the major infection. I was scared to death that my face was going to be permanently changed because of how swollen and unrecognizable it had gotten. All because the original surgeon brushed off my concerns and the office manager/nurse was an asshole who didn\u2019t believe me.",

            "Not a doctor but posting on behalf of the pulmonologist who saved my life. \n\nRight before the pandemic really kicked off, I was taken to the ER because I couldn\u2019t catch my breath, my chest was hurting and my lungs felt like they were on fire. Went through the basic tests, doctor says \u201cit\u2019s probably pneumonia and sent me home\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m back a week later because my situation has deteriorated rapidly. I\u2019m put on fluids, antibiotics, IV morphine. Same doctor says \u201cit\u2019s just pneumonia\u201d but I get admitted for a week. There is zero improvement. Two weeks, nothing. Three weeks, and by this point I\u2019ve had multiple chest x-rays, MRIs, CT scans. Someone points out my lung looks a little weird. Doctor is strangely resistant at first but finally orders a biopsy because a pulmonologist asked for it. \n\nInstead of waiting for the results to come back, a surgeon is brought in, and they\u2019re gonna crack me open and remove my whole left lung. Because reasons. By that point I could barely speak, hold a pen, comprehend what was happening to me. We\u2019re at the end of week four, and when I went under for surgery, I destabilized so quickly that the surgeon was like yeah no I am never attempting this again on this patient. \n\nI spent a week in the ICU on a ventilator. Out of pure stubbornness I got off the ventilator and was eventually returned to my room. Approaching six whole weeks in the hospital. I have asked several times \u201cdo you think this could be cancer?\u201d and was reassured oh no, absolutely not. \n\nAt some point during all this, a different pulmonologist was like \u201cthere is definitely something fucky with this lung\u201d and outsourced my neglected biopsy and some cultures to a university in another state. \n\nThe day I was to be discharged by the admitting doctor with \u201cit\u2019s still probably pneumonia, we don\u2019t know, here\u2019s a PICC line and some antibiotics\u201d, that pulmonologist came in to my room, just sort of sighed sadly at me, and told me I was dying of stage four lymphoma that had spread to my lungs. \n\nIf he hadn\u2019t trusted his gut instinct, I would be dead. Instead I\u2019m four months in remission :)",

            "A few years back, on the beginning of my career, I wanted to make some extra money and worked few days a month in a small town in an after hours medical care (not an ER, more like GP grade cases during nights/weekends). I had this mother come to me with her 3 y.o. daughter, telling me the kid had urinary tract infection, but the antibiotics prescribed by her GP weren't working. Her main symptoms were polyuria (peeing a lot) AND polydypsia (drinking a lot) - 3 years old girl had been drinking 4-6 litres of water a day. She showed me the urine test she had with her (on basis of which she was administered the antibiotics) and the glucose level was elevated (I don't remember the exact value) - the previous doctor overlooked this. We took her blood, checked her glucose level and it was around 800 mg/dL (VERY high - might lead to ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening state). I called the nearest children hospital, arranged her admission to an endocrinology department, called an ambulance and had her transported there in less then an hour - the girl had type 1 diabetes. I met them once more few months later, when the girl came to me with some kind of flue - the mother started crying, when she saw me, and thanked me for saving her baby. \n\nThis might not sound spectacular, but during the following few years of the job, I treated, or took part in treating hundreds or even thousands of patients, I performed resuscitations (some with success, some not so much), had patients with strokes, MI, and still, this is one of the patients I remember the best, and I feel most proud of.",

She has always been one of the most level headed people I know). She didn't get diagnosed or treated until she was 21 and her body was basically shutting down and eating itself because it couldn't process nutrients. Now in addition to her celiacs and gastrop, she has a ton of food allergies, autoimmune issues, cysts, and decreased fertility.

            "Not a doctor, but a patient. I was 15-16 when I suddenly began experiencing rapid heart palpitations, lasting about 45 mins each, caused by seemingly nothing. Would feel weak, unable to do much, with labored breathing and then they'd just stop. Went to the doctor, who told me it was from drinking too much caffeine and eating too many energy bars. When it kept going every few months, that diagnosis morphed into panic attacks. That lasted until I was 30 and began working at a clinic where I had an episode. The doctor I worked with took one look at me, gave me an echocardiogram, and told me I needed to see a cardiologist. Lo and behold...not panic, not caffeine but supraventricular tachycardia. Had my ablation Dec. 2020, left the hospital with what I'm 99% sure was COVID. Was told my heart would feel some discomfort for up to a year but would then subside. That's funny too.",

            "Okay I\u2019ve got one but I was the patient. \n\nI was 13/14yrs old and I went to the doc because I had a cyst growing on my inner labia next to my clit. Super painful and embarrassing for a young girl. I explained what was happening. \n\nThe doc asked me if I was a virgin and I said yes and then proceeded to give me a literal vaginal exam with his fingers inside me. I remember being horrified by this and confused as the cyst was on the outside of my body and up north..\n\nI was sent home with antibiotics. \n\nThe cyst grew bigger so we went to the hospital. \n\nI was examined by another man and they had two interns in the room as well (which was so extremely embarrassing for me showing my private\u2019s to now another grown man and two more strangers)\n\nAgain he gave me an internal vaginal exam and told me they couldn\u2019t see anything. \n\nSent home again. \n\nReturned a few days later because the cyst had grown so big I couldn\u2019t close my legs to walk. It was literally the size of a fucking golf ball!! \n\nFinally, a woman doctor saw me, and saw it right away. Normally a cyst on the labia can be lanced and drained but because it had been left so long I had to be put under and have it removed surgically. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why I was ignored multiple times when explaining it was on the outside of my body not on the inside. Why I was penetrated by two male doctors at 13 years old for a vaginal exam that was completely unnecessary as the cyst was literally visible. If an experienced doctor is mistaking a fat cyst for an enlarged clitoris on a 13 year old then there\u2019s got to be something wrong with them, right??! \n\nI\u2019m now 28 and I\u2019m still a bit traumatized by that experience. I feel violated to this day. I guess my story is just another example of how women (and girls!) aren\u2019t taken seriously?",

Literally got the news last week.\n\nMy 87 year old grandmother who spent her entire life being the healthiest person I have ever met from food to hygiene, exercise, mental wellness etc. got a lump on her neck. A LARGE lump. Took her to her doctor who said it was probably sinus drainage. Antibiotics didn\u2019t work and went back. He said it was probably nothing- didn\u2019t even try to give another antibiotics or steroid or anything just said wait it out.... \n\nFinally after 6 MONTHS of having a bump sticking out of her neck an inch or two, he ordered tests and sent us to another doctor. He asked what the primary told us and we said that he told us she needed tests and u had the results, he was pissed that her primary who she has had for 30 years wouldn\u2019t sit us down and tell us she had cancer.... he told us her primary doctor must not have even looked in her throat because the cancer has it almost totally blocked and she immediately had to go in to get tonsils removed so she could continue to swallow. \n\nBasically, after going back and forth for months with her primary, saying she couldn\u2019t swallow and having a huge ass lump on her Lymphnode, this dumbass didn\u2019t even think to look in her throat...... then when he found out she had cancer, didn\u2019t tell us and sent us to someone else to find out despite him being with our entire family for 30 years. The cancer turned out to be from her neck to her pelvis so not much we can do but it\u2019s just ridiculous he didn\u2019t even look in her throat which is basic shit ESPECIALLY for when someone says they\u2019re having trouble swallowing.",

I'd been having \"migraines\" for the past couple of months that were steadily increasing in severity. About halfway in I couldn't go to work; I could only lay in bed, moaning in pain. \n\nI went to an urgent care doc who told me it was the flu. This prick had the audacity to listen to my story about being bedridden with increasingly bad migraines, swab me for the flu, have the test fail, and still say it was probably the flu and to drink more water.\n\nFlash forward to the next weekend, I went into the ER. Nurse looked me up and down, listened to my story, and asked if my neck was stiff. I said yes, and - while he kept his composure - he freaked out when I got weirded out about the prospect of inpatient care.\n\nI signed off when I was able to catch my breath for a second. The guy was trying to stress how important it was that I sign off right away, but I don't do well under pressure so he escalated and told me I was in imminent danger, and anyone I'd been in contact with recently was as well. That didn't really help my situation, I just panicked more, but when I was finally able to convince him I literally needed \\~5m to breathe and process, everything resolved and I signed in.\n\nThey did the thing where they take brain stem fluid from your back to figure out which variant I had, threw me in a quarantined room, and I was there for 2 weeks. If you're as unfamiliar with the disease as I was, it has two different variants; one kills you and is a problem, one is usually not really a problem. It got to the point where I couldn't answer basic questions about what I did at work - work called because I was the only guy who *did* know, but luckily my boss was a smart guy and pieced it together. Luckily, I just had a severe case of the one that doesn't kill you. I was out of commission for two months straight, couldn't even look at a computer screen without instant nausea.\n\nSo yeah, if that urgent care doc is out there, you dun goofed and led to one of the scariest moments of my life.

He had visited his physician the previous night who did a routine examination of the Tympanic Membrane to check for perforations and brushed it off saying it's nothing severe and gave him some anti-histamines for his cold as he suspected a block in the Eustachian Tube to be the cause.\n\nNext morning, he noticed his hearing loss has not reduced and had actually worsened ,he came to us with this same complaint but only except we noticed that the patient was afraid of walking without support as he had imbalance and Vertigo. We quickly did tuning fork tests and found that he had sensorineural hearing loss and suspecting inner ear diseases we ordered a CT scan in which we diagnosed Vestibular Schwannoma ( Acoustic Neuroma) which had invaded the CP angle. \n\nIt's a benign tumor of the Inner Ear and we promptly referred the patient to a Govt funded hospital for further treatment according to the patients wish as he didn't have enough money to undergo surgery in our privately run hospital.",

They weren't in a position to be picky.\n\nVon Steuben, who was blackballed from military service in Europe and increasingly unwelcome in France, took the job.\n\nHe arrived at Valley Forge in uniform, accompanied by his dog and his three French lovers (who also served as his aides-de-camp and translators) and set about training the American army. Because he didn't speak English, his boyfriend/translator Louis de Pontiere would write von Steuben's instructions in French for him and hand them off to Alexander Hamilton to be translated into English for the men.\n\nUsing a technique where he would personally instruct 10 men and then have each of them go and teach 10 more, Von Steuben more or less single-handedly retrained the entire American army in the latest and greatest of European military techniques. His training manual was in use until the civil war and still forms the basis of the US military training manual used today. \n\nAfter the Revolution, Congress granted von Steyben US citizenship and a massive estate in New York, where he lived the rest of his life in seclusion with two handsome American soldiers who were half his age.",

This notable fact, albeit well known by most of us, is absent in modern day history books in Japanese schools. Its conspicuous absence along with other Japanese war crimes, such as the systematic killing of ~300,000 Chinese civilians in the event known as the Nanjing Massacre, is due to the continuous efforts of Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his political party the LDP, and his far-right ultranationalist sect the [Nippon Kaigi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Kaigi), among whose primary goals is to revise history in the name of Japanese nationalism and exceptionalism.\n\nShinzo Abe's grandfather was [Nobusuke Kishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobusuke_Kishi), known as the \"Devil of Showa\", who ran a slave labor camp from 1938 to 1945 in Northeast China that enslaved about a million Chinese each year for brutal mining and industrial work that left tens of thousands dead on a monthly basis. He was well known for his passion for women in alcohol- and sex-drenched weekends, and was imprisoned as a Class A war criminal after World War II. Unfortunately, instead of being properly executed, he was released and started the LDP, Japan's dominant political party today, and became Japan's Prime Minister due to his widespread popularity among Japanese people.\n\nFun article: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/abe-trump-japan-illiberal-authoritarian-turn.html",

I likely wouldn't be able to find a job in my own field let alone most other places as any experience and education I have would be largely irrelevant 15 years after-the-fact. \n\nIt's not even likely that the trip itself would prove to be useful upon my return. Most people wouldn't even believe the story... sure not having aged in that span would definitely set some alarms off but in all honesty at my age (late 20s) 15 years is *just* barely inside the realm of doubt where people wouldn't even be sure that I wasn't just somebody who disappeared and aged *really* well. \n\nAnd even if enough people believed the story (including world governments, NASA, etc) - what exactly can they benefit? I can tell them all that life may or may not exist on planets in directions I can't actually point them in, and even if I could it's not like I get to keep the alien spaceship. It would be an extended 15 minutes of fame and eventually everyone would realize that even if I am telling the truth, it's largely irrelevant. \n\nIn an absolute best case scenario I may be able to restart the space race and act as a well-paid advisor to what kind of life I saw and what really is out there... but I truly believe that's pushing it. \n\nI honestly think that this would only really be worth it if you had absolutely nothing to lose - and even then it's still debatable.

When I've had surgery, I'm just gone and then I'm back.  I imagine *not being* as a tremendous relief, though the universe could call me back into being if there's some entity beyond our knowledge.  \n\nI do hope that the Egyptian religion isn't the \"right\" one.

My new life might not be as fortunate, and I don't even know if I'll be born into the current time line! Who's to say you're not born into random time periods? Like maybe 1700's, or back to the Trojan war. Either way I'd love to re-experience life. Right now I'm an African American male. I wonder what it'd be like being for instance a white female. Not having to live in fear because of corrupt cops, but also experiencing the stereotype of being overly privileged. I know most are, but there are some more unfortunate than blacks. And men are just so naturally stronger than women, I want to experience whatever feeling comes with knowing that. And what are periods like? I wanna experience everything! Child birth, female orgasms, periods, having long hair, bein sought out instead of doing the seeking. Even addiction! It fascinates me how one cannot live without something. I'd love to feel that sense of controlling. Imagine not having another mini limb in the place with probably the most movement(Penis). That'd be awesome if people didn't know when I'm horny, a freeing feeling almost, ever sit on a bike and crush your balls? It sucks. And not having to turn into a professional acrobat and gymnast to pee into the toilet with morning wood. I know what a risk it is because of the chances of pulling the short stick, but I'd still love to experience it!\n\nEdit: Just more things I'd like to experience and spelling mistakes.",

            "Several scientists have given a lot of though to what kind of message you could send to a completely alien civilization which they could decipher with the only assumption being that they live in the same universe as us. Naturally a lot of these messages are just completely insane ways of saying anything since it models all communication as a mathematical proof more that anything.\n\nFor example how do you communicate the idea of left and right when you have no idea what format an alien species will be experiencing your messages in?  Obviously using a relationship within the electroweak model where charged weak gauge bosons only couple to left-handed quarks and leptons.  I mean completely basic stuff right?  How can we communicate the fact that our species reproduces through an exchange of DNA.  Well by assuming they have complete knowledge of organic chemistry and group theory so that a simple reference to the chemical structure of DNA from a symbolic representation of the periodic table will tell them how our DNA is structured allowing them to infer the rest and a reference to the number 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000 in a table will immediately inform them you're talking about a form of symmetry.\n\nAny species who received one of these messages of course, if they were ever sent out, would probably assume that humanity is some super intelligent species that innately understands the intricacies of the universe in a way they never will.  I would lay out a long and horribly intricate message like that though, with no other meaning whatsoever just an attempt to communicate and inform them I was intelligent.  I think the undeniable knowledge that something intelligent wanted to communicate once and failed right at the dawn of humanity would cause more chaos than any other message ever could.

            " On the afternoon of August 18th, 1973, five young people in a Volkswagen van ran out of gas on a farm road in South Texas. Four of them were never seen again. The next morning the one survivor, Sally Hardesty-Enright, was picked up on a roadside; Blood cloaked and screaming murder. Sally said she had broken out of a window in Hell. The girl babbled a mad tale: a cannibal family in an isolated farmhouse? chain-sawed fingers and bones? her brother, her friends hacked up for barbecue? chairs made out of human skeletons? Then she sank into catatonia. Texas lawmen mounted a month-long manhunt, but could not locate the macabre farmhouse. They could find no killers and no victims. No facts; no crime. Officially, on the records, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre never happened. But during the last 13 years, over and over again reports of bizarre, grisly chainsaw mass-murders have persisted all across the state of Texas. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has not stopped. It haunts Texas. It seems to have no end."

Her diagnosis was almost 5 years ago, and she is doing fantastic now.  I'll give a little back story to answer some questions.\n\n\nShe was 5 years old when she was diagnosed with an Optic Nerve Glioma, or a tumor on her optic nerve and had fully lost all vision in her left eye by the time it was discovered.  She had absolutely no symptoms at all that we were able to see, I was a stay at home mom at the time and she wasn't falling, tripping, getting lightheaded, headaches...nothing.  How we found out what was her dad and I were doing a craft with her and she made a pirate periscope out of a paper towel roll. When she held it up to her one eye she said she couldn't see anything.  After us covering her eye and asking questions, we believed her. What sealed it for us was when we covered her other eye and shined a flashlight into the \"bad\" eye.  Instead of her pupil restricting in response, it dilated to almost the entire size of her iris.  \n\nWe panicked, naturally, and took her to the ER.  Within 30 minutes she and I were in a helicopter heading to a large city children's specialty hospital, with my husband driving to meet us there. She had the symptom of a TBI, traumatic brain injury, and that was outside the realm of what our small local band-aid hospital could even begin to handle. We arrived about an hour and a half before my husband, and had all testing done when he came in. We had an answer - an Optic Nerve Glioma that has atrophied her optic nerve and the grape sized tumor was starting to push out her eye.  Externally there were no visual symptoms.\n\n Then we met with a neurologist, neurosurgeon, and neuro-oncologist. We were given options, and decided to go with a combination of 2 different chemo drugs; One that is commonly used with that type of tumor, the other had just come out of clinical trials and was showing some success at restoring vision.  \n\nShe did 12 months of every-other-week chemo and handled it like a champion.  The blood supply to the tumor was killed and it reduced in size by about half.  She is still totally blind in that eye, but you cannot tell by looking at or watching her.  She's a straight A student, plays sports, and is an extremely talented artist.  We still have to see half a dozen \"ologists\" ( neurologist, neuro-oncologist, oncologist, endocrinologist, ophthalmologist etc) but is thriving and happy.",

My doctor tells me the pharmacy has to request it be sent to the insurance company so they can get paid.  Everyone I talk to seems to know exactly the sequence of steps that has to happen and exactly who has the information and exactly where it needs to go.  They \"do it all the time\".\n\nSo the problem?  Why don't they just fucking do it?

We had one company annually bring 80 interns as part of a site visit tour, and it was a nightmare.\n\nI was sure someone would die every year. One year there were three hospitalizations though, and one of the boys sent the hospital bill to the hotel. To be clear, the entire F&B team knew about the event and were very vigilant about refusing service. We were not involved or liable in his medical issue. The audacity.\n\nParticularly because he and all of his intern colleagues trashed everything. We had to prepare the lobby by removing sculptures and porcelain plant pots. One year we started always removing a kind of sharp-cornered bookcase because too many drunk interns had hurt themselves on it. There were bodily fluids everywhere and linens destroyed beyond continued use. Plumbing broke daily. There was always smoking damage in some rooms. \n\nBut all the adults were useless, of course. And all adults were culpable in providing alcohol to the underage people. The company accepted the bill for the damage every year, and always came back. And we would add literally everything we could. We would tack weeks worth of room nights onto their bill because we had to keep dozens of rooms out of service while damage was repaired. The company paid for everything we comped for complaining guests too. They also paid for anything we had to replace, and they were so used to the damage fees we would just throw things in there sometimes. Like a treadmill finally broke during their residence. But did one of their guests break it? Don't know, didn't care, they bought us a new treadmill.\n\nWe were one of three hotels on this annual tour.",

Hotels that are rated by Forbes (formerly Mobil) and randomly \u201cinspected\u201d frequently, and there is a very specific checklist of things the hotel/restaurants must do/offer in order to keep their rating.  We always had to be suspicious of any single diners because they could possibly be inspectors.  So you could be a regular Joe Schmoe but if you are dining alone you are going to get the 5 star treatment.  Once we had a particular woman staying at the hotel and somehow management figured out and confirmed she was an inspector.  They literally took security cam stills and printed them out to give to all employees so we would know who she was.  I still remember her name was Katrina \ud83d\ude02\n\n\nSomething else interesting - one of the (5 star) restaurants I worked at (in a 5 star hotel) would frequently be closed for private events. There was usually a contract written beforehand stating the group must spend a minimum amount of money.  We got automatic gratuity on whatever that minimum was but the goal was to go over so we would make more money.  The people at the events usually didn\u2019t know these details (they weren\u2019t the ones paying) and towards the end of the night if they hadn\u2019t reached the minimum we would have to start pouring the most expensive wine and liquors to meet the goal.  Who wants a few rounds of McAllen 25 doubles etc.  And people still tipped cash on the open bars so it was easy to walk away with $500 a night in tips after those parties.  It was the easiest money I ever made.\n\n\nETA - MACALLAN!  Ha, please forgive me I am a lowly tequila drinker",

            "I wrote travel guides to places in the Middle East (Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, etc) and have stayed in lots of five star hotels around the world for work. \n\nTHe whole five-star system is murky from the start.\n\nThe manager at a top-class London hotel told me that the hotel grading system in general is \u201cutter nonsense\u201d. The problem, he said, is that the list of criteria to reach each of the star ratings is little more than a tick sheet, albeit with around 500 factors to consider. For example, one criterion for being considered five-star is fresh flowers being present in guest rooms, but there\u2019s a huge difference between a big ornate display of orchids and a bunch of daffodils. The presence of either would technically tick the box and in theory you could fulfill all the required five-star criteria yet be hugely inferior to the hotel next door that offers all the same things but at a much higher quality and standard.\n\nThe Forbes Travel Guide gave just six London hotels a five-star rating (including the one my insider works at) but that means that fantastic hotels like The Ritz, The Langham, The Berkeley, and Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park are \u201conly\u201d four star. Are they really 20 percent inferior to the five-star-rated Al Bustan Rotana in Garhoud in Dubai which is basically a business hotel near the airport?\n\nIt\u2019s also difficult to maintain a consistent roll-call of criteria, as modern demands change. For example, Wi-Fi in the room is a relatively recent expectation and what we expect as standard has changed over the years, so what constitutes luxury now has altered accordingly. When Savoy Hotel in London opened 1889 it was boasting about features such as electric lifts, \u201cspeaking tubes\u201d to link each floor, and fully plumbed bathrooms.\n\nNow though, in the era of Internet, crowd sourcing is often the most reliable way to judge somewhere. When hundreds of people on sites like TripAdvisor say a place is overpriced and terrible then it doesn\u2019t matter what the official book says. And if a one-star hotel gets nothing but praise from 90 percent of the people commenting? There\u2019s your consensus of rating right there.",

(Looking down, crying, silent, dirty clothing). \n\nLines of questions try to get the child to speak in general, as many traffickers take in children that don't speak English. \nOtherwise questions about their stay get directed at the child instead of the guardian. \n\"What adventures are you guys up to here in Chicago?\"\n\"Is your DAD here on business?\"\nWe crouch and say if they would like to help the bellman work. Most kids love the experience. We usually crouch down and try to make eye contact. \nIf I can't definitively tell security that the child is 100% comfortable in their surrounding, or if the guardian tries to lead the child away from me deliberately security gets an internal investigation going.\n\nMy dad has given me confirmations of arrests made of guests that I had attended to.

            "Affairs. The hotel I worked at for a year had a strict privacy policy around this and you are told, well it's drilled into you, \"not our business\".\n\nUnsure what it's like these days but my entry level job in the travel booking world started as a travel planner for a 5 star chain in Melbourne Australia a couple of decades ago. My station was next to reception (I looked like I was a part of reception, but was on the end) and it was not uncommon to have the affair couple check in then, while the affair partner was still checked in, the cheating spouse would return the following day with spouse (sometimes spouse and kids) and check into another hotel room. We were under strict instructions \"not our business\". But it wasn't uncommon on holidays for both spouse and affair partner to be in the same hotel at the same time.\n\nWasn't uncommon to see married people use the day stay program to cheat, sometimes with the same person (affair partner) but on occasion someone new (it's not below me to say I took some joy in knowing the cheater was being cheated on.)\n\nHowever there is that \"one\" that will be seared on my brain forevermore. A married couple,  both had rings on so I just assumed husband and wife, were regulars at the hotel for weekend stays, nice chatty folk (I was young so I didn't get many people stop and chat with me), I booked them on some day trips, sunset dinner cruises etc mostly couple/romance geared packages and since ID wasn't required for both to make the bookings they never corrected me when I booked the itineraries in both names but with his surname (since he paid with his card, I had his full name.) So cut to a few months later, this married man checks in but with a different woman, *sigh*, I will forever feel like a monster when that woman \"snuck\" downstairs to book herself and her husband the exact same romantic sunset cruise package that that man had booked with this other lady only a fortnight ago, to celebrate the end of her chemo round. She wouldn't stop talking about how this getaway was her thankyou gift to her husband who has been so amazing and supportive during this time. ... typing it I still feel like the worst human that I choose my job (breach of privacy is instant dismissal) over telling her what was going on. And yes that other woman (the woman who was having the affair with the married man whose wife was battling cancer) did turn up with her own husband and booked a dinner cruise and her last name on her ID was not the last name I had been using previously so that sealed it that they were having an affair together. \n\nThe other thing is drugs, cocaine mostly. Had a semi famous couple have their wedding reception and most guests were high, best man passed out in the bathroom, shat himself, with the straw still up his nose. Maid of honor pissed herself while sitting at the bridal table. \n\nThe cleaners see the worst of it, I just worked up near reception and saw some bad things but no doubt the cleaners would have seen the worst of what hotels don't want the public to know about.",

            "I used to work at a five star hotel in Miami in 2001. There was a lot of damage done to the rooms by very entitled rich and famous people but it was a beautiful hotel and still is. Stunning. There was a lot of sex parties though. A lot of cocaine, pills and sex. \n\nI have a cool celebrity story.\nOutkast stayed there for two days, andre 3000 and big boi.\n\nI\u2019d met a lot of famous people but none were as kind as them, absolutely none. As a young woman at the time, I dealt with a lot of inappropriate things in that hotel which included famous men and women propositioning me. I had more women proposition me for sex than men oddly. And some were celebrities and socialites, others were just super rich or girlfriends of athletes or artists. \n\nOn the first night Outkast were there with a team (rented 8 deluxe rooms for their team and whoever else), a couple of women were harassing me in an elevator because I wouldn\u2019t give them the room number for either party. I got spat on and shoved in there. I was really shaken up and cried hysterically when I got down to the lobby. Low and behold, Andre was down there talking to some fans very nicely. He just had came back in from exploring the city around 2am. He went searching for a vegan spot (he was ahead of the curve). \n\nHe saw me crying and came over to where I was standing to ask if I was okay, firstly I couldn\u2019t even make words out because I love Outkast and I felt humiliated. He sat down with me and the same women harassing me in the elevator from the 12th floor to the lobby just observed and called to him for his attention. \n\u201cWhy are you with that ugly cheap bitch (referencing me), she\u2019s a rude desperate bitch. Wouldn\u2019t let us come find you!\u201d \n\nHe had a look of disgust on his face and just told them that I was his close friend from Atlanta. The funny thing is that I am from Atlanta and earlier in the day we checked them in, I told them how much they meant to me as a girl from Atlanta. He actually ended up speaking with me most of the night in the lobby and we went on the rooftop after I got cleaned up. My manager was very cool and handled everything. She had gotten those girls escorted off the premises which was a relatively painless thing. Within the hour, thanks to his complaint (Andre) they were gone. \n\nAfter I got cleaned up and they left, we just hung out most of the night. I was still on shift but my manager was just so understanding. We must have spoke until 7am. \n\nI never forget them. Andre gave me 5 free tickets to a sold out show they were doing the next night. I brought my friends with me. Have us backstage treatment and a ride there. Hung out in his bus after and hung with big boi too. They had separate tour buses and andres didn\u2019t have any liquor or drugs. He was vegan and holistic at that time. He had his chef make us a chickpea salad and it was one of the best moments of my life. I\u2019m probably the only person  with a photo album they keep up with now, but I look at the pics I got developed from that night. There\u2019s a picture of Andre and I hugging and making a stupid face. I look at it sometimes because I remember how happy that experience made me. I was supposed to work that night but my manager gave me a free pass for the weekend lol. She stepped in for me. \n\nFunnily enough, years later I was in Ireland for a friends wedding and him and I stayed at the same hotel. He was shooting the Jimi Hendrix movie. We were on the elevator together because we stayed on the same floor. He actually said hello and we got to talking, he just said I looked familiar to him. And I told him we met years ago. It was a come to Jesus moment in my life lol. We hugged for so long. This was maybe 2012. \n\nSaw him again by chance in Philly in 2019 (where I now live). Took a picture and this time swapped numbers! I never text him but I\u2019m so glad this came out of the hell of working in a hotel 20 years ago.

            "I worked at a hotel that fancied itself as a 5-Star but let's be real, it was barely a 3. Our oil baron owner spent all of his free time at the hotel instead of at his main business, and loved to have staff bow to his every whim while paying an absurdly low wage. Eventually, low wages equalled an extremely low skilled workforce, and nowhere was that more evident than in our security department. While some of them were ex-military and some of the funnest people I ever had the pleasure of working with, the newer ones fancied themselves as future PD material, and one of the perps they were most on the lookout for were the human scum who would dare to solicit a prostitute while staying in our prestigious, virgin establishment. Cut to a normal Friday night when we had in-house a large group of conference attendees, all of whom seemed to retire to their rooms fairly early compared to most conventions, but then again, this being a conference of elderly evangelicals, it was not surprising. In the still of their ruliness, one intrepid security guard named Brad (actual name) spotted a lone white female entering the room of one of our guest attendees during the overnight hours. Brad, going by natural instinct instead of consulting with front desk staff, went straight to that room and knocked on the door with the might of a warrior. When the perplexed male guest appeared at the door, Brad asked to speak to him in the hallway, and in a pointed yet whispery drawl, asked, \"Sir, is that a, uh, prostitute that went into your room.\" The guest, with astonishment and not even a hint of anger simply said, \"That would be my wife, her flight just arrived.\" And that is how we managed to have our first ever all-employee meeting.",

These types of places have very skilled loss prevention teams and so employees are highly vetted and know they are being watched.  The loss prevention guys I worked with were very good at kid-gloving baseless accusations of theft while trying to explain that they were doing everything in their power to resolve the problem but could the guest kindly assist them by relaxing in their room and double checking items while they interview anyone who might have been in the room.

Yet whenever we\u2019re within an hour of each other we always make a point to get breakfast and catch up (this usually turns into 3+ hour conversations).

            "Like I suspect for a lot of people, getting divorced was a real eye opener. I started with a core group of close friends who had all met in our late teens/early twenties and one of them introduced me to the woman who I would ultimately marry. Well into our 40s they were what I considered to be my family but when the divorce happened things spiralled. \n\nMy best friend stuck with me, but his wife was the one who orchestrated things in our group and she was best friends with my ex. I was expecting the two of them to insulate for a while and I knew it was painful for my ex to be around me, so it was no surprise when I stopped getting invitations to cook outs etc..\n\nBut then I noticed that the other members of the group were also avoiding/ignoring me. I'd see on facebook that one of them came into my town to go to a concert for a band that they knew I liked and hadn't so much as texted. Birthdays rolled around and nobody would call. When my parents both died within a few months of each other and not a one of them reached out I knew where I stood.\n\nMy best friend needs to get credit though. Alone from all of them he made a consistent effort to stay in touch and see me regularly. He was there when my parents died and through everything else even though his wife clearly disapproved. I think finally after this nonsense had been going on for several years he told her how ridiculous it all seemed and that entire friend group tried to reconcile. I made it clear right from the start that there was no guarantee that I'd ever find space for them in my life again.\n\nThis is all very apropos right now because they are having their first big post-covid party in a couple weeks and I'm invited. People are coming in from all over the country and the only one I give a shit about seeing is my buddy.",
            "When they abandoned me when I was going through a rough time. When I spent years listening and supporting them. When I have my first true moment where I am not coping and need support, they are nowhere to be seen and bitching behind my back. This is when I realised my high school friends never had grown up past high school. \nLuckily I had other friends. Just not a large girl group like that. But I can actually say that every friend I have I know they have my back and won't judge me if I am not always happy. And the same for me. I have always had very high expectations of myself as a friend and I feel that everyone I call a friend is someone that brings something special to my life. That is worth more than having a huge group of bitchy girlfriends who turn on each other when they are out of the room. It took me a long time to realize it though.",
            "When I realized literally just being in the same room as that person made me miserable. It\u2019s because the person was extremely self conscious, to the point that they would overcompensate by \u201cputting others down\u201d every  little chance they had, to make themselves feel above. I kept wondering why they would keep throwing me under the bus for no reason? Like we had been friends for years, why would they treat me like this? It took me years to figure out exactly how bad of a friend they were, no matter how hard they pretend not to be. It took me an entire year of ghosting to stop being friends with that person, because they loved putting me down so much they wouldn\u2019t stop calling me, texting me, trying to contact me for a year with no responses because they could not understand how someone could possibly want to stop hanging out with them because they are so perfect!",

            "For anyone who's quite young reading this (or just leaving college) don't confuse \"fake friends\" for people becoming adults.\n\nIt's extremely normal for adults to 'lose touch' with older, close friends due to life circumstances - children, distance, work etc. That doesn't mean they're 'fake' friends it just means they have higher priorities than hanging out / chatting than they used to. You'll often find those \"fake friends\" are happy to see you when either they or you make it easy/convenient. That may be frustrating but it's a normal part of growing up & likely something you'll do too.\n\nPS: The post-college bit is the most jarring because everyone becomes an \"adult\" at a different pace. So people drop off & if you're not ready yet it can seem like people are dropping you as a friend.\n\nJust make it easy for them & you'll very likely pick things up right where they left off.",

They didn\u2019t even know when mine was.\n\nAfter I graduated and looked back on it, I realized they were never my friends. I don\u2019t even hear from them anymore.\n\nI spent 4 years socializing with the wrong people, and if I had just hung out with the people that I had led to believe were \u201cnerds\u201d or annoying (or who I had more things in common with) I would likely have had a much more fun time in undergrad.\n\nGood thing I have much better friends than just the ones I made back then",

I got laughed at, but I went and sat alone. I was alone all the way until junior year of high school when I told my parents that the big city wasn't for me. So my amazing parents sacrificed everything and moved up to Montana. I showed up to a small school and didn't know a soul. I decided to join the football team. That was the best choice I ever made.

            "When I left their church",
            "Accidentally overdosing on a drug and ending up in the hospital, I reached out and messaged those friends that said, \"Message me if you need anything!\" And when I asked them to do something like feed my cat, check the mail, message my family who don't use internet, or just talk to me, the response was \"**Let me know if you need anything!\" It was as though saying that somehow ignored what I was telling them I need. I learned people say this when they don't know what to say, or don't want to actually do something**. Like, here I am, in a hospital bed, asking you for that help you said I could ask for. I know that I've helped you, but now that I just need this rudimentary help while I'm being treated at the hospital, no one is there. Not even family.\n\nI've gone out and visited friends, hosted events for them, helped them in many ways, and it can be for years. And yet if I ask to be visited or for help, there's nothing. Sometimes they won't even let me know they can't show up for things like my birthday until hours into the party starting time. Some people just want to \"piggybank\" you, dropping figurative social coins into you so that you show up for them, but they may never show up for you. I've spent years talking to someone wondering what it would take for them to ever fucking visit me, to have them literally show up once in over 5 years of a friendship. **I feel like an idiot for having invested so much of myself, time, money, and genuine love to realize they do not want to invest even a fraction in reciprocation.**\n\n\"We're friends for life now\" some have said to me, and we've shared deep things. But it's always in public chat groups and we never converse in private. I've learned some people know how to be emphatic and seem really caring, but often it seems all they really care about is a performative friendship: the sing and dance of a friendship, but when you genuinely want to talk and open up about a conflict, to really ask for help to work through something, it's not what they're there for. **They're there for the superficial and entertaining, the positive only, and the negative - whatever it may be - is not what they are there for.**\n\nI don't know anymore what a real friendship is. I'm left really wondering if I'm the problem. The proverb \"if everyone is the problem, then it's you\" rings in my head: I must be the problem, because every relationship has similar issues: **lack of genuine connection**. If I start to open up and share genuine feelings, it's a burden. And most of the time I'm just asking to be heard, nothing more, and I really only do this when it feels like it could be accepted. I'm not opening up relationships like this. You have to wait till rapport feels like it's acceptable to be vulnerable and authentic. But, even when you do, there's the risk that you're not compatible. Or.. maybe I'm completely wrong and I have a massive issue I need to address that I'm just not seeing. I've been in therapy for a while and my consistent issue is that I'm emotionally confused about my own self.\n\nSo.. tl;dr I don't fucking know.",

            "I realized when the only time I'd hear from them is when they needed something from me.  I had, what I thought was a very good group of friends throughout high-school and college.  After college, the only time I'd hear from them was when something was broken, or they needed help. They got a new TV, and needed it set up. Or their computer was acting up and wanted me to look at it. Or they were drywalling their basement and needed a set of hands.  Not once over the course of about a year was there a single call for \"Hey, you want to hang out tonight\" or \"Hey, let's go out for dinner\"  \n\nQuickly moved them into the acquaintance category.  I'd say I probably have 2 true friends.  The kind who I'd bail out of jail with no questions asked, or they'd help me hide a body if it ever came to that.",

I was two things: a poor kid in a private school and a really aggressive girl.\n\n\nI was only friends with other girls, and they were friends with me because they didn't want me to beat them up. I wouldn't even if they weren't, but they couldn't know that. And to be a part of conversation I had to actively pretend to own stuff I didn't \u2013 like cable TV and such.\n\n\nI have plenty of stories of fake friends. But it was partly my fault too. Currently I have a small friend group and I strongly believe they're not fake.",

            "I've had a couple of these, but the one that stung the most was my \"beat friend\" who kept me around to feel good about herself. Things I didn't realize until she ghosted me after nearly 7 years of friendship. She always had a guy, a job she loved and was constantly getting promoted, and a fancy apartment. I was always single, had a dead-end job I hated, and while my apartment was nice, it was nowhere near as \"nice\" as hers. (I'm not complaining about my life. I was fine being single and was working on finding a good job.)\n\nFast-forward to me getting in a very solid, serious relationship (we're now married), renting a nice house instead of a small apartment, and having a really good and secure job. Add on to that being medicated for anxiety so I'm much happier now. The last I spoke with her, we had made plans for her to visit me. When that date got closer, I texted her to see if she still planned on coming and she never responded. Reached out to her a number of times over a couple months. Nothing. \n\nFrom her perception, I was no longer the friend to be feel sorry for, the friend you could compare yourself to and feel better about your life. Therefore, I was no longer needed. It broke my heart and took me months to get over.",

Wasn't anything big, just my display cable fucking up, but it did give me the creeps. As for dark or disturbing shit, I've only found a list of random addresses. The dark web really has a lot of stigma associated with it. For the most part it's just people curious about the dark web or people trying to scam you or sell you drugs. You have to do a lot of looking to find the really fucked up stuff. You're more likely to find dark web type crap on Reddit or YouTube than the actual dark web.",

And this guy took months and months going back and forth between car shops and the forum thread to try to get the issue fixed. Everyone on the forum was pitching in to try to help him. So I kept going through this long forum thread to try to figure out if he ever fixed it. And suddenly there's no more replies from the guy.\n\nEveryone was scratching their heads for a while. We thought he had maybe gotten the issue fixed and didn't bother to update us on it. Then one day, a news article popped up about a really rich guy who died in a Thai jail cell. And then we connected the two stories and they matched up. The same make and model of the car in the news article matched up with his car. And they were both claiming to be in Thailand at the time.\n\nSo what happened was that that same guy who was still talking on the forums got raided by the Thai police around the same time he stopped replying to the forum. Turns out that he was running one of the biggest dark web marketplaces where drugs were being sold and exchanged. It had something like $1 million in revenue per day and he was hiding out in Thailand while living in luxury. They found him dead in his jail cell a few days later. They claim he died of \"suicide\".",

Everyone flocked to a new site called Hansa which had some sketchy design features but it was the next best alternative.\n\nTurns out the Dutch police took over the site and with cooperation of multiple governments ran a drug distribution onion site with over a million dollars of transactions for around a month. They were gathering information from unsuspecting users(including me) who bought with faulty security practices.\n\nNow this is where I started freaking out imagine trafficking drugs through the mail and the attorney general at the time Jeff Sessions makes a speech live on television that he was going to crack down and explicitly explains how fucked everyone on Hansa was because they have been gathering data for over a month. And in a big dick energy move closes the site and puts up a banner in its place saying everyone who has purchased will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law during his live speech. \n\nI was shitting myself for a month as many arrest did occur but luckily I guess I wasn\u2019t important enough and nothing happened to me.",

Of course we never cancelled it.\n\n-They figured out who I was by using a CuteFTP vulnerability to get root directory access to my PC. The death threats were bad enough, but what really sticks with me is the malice of deleting my family photos including the last picture is us with my dad whole he was alive.\n\n-I was the typical invincible-feeling young adult and I was more concerned about worrying my mom than I was about my own safety.\n\n-This was long before \"doxxing\" was a thing, and online threats going from email to handwritten letters was terrifying, but as a high school kid I never would have admitted it.\n\n-Nobody asked, but if I was confronted in person I would have fought back. 18 years later, if they really held a grudge and threatened me again with the same malice expressed in those letters I got, I would open the door with a gun in hand and if they tried to get in, I would assume that they were intending to kill me and shoot first.\n\n-This is a serious post so as funny as it would be to accept the previous statement with the autocomplete error \"shit first,\" I fixed it.",

            "There's hitmen, human trafficking and snuff films and such but a vast majority of these sites are scams asking you to send them bitcoin. A small portion of users on the dark web would be there for this sort of stuff. However, buying drugs online is quite popular and widespread. Single vendors can have $500,000+ in lifetime sales.\n\nYou use PGP to encrypt your address so only the seller of the drugs has access to your private info. If your package is seized, LE have no proof you ordered it unless they seize your computer and you have that information stored on it, you can use tails/USB to avoid this.\n\nEven if your packages get seized, you'll often get a \"love letter\" saying what they seized and there is no follow up after that.",

They had a segment where an author who was writing a book about it basically gave step by step instructions on how to do it. I did everything he said and, by golly, it worked.\n\nTruthfully, it was pretty underwhelming. Mostly just drugs and counterfeit items (passports, money, etc.). I did find some weapons with the serial numbers scratched off (pistols and shotguns), but nothing that would start World War 3. I also saw a couple ads for hitmen, but they seemed pretty hokey and were most likely, undercover cops. \n\nI never felt in danger, but I have never gone back because there's nothing I really want from there.

I attended the trial of one of the most evil people on the planet - Lux, the owner of Hurt2theCore (a child torture site) turned out to be a friendless, unhappy kid who built his evil empire from his childhood bedroom, with his parents blissfully unaware of what was happening under their noses.\n\nThe only time I've felt even slightly in danger despite all this nosing around in there was when I helped uncover a hitman scam. The owner of Besa Mafia, the most profitable murder-for-hire site in history, came after me when I started writing about him. He made loads of threats (\"you don't know who I am, but I know who you are and where you live\") but that wasnt scary, as I had access to the backdoor of his site thanks to a friendly hacker and knew he didn't really want to hurt anybody.\n\nIt took a bit of a darker turn when he told the people who had signed up to work as hitmen on his site - and who he made video themselves burning cars with signs on them to advertise how legit his site was, then never sent them the promised money for doing so - that I was the owner of the site who had ripped them off.

I just spent more time than I should have reading about the ghastly videos that apparently thousands of you have seen, mostly by accident, and mostly when you were young children. Every single one of you noted how damaging the images and sounds were to you, and for many of you, that damage lingered.

Closely watch their emotional development and behavior.  Create open, nonjudgmental, safe, relationships, where they feel secure in the knowledge they can come talk to you about anything.

Actual victims of OCD do things like stand by the light switch in a room and repeatedly flick it on and off for hours and mentally break down halfway through, or making gestures as if they're washing their hand by a basin despite there being no water and that they simply cannot control the urge to make those gestures. The word \"disorder\" indicates, among other things, that the symptoms are severe enough to downright disrupt one's daily live and stop you from carrying out your \"normal\" routines and activities. People should stop saying things like \"I'm just so OCD, I can't help but round up the numbers you know\" as people are misinformed enough about this disorder.",
            "That 12-step programs get addicts clean. \n\nThe truth is that their efficacy hovers at ~5%. That's exactly the same as quitting cold turkey. \n\nThere's plenty of researched and scientifically tested methods that work better.

This is resultant from a traumatic brain injury I sustained while snowboarding in 2000. I wasn't wearing a helmet and am lucky to be alive and not paralyzed. I broke my zygomatic arch (cheek bone), two molars, and my coronal suture (the zigzaggy part of your skull where the pieces fuse together). My eye swelled out of its socket and my brain swelled up too, and I was not expected to live and the doctors called my parents asking if I had a will made out. But I pulled through and now I live a normal life except for periodic seizures.\n\nPlease, take my experience for advice and wear a helmet when you're doing anything that could injure your head. Seizures are, in my case, very annoying and I put my family through hell worrying while I recovered.\n\nFor those who wonder what it feels like to have one of these minor seizures, it's sort of like the world \"becomes 2D\", I get a sensation similar to having to sneeze but throughout my entire body, and then I breathe heavy and get a headache, followed with feeling logy for the rest of the day. Medication helps greatly, but lack of sleep and stress can bring them on.\n\nThanks for the supportive messages. I can't wait until my little girl starts sleeping through the night!",

            "This time last year I was in a deep depression. I was completely numb to life. I had lost touch with everyone except my immediate family. I was severely overweight, stressed and not taking care of myself. Completely detached, the only thing keeping me going was work, and it was a real stressor. I was in this state for probably 6 years.\n\nI got invited to a wedding. I didn\u2019t want to look like a complete troll in all the pictures, or ruin the mood on the day in any way. On New Years Eve, I decided to completely change my routine and diet. I only ate food I cooked myself, from unprocessed ingredients. I avoided bread and other heavy carbs like the plague. I skipped lunch. I only drank water. \n\nI lost 20kg in 4 months. My feelings came back online and they were intense. I forgot what it felt like to be driven by feelings rather than detached thought. I suddenly became naturally expressive and accessible to other people again, to my own amazement. I was \u201cback in the room\u201d, so to speak. But I wasn\u2019t quite in time with things yet, and I needed to spend some time catching up with myself.\n\nI reconnected with an old friend to patch things up, but also as an inadvertent cry for help. Turned out he was rather lonely too. Made a nice fool of myself with him, but that\u2019s ok - we love each other. He\u2019s a great friend to have.\n\nI started experimenting with dudes. Never thought that would happen, but it did. It was fun and intense and exciting, but not the same feeling as with girls. Been on a couple dates but will be hoping for a new relationship with a girl after the new year.\n\nI\u2019ve been weight training since May, gained probably 5kg or more. I\u2019m already looking good. After the new year I\u2019m gonna lose the fat to see what\u2019s underneath and it\u2019s gonna fucking rock.\n\nI\u2019m starting cognitive behavioural therapy next week as I\u2019m not good with vulnerability or intimacy.

It was only when I began to teach and have research students myself that I saw how much school trains students just to be students, not scholars. \n\nAnother thing I have learned is that this moment I refer to above is not the time when one realizes a fatal flaw, but a decision point. It's the time when someone decides if they want to switch gears and go into research, or go forward the way they were going as students. This is often a rough transition but, like many others, it's worth it to push through and the results can be really wonderful.\n\nEDIT2: I am also getting a lot of responses from stressed-out PhD students and I want to add one more thing, just for you all. The PhD process can be one huge mindfuck, and you don't even realize it until you are on the other side. It has the power to make you feel like your value as a person is being evaluated. This is not true. You can leave tomorrow and still be a valuable human, just as much. Alternately, you can love your work, it can bring meaning to your life, and you don't need to die a little bit when you get criticism of that work. Criticism is *good,* it is how you improve your work, but it is not you as a person who is being critiqued. \n\nIt's true that people will rarely go out of their way to make the criticisms easier to take, this is part of the culture of academia for better or worse. In the end, though, I think it's better to encourage an environment of open and honest discourse rather than focus too much on how doing so makes other people uncomfortable. Just remember this - everyone is going through the same thing, everyone finds it hard, and anyone who doesn't say so is lying.\n\nThis is why it's important not to become isolated. Keep in touch with other students, particularly senior ones.  Don't rely on your advisor as your sole source (or any source, in many cases) of support. Find other faculty members that you jibe with. The more you put yourself out there, the more you will realize everyone is going through the same thing, or went through it already. ",

One of our jobs is we would send a team in when the house was still in sticks and install the furnace and duct work.

Anyways, the point is no one in here would be here without some sort of schooling. \n\n   This new guy wouldn't do anything. We told him to climb into the attic and help another guy run some 16\" flex duct. He said he couldn't climb the ladder. We assured him he'll be fine, and even got him an 8' ladder so he could litteraly step right off the top rung on to the trusses. Wouldn't go up it. \n\n   Finally, we manage to coax him up the ladder after a good 10 minutes, and he spends the entire time wrapped around a truss upright like a cat stuck up a tree. We give up on him, the guy manages to run the duct himself, then we have to take five minutes to coax the guy back down the ladder. \n\n   Now, we regularly have to place 20\"x20\"x36\" sheet metal collection boxes, that wheigh a reasonable amount, above 15' staircases, and this guy couldn't climb 8' into the air above a plyboard floor.

For example, you can no longer download games you bought on the Nintendo Wii Shop because that service has shut down.

People should be using a service hosted on a .gov domain for government-related activities like registering to vote, jury duty, drivers license, etc.\n\nHowever, dozens of doppelganger websites sprung up. They mostly appeared on .org and .net domains, and what was particularly nefarious was they paid other social media platforms (including Reddit) to promote them. They were advertised using a hard-coded CSS overlay, so your adblocker wouldn't catch it, and you had to actively dismiss the notification to access your social media page. And a ton of these voter registration sites, if you dug around, read the terms of use, and did the same for their affiliate and partner organizations, were rather nefarious with user information.\n\nThere was a very popular one, TurboVote, which was actively promoted by Twitter. It looks like a voter registration form, has all the expected questions for it like name, phone number, address, even assures the user that the information is going towards their voter registration form.\n\nAfter filling all that out, the site then finally asks what state the user is in. Mind you, asking what state the user resides in should be the *first* question on an online voter registration form, as a handful of states do not allow online registration. After selecting the state, you are then redirected to that state's voter registration form, a .gov domain. Mysteriously, all text input fields blank, none of the information provided transferred over. You have to give all that information again.\n\nSo what the hell did you just fill out?\n\nIf you go to the site's privacy policy, they say they do collect that personal information, but don't sell that data. But they do provide it to their partners so they can render their services.\n\nIf you go to their partners' websites, and read their privacy policy, they do retain user information, and they do sell it.\n\nSo basically, all these voter registration websites being promoted by Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram celebrities were data mining operations. Their model was to collect, then pass it on to a \"partner\" to sell it so they can honestly state in their privacy policy \"we don't sell your information.\"\n\nTrue. They don't. But their buddy does.\n\nJust use a .gov instead. Yes, those websites are clunky and 20 years old, but they're the official source. You shouldn't be giving personal identifying information to third party intermediaries of unknown ethical standard, no matter how sleek and simple their website is, no matter which major social media platforms they paid to hardcode a CSS overlay promoting them. They should only ask for your state. No name, no address, no date of birth. Just your state, so it can redirect you straight to the state's vote registration page if available. If the site asks for anything more, bail. It's a data mining operation.",

And I know plenty of people out there are a huge fan of space and willfully ignore facts when it comes to, say, climate change, because the truth there is unpalatable and affects them more immediately.\n\nCarl Sagan said in the 90s in *The Demon Haunted World* that- \u201cI have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...\" I think it's pretty clear this trend began in earnest in this decade, but I hope we will be able to right the ship a bit in the next one.\n\nEdit: lots of people telling me that they don\u2019t think there are Flat Earthers IRL, or that it\u2019s not that big a deal. I disagree.  People who get into one conspiracy theory as weird as Flat Earth aren't usually prone to stopping there.\n\nSecond, I actually have colleagues who had a Flat Earther who kept coming in and threatening the astronomers in the department for their role in the conspiracy theory, and making the young women students feel *very* uncomfortable.  He kept coming back onto campus despite a ban for some time, and I'm told it was really disturbing.\n\nI\u2019m sure many people are joking about Flat Earth. Unfortunately some not in on the joke couldn\u2019t tell the difference and started listening.",

            "When future historians look back on the first generation to grow up with Internet access, they'll wonder why everyone started not only embracing snake oil, but actually dreaming about becoming peddlers of it.\n\nNow, when I use the term \"snake oil,\" I'm not just talking about the likes of Doctor Oz and Gwyneth Paltrow; I'm referring to anyone who dishonestly claims to be offering something worthwhile. This hasn't just been the decade of crystal-based remedies and chakra enemas, after all: We've seen everyone from so-called scientists to self-serving performers doing whatever they can to exploit any audiences that they can attract. These people don't actually care about entertaining or informing so much as they care about staying in the spotlight for long enough to get a tan.\n\nI'll give you an example: The vast, *vast* majority of the videos on YouTube are shallow and formulaic, with maybe thirty seconds' worth of content being stretched out to fill (at least) ten minutes. While many people are aware of this, far more folks are content to simply sit back and stare while an overly animated caricature of a person repeats themselves for the fifteenth time. There's no story being told, no knowledge being shared, and no substance to speak of... but viewers trick themselves into thinking that they're having a good time, if only because real entertainment has a somewhat similar taste to the placebo sort if you aren't really paying attention.\n\nTherein lies the crux of the problem: We don't *want* to pay attention. As a society, we've adopted this mindset that effort and expertise are both bad things. Anti-intellectualism runs rampant, with people actively defending it instead of looking for opportunities to improve themselves. How many writing errors do you see in a given day, do you think? How many myths do you see being repeated, and how many facts do you see being dismissed? We've become a culture that glorifies laziness and ignorance, and we try to hand-wave away any attempts at pointing them out.\n\nWorst of all, we reward the people who embody those traits.\n\nWe upvote single-sentence (or even single-word) comments on /r/AskReddit. We subscribe to YouTube channels that exist for no reason other than attract views. We send the message that we'd rather embrace easy-to-understand lies than truths which might require a little bit of thought. We turn to charlatans who promise health and happiness, and we shun anyone who encourages us to actually make a damned effort for a change. In short, we encourage the mindset that snake oil \u2013 in whatever form it make take \u2013 is the most desirable substance on the planet, and that the people who peddle it should be applauded.\n\nThere have always been lazy and ignorant individuals in the world, of course.\n\nHowever, this has been the first decade to give them preferential treatment.\n\n**TL;DR: The 2010s saw sales of snake oil shooting through the roof... and we keep demanding more of it.**",

I shave because the hair itches me and I don't like it. \n\nEdited to add this: just because my mother said a few crazy comments in her life, doesn't mean she was a bad person.

We just didn't wanna spend out time hanging out with them, but obviously there were some more private reasons too.\n\n  So one night before we had time to react my dad knocked and threw open the door and looked straight into my butthole with the way the bed was positioned at that time.

Books and expertise on this subject do exist.  I\u2019m always amazed that parents aren\u2019t ready to accept it when their kid starts to need privacy and independence and also resent that their kid has begun to want to spend more time with friends than parents.  Not only did they have like 10-12 years to prepare, they were kids themselves who went through exactly such a transition because it\u2019s 100% normal and healthy.

            "I (37F) have a 17 year old son. We have a great relationship, and I do this, but usually only at certain times of the day. Like, waking him up for school when he has slept through his alarm, around dinner time to let him know when it will be/is ready, or when he is gaming, because he can't hear shit when he is in a group with his noise-canceling headset. I knock, and open right away, and he expects it. \nI was also very open with him once he hit about 12, that I knew he was, uh, exploring himself. We had a long talk about sex, consent, and protection, and at the end I gave him a couple boxes of condoms. I told him since he was already testing out his manhood, I wanted him to practice with condoms too, so he wouldn't be a noob at it when it was game-time with a vagina in front of him. I let him know I wouldn't be checking to see how many he used, but to let me know when he needed more. At the end of that convo,  I explained that he did need to throw them out appropriately, and that he needed to pick appropriate times to enjoy himself, as there are just certain times I will just be more prone to the knock and enter (above mentioned times). He understood, and has never conveyed any issues with the arrangement. If it's later in the evening, especially on weekends, I knock, and wait for him to respond. If I can clearly hear he's gaming, I'll still knock and walk in. I never just knock and walk into the bathroom, that's asking for trouble. \nIt just has never been an issue for us, but I think it takes some intuition to have this work out alright. I've never walked in on him having an intimate moment, and he has never yelled, complained, or raged at me coming in. And we have a pretty open, and brutally honest, relationship. ",

Note, she is like 71 and we are totally best friends.\n\nHere's what she said:\n\nYou do it because you're in a hurry and don't want to be held up. Usually, you're putting away laundry or something like that and can't be bothered with hanging by the door and listening to some kid go \"Oh no. I need my privacy.\" It's like, listen you little shit, I work, this is my house, and I'm about my business. You're just sitting there jerking off or some shit. I don't have time for your \"boundaries\" and your \"privacy.\" I have a job and household to maintain. \n\nThen I asked, well, what if they actually are jerking off? And she said \"Masterbation is for the bathroom or late at night when everyone else is asleep. What the fuck is wrong with kids today? Everyone's got an iphone or ipad they can use to get porn. Take that shit to the bathroom and clean up after yourself. Jesus fucking Christ you think your mom finds your crusty pillows and blankets and doesn't know?\"\n\n\nSo. According to my mom, if you want boundaries or privacy, you need to help out more around the house and, also, stick to jerking it in the bathroom. \n",

As a mom, I vow to end this insanity and never do this to my children. \n\nMy mom used to do it though, still does actually when I'm visiting (I'm 29.) She would barge in my room as a teenager, no knock, turn on all the lights and start talking about random crap. All things I hate. Now if I'm visiting, if she's awake, she wants the house to be awake. 6am and shes banging pots and pans together or some shit and making the most noise humanly possible. \n\nMy dad used to knock super quiet and come in and freaking whisper if he needed anything. \n\n",

I am to still just knock and come in. \n\nThanks for the question, though. I will consider more habits that I should get an updated preference. ",
            "When my sister was 15 or 16 she would barge in to my room to put dirty clothes in my hamper because I guess hers filled up too quickly. So I was 10 or 11 and well into my masturbating-furiously-all-the- time phase. She would barge in, usually on the phone, dirty clothes in hand, and walk back out usually leaving the door open as I chided her about disrespect and a right to privacy which she would ignore completely. Most of the time I could hear her clomp clomping her way towards my room. One time I was caught so off guard, dick in hand, that I had to do a barrel roll off the side of the bed. She came in as I hit the ground. I heard confused laughter. She asked what I was doing. I yelled get out. She didn't until she was ready. I thought about lying but I also thought about telling the truth. After telling her I was goat choking she never barged in again. Maybe she didn't think it was possible a kid so young could be beating meat but she was mortified. Still is and she's 30 something. "

My daughter was in elementary school at the time, and she would go out of her way to introduce herself to the kids and take time to play with them. Several groups of kids came and went before we moved to another state.\nSeveral months after we moved, we were in town visiting, and bumped into the mom of one of my daughter's classmates. This mom is a child psychologist and she said, \"I just wanted you to know- I work a lot with the kids in foster care. And I kept hearing different kids talk about their friend <daughter's name>. I looked at these kids' paperwork and saw they had been placed in a home next door to where you all lived. It dawned on me that they were talking about your daughter.

            "TL:DR - I\u2019m one of two managers at a company. Our workers prefer to be on my crew rather than the other guy. Overheard them fighting to get a spot on my crew. Feels good bro. 11/10. \n\nLong story - \nMy coworker and I got our jobs at this company at the same time, went through training together, got qualified for certain tasks together and eventually both got management positions at the same time. He and I are good friends I\u2019d say, and we cooperate and work together seamlessly when needed. But, our leadership methods are vastly different. After a lot of my own research I found a foundation of positive reinforcement is equally if not more effective than an iron fist type leadership so that\u2019s how I run my program for my crew. He\u2019s the exact opposite and is very open about trying to make his crew fear him. \n\nBoth our methods get the job done, surely. But I try my best to make sure my crew doesn\u2019t dread coming to work. These guys and girls are the backbone of our operation and deserve respect. They\u2019re holding me up and making me look good with their accomplishments- so I take care of them as best I can and always give words of encouragement. So much so that I have this little joke where I call out someone\u2019s name across the hangar and just point at them like \u201cgood job bro\u201d and they get the message and laugh. Good vibes. \n\nAnyway our work schedules operate on a 3 month bidding rotation; Each mechanic will bid for which crew they want to be on which alternates weeks, and those with the higher seniority in the company get the more desirable shifts. \nIt boils down to choosing to be on my crew or my coworker\u2019s. Basically picking who your manager will be. Long story short I heard people were fighting to get on my crew. And overheard numerous times that my crew was much more preferred to be on. Just made me feel good that my efforts aren\u2019t in vain. I feel bad for my counterpart, but at the same time, a guilty part of me is like, \u201cyesssssssss.\u201d ",

She gave me my stuff and I went to go fill my drink at the fountain. From the other side, in the kitchen, I can hear her say to someone \"Oh my god. Did you see that guy? He's huge, looks like a viking. His lion maine is glorious. I can't believe he eats salads.\" I wanted to say something like \"Valhalla awaits me!\" or something but I'm not verbally articulate so I just left.",

I was one of the chefs, and most of my cooks were pretty inexperienced. I had one guy with a pretty solid amount of experience, who was venting to me about another employee. I told him to give the other guy a chance, that he was inexperienced but was a hard worker and very eager to learn. Apparently he was in earshot and over heard the entire conversation. \n\nJust before we closed for the season there was a big employee party, I was sitting with some of my cooks and the one I was talking about came up to me and pulled me aside. Told me he had over heard that conversation and that it really meant a lot to him, and that from there on he would always know that I had his back. He would end up being one of my best cooks and is returning to the job this summer to work with me again.",

            "Astronomer here! There are a lot of things posted here that are not really likely to happen any time soon or affect your life on Earth much. So, if you want something to worry about, may I introduce you to the [Carrington Event of 1859. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1859_geomagnetic_storm) Basically Carrington was a scientist who noticed a flash from a huge cluster of sunspots, which was the biggest coronal mass ejection from the sun ever recorded (aka a ton of material ejected from the sun at high speeds). It hit Earth within a day- aurora were seen as far south as Hawaii, wires on telephone poles burst into flame, and telegraph operators even reported contacting each other *when not connected*. If a similar event were to strike Earth today, it would cause billions of dollars in damage, because blown transformers are super hard to replace and a lot of satellites wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it (and it goes without saying you\u2019d have a serious radio blackout for a bit until it ended on a ton of essential frequencies). \n\nThe crazy thing about the Carrington event though is we really have no idea how often such events happen. But we do know that in 2012 there *was* a Carrington-level solar flare [that barely missed Earth...](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_2012)\n\nEdit: for those making \u201cnext in 2020\u201d jokes, this is not super likely this year. We do know these biggest flares happen during solar maximum- the sun has an 11 year cycle of sunspots and the period with the most is solar maximum. We are just coming out of a minimum so the next max would be 2025-2026 or so. \n\nHowever we really don\u2019t know how common these big flares are. Interestingly data from other stars shows they seem to be much more common around other stars than our own, with huge implications for life in some cases.\n\nEdit 2: apparently this was on a YouTube channel this week coincidentally, you don\u2019t need to be the 100th person chiming in to mention it",

            "My wife will tell me the next day when I do this.\n\nHer favourite story to tell is that she woke up in the middle of the night to find me slowly walking out of our bedroom.\nWife: \u201cAre you ok? What are you doing?\u201d\nMe: \u201cThere\u2019s somebody downstairs in the kitchen,  unrolling the tinfoil\u201d\nWife: \u201cOoooo-Kay. What\u2019s your plan?\u201d\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m going to stop them\u201d\nWife: \u201cShall we get a bit more sleep then both go down together?\u201d\nMe: \u201cOk\u201d.\n\nAnd I went back to bed. \n\nSubsequent investigations found a small plastic bag on the floor, near my head, being rustled by the movement of the curtain, the window being open.",
            "Not my current partner but my ex-boyfriend sometimes talks in his sleep and the funniest story was this one time i was still up reading a book and i hadn't noticed that he was already asleep next to me. \nSuddenly he bursts out \" Will you just give me the fucking yogurt already, Shannon!?\" in a flawless british accent and scares the shit out of me.\n\nWe're both german and none of our first languages include English.\nWe didn't know a Shannon.\nHe's lactose-intolerant.",
            "He farted very loudly and proceeded to say, \u201cyou got the wrong guy\u201d",
            "My girl woke up one night and said \"Did you find your rocks?\" and I asked her what she was talking about and she said \"I don't know, I'm just trying to make conversation.\" and promptly went back to sleep.\n\nShe has no recollection of this.",
            "My boyfriend woke me up the other day by gently putting his fingers in my mouth and I kept moving my head out of the way until eventually I was like \u201ccan you stop that!!!\u201d\n\nHe then sounded genuinely upset and asked why I woke him up as he was having a really nice dream about feeding a deer. Brilliant.",
            "Sigh; my boyfriend either recites postcodes (delivery driver) or calls the dog in his sleep. So either he is mad no one is responding to his postcode nonsense or I get a flying 30kg dog to my body",
            "My aunt likes to tell the story about her and my cousin sharing a hotel room one time. My aunt woke up having to pee, and found my cousin sitting up in bed with her arms folded across her abdomen, kind of rocking back and forth and giggling quietly. When my aunt asked her what she was doing, my cousin said, \u201cI\u2019m holding a baby and it has an adult smile!\u201d \n\nI found this story deeply unsettling.",
            "Once my ex said \"horse.\" That's all. Just horse. But with a sense of urgency.\n\nThe same ex told me I once sat straight up in bed and mumbled, \"Jesus, grandma, you scared the shit out of me.\" I had been dreaming that I was in bed at night and my grandma (still alive at the time) wandered into the room and stood at the end of the bed with a blank stare.",
            "So this one time while my s/o was sleeping, she randomly reaches over and starts to pet my leg softly. When I ask her what she\u2019s doing she looks at me like I\u2019m stupid and says \u201cwhat does it look like? I\u2019m petting this fluffy baby penguin.\u201d Then pauses for a second, pats my leg again and blurts our \u201cWait this isn\u2019t a penguin!\u201d I have never laughed so hard over someone talking in their sleep\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards kind strangers!",

            "My wife started screaming one night that she was lost in the local grocery store. And that no matter where she went she couldn't find her way out. I asked her has she tried checking out at the cash registers?

            "\nOne night, my boyfriend  woke me up in the middle of the night, tapping me on my shoulder. He put his  finger on his mouth, whispered \"shush\" to me, then pointed at the door and told me \"I can hear something, don't move\". Predictably, I nearly shit my pants. All the worst possible scenarios crossed my mind, and the moment of silence after he shushed me felt like hours. Then, he started waving his hands and talking about tetris, 'the twirlies' (idk), and making sure we don't align... And that's how I learnt my boyfriend talks in his sleep.",
            "Heck yes. Please take a seat.\n\nMy wife was an avid sleep talked for a long time and her midnight announcements range from simple single words to elaborate speeches. The ones that really stand out to me are:\n\nWaking up in the middle of the night to her suddenly sitting violently up in bed, throwing back the covers, and screeeeaaaaming: \u201cTARANTULA!!\u201d. That will make you very awake, very quickly.\n\nWhispering my name repeatedly which woke me up so she could share in a hushed, cautious voice: \u201cThere is an alligator in here.\u201d When I expressed my concern (playing along) she told me, still whispering, that: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It has been here before.\u201d\n\nBut my all time favorite was when, from her perspective as she later explained, she was dreaming that I was playfully sneaking up on her and she saw me and was calling me on it. From my perspective, my wife sat up in the middle of the night, starting into the darkest corner of the room and said repeatedly in a soft sing-song voice: \u201cI seeee youuuu.\u201d My flipping blood froze.\n\nTLDR: My wife is terrifying.\n\nEDIT 1: Thanks for the awards! I am glad this has managed to make some people laugh/cry at work.",

            "Years ago, my wife was mumbling in her sleep and seemed a bit upset.  I wanted to comfort her, without waking her up too much, so I said, \"Honey, you're fine.  Do you know where you are?\"  \n\nShe slugged me in the arm, and said \"I'm in place where punch buggies are seen first.\"  She then rolled over and muttered to herself, \"chugga-chugga-chugga-buggy\", and went back to sleep.\n\nShe didn't remember a think the next morning.",
            "My mom sleepwalks sometimes.  When she was in the middle of her residency, she came into my room in the middle of the night and sharply asked, \"Did you give {patient} her dose of {medication} like I asked you to 15 minutes ago?\"\n\n\n I groggily replied, \"Who? Wha?\"\n\n\nShe just huffed and said, \"Well I guess that answers my question.\" Before turning around and leaving.

He stood up, walked into the wall, then stood there like he was contemplating the barrier. He just backed up exactly as he came, sat down and swung back into bed like nothing happened. That was creepy.",
            "I have had funnier experiences than this one, but cannot remember exactly what was said... most recently, though:\n\nMy boyfriend scoots over to me to big spoon/little spoon, and I snuggle in, thinking that\u2019s all it was, then he gets real close to my ear and whispers, \u201cJust so you know, there\u2019s something in the closet. Like a... a cartoon turtle.\u201d I did my best not to bust out laughing and just said, \u201cOk honey!\u201d When he woke up, he had no memory of it whatsoever, of course!",

            "When I was a child about 5 years old, I was sleeping in my parents bed for some reason (*probably a storm*). Mom was awake, dad and I were asleep. Suddenly my father and I have this cross-sleep conversation while my mom lays between us, quietly freaked out:  \n\n\n\"Dad, you better not take my toys!\" I mutter angrily. \n\n\"Ok, I won't\" my father responds. \n\n\"Don't even touch them.\" \n\n\"Ok.\"\n\nNot particularly scintillating conversation, but notable for the fact that were both asleep and still responding to each other.  It was like making Alexa and Siri talk to each other lol",
            "My boyfriend had his tonsils removed awhile back, so he was on some pain-reducing drugs that kept him sedated and, in his words, made him \"a fucking dumbass.\" He had a conversation in his sleep with me about how I shouldn't trust leprechauns, because they conned him out of gold coins by giving him foil-wrapped chocolate coins instead. Also, he said not to trust Irish people, because they were honorary leprechauns.",
            "Not my partner, but my younger brother and I used to share a room and used bunkbeds. \nOne night I heard him mumble \n\n\"I don't create the weather, I just predict it.\"",
            "My brother did that in the middle of the night. He would get up, go into the living room, say some nonsense shit to our parents and go back to bed. It was actually pretty creepy the first times, because he was like: \u201cThey ARE in the walls. THEY ARE!\u201d",

I pointed out his arm was UNDER his pillow. He said ok and started snoring. \nIt took me another hour to get back to sleep. He didn\u2019t wake up at all.\n\nEdit: blimey went to bed and this went crazy overnight. Thanks to those who reached out in concern to check on his health. He participated in a sleep study and it was found to be stress related. Luckily not Sleep apnea. Also, he did wake up, just not until morning. Didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d phrased it in such a way that people thought he\u2019d died!",

            "Oh man, not my partner but my brother.\n\nI was watching The Exorcist with my dad and my brother, and at the beginning of the movie, some archaeologists find a little statue that releases the devil or something. Anyway we finish the movie, and my brother falls asleep on the other couch, so my dad and I just watch another movie.\n\nThe second that movie ended, my brother sat bolt upright and walked to the middle of the room asking \"where's the statue?\", and we're like \"what statue?\" and he's going \"the statue! The statue!\" -- eventually he makes a motion with his hands like he's picking something up, moves it over about a foot, and then puts this imaginary statue back down.  He went right back to sleep again after.\n\nMy dad and I just looked at each other like \"uhhhhh what the fuck just happened?!\", but we got a great laugh out of it.",

            "Roommate freshman year of college was a sleepwalker/sleeptalker. We were in the freshman dorms, small little room. I woke up one night and saw him sitting straight up on the side of the bed just staring at me (eyes fully open) just talking gibberish about golf. He was going on about Phil Mickelson or some shit. Have to be honest, it was creepy as all hell because he was staring directly into my eyes. Next morning, I told him about it and he just laughed and said, sorry, I tend to do that from time to time.",
            "I'd be the king of Monaco! My wife said this one night out of nowhere. The funniest part was her tone of voice,proud and assertive, like she was really sure of her claim to the throne. Anyway, the joke's on her, Monaco is a principality.\n\nWow, thanks everyone, I've never had a post or comment get above 10 upvotes before and definitely never had any awards!!",
            "My boyfriend sat bolt upright in bed in the middle of the night, he doesn\u2019t usually sleep talk.\n\nHim: \u201cThere\u2019s a thing over there\u201d\n\nMe, absolutely shitting myself: \u201cWhat thing?\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cUpgrade!\u201d\n\nMe, relieved but very confused: \u201cWhat kind of upgrade?\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cBaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggg\u201d\n\nMe: \u201coh a bag upgrade okay, carry more stuff\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cYeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201d\n\nHe then flopped down and began snoring letting me slowly recover from the massive spike in heart rate. Your boyfriend sitting up in a dark room and looking at the corner saying \u201cthere\u2019s a thing over there\u201d is NOT fun. Turns out he\u2019d just been playing too may games!",
            "Not a partner but in military training and school I often took the night shift for guard duty. The amount of sleepwalkers and talkers is way fucking higher than I expected. It is straight creepy when you have to walk down the halls with a covered flashlight listening to big-ass grown men mumbling and lashing out in their sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat takes the cake though is often sleepwalkers will just kinda stop randomly. So you'll be walking along in the pitch-black darkness and suddenly there is just a fucking dude standing there. Eyes generally closed, or worse... open, just kinda listing to the side or leaning against a bedpost or wall. After I'd suppress all the swear words I was about to yell out; nothing much to do but kinda prod them along back to their bed. For all the randomness that is being part of the military, I really didn't expect one of my jobs to be gently tucking my fellow soldiers back into their beds.",
            "Husband woke up in the morning and told me about a crazy dream he had: we were hosting a party and he was serving cookies. He was upset that nobody was eating them. When we went downstairs, we discovered a full plate of cookies sitting on our dining table.",
            "I'm the sleep talker. I don't remember any of this, but my boyfriend said I did this to him. \n\n In the middle of the night I hit my boyfriend's ass hard with my knee. Obviously he was pretty upset. He sat up to stretch, and I said \"I'll stretch too!\". Did stretches, and laid back down. \n\nThen, while making full eye contact with him, I grabbed the blanket and threw it off of him. Then rolled over and started snoring immediately.",
            "We were freshly married and living overseas. My husband hadn\u2019t had much sleep the nights before, which usually enhances any sleep talking. It was hot in our room. My husband mumbled something which I didn\u2019t quite catch. I asked him to repeat it. He got up, opened the bedroom window and said very pointedly \u201cAir flow, Bitch!\u201d then laid back down, completely asleep. Now, my husband has never, not once, ever called me a name or even raised his voice to me, so this is particularly hilarious.\n\nEdit: you guys are FAR too kind with all the awards and upvotes! Thank you so much!!!\n\nAlso, this happened before Breaking Bad was a big thing, so maybe my husband is the original Jesse Pinkman? Except without all the meth and mayhem, of course.",

            "My boyfriend is bilingual and sometimes I catch him sleep talking in Punjabi, I\u2019ve never heard him sleep talking in English. \n\nHe also once punched me in the middle of my spine while fully asleep. When he woke up he claims in his dream he was giving him mum CPR...\n\nHe sometimes also suffers from night terrors. It happened often when we first started dating (almost every time he slept or napped) but it hasn\u2019t happened for probably over a year. It happened like two nights ago where he just started screaming like a banshee in his sleep. It was wild and terrifying.",
            "When my girlfriend and I started dating she told me that she\u2019s been told she talks in her sleep from time to time, and unfortunately has nightmares fairly often. One of the first nights we spent together she wakes up at 2am and sits up super fast. It wakes me up and I look over only to hear her quickly say, \u201cPizza. Order a pizza,\u201d then lie back down and start snoring within a minute. God I love that woman lmao",
            "Not my partner, but my mom.\n\nShe talks and moves a lot during the night.

She\u2019ll sit up for this sometimes, never seen her walk. \n\nI usually just say yes ma\u2019am, will do. because she\u2019s the boss. And she goes right back to sleep.

            "My husband once randomly blurted out \"bread for the ducks!\" and just got up out of bed and went downstairs before curling back up on the sofa.\n\nHe woke up so confused the next morning. He was convinced we'd had an argument he'd forgotten.",

            "No gems, just horrors. I sleepwalk once in a while but apparently when I was a toddler I used to sleepwalk, cry and say 'she's following me' or just try to leave the house by myself.\nNowadays if it happens, I wake up looking at my reflection in the mirror in the dark. When that happens it fucking creeps me out so I won't sleep the rest of the night.\n\nEdit 1: Why don't I move or cover the mirror? The first time it happened, I covered the mirror but with my morning rushes to work, I pull the cloth down to get ready, and then cover it when I reach home. I've had and still have peaceful nights of sleep (with dimmed lights on) so eventually I'd skip on covering mirror and focussed more not being afraid of the dark. When I least expect it, I then I catch myself waking up to the mirror with a gentle head bump/nod. Get spooked at the incident, rinse and repeat with a blanket cover. I generally have good nights of sleep, these sleepwalks are very rare so I'm really I'm more concerned about my fear of sleeping in the dark. I can't do it. I need a dimmed light for bedtime.\n\nEdit 2: Is it this particular mirror in my room? Yes, it's always this mirror but maybe I haven't had enough sleepovers to have another sleepwalking state elsewhere. I think it's just my subconscious self remembering how I like the mirror during the daytime to get ready, do my hair, makeup, try clothes, etc. I live in a shared flat so I can only leave it in my room.

I once woke up, wrestled it from her, screamed \"Fucking woolly balloon!\" And threw it across the room.\n\nOne time, we were staying at her dad's house and he had a \"no funny business under my roof\" rule which I fully respected. In the middle of the night, however, I sat up in bed, woke my girlfriend, and said, in my loudest voice \"God, there's some places I could bang you in this house!\"\n\nWith my current girlfriend, I have threatened to \"beat [her son] into next week\" if he carried on making noise... Sleep talking isn't all fun and games!",
            "I'm the sleeptalker in this situation, but it happened with my partner so I'm counting it. We'd been in bed probably an hour or two, and at the time, I had an injured shoulder (important later).\n\nI woke up because I thought I heard him saying something, and I was under the impression that he was the one talking in his sleep, so I told him he was sleeptalking, then I rolled over and went back to sleep. In the morning I recounted my experience, and he told me what had actually happened.\n\nAccording to him, I was shuffling around in bed and he was concerned about my shoulder, so he asked me if I was okay. I turned around to face him and said:\n\n'He turned himself into a fucking pickle'\n\nThen grabbed his arm, turned round and pulled him into spooning position and went straight back to sleep. I have absolutely no memory of it, but it's probably my favourite of my sleeptalking/walking stories now",
            "Not a partner, but apparently something I did. I used to work at a canoe camp in Minnesota. The guides would share rooms. Me and my roommate would jokingly tell the other guides and campers that we spooned at night as a joke.  \n\nFlash forward to a couple weeks later and we get another guide in our room. Apparently, on his first in our cabin, I slept talked, and said \u201cBig spoon in the back small spoon in the front! ITS A PARTY!\u201d We proceeded to think for the next week he moved into the looney bin.",
            "First of all, he only sleep walks/talks when he is super tired.  And if he's been really stressed out sometimes it will be a few nights in a row.  Probably my favorite one is that my husband was sleep talking about work one night. \nHe must have been on a construction job and he was arguing with a co worker and said in an exasperated tone, \"no (insert co worker name here), that's not how you do it!\"\nI was annoyed and exhausted because this was the third night in a row he had kept me up talking so I snapped at him and told him to be quiet.  A few seconds later I hear frantic whispering from him, but thought, \"whatever, at least he's quiet\" and was able to fall back asleep.",

            "One story of my sleepwalking that I\u2019m reminded of often was just after my granny died. I walked into the living room, hours after I had gone to bed, and said \u201cIt\u2019s okay, granny didn\u2019t die! It was Cookie(our cat)\u201d. My mum pointed to the cat sitting on the floor and said \u201cshe\u2019s right there\u201d. And I just laughed and walked away right back to my bed and back to sleep",
            "My time to shine! I\u2019m the sleep walker here. My poor husband is woken up in the middle of the night at least twice a week due to my shenanigans; more often if I\u2019m stressed out. I keep telling him he needs to write a book about all the crazy things I say and do in my sleep. Most of the time, I wake up confused and don\u2019t recognize him and end up yelling at him to get out of my bed. Other times, I forget he\u2019s there and continue acting out my dream. \n\nOne time, I thought I was a maid in an upscale hotel and started taking the sheets off the bed to wash them while he was still sleeping in the bed. Another time I frantically jumped out of bed and ran to the window to open it. I was convinced my \u201crabbitbirds\u201d (rabbits tied to birds I guess? I have no idea) we\u2019re outside in the snow and needed to be let inside. We live in Southern California in an area that never gets snow. \n\nHowever, my crown jewel story comes from when I was young. I had fallen asleep on the couch and my older sister \u201cK\u201d came to take me to bed. Instead of walking to my room, I walked into the bathroom, put a few pumps of soap in my hand and sat on the toilet in silence. Completely bewildered, K asks me what the hell I\u2019m doing. I respond by shushing her and telling her that \u201cI\u2019m making planets.\u201d I have no recollection of this event but I\u2019ve had the story told to me so many times over my life I almost feel like I can remember it.",
            "I am the sleepwalker. \n\nI once woke up in the middle of the living room, on the floor. According to what I founded and what my family founded., I just walked into the room, stepped on a lego (that woke me up), and was so surprised I fell, and knocking myself out.\n\nAnd another.\n\nI once woke up in a field, in pyjama, it was raining, I woke up because one cow was pushing me, it was traumatizing because I had no idea of where I was or why the fuck I was here.",
            "These are all random separate occasions:\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck *is* that??\u201d While pointed towards the window but not looking quite at it.\n\n\u201cThe wires in the wall. They\u2019re watching us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s probably just monsters.\u201d\n\nBut mostly just screaming in terror. Then right back to sleep.\n\nOh... when he was a kid he was sleeping at a friend\u2019s house. He woke up squeezed between the wall and the entertainment center climbing up the shelves.",
            "Years ago, before we were married, my sleeping husband asked me if I loved him, I said yes. His response was \"if you loved me there would be more pizza.\" He talks all the time in his sleep, but usually doesn't make any sense, so this is my favorite!",
            "When my wife and I first started dating I found out she was a sleep talker.  At the time she was working in a call center taking reservations for a major hotel chain.  She started trying to take a reservation in her sleep one night so I played along.  Normal requests at first but then I started asking for more and more outlandish stuff I wanted in my room.  Like a jacuzzi that could fit 20 people and a buffet for my pet snails. I eventually pushed too far and she woke up just staring at me asking what the hell I was doing.  She's had a few of these types of episodes in the many years we have been together but nothing quite so detailed and interactive as that one."

            "That 4Chan would use this new information to fuck with people in terrible but sometimes hilarious ways. \n\nCan you imagine Mike Pence one day making a sobbing appeal to the internet after thousands of dudes all over the world coordinated their dom daddy Pence masturbation fantasy to commence just as Pence sat down for Sunday service? \n\n\"I mean sure it's kinda gay. Mike Pence isn't someone I would normally be attracted to, but at the end of the day, he hates it more than I do so it's all worth it.\"\n\n\nI think a more accurate answer would be people becoming more accepting of sexuality and the differences between men and women in how they approach sex shrinking. If everyone knows how much everyone masturbates the whole sexual shame thing would lessen so in theory, women wouldn't be as worried about being called names for their natural wants and desires. \n\nThe downside of this would be it would be a new form of harassment. I think you'd find a lot of people, both famous and not, developed issues from the constant bombardment of how many people are thinking about them. Aside from the Pence comparison, I think it could make many victim's lives hellish if their abuser was able to continue tormenting them remotely. \n\nHowever, the flip side is also true, you would have lots of scandals like \"Bernie Sanders thought about an aide!

The feeling lasted only seconds however she is certain the source was the Vermont Senator. When asked for Comment Sen. Sanders replied that he was looking through his phone at the number of people now people covered under his state's expanded medicare coverage and accidentally swiped from the PowerPoint screenshot to a photo of a rally where his staffer was a speaker. He regrets the mistake and insists that in no way can the 28-year-old former volleyball star and IG model compare to his love of bar graphs.\"\n\nPorn would change too.

My buddy, overjoyed that someone had actually entertained his phone call, immediately asks the kid if he knows of any parties going on. Just as the kid on the other line responds that he and his buddies are in search of a party as well, another Jeep with a group of kids pulls up next to us at a traffic light and I can hear the echo of his response coming from the vehicle right next to us. Wait, are you in the car right next to us!? Both vehicles start freaking out at the light! We all pulled into a nearby parking lot, had a laugh about the randomness that had just transpired and then tracked down that party where Mike ended up losing his virginity.

He gets done and sees all the messages telling him his camera is on, and promptly leaves the meeting.\n\nCisco ends up firing the guy over this and I believe he ended up suing for invasion of privacy and winning or something like that.\n\nSo that, kids, is why you have to turn your camera on before every meeting (or get notified that it's on).",

            "First, let's mention an occurrence that sets the most violent end of a scale of things that could happen, and I thank you for motivating me to look it up after having heard of it over and over for a few decades: Have you ever heard of a firefighter being blown out of his boots?\n\nFor example, an article about the West Fertilizer Plant Explosion in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, that happened in 2013 and was easy to find via google, contains this quote from a firefighter:\n\n\u201cI do not recall the explosion,\u201d says Payne.  \u201cI didn\u2019t hear the explosion, or [sic] feel the explosion.  The people who found me, I was in a sitting position\u2014is what they tell me\u2014my eyes were open and fixed, my boots were in one place and I was in another.  In other words, I was blown out of my boots.\u201d\n\nIn other words, that day he put on his boots and laced them up, or did whatever one does to affix one's boots, to keep one's boots from coming loose during a firefight, and after an explosion he found that both his boots had come off.\n\nOur firefighter's experience, then, shows that it is possible for one to lose a boot, even when tightly fitted to one's feet. \n\nWhat might have happened with Cinderella?\n\nLet's guess that a pumpkin coach might occupy a space similar to, say, a sphere of five feet radius (Cinderella was dainty, of course, so this would be large enough for her. After all, we're not talking about her ugly stepsisters here.) That would occupy a volume in the range of about 65 cubic feet. When it changed back to a pumpkin, those 65 cubic feet would have been instantaneously replaced by a pumpkin probably in the range of one cubic foot of volume. That would have been experienced and witnessed as an implosion.  (We won't talk about the experience of the horses that suddenly become mice.)\n\nThis now brings up something ignored in the TV shows that refer to people trekking among the stars (not the stars who dance, but the stars that shine). That is, \"beaming up\" requires the space occupied by the person or item to suddenly become bereft of matter in the sending location, and that same amount of space to suddenly be occupied in the receiving location by matter that was not there previously. Any transporter worth its dilithium would accomplish this transfer VERY rapidly (not as shown in the TV shows), so there would be an actual small explosion at the receiving site and an implosion at the sending site. The shock waves from this occurrence might easily \"damage the port nacelle,\" as we so often hear, or do other damage.\n\nAt any rate, we now have established that it is possible for a person to be separated from his or her shoes, and that conversion of something from one physical volume to another would create a kind of explosion.\n\nI think that about covers it. I could go on, but that truly does about cover it. It has been shown that it is possible to lose one's shoe under circumstances that Cinderella was exposed to.\n\nThe glaring question is this: why didn't the other shoe revert to its previous material, size and shape? How did the prince have one of those shoes to fit to all the feet in the kingdom? I mean, is this stuff all just a fairy tale?",

            "You know, I was thinking about it and personally I'd be happier getting a role for being fat or ugly than losing a role for not being attractive enough.",
            "I work at a theatre school. The acting students are typically striking-looking in some way. Strikingly beautiful, strikingly gaunt, strikingly unsettling, strikingly kind. The fat students are usually a bit big but also very strong and agile. The ugly students are ugly in a unique and interesting way, not merely less-attractive than their peers, but positively more ugly. They're both the same distance from plain, but in different directions.   \n\nThis is usually a selling point for them, and they know it.  Someone who looks fat and lazy but has the stamina to perform all day is an absolute prize. Someone whose selling point is his trainwreck of a face knows exactly what he looks like, and in conjunction with his performance skills, has a very sellable product. \n\nRemember that most roles have an audition process. You subscribe to, or ask your agent to keep an eye out for roles you are confident you can play. Most actors aren't after a Juliet, a Hamlet. They are after roles that fit their description and skill set. \"Short, plump ginger-haired woman with a maternal smile in her late 40s\" is a role certain actors will find and send in a headshot for, just like \"Hispanic, unattractive, 50+ lbs overweight man, lazy eye or missing teeth desirable\" will catch the eye of others. You apply for the roles. \n\nProfessional actors are confident self-starters after a job that pays, that gets them seen, that lets them show off their range, so as to continue building their career.",
            "I spent a few years in LA going to auditions. Some of the roles i got cast in include overweight jogger, fat guy with beard and guy waiting in line for donuts (which was actually not a specifically fat guy audition more a hipster which was also a lot of the roles i went out for. \n\nIt wasnt that awkward. And i got to know a lot of dudes who kind of look like me just from seeing them at the same auditions.\n\nMost awkward audition was for a Polish tire commercial where i had to be topless.",

Ugly actors aren\u2019t less smart or self aware than good looking ones. For example, little people or dwarfves, they get into acting knowing that they will more likely be an elf in a Christmas special than end up like Peter Dinklage, but they want to act regardless. \n\nBottom line? We are all too needy and self obsessed to feel awkward, even the ugly ones.",

            "Former casting director in **Hollywood for 13 years (HBO, Netflix, and every major network** + some international commercials): it\u2019s not awkward at all. It\u2019s a business like any other business, and every role has a place and is extremely important. The actors all know that. I\u2019ve never had a single actor not really want a part. They all know that any role can be a huge career booster at any level so be it for commercials, music videos, TV shows or film (all of which I cast), they 1) were stoked on the money and 2) knew it could be a great opportunity to do what they loved, make great connections on set (leads to more roles), and take their career to the next level. \n\nI\u2019ll add that the breakdown for a role (aka Hollywood term for \u201cjob listing\u201d) never says \u201cugly.\u201d Like every business, Hollywood has its own vocabulary. And as others have pointed out \u201cHollywood ugly\u201d is not \u201cevery day life ugly.\u201d If you think about it, any \u201cugly actor\u201d always has some really specific character traits that make them who they are: funny, charming, devious, conniving,.. So the actor needs to have those/act them well. Aka it\u2019s rarely *just* about their looks. A role might be listed as \u201cage: 50s-60s character actor, quirky, fun-loving,..\u201d a whole lot of other descriptors, along with a 3 line summary of key traits/ context. All professional actors know what that means, and all that audition are there because they want to be. It isn\u2019t a bait and switch. There are no surprises.\n\nOverwhelmingly, almost all actors I\u2019ve cast were an absolute joy to work with - a solid 98%. *(Only about 2% were not. Some of those you\u2019ve seen in the press.)* And they absolutely would come back for repeat roles even if \u201ccharacter\u201d roles. \n\nI always treated every cast member with great kindness and respect (regardless of how they looked) because I knew the value that each one brought. I was always very grateful for their hard work because they made the whole project come together, and that made everyone happy.\n- Also casting directors are rooting for their cast to kick ass! We get just as excited (behind the scenes) to see them crush a role as they are to play the role, this means *all the actors*: young, old, pretty or \u201ccharacter.\u201d We\u2019re stoked equally for each one\u2019s success!\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a **Hollywood \u2018Ugly\u2019 Fun Fact**: typically where networks draw the line is **teeth**. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s kind of a known joke.  NBC, ABC,... you name it: a person could be missing a limb, hair, appendages,.. not a problem just as long as they have all their teeth. That\u2019s where they draw the line.  It would appear that for Americans at least, it\u2019s the one thing that makes people actually change the channel.\n\n\nEdit 2: Adding a **response about Kids** - per the question above regarding \u201ccasting the unattractive kid: In short, I never cast roles like that because I simply couldn\u2019t on a moral/ conscience level. Parents of kid actors are often ... well, just unique/difficult (think stage mom who wants their kid to be famous), so I already have my own views on all that. I didn\u2019t want to contribute to the problem. \nDuring my time in the biz, I only cast a couple projects with kids in them, and I only chose things that\u2019s were super fun, encouraging and that the kid would have a blast filming and be proud of. \n\n**[music video I cast: the little girl. So Good To Me by Chris Malinchak](https://youtu.be/KrMl32cuC2A)** \nBecause who wouldn\u2019t love **playing with a giraffe all day** for a day? (And make money). Super fun.\n\nEdit: omg, You guys. Thank you for all the awards! I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found my comment(s) informative. Casting for me was a real joy: getting to find diamonds in the rough and having the honor of helping some of them on their path to forging great careers, playing amazing roles, and touching so many of you through their art and the characters they played. It\u2019s a special kind of magic, and I was happy to be a part of it. Now i get to sit back and watch my friends who are still in the business continue that work. :)",
            "To actually answer the question that nobody has directly; not awkward at all. People will absolutely jump at the chance to be 'the ugly one.' They don't really care. It might be awkward mentally for them, maybe, but it's nothing personal and they know it - just another job opportunity. \n\nLike a classic meme goes: \"If someone paid you $200 but had to call you ugly would you take it?\" \"Of course, I'm ugly. Not stupid.\"\n\nEDIT: For what it's worth too, I think a main point is that it's an audition for the *role* of an ugly person, doesn't mean you ARE dreadfully ugly.

            "Hello. I\u2019ve made a few indie/low budget films, acted in more than a few, and have had a hand assisting on crew.\n\nFor the process I\u2019ve witnessed, those in charge were pretty straightforward with everything as far as what the role was.\n\nExample: the first role I was ever casted for was a smaller part in an indie slasher. I was told I looked like a smarmy dick, and once I started acting the part they casted me immediately. This is nothing new for me. For whatever reason I always look like I\u2019m brooding or glaring (I guess it\u2019s the guy version of RBF). They didn\u2019t mean it in a bad way, either. When they talked about my look, it was all for the sake of the camera, and when they got to know me they learned quickly I\u2019m very easy to get along with. What\u2019s more, talent + that certain look brought in quite a few inquiries for availability to play villains, bullies, corporate shills, and etc. it ain\u2019t much, but it\u2019s honest work.\n\nThe same can be said about other roles. If a role needed a bigger person, once the casting crew found their candidates, they were straightforward in letting them know what the role was. Of course they were respectful, but transparency and respect were key so that everyone felt comfortable on set, and especially if those characteristics became the butt of a joke. \n\nTo be frank, though, I\u2019ve never met an actor who was delusional with their appearance because they understood the camera is objective (this isn\u2019t to say they don\u2019t exist, but that\u2019s my experience).",
            "There's a model agency in London called [Ugly](https://www.ugly.org/). I imagine everyone involved knows what's involved.\n\nMore generally, by the time they leave acting school most actors will have figured out whether they are going to be playing Juliet. Fat people know they are fat. They move forward, or not, on that basis. I imagine it is a bit like playing bad guys. You want to tell the stories so you play the role that the stories demand.\n\nIn some cases an attractive person will be made ugly by using make-up and/or prosthetics. If you have to, you could do the same with an ugly person to save their self-esteem.",
            "I remember that when I was a kid, I was always so offended that I\u2019d always be cast as the ugly/funny roles. The old lady pirate in Pirates of Penzance. Or the \u2018funny\u2019 sidekick. The one who couldn\u2019t sing in A Chorus Line.\n\nBut then I became a Drama teacher and started casting kids in roles. And I realised, from the POV of the teacher, you only gave the ugly/funny roles to the genuinely talented kids. The ones you knew could pull it off.\n\nBecause it\u2019s actually a lot easier to play an attractive/romantic lead than it is to play a goblin/she-witch/troll.\n\nSo now I try to remember that the kids cast as the ugly one is probably gonna be upset that they didn\u2019t get the sexy romantic lead with the sweeping ballad, and I try to reassure them that they got the part not because they can\u2019t play the romantic lead, but that no one else was good enough to play their part.",

Weirdly enough it\u2019s the \u201cpretty ones\u201d that have issues, not the character type actors. Most character actors really like being character actors bc they get the fun roles!  They enjoy \u201cuglifying\u201d themselves for auditions!

It was awkward for me to be honest.

            "Tbh as a professional actor, it's so much easier to get roles if you have an interesting look - some call it ugly, but it's basically a face you (or a casting director looking at hundreds of people every day) will remember. Good example could be that new actress who played the main role in Queen's Gambit or the classic, Benedict Cumberbatch. They were not type cast as ugly, even though their look is NOT the mainstream of beauty. It's also worth remembering it's possible to make an average looking human either ugly or drop-dead gorgeous just by make-up, and if you're filming something, you have a whole team of people making sure you GLOW.\n\nThere's plenty of naturally good-looking actors, and some of the prettiest women I know have had the hardest time finding roles, because there's hundreds of other gorgeous white, blue-eyed brunettes with long hair and they do not stand out from the crowd at all. Meanwhile I have a rather specific look and often get auditions of very niche characters and often I'm one of the 20 people they could find in all of UK that sort of match the brief. Not to mention if you go on agent's websites, they usually send all their \"pretty women in 20s\" castings with a portfolio of 10+ clients (including me,  even if I have a different look), but if they have a \"woman with short hair\" or \"black nerdy boy\" they'll often have only 1 person matching the call in their books.",

            "When I was a manager in retail I used to ask the question \u201cWhat was the last thing you\u2019ve ever stolen?\u201d during interviews. I was asked it during a previous interview for a job and I asked my manager why she asked it. It\u2019s a good way to tell if someone is capable of being honest and accountable in a situation that may not have favorable results (i.e. \u201cscrewing\u201d up the interview). I noticed that most of my associates that answered the question honestly would usually own up to mistakes made on the job and wouldn\u2019t try to lie their way out of problems or throw others under the bus.\n\nEdit: To add a few clarifications for some of the comments I saw\n\n-It was never poised to be a \u201cgotcha!\u201d question. I\u2019d only ever used someone\u2019s response against them a couple times, one in particular admitted to stealing clothes from the previous store they worked at and would \u201cforget\u201d to pay for them.\n\n-It was a question that was derived from our \u201cmanager interview questions\u201d sheet we filled out when interviewing candidates. The original question was \u201cHave you ever stolen anything?\u201d And we were allowed to modify wording of the questions as long as they were in reason.\n\n-Its not a question that was only asked of certain candidates. If you interviewed at our store, you were asked that question, doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what position it was for. \n\n-Being asked if you\u2019ve ever stolen is a very very common question asked during interviews where you are dealing with money, or in retail of some sort. A lot of companies have to deal with internal theft as well as external (internal=employee theft, external=customer theft) and it\u2019s generally asked to make sure someone won\u2019t be a risk for internal theft. I would use the question as a way to gauge if I could believe someone to be honest if a mistake occurred and having a sense of accountability. \n\n-If someone replied they never stolen or couldn\u2019t remember, I would use how confident they were in their response. It was very easy to tell if someone was sincere or not.\n\n-It\u2019s not meant to be an offensive question. When interviewing a candidate, I need to get to know you. No one \u201clooks like\u201d they steal, much like no one looks like they commit any crime. I literally have no idea if you steal or not. It was a question asked if every single person interviewing for our company among a million other questions.\n\n-I would usually follow up with my personal answer that stole a CD from Walmart when I was 16. I wanted to make sure the candidate knew it was okay to answer that question. \n\n-Background checks usually weren\u2019t run until the very end of the hiring process. We would conduct two separate manager interviews, and if we agreed we wanted to hire a candidate, we would reach out to HR to run all of that stuff before making the offer. We would generally never see the results of a background check as that was an HR thing. So we would have no idea if you were arrested for theft or anything like that when we conducted our manager interviews. \n\nAnd yes, I am aware that some companies do use this as something against you which I personally think is dumb, but with the few retail companies I worked for, it never was unless you gave a really incriminating answer. My experience is completely anecdotal to others.",

He arrived at the bank and sat for the interview, after half an hour of the interview going seemingly well,  the interviewer thanked my dad for coming and told him he didn't get the job. \n\nDad asked politely why he had missed out, the banker replied \n\"well you turned up today in a raincoat AND brought an umbrella.... You're obviously a pessimist. We need optimists at ML\". \n\nDad left and on his way home forgot the posh umbrella on the train. He took that day as a sign that a career in the City wasn't for him.

            "I remember it like it was yesterday, at the very emotionally prepared age of 7.\n\nMy brother and dad both played WoW and had level 60 characters which I never really had the patience to level myself.\n\nAnyways I wanted a cool character myself, so I decided to search for \"wow\" on eBay, hoping to find accounts and dissociate in fantasies about where I was a fully geared badass.\n\nThe things that popped up were porn DVDs, and alot of them at that! \"Wow! That's what I call sex!\"\n\nI was NOT ready. \n\nThe emotion I felt wasn't curiosity or disgust, but a subtle mix between both, I felt as though a primal instinct was creeping up on me, shit was weird, I would revisit the cover of these DVDs pretty regularly.\n\nNow, this is where it gets weird and comically tragic.\n\nI had never seen a penis before, and neither a fully erect one at that. So the natural question is, Why doesn't mine look like that?\n\nI don't know if most people remember this but, when you're a kid, the glans of your penis is stuck to your foreskin, and you cant pull it back because its attached very hard. \n\nSo when I noticed this I thought I was a freak, one day I realized I could see the tip of the purple iceberg and oh boy, there was so much fucking skin attached to it that I panicked.\n\nFrom that day on, during bathtime I would pull my skin so hard til it ripped off and only stopped when my tears were pouring down or if I was bleeding heavily.\n\nIt was some 127 hours vibe shit, sometimes I still have nightmares about it. Every bathtime for months, my instincts told me that I NEEDED to do this. It doesn't stop there.\n\nOne day I came to the end. there was only one part left between me and being normal, and it was going to be the hardest one.\n\nGuess what part?\n\nYup, the frenulum, banjo string, whatever you want to call it.\n\nYou'd think evolution would have found a way for you to know what is normal and what is not but I didn't have a clue. I saw my banjo string and thought \"what the fuck!? Well I came this far.\"\n\nBut it didn't come off, no matter how much I tried. I tugged my pre pubescent microdong every chance I could get and was soon about to give up, the pain was unreal. However, I had already committed, I HAD to be normal.\n\nMy mom would put sharp objects in the highest drawers, one day before bathtime I climbed up on the desk and brought a pair of scissors to my room. I told my frenulum, \"that's it, finally, I win, fuck you\".\n\nThat day\n\nThere was alot of blood, I panicked but I didn't want to ask my parents for help, I wrapped my battle-scarred wiener in a shitton of toilet paper, went to sleep and spent the night in a fetal position, I thought I was going to die, and I would rather face that than telling my parents that I've been mutilating the defective dick that they gave me. After surviving this, I gave up.\n\nI've been calling my johnson \"James Franco\" ever since I saw the movie, I don't boast about it and I've never told any of this to anyone, its almost like a personal little inside joke between me and James. \n\nThis whole experience had been entirely repressed from my memories, I saw this post and it all came back. Vivid, bloody memories.",

            "Lots of bad advice here. He asked how you win a fight, not how you run away from a fight. That groin, nose, testicle thing is horrible advice that they don't even teach anymore. \n\nThe leg of your dominant hand 6 inches back, feet shoulder length apart, hands held with knuckles touching your cheeks and elbows in. That's your stance. Don't lift your feet, but pivot them 45 degrees when you throw a punch (same foot as the hand you're throwing, you want to feel the entire side of your body that's throwing pivot, this is where a majority of a punches' power comes from). After each punch return your knuckles to your cheek before throwing the next. While throwing a punch focus on keeping your wrist straight like your forarm is a  metal pole - don't do this your wrist is broken. Stay tight. Someone dives in for a takedown shoot your legs back and put your weight on them. Throw elbows any and all opportunities. \n\nEdit: Guess I'll continue adding because I left a lot out, there's lots to include. \n\nYou want to keep equal weight on both feet, don't put all your weight on one leg - if that's lifted you lose all balance. Have the foot of your dominant hand (which should be back) with your toes pointing to either 2 or 3 O'clock.  If someone aims for a body blow lower your forearm (which should be touching your body if your knuckles are properly placed) AND head as your knuckles never leave your cheeks. When you throw a punch you will really REALLY want to lean forward or backwards - no not do this. Biggest indicator that someone doesn't know what they're doing. If you do this you cannot move your feet at all or pivot properly thus losing all power. In terms of movement you should be doing a shuffle step - step with one foot and lightly drag the other. Feels weird, especially keeping your stance (dominant hands foot 6 inches back + shoulder length apart). When you step your feet will be slightly more than shoulder length, shouldnt be more than 3 inches. You go left move the left foot first. You go right move your right foot. NEVER cross your legs. Bigger people hit harder because they have an easier time putting mass into the hit, the same thing can be accomplished with pivoting your body appropriately. People get knocked out not by the force of the hit but the jaring in their brain, which is why you see videos of someone barely getting touched and getting knocked out. This is why upper cuts (5's and 6's) and hooks (3's and 4's) are so often responsible for knockouts - it's harder to see them. You see a hit coming and your body involuntary tenses up the proper neck muscles to prevent brain jarring, so hitting someone at novel angels is ideal. \n\nIf your dominant hand is right your right leg should be back. Your left leg is forward. In this position punches with your left hand are jabs (1), these are the only punches you should throw consecutively. Keep jabbing pretty much nonstop. Punches with the right hand are crosses (2), these you put extra power into. You jab to set up a powerfl cross. Left Hook (3), Right Hook (4), Left Uppercut (5), Right Uppecut (6). You always want to go: Even, Odd, Even, Odd, etc. As the knuckle touches your cheek after throwing a punch the other punch should already be leaving.",

But, one night my friends and I went to the gutted out house to smoke some marijuana out of a buddy's hookah. Buddy failed to inform us he had recently glued the bowl back together. Well, the crew lost composure. 2 people fell off the dock into the bayou, and everyone started panicking that they'd get hypothermia (not gonna happen during Louisiana summer). So people leave, I drive a group to our next spot.... my Pontiac Sunfire is now a spaceship. My buddy riding shotgun started cackling hysterically yelling about rattlesnakes in the road (we don't got those), and the 2 in the back were talking about magic or some shit. We couldn't make it to our destination due to freaking out, so went to hang out in a grocery store parking lot til we regained composure. 10/10 would not smoke glue again.",

He laughed and held it up to my lips and lit it for me as I drove. I ripped it hard and long and glanced down midway into this monster hit and it was a bic pen with a thimble melted onto the end of it and there was a fat white rock in it. What scared me the most was how fucking good it made me feel. I felt as if i was floating 20 feet above my car watching me drive my car, speeding down the highway.

I decided I wanted to get high but I was in a new city and didn\u2019t know anyone. I got on Craigslist and funny story I never found any heroin but I found a guy who sold meth. I have never tried meth and was never a huge fan of uppers but I decided well it\u2019s something and it will get me high so let\u2019s give it a shot. (Not literally a shot because I only smoke my drugs never inject them) well this guy got me some meth and let me use his pipe to smoke it I took one hit and immediately got the worst headache I have ever experienced. I only took that one hit and stopped the headache lasted through the night and the next day. I tried to tone it out but it didn\u2019t work it hurt bad. I went to a urgent care and they gave me some steroids or something like that some cream to rub on my forehead nothing worked. Que to 5 days of this headache I finally went to the ER I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and it was affecting my job. As soon as I explained what was going on minus the meth part (I told them later) they took me straight back and admitted me into a room and got me ready for a cat scan or mri whatever scans your brain. Well turns out I had a stroke (that\u2019s what the Dr called it) from smoking the meth a blood vessel in my brain burst and let out blood and the pressure from that was the cause of my headaches. Dr told me that it could have been a lot worse and I was extremely lucky. So after realizing how close it came to me dying from one hit of meth I have not touched it since and never will!

It's a bit more well known nowadays, but when I first was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (they told me it was Hypothyroidism at first), I didn't even know what the thyroid was. \n\nFor people who might not know, the thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland in your throat. Without getting into it too much, it releases hormones that regulate many things. You wouldn't expect this tiny little organ to be so important, but holy crap it is. \n\nI found out I had thyroid issues when I was 15 after I was constantly tired, had irregular periods (I've gone two months without a period before), my weight was out of wack, my mental health was constantly declining, and I had issues with breathing among other symptoms. \n\nApparently if I hadn't started taking thyroid medication when I did, I would've gone into a coma within 2 weeks. \n\nIt didn't help that I had a dad who constantly made fun of my weight and appearance even after finding out I had thyroid issues and learning how hard it was for me to loose weight. Turns out, his two sisters had Hypothyroidism and his brother had Hyperthyroidism. \n\nIt took quite a few years to finally find hormonal balance and I'm 20 now, but I'm doing a lot better than I was before, physically and mentally.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for telling me your stories and experiences, it's made me smile seeing that you guys are recovering/recovered. \nI'm not good with words and there's probably a lot I'm not expressing, but The test they do to check your thyroid/lymph nodes is painless and easy.

            "Nsfw answer, but sharing/using sex toys and other insertables. And not just in the sense of sterilization, but also improper stretching, lubing, and proper maintenance of your body and toys/ insertables.\n\nI work in an adult stores, I do my own research into the products we sell, and let me tell you, the horror stories of newbies just picking up a 8 inch dildo after seeing a porno and going \"Hey, if they can do it, so can I\" are too many to count. I have seen/heard/brought close friends of mine to the hospital and ER just to help them get their body patched up from improper use. I have seen the result of improper use of non-lubricating substances on peoples bodies. And I had a friend who died from a terrible rectum infection. \n\nLook, I know some if you are going to do these things anyways, and I have already made my point, but if you want to protect yourself, here are 5 things to ensure you all are safe from bad sexual practices:\n\n1) SOAP AND WATER: clean yourself and your toys before and after. Regular, unscented soap and warm water will be enough. There is also toy cleaner on the market which works just as well. \n\n2) START SMALL, LOTS OF LUBE: those professionals on the XXX tapes? They are \"Professionals\" for a reason! They work their way up to those sizes. So start small, and use more lube then you think you need.\n\n3) MORE LUBE: I aint kidding, the more the merrier. Also, I always recommend Water and Silicone based lubes. The following is NOT LUBE: Bengay, butter, tobasco/hotsauce, alcohol, plain water, spit, semen, juice, bleach, clean solutions, blood, and anything else that is not Water/Silicone based lube!\n\n4) IS IT USED, OR DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO HAD IT? DONT USE IT: STDs are still out there, and can be easily carried over on toys that infected individuals play with, even with soap and water. If you know the previous owner is clean, still proceed with caution. Also, ask for permission before you play with other peoples toys.\n\n5) PAIN IS NOT PLEASURE: Look, as much as the BDSM community will glare at me for this, if it hurts, pull out immediately. Pain is your body's way of saying \"STOP!\", so ignoring it is both stupid and life threatening. Only follow pain once you are certain that its the expected kind of pain, like spanking, soreness, and electro play. Actually, double check that last one, that may be a fault in your vibrator....",

            "**Hypothermia** - If your clothes get soaked and you can't dry out and warm up, temps in the 50's F (~13 C) can kill you.  This is how people going on day hikes get killed.  Something happens and they can't get back to their car/lodge.  The weather changes and they can't find shelter and they get wet.  They die of \"exposure\".  \n\nMy Scoutmaster taught us boys the hard way by teaching us the importance of planning.  He made us traverse a stream, and while our packs didn't get wet because we were carrying them above our heads, we did get soaked up to about our chest in cool water.  The temperature was around 55 F that day, which is not *that* cold and kinda nice.  After we got to the other side, you would not believe how quickly we got cold, especially if there is no cover from the wind, and within a few minutes, our hands became useless and we couldn't start a fire. The shivering got so bad, it was incapacitating.  The cold set in fast.  We learned that day that we needed to make sure our clothes remain dry, even if that means stripping down butt naked to cross the stream, and that we needed to have fire already made and a smoldering ember ready to go along with tinder so that we could get a fire going quickly (that is if we didn't have matches or a fire steel). So he taught us that we should cross the stream, put our dry clothes back on, start a fire to warm up and dry out, and immediately start working on shelter.  Hard lessons don't leave you, even after 30 years.\n\nEdit:  For clarity",

            "Rescuing a drowning person. Drowning people are completing panicked, with one goal which is to get to air immediately, and they will climb ontop of people in their blind panic and fear with little to no thought as long as they can keep their head above water. There have been stories of young children drowning their older siblings and parents as the kid climb on top of their parents heads and submerge them under water. \n\nRescuing a drowning person is no joke and if you yourself a poor swimmer and/or not trained in in-water rescue, do not attempt rescue! Your safety is top priority. Instead immediately call emergency services and try to either extend something out for the person to grab onto (like a pool noodle, pool net pole, branch etc) or throw something that floats at the person for them to grab onto (a life jacket/PFD is the best, but pool noodle, kickboard, floatie, opeven cooler/esky lids work). \n\nIf you are trained in in-water rescue, then youn should already know that if you don't need to get into the water, the don't. Remember Call, Reach, Extend, Throw, Row, Swim, in that order. And always always assess the conditions of the water before going in if you do: if the water is too murky, the current is too strong, there is too many in water hazards like logs or rocks...again, don't attempt rescue. It sounds horrific to think about, but always thinm of numero uno and rescue teams would much rather only rescue one person than two people. If you do decide to jump into attempt rescue, then you should always tske something that floats with you so you can hand it off to the drownee before they grab onto you.\n\nEDIT To Add: I have already put this in another comment, butnseeing as some people may nave skipped because they are commenting about how to punch someone in the face to kmock them out...no, no no!\n\nHitting someone until they are knocked out may once have been a legitmate technique taught to those trainkng to be lifeguards. It is no longer taught, has not been for years now, and is actively discouraged. If there is anyone out there that thinks they can attempt in water rescue here is what you do (copied and pasted from my other comments)\n\n>This storybactually raises a good poimt: how do you approach a drowning person?\n\n>I have heard from too many people: \u00b0Oh, I have been told to knock them out! Like slap them or hit them!\" While your husband did what he had to do to rescue his friend, this idea thatbyou need to knock a drowning person out is incredibly outdated, not to mention highly unsafe not just for the drowning person but yourself as well.\n\n> First off, if you are close enough to hit a drowning person, you're close enough to be grabbed by them. Remember a drowning person will latch onto anything that even appears to be floating to keep their head above water, that includes a person trying to rescue them. Remember a drowning person is not thinking clearly, they are panicked and struggling for air. They will grab you and potentially pull you under to achieve a fresh gulp of air.\n\n>As mentioned in my OP if you are going to save someone from drowning you should ideally bring something that floats with you, but really it could be anything that the drownee can hold onto (maybe don't bring a heavyblead anchor or dumbell with you though). I got taught even a t shirt or shoe can sometime suffice, anything to create a barrier between you and the drownee. As you approach the drownee, position your body so you are sorta upright, with one hand holding the floating up extended towards the drownee, shouting out \"Grab the float! I can help,,grab the float!\". Hopefully the drownee does grab the float, but if they so happen to go to grab you or your arm instead immediately go onto your back, feet towards the drownee and kick HARD away. You may have to reapeat this process a number of times, even when the drownee tires themself out.\n\n>What happens if the victim does grab you and starts to pull you under? Suck, Tuck, and Exhale down. Bring them down under water with you. Sound like the opposite of what you should do? Remember the drowning person's goal: to get air. They can't do that underwater so if you are taking them with you they're going to let of you. Kick away again.\n\n>Ideally if you can try to get behind them. They can't grab you from behind. In one forceful motion tuck your arms under their shoulders/armpits, raise your hips up and lock your knees around their hips.",

            "I worked for a summer camp one year that was run by a stereotypically hippie-dippie organization. Now, I personally support this organization but they had some ridiculous idea about how to discipline children. In that they didn't believe in discipline at all.\n\nNo time outs. No raising your voice (even just to be heard). No rewards to be earned or positive reinforcement. No loss of privileges. No warnings. No speaking to the parents about behavioral issues. Nothing.\n\nNow, most of the kids were coming to this camp because their parents didn't have the means to send them to more expensive camps and quite a lot of them had behavioral issues to start with. But none of the kids were monsters, in fact, they were all pretty great. They mostly just needed some understanding and solid boundaries.\n\nUnfortunately, with no discipline, comes no boundaries, or at least no way to enforce boundaries. So the kids tended to run amok and there wasn't a whole lot we as counselors could do.\n\nSo I surreptitiously gave a few time outs to some of the more wild kids and, guess what, their behavior immediately improved and I never had trouble with them again. In fact, they had a better time because they weren't constantly getting into fights with their friends. \n\nBut, I guess the higher ups found out about it somehow and sat me down to talk about how \"you just need to talk to them, find out why they are behaving badly and make them understand the correct way to behave\".\n\nI knew why they were behaving badly - they were kids in a place away from their parent with no rules and no discipline - they were seeing what they could get away with.\n\nIn the end, I basically ignored the higher-ups. I wasn't getting paid enough to deal with kids all day without having any way of keeping a bit of control. Regardless, the only problem kids had already had their time outs and, like I said, they were fine once they knew where the line was. Besides, I wasn't worried about my job... they don't believe in discipline.",

            "I was a manager for a well known lingerie store. Our location was in a failing suburban mall. The store was giant and shaped oddly. There were dressing rooms in odd hidden corners and a few blind spots. The store was located at the end of the mall next to other stores no one really went to, so there wasn\u2019t much foot traffic. We were also always short staffed because no one wanted to work out there. All of those factors made us a prime location for thieves and weirdos. \n\nI would have to do laps around the store due to its layout, and I would regularly come across people doing sex stuff in this one secluded little dressing room. The dressing room was in a sort of alcove and was the least visible spot in the store, so it was prime real estate for all kinds of shenanigans. It ranged from women doing strip teases for men, to catching couples having oral sex, to catching couples having penetrative sex, to catching men masturbating. The final straw was catching a man at closing time, masturbating into a pile of cotton panties with the dressing room door wide open. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I put in my notice the next day. \n\nAnd what was crazy was that corporate always shrugged or laughed it off when I would call and complain that we needed a security guard. I was 21 at the time, and every woman that worked their was between 19-30; it was a safety issue, and they\u2019d also blame us for all the merchandise theft, which we were unable to prevent because their weren\u2019t enough bodies in that gigantic store to prevent it. \n\nI was also dating a guy who also worked in the mall, and he told me that they finally closed up that one dressing room not long after I left. He said a lot of folks were pissed because apparently that one little dressing room was a well-known open secret spot for hooking up.",

            "I worked as a car detailer (like cleaning and waxing cars) when i was 16, my dad owned the business for years so I grew up doing it and was pretty skilled for a 16 year old, my dad sold the business to a family friend, part of the conditions were thst I'd keep working there and show him what to do bit the guy was an idiot.\n\nHe put me on the hand car wash because I was \"too young to be waxing expensive cars, customers dont like it\" when the actual reason was the hand car wash was the shit part of the job and he wanted the fun part, he then fucked up a jaguar's paint work by buffing it WITHOUT A PAD on the buffer, just scraped  the fuck out of a fucking jaguar. I let him blame me because I felt bad that he was the owner of the business and made himself look a tit. Then I realised the reason was that he was stoned out of his fucking mind everyday (look I smoke weed too, no judgement but dont do it at work..) he started leaving me alone for hours on end while he went to smoke weed, I would earn all his money and wasnt even getting minimum wage. \n\nCome one day in the winter he turned up and opened the garage with a spliff in his mouth, immediately left and didn't come back for about 6 hours, it was freezing, there was ice everywhere and I was alone shaking trying to wash cars with water which was freezing on the surface of the cars as I was going, I was running around like a madman trying to stay warm and because we were busy as, I slipped hard on some black ice, went upside down lol and landed on my head, completely blacked out for a minute or so and woke up to a few customers around me like wtf, where's your boss, I looked about 12 aswell so they were genuinely concerned, I got up and just left. Left the garage open, left everything there to be taken if someone wanted to, he rang me an hour later going mental and I was just like fuck you, you left me for 7 hours to get stoned, shove the job up your arse you prick. \n\nFirst of 3 times I've up and left a job without warning because of arsehole owners, remember if you aren't making money for yourself, you're making it for someone else. You should be more important to the employer than they are to you and that's how it should feel when you're working for someone.",
            "Working $10 an hour in Disney world on an attraction. There\u2019s one position called merge, where your job is to stop the stand by line and send the Fastpass line. Fastpass is normally based on reservation, but if another ride breaks down in the park, they\u2019ll give out fastpasses that can be used pretty much anywhere.\n\nOne day almost every ride in the park was broken except ours, which meant EVERYONE was coming to our Fastpass line. I was sending 150-200 people through Fastpass for every 10 I was sending through standby, for roughly an hour, and I didn\u2019t even come close to clearing the line.\n\nThe people in the standby line were screaming at me, starting chants, taking pictures of me (and my nametag), and just generally being awful. My favorite was one guy repeatedly screaming \u201cI KNOW THIS ISNT YOUR FAULT MAN BUT THIS IS BULLSH*T\u201d, in front of his six kids.\n\nI just calmly stood there and just kept saying to everyone \u201csorry folks, but I really don\u2019t have any control over this\u201d\n\nI got off easy though.

            "I guess I can go literal with this one: I work in an office environment and my boss at the time was having some stomach issues, I didn't know about it at the time but it was a pretty regular occurrence for her(the stomach issues, not what ensued). So she was on a call in her office and was trying to finish the call when evidently DEFCON 5 hit and she ended the call and I just see her running from her office in the \"I'm about to shit my pants\" walk, going as fast as she can out the door and down the hallway to where the nearest restrooms were. I don't think much of it until another co-worker comes back from the break room and asks me to go down the hall and look on the ground and tell me if what she thinks she saw on the floor was indeed what she thought it was. So I do, and I see a trail of a few random little pieces of poo all the way down and it was definitely poo. \n\nI don't know what to think but my initial thought was that someone stepped in dogshit and tracked it through the office. We also had clients on site to tour our office that day so I grab some paper towels and a trash bin and go start cleaning it up piece by piece. Then when I cleaned it all up from the hallway I get back into my office area and notice there's also a piece of it over by our copier machine so I'm thinking it had to be someone in my direct department who tracked the dogshit so I tell everyone to check their shoes because someone tracked in dogshit. My boss still hasn't come back from the restroom yet at this point. \n\nThen, one of my other co-workers comes over to me and tells me quietly to stop making a big deal about the dogshit and I'm perplexed. Then she proceeds to tell me that our boss called her from the restroom telling her she shit her pants(she was wearing a dress but still) and that she needed her to help her figure out how to get a change of clothes or something and sneak her out of the office so nobody noticed. So I went and pulled her car around to the side of the building and she helped her sneak out and just told everyone she wasn't feeling well and left for the day. To save her the embarrassment, I never told her I picked her shit up, I just told her we got it handled. \n\nTL;DR: I unknowingly cleaned up my boss' shit and helped her sneak out of the building so nobody knew she shit herself",

Once when I was walking through the roof area, one individual came from the opposite side and put his pistol on my head. He wanted to get into a bank and wanted me to provide access. The worst thing was me being trapped in the blind spot of the CCTV. My mind and heart both almost stopped working since it was my first time having a gun on my head. \n\nI slowly started walking towards the entrance and when I entered the key inside the lock, we heard the sirens for police vehicles. They panicked and ran away in the dark. I quickly called my Control Officer (guy on CCTV) and told him the whole scenario.

            "I had a really hard time finding my first job out of university. My friend ended up getting me a gig with a promo company to help me with bills. The job sounded simple enough - I was to hand out coffee samples for a certain brand while being stationed at varying grocery stores across the state. Later in the job description I was informed that I would also have to bring the sampling booth with me.\n\nI thought it would just be a small, plastic cart, but nope - it was a huge full-on wooden coffee service station. Not to mention that I also had to bring in the coffee machine, sugar, milk, water and even garbage can. The first time I did it, I struggled to put it all into a shopping cart, and only barely succeeded by using two. The next few times weren't all that much easier, but I did get better at doing it.\n\nI think it was the sixth, or maybe seventh time. It had already been a horrible day - customers had hated the coffee (what do you expect from a shitty machine?), the store manager had been rude and unaccommodating, and my back was starting to hurt real bad. One guy even made a point that he hated the coffee so much that he poured the cup into my garbage can, waterfall-style, before flicking the empty cup towards me. It killed me so bad, but I needed the money, so I forged ahead and finished the day off.\n\nI loaded up my grocery carts again and pushed out of the sliding doors only to met with complete darkness and pouring rain. It had also been a busy day at this particular store, so my car was parked all the way at the end of the parking lot. I was pissed but was just like \"fuck it, let's get this done\" at this point so I started pushing. 3/4 of the way to my car, the front wheel of one of the carts gave out. I lost my balance and my supplies came flying out, coffee machine, sugar packets and all. It was almost comical. \n\nI knelt in the downpour, picking up my stuff, only to find that the coffee pot heavily cracked. That was enough to push me over the edge. I crumpled into a heap on the ground and quietly cried.\n\nWhen I had finally regained my composure, I grabbed the rest of the supplies and haphazardly threw them into my car. Drenched and sitting in the driver's seat, I called my manager and told her I quit, and that she could pick up the supplies whenever. \n\nThat job 100% did not pay enough for that shit.",

He wanted the first half of the story to be able the little car stretching out his peehole as it went in, and the second half to be about how the tiny little wingmirrors damaged his urethra as it came out.\n\nIt's not that I couldn't have done it (and the money he was offering was pretty good, at least at the time), but writing a story takes me a couple of hours, and I did *not* want to spend that time thinking about someone's junk getting ripped to shreds. I politely recommended him to another user who I hope could have given him what he wanted, and I sincerely hope I never stumble across that story on the internet.\n\n**EDIT:** It was pointed out to me one of the other times I've told this story that the vast, vast majority of Hot Wheels cars don't actually have wingmirrors.

We weren't allowed to leave bags around the bottom of the dumpster on the ground, because the trash guys would just run over it and get shit everywhere and we'd get in trouble. The bags were also quite possibly the thinnest garbage bags ever made, so half the time you'd try to hurl a giant garbage bag full of spaghetti and alfredo sauce and god knows what up to the top of the dumpster and it would break and get sauce and shit all OVER you.\n\nI did NOT get paid enough to deal with that.",

My first job was at a small firm where the boss was banging the secretaries and paralegal when he was helping his church for free. After about a year, he asked me why I wasn't playing golf at the country club to bring in clients. I was earning $33,000/year; the country clue dues were more than that. My next job was at a firm where I walked in on the owner beating his meat. I told the HR lady who denied that I saw it and then caused all sorts of trouble for me; when she got called on it, she blamed the metal plate in her head. I was earning $31,500/year. My next job was in legal aid where we either had paper, a working printer, a working fax machine, envelopes or stamps but never all at the same time, usually 2/5. I was earning $32,000/year.

This unconscious man was snoring heartily. His chin resting on a vomit soaked shirt which stretched down to a clothing void between shirt tails and shoes. I unlocked the door and shook him awake to tell him that he needs to leave pretty sharpish and muttering slurred apologies he complied. Trousers back on he was escorted off the premises and told it would be best to leave it a while before returning. \n\nI have to inspect the carnage in the bathroom to make sure it's flushable. It wasn't. On closer inspection this guy had dropped his glass into the well of the toilet when he had passed out. It filled the hole pretty nicely stopping it up like a cork. After consciousness had left him so did the contents of his bowel and he had filled the glass like a Mr Whippy ice cream maker with a broken lever. \n\nThe scene was brutal and the kind of thing you can only state at knowing you're going to have to get rubber gauntlets and get in there because you cannot leave that for the opening manager, or cleaner, or any living human being to find unprepared.

            "Not me, but it's a great story about some coworkers that had enough of the shitty owner of the restaurant we worked at and quit on the spot.\n\nIt was a Japanese restaurant that had a really high turnaround rate, like they literally had a help wanted sign taped to the entrance at all times because people quit all the time. The main reason why was because one of the owners was a huge bitch who loved to yell at people. I saw so many people come and go, most usually lasted only a few days. There was a sushi chef there that had been there for a while, longer than I had been there. He was pretty cool and we got along great when we worked together. His girlfriend also worked there as a cashier and a lot of times they were scheduled together.\n\nOne Saturday that I was supposed to be off, I get a call from Carol (the bitch boss) asking me if I could come in. Apparently Max and his girlfriend had both just straight up quit and walked out of the restaurant. The place was pretty small so usually it was just the cooks in the back, the sushi chef, and the cashier/delivery driver. So, when they left, they basically left the place empty aside from the cooks, who did not speak English that well.\n\nI decided to take the shift for the extra money and when I got there Carol was already there behind the sushi prep area making orders. She usually didn't come in at all on weekends, but would still watch the security cameras occasionally from her laptop at home and if she saw you standing around doing nothing, she would call and yell at you. \n\nIt turns out that was exactly what she did to Max and his girlfriend. She kept calling them a bunch of times and yelling at them about petty shit and they had finally had enough. Carol showed me the security footage of Max yelling at her over the phone, hanging up, then taking off his apron and both him and his girlfriend flipping of the security camera and walking out.\n\nShe was showing me because she couldn't believe how disrespectful they were and how they could just leave the restaurant like that when there were customers in it. Even though she was trying to play the victim, I knew damn well what she was like and she just pushed them too far. Hell, I would have loved to do the same thing various times, but I desperately needed the job at the time.\n\nLast I heard of them was that they both got jobs at the sushi place that was competing with the restaurant they walked out on.",

So signal sent at 00:05.\n\nThe Titanic then sunk at 2.20 and the RMS Carpathia was a massive ship that arrived first on the scene at 4:00 (1 hour 40 after the Titanic sunk) and saved 712 people that were on lifeboats but obviously many died in the sea.\n\nSo what I would do is send a distress signal to RMS Carpathia. Except I would send the distress signal at 2030 (i.e. before the titanic hit the iceberg), then let the titanic hit the iceberg, and then RMS Carpathia would arrive at roughly 0030, which give or take is when the Titanic definitely knew she was sinking (and sent its original timeline distress signal), so the Titanic would definitely load it's passengers on RMS Carpathia, giving them just under 2 hours to do so before the Titanic sunk.\n\nSo yeah, everyone saved but major safety changes would have been made to ships going forward.\n\nAnd just for fun I'd scrawl 'paint me like one of your french girls', so when future subs go down and film the titanic people will be like wtf does that mean, but time travellers would understand the reference :D\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the awards guys :-)",

Still, she seemed game...\n\nThen, as we just began to start (a few kisses, hand under the shirt)... she started crying. \n\nNow, here's a little hint to all you guys out there:  if she starts to cry, she's not happy. \n\nSo, naturally, I put the brakes on and say, \"hey, what's going on?\"   \n\nAnd she's not into it.  \n\nYes, she's lonely... desperately lonely.  But I'm a *friend*, not a potential lover.  \n\nShe likes me.  But she's not into me that way. \n\n...but, here's the thing:  she's still game to go through with it...because I drove five hours, after all.\n\nNo chance.  She's not into it, then *I'm* not into it. \n\nWe hugged, went out for dinner, had a great time. \n\nI slept on her couch for the next few days of the visit.  \n\n(curiously, that same visit, she hooked me up with a friend of hers... who I dated happily for six months until the 5-hour commute wore it down.) \n\nTLDR:   she started crying.   Guys, when she's crying, it's time to call it.",

            "As long as the texture was close to that of actual meat, sure. I don't eat meat because I want to consume the flesh of formerly living animals. I do it because I much prefer meat to the non-meat options for getting the same nutrients and what not. If the lab-grown meat gets as cheap (and tasty) as the critter-grown meat, I see no reason not to eat it instead. Plus, it's probably less harmful to the environment than livestock farming (at a guess - I haven't really looked into its environmental impact yet).",
            "Yeah, I already have!  I like meat, but sustainability and climate change matter to me so I've cut back a lot.  I only eat the real stuff when I'm at restaurants or in my favorite special occasion foods.\n \nThere are some really good meat substitutes on the market right now.  Even if you're a diehard meat lover, you should try them out just for the novelty factor.  You might be surprised!\n\n**Impossible Burger:** Currently only available in restaurants, but it's by far the best fake beef.  The company somehow figured out how to produce hemoglobin from soy, so these burgers have a realistic \"bloody\" taste and red center.  It's not an absolutely perfect replica of beef - the texture is a little crumblier, and it's not as juicy - but in a burger with toppings you might not even notice.\n\n**Beyond Burger:** Currently available in most grocery stores at a bit under twice the price of real beef hamburger patties.  The taste isn't quite as good as the Impossible Burger, and they develop an oddly crispy exterior when cooked, but they aren't bad.  Actually, I rather liked the crispy little burnt bits.  They smell absolutely disgusting (like cat food) when \"raw,\" but once you grill them the stink goes away.  I'd recommend grilling them outside, though... the raw smell is very off-putting.\n\n**Gardein:** Their fried chicken strips (available in several flavors) are a little oily, but they have the taste and texture of a real chicken nugget.  Even my cats are fooled by these things.... after all, real chicken nuggets are so processed that they barely count as meat anyway.  The teriyaki chicken strips aren't as good as the fried stuff, so give those a pass.  The fake fish and crab balls are less convincingly \"fishy,\" but they aren't awful.\n\n**Beyond Meat Chicken Strips:**  The texture of these chicken strips is surprisingly close to real grilled chicken strips.  The taste isn't quite there yet but if you put them in a fajita you might not even notice.\n\n**No Evil Foods:**  Pricey, but their chicken and shredded pork BBQ are surprisingly realistic.  The chorizo is spongy and weird, so pass on that one.  Their Italian sausage is well spiced (a lot of vegan hot dogs/sausages taste like a damp sponge), but it tastes better sliced in a pasta dish than straight up on a hot dog roll.",
            "Sure, because they're cheaper and tasted good - I'm going to assume that they're made of something natural as well, because I lived through \"margarine\", and that was not healthy in addition to tasting like greasy shit.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the other day I ate a thing called \"I can't believe it's not General Tao\".  I could believe it was not General Tao, though I had a hard time believing it wasn't chunks of tofu.  We're a long way from meeting your \"tasted good\" condition, is what I'm saying.",

            "There was this really bad accident one town over where this dude from out of town ran past a stop sign and slammed into a van full of 3 or 4 children, the mother and the father. Some weren\u2019t wearing seatbelts. The father and son in the van survived with some injuries. The mother had a brain injury. Three children died (one was unborn). \n\nThe father recorded video after video about the event that happened. He documented every painful thing that happened to help him cope with what happened. He shared it all to Facebook to reach out to the community for help. This is all fine, but this man\u2019s wife had just lost two babies, and her unborn baby. She was in a coma unlikely to wake up. \n\nIn a turn of events, the wife woke up and began to rally. This is where I became grossed out. Shortly after she woke from her coma, the husband pulls out his phone and records himself telling his wife that they lost three of their children. He puts the phone in her face rather than console her. Then, he posted it online for the hundreds and hundreds of people following the event on Facebook. This woman just got out of a coma, and just received the worst news of her life, and this man put it online for the world to see. Absolutely disgusting. The wife died later on too. Terrible situation. I can\u2019t claim to know what I would do if it were me, but it was awful to see.",
            "One time I actually went verbally abusive towards my neighbour for this. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is an epileptic. His seizures can be live threatening as they sometimes stop his heart. One evening last year he had one of those and I had to perform CPR. I obviously simultaneously called an ambulance and they came shortly after, leaving the lights on because they had to park in the middle of the street.\n\nNow after a seizure, my fianc\u00e9 is very disoriented. He doesn't know where he is, who he is, who anyone else is, it sometimes differs, but it's always bad. On this particular day, he remembered me and took to me for help in his confusion. He couldn't fell his legs, he didn't know what was happening, he didn't realize he only hat his underpants on (we had gone to sleep about an hour before and it was a very hot day). He was bleeding from his mouth because he had bitten a tiny bit of his tongue off and his chest was red from me hitting it during CPR. He looked awful. \n\nWhen the paramedics and I helped him outside to bring him to the ambulance, he wasn't able to put any clothes on due to his disorientation and would shrug any blanket off because it was too hot.\n\nThe neighbour, alerted by the siren and lights of the ambulance, was standing outside his house, beer in hand, filming us. I helped put my fianc\u00e9 into the ambulance and went to grab a bag of stuff for the hospital. My fianc\u00e9 cried out for me like a lost child since I was the only person he recognised. It was heartbreaking. And my asshole of a neighbour filmed it all while laughing his drunken ass off. I went over, yelled at him in very explicit language and demanded he delete the video. He just laughed at me. \n\nWell, joke was on him. I called the cops and they took the phone. He got to pay a fine for filming a person without permission (illegal in Germany) and has now orders to stay away from us. \n\nI still wonder what he thought while doing this. Or if he thought sth at all.",

But deep enough to drown if you are sitting down in a car.\n\nThe first guy who pulls over leaps out and into the water and start trying to force his way into the car to pull them out. In a few moments later other people pull over. Everyone pulls out their phones. Not to call the emergency services, no no. They start filming. The guy in the water screams at the other to help, to call the emergency services, to get in the water and get the people in the car out.\n\nEventually the emergency services get there. One of the two in the car is dead, the other in a coma from hypothermia and and oxygen deprivation. They awake some days later to learn their spouse drowned.\n\n\nI don't actually have an answer to your question, but this was what it made me think of, and i just can't figure out why the fuck people would be like this, and how the hell they live with themselves.\n\nEDIT; so a few people have made some '*nice*' comments like:\n\n> So you watched it and am telling us now\n\nNo. I read about it shortly after.

Instead he just told them they were in the middle of the road and to have a nice day. The guy kept going but we kept telling them to have a nice day and waited for them to leave.

            "New Years Eve, the year 2000. I was working security for this event. Firework show was over at the local park, everyone was leaving, and I heard a terrible scream behind me. A teenaged girl had fallen out of the tree she'd been in to watch the fireworks, onto the park bench below, and busted out her front teeth.\n\nShe was squealing and howling, and I got her to open her mouth so I could assess the damage. It was not good; teeth were broken off just below the gum line. Her jaw didn't seem to be broken though, so there was that, and there wasn't a lot of bleeding. I held her hand and told her that it was going to be alright, that the damage was fixable; that I'd had my own front teeth busted out, and they'd fixed it just fine, gave her my winning smile (you really can't see the damage). I'd just gotten her down from screaming to crying when her mother showed up. I stood up to get out of the way, and found there was this fucker (looked like a college student, accompanied by some girl of the same age) standing there not 10 feet away with a videocamera and a smile, filming this with great intensity, like it was the most exciting shit he'd ever seen.\n\nI stood up to face him. \"WTF is wrong with you?\"\n\n<The camera turned to me now, his smile got even bigger. Oh boy this video was just going to get better and better.>\n\n\"This girl is having the worst moment of her life, and you're what? Gunna film it so you can enjoy it in the privacy of your own home?\"\n\nAt this point I saw the change on the face of the girl he was with as it dawned on her that she was with a creep. She gave him this look of cautious disgust/concern and said \"Jake. Stop. We need to go.\"\n\nHe kept filming. He was just totally transfixed by it all. She looked at him for about 4 long seconds. \"I'm leaving. NOW.\" she announced, and walked away. He decided to reluctantly follow her, but walking backward, filming me standing there looking at him until they'd disappeared into the crowd.\n\nI've sometimes wondered, when he viewed that footage later if it was really as awesome as he imagined it would be at the time. I think probably not.",
            "A woman posted a few weeks ago somewhere that she was trying to return something to a baby supply store and they kept just offering her store credit. She tried explaining she had a miscarriage and couldn't use it, and they kept insisting she get store credit, which just added so much injury to insult. She got to the point where she was just sobbing and begging for a refund because she didn't have any money for a hotel in the city she was staying to get the procedure to remove the fetus, and she was desperate.\n\nSome asshole, of course, whipped out his phone and started recording her without any idea why she was upset, and calling her \"Karen\". She, understandably, went off on him.\n\nI can't even imagine how heartbroken and distressed she was, and someone took advantage of it for social media attention. These days, it's just assumed that someone who is upset is being a terrible person for whatever reason.

Internet vigilantes who doxx the people in the video to actively ruin their lives, people who upload the doctored video because they know that will happen. Especially when social media like Facebook and Reddit are notorious for reposts of things that could've happened years ago. I understand wanting to take out racists and cruel/bad people, they absolutely should be held accountable and punished for their actions.

So I did, I had to do multiple trips to several different stores, but it ended up being like $1300 bucks, which was *insane* money for me at the time.

            "My parents bought me a laptop for my 18th birthday. It was absolutely unheard of in my family to recieve gifts as expensive or technological. I cried when my Mom handed me it. I was meant to be moving away for university and both my mom and dad had saved up 6 months wage between them to afford it for me. We all hugged and cried and it was extremely meaningful and emotional. I went off to university.\n\nI was in the dorms one night when my dorm mate, who was a rich white boy from long island, brings back like 2 drunk girls and another friend. They start drinking and rolling up weed in the dorm, which I was fine with, it was university etc. I go to the bathroom down the hall, and when I get back, one of the drunk girls has opened my laptop and is trying to log in.\n\nI approach her and I'm like \"hey that's my laptop, not (roommates). I don't mind you using it I guess but let me just log you in to the guest account\" - she goes to move the laptop off her lap toward me, and knocks an open bottle of wine on to it, the entire laptop being flooded with wine.\n\nshe goes \"oh! sorry!\" and i'm like what the fuck dude get a fucking towel! put it upside down! I'm FREAKING the fuck out!!!!! I can't believe it's happening. My roommate starts telling me to chill the fuck out and asks \"can't you just get a new one dude?\"\n\nI start patting down the laptop and I ask them, please, if it doesn't work, can you help me replace it? I need it for my classes etc. They start laughing at me! Saying \"why can't your parents get a new one for you?\".\n\nIt took 2 weeks of demanding them to buy me a new one before they reluctantly did as I had to explain to the dorm manager my situation of my family being extremely poor and it being unbelivable that they were even able to get me into university let alone a new laptop. Luckily he was sympathetic as fuck and helped me arrange for a replacement.\n\nBut man, that moment of  \"can't you just get a new one?\" made my fucking heart blow up. It was more painful than the laptop getting damaged itself. I looked at him and wanted to fucking kill him. I'd never experienced rich kid syndrome as succinctly before or since.

            "My friend is a Commercial Pilot and works for a large company that has a \"flight department\" consisting of several jets and turboprop airplanes. The owner's kids, and a group of their friends, were granted permission to take one of the jets from the central part of the US to the Bahamas. Upon arriving in the Bahamas they were meeting other friends and getting on a very, very large yacht for a week. They realized the yacht was equipped with fine dinning food, not the type of food they liked. (junk food) They ordered the Pilots to fly back through US Customs and to their hometown in the Midwest. Once there they had to pick up multiple sides of BBQ ribs, burgers, hotdogs, soda, beer and piles of other junk food and fly back to the Bahamas -- and do so within a time-frame that still allowed them to leave with the yacht on time. It costs roughly $5,000 an hour to operate the jet they were using. And it never even struck the owners as something extreme.\n\nEdit: Due to the popularity of this post, I called and got clarification on several points that have been repeatedly questioned. \n\n-The BBQ (ribs, pulled pork & sauce) was the main purpose for the return trip to the Midwest. If you\u2019re from the Midwest, or a southern \u201cBBQ city\u201d, you know what I\u2019m talking about. They don\u2019t have this in FL, period. The other junk food was add on requests from other guests. \n\n-The plane owner\u2019s son had promised, in the months prior, to bring some of the BBQ he had told his other friends (who he was meeting in the Bahamas) about repeatedly throughout college. He forgot, and was catching hell for it. In an act of boldness he sent the plane back for it. \n\n-This is the most extreme example of how theses planes are used, and wealth flaunted, within this company. That\u2019s with the understanding that wife shopping trips, sending a plane back to pick up a kid after school to come to FL, ballgames, hunting & fishing trips and to dine in a restaurant 3,000 miles away, is commonplace.\n\n-On occasion these planes and Pilots have been used as \u201cAngel Flights\u201d transport ill children and family throughout the country for medical procedures. \n\n-The pilots for this company aren\u2019t paid the best, but are permitted to bring family (spouses mostly) to destinations as space and work schedule dictates. Some senior pilots can stay at company owned property nationwide if available. ",

So to give your eyes a break, I'm going to share one story of a \"good\" rich kid, although it may not be welcome, which is understandable. (This person does not have rich kid syndrome, it's just a rich kid story).\n\nSo generally rich kids don't mind spending their parent's money.\n\nWhen I first met this guy I know, I assumed he was poor, like me, or at most average. He wore the same shirt/pants most days of the week pretty much, he didn't drive an overly expensive car (Honda Fit), etc. \n\nEventually we started going on dates and we went to pizza houses, Chinese restaurants, etc. Very cheap, super low-key.\n\nThere was NO sign of him being loaded at ALL.\n\nHe's an international student, and one day after we got to know each other better and were already dating for awhile, he started talking about how he is not allowed to work in this country. He looked like he was hinting at something, and then asked me if I knew how he was going to school here. Since I had not been close to an international student before, I just assumed that they used their savings, worked their way through it, or took out a loan (wow I feel poor now...).\n\nThen I think about it more. He has an apartment to himself. Goes to school full time (an EXPENSIVE one at that!). Bought a brand new car when he came here a couple years back. Wtf? How is he affording all of this?\n\nThen he dropped the ball that he was rich and his father pays for everything. I kinda just said \"okay...\" and forgot about it, because I actually kinda didn't believe him, but he thought I did. We never talked about the matter again.\n\nFast forward a couple of months, he says he needs help with something on his bank statement and asks me if I could help him. Of course I agreed and he showed me his bank statement. Y'all. When I saw the numbers I literally almost fell over. I asked him, \"where did you get all of this money??\" And he said \"I told you, from my Dad!\" Then very lightly and nonchalantly tells me later on that his father is on the top 200 richest person's list in his entire country with a population of about 51 MILLION people. To say I was shook was an understatement, but looking at him you would NEVER know. Some days he actually slightly resembles a homeless person (sorry babe, if you're reading this. It's only the days when you don't shower. \ud83d\ude05)\n\nThat being said:\n\nHe never buys anything and I mean ANYTHING he does not need. He buys food, gas, and pays for rent and electricity. That's IT. I have to force him to buy new clothes if I think he needs them, and I have to let him know that sometimes spending money is necessary for fun. He always shops from outlet stores and would never pay more than $15 for jeans, and he has explicitly said that any shirt over $10 is not a shirt he would like to own. He let his hair grow HALFWAY DOWN HIS BACK because he did not want to spend $30 to get it cut (he was actually growing it out to donate it, but he never realized he would have to spend money to have someone cut it). I ended up buying some supplies to cut it for him at home.\n\nI just think it's a little crazy that he (technically his dad) is that loaded but he doesn't buy ANYTHING. His Dad would let him, for sure, and has expressed that, but he doesn't want to. To put things in perspective I have $2 and will spend every penny of it on whatever makes me happy at the time, and this man's dad casually sent him $100,000 the other day just for his basic life expenses for the year, and my dude doesn't spend an unnecessary penny.\n\nHe's admirable, he really is. He is the most down to earth person I have EVER met, and he happens to be the most loaded person I will most likely ever meet. I sometimes think he is a little too frugal, but we keep our accounts separate so it doesn't bother me. Also he views his money he uses as his Dad's money, not money that he has earned the right to use. I hope if I ever have children that I can teach them to be this responsible and respectful \ud83d\ude0a\n\nP.s.

            "Super late to the post so I doubt anyone will see this but...\n\nI had a partner. We\u2019d been together for decades and we\u2019d lived a genuinely fulfilling life. Kids, a home, friends. It was vaguely fantastical and we\u2019d been part of the whole saving the world trope in some meaningful way. Not the main characters but we\u2019d helped. \n\nAnd then I discovered something horrible. No idea what it was but it sent us all back in time to when we\u2019d only first met. Back when the world was still \u2018under threat\u2019. In my anger at whatever it was I denounced them publicly to a good friend of ours who was someone important. A captain of the guard or the local director or something along those lines. \n\nThey denied it, my partner, but there were recordings of our lives from before time had gone back, things that had been saved somehow and eventually they admitted to whatever it was I accused them off. But at that very moment I was hit by an absolutely overwhelming wave of terror, that I was making a mistake.\n\nEven now, years after the dream, I remember screaming in fear and rushing to their side, even if every other detail has faded away. As I held them I remember all the memories running through my head. But I don\u2019t remember what any of them are and this is the bit that has made me so desperate to go back.\n\nBefore I woke, my partner leaned in close and whispered in my ear, not in their voice but the voice of the trickster god that we\u2019d defeated before time had reversed, and they laughed. The last thing I heard before jerking awake was that I\u2019d given up everything, and they\u2019d finally won. \n\nI woke up absolutely drenched in sweat, terrified out of my mind, with a horrible pain in my chest. The scariest thing, I knew that all those memories fading away were signs that the evil god was erasing the life i\u2019d had. Our kids, our friends, everything. And as the dream faded I realised I was forgetting the details.\n\nBy the time I started writing it down I couldn\u2019t remember the names of the kids I vividly recalled having, or my partner or what they looked like. \n\nAll I remember is that I couldn\u2019t forget, that if I forgot I\u2019d never be able to undo what he\u2019d done. But years later I still don\u2019t remember. Every few months I\u2019ll remember that I still don\u2019t know and It\u2019ll take me days to get over it. I hope one day I\u2019ll have the dream again and I can remember another detail.",

            "In a beautiful city with art-noveau aesthetic I was a male lover of a detective (also male) that went missing without a trace. I was also an investigator, working with him, but I was either his subordinate or I hadn't got as much experience as him.\n\nMy beloved disappeared and I continued his investigations all across the city, talking with the same witnesses, trying to solve not only his mysterious disappearance, but also the case he had been originally working on. My progress alternated with sepia-coloured flashbacks of him being in the same place, having the same conversations. I'm delivering an inner monologue through all of this, narating my progress, how I miss him, how I hope he's still alive, but I'm growing more and more depressed.\n\nI got a tip for an abandoned mine/factory just outside of the city, on a hillside resembling cliffs of Dover. There was a still functioning railroad track leading to it, crawling along the cliffs in a steep, steep trail, turning at 90 degrees at one point. How the steam-locomotive with carriage wagons overcome it, I have no idea.\n\nThe railroad ended in a station carved in the cliffside - and what a station it was! From the outside it looked like those three-faced buddhist goddess statues, but more art-deco-ish. Only the head was actually carved in the cliffside, the front-looking face watching over the city with it's glass eyes. Which were actually enormous windows of the train station. The deep indigo blue of the glass was due to the mineral that was mined/processed in the factory.\n\nThe train entered the station through the eyesocket of the right face, which was still glassed-in. Somehow the glass of that particular eye functioned as a gate and could slid into the wall to allow the train to enter. To reach the top of the hill where the decreipt, wooden and archaic buildings of the mine was, one had to take a very futuristic elevator.\n\nSo, as I'm taking the train to the goddess-head-station, I got a vivid, no longer sepia-coloured flashback of my lover fighting, fencing no less, with somebody on the roofs of the wagons. \n\n\nAnd then my alarm-clock blares!\n\nI have a lesson, I ought to get up.\n\nBUT I need to know what happened. \n\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nWell, I just flopped back to my bed, and... back in the dream I took the manga I've been reading and flipped through the pages, speedreading to the end. There ought to be the battle on the wagons in greater details, the narrator's arrival to the mine where he (no longer I, my bloody alarm forced me to switch perspective) found the body of his lover, and a fire that my original dream avatar set to destroy the group of killers who had been waiting there to silence him.\n\nI'm not sure if my avatar survived and the details are fuzzy, but hey, I've got to know the intended end!\n\nMy craziest dream-experience ever.",
            "I always get really vivid dreams, this is the one that fits the question best...\n\nIn the dream, some kind of new iceage seemed to have changed civilisation as we knew it, burying all previous settlements in snow and ice. The people that remained lived in small isolated communities in giant semi-subterranean domes made of thick glass in the centre and concrete bunkers around the edges. \n\nSome sort of vital delivery or communication had been interrupted between my settlement and the next nearest one, a month or so walk away. The man I loved in the dream, who was some sort of ranger that knew the hostile and icy lands well, had volunteered to go out to the other settlement to find out what was going on over six months ago but had not returned. \n\nIn the time between him leaving and the \"present\" I had found out about and had his child, something he did not know, and was beginning to give up hope that I'd see him again. In taking the child to the government offices to register for extra rations, I uncovered that the the government of the dome were part of a regime/cult that hid the fact that the other domes communities had a plan to form a better and safer community in a fabled warm/safe spot by blocking communications. By doing this the cult had absolute control over our dome and its citizens.\n\nThe man I loved had discovered the truth and left for the other dome on a secret mission to get help but the government had been sending out armed patrols to prevent his return. I returned home and was later woken up in the night by a firefight close to the dome between the government officials and the party the man I loved lead.\n\nI ran out into the cold and saw the man from across the snow. A shot range out but woke up befoe I could find out if it hit him or me.\n\nI wish I knew how it ended.",

As a very talkative and creative kid I often annoyed my parents with random questions or ideas. Instead of playing into the imagination of an 8 year old, my parents gave me a word count. For example I would only be allowed to say 10 words that day unless it was an emergency (blood or fire). The word count would be anywhere from 10-50 words depending on moms mood. This only lasted about two weeks but was still damaging. \n2) this rule was enforced by my older siblings who babysat me and my younger siblings most weekdays as mom worked and dad slept. They would organize something called the \u201clittle kid fights\u201d. Me and my three younger brothers would do a tournament-style fight to establish order of dominance. If you were dominant over a person you had ultimate say over everything. You could kick people off the couch if you wanted that seat. Steal toys and food. Whatever you wanted.

If you want to play games, set up your PC / laptop at the table in the common place, want to read? why stay in your own room, you HAVE TO be in the living room and pretty much share every moment with family.\n\ni thought it was normal when i was a kid, that i literally had no 'personal time' aside from sleeping. my parents would want me to do my homework / read / do anything where they can see me, and where we hang out as a family.\n\nApparently ppl were allowed to have their own free time, completely be alone! what a shocker for me! \n\n(Argh i'm deeply troubled by that now btw, that i feel the urge to grow independent but at the same time feeling guilty that i'm not tied with my family -- even when it's just abt reading in my own room).",
            "This is 100% true! Visitors were never allowed 'inside'.

Likewise we weren't allowed to go into other people's homes. I've had so many conversations on porches.",

            "It wasn\u2019t so much that I thought EVERY household followed these rules, but I did consider them normal.\n\n1) When guests come over, boys and girls do not play together.\n\n2) Friends who come into your room must be the same gender as you.\n\n3) If you get in trouble, you will not be allowed to read except for the Bible.\n\n4) Do not listen to rock music because it is inherently evil, no matter who performs it or what the lyrics say.\n\n5) You\u2019re not allowed to enter the house of anyone whose parents we are not friends with, even if you play with their child every day. He is allowed in our house, however.\n\n6) We do not celebrate Halloween and anyone who does is inviting evil spirits into their bodies and homes.\n\n7) If we go somewhere, even to the store, you will wear non-denim pants and a collared shirt, and your sisters will wear long skirts. Even at home, your sisters will never wear slim-cut pants or shorts above the knee.\n\n8) Sometimes we anoint people with oil and repeat shouted pleas for divine healing and/or guidance.\n\nI think I should probably say that my parents have loosened up on some things since then, but that\u2019s how I grew up.\n\nEDIT: Okay holy crap you guys, didn\u2019t realize anyone would actually read this. I\u2019m studying for a math test and there\u2019s no way I can reply to everyone, so let me just kind of put a couple blanket answers here:\n\n1) Whoever said IBLP, you got it in one. We used to go to Bill Gothard\u2019s conventions every year. I started calling it GothCon and from what I hear, the name kinda stuck.\n\n2) I\u2019m not gonna do an AMA. Not from this account, anyway. I\u2019m just here to offer Reddit a couple jokes and encouraging words and talk to folks about baseball sometimes (and promote my nerdcore rap project like everyone else). I almost never get so serious on here, so I\u2019m kinda scared that this is getting any attention cuz it\u2019s really not what I\u2019m here about.\n\n3) Even though what I\u2019ve described sounds pretty wild, we actually had a pretty tame experience in comparison to a lot of folks we knew. I think my parents are overall rational, intelligent people (even if we disagree on a lot still), and over time, they made strides to regain balance from some of the extreme views they\u2019d been drawn into. I understand that they were overcorrecting from the lack of structure or control they\u2019d had growing up, and while it doesn\u2019t excuse everything, it\u2019s something I can consider without too much bitterness now.\n\n4) I\u2019m not interested in dwelling too much on that part of my past because I don\u2019t want it to define the rest of my life. I can see the ways it\u2019s affected me and some of the hangups I have because of it, and I\u2019m taking steps to deal with that on my own terms. Like I said in one reply before, you only get one shot at living your life, so there\u2019s no use trying to climb back up the slide.\n\nEDIT 2: Just cuz some of y\u2019all are still asking: No, I was not raised Mormon. IBLP is not a Mormon organization. Interestingly, one of my childhood friends is a Mormon missionary now.",

Judge has them both tested. He tests positive for meth. My client is clean. \n\nJudge denies his motion, and asks me to send in new temp orders where young man is required to maintain employment and start paying child support and places him on supervised visits. \n\nIcing on the cake, opposing counsel actually calls me and leaves me a voicemail congratulating me on, and I quote, \"handing her ass to her for the first time in a long time.\"",
            "More of a case of screwing himself over, but here goes.  This was a case another prosecutor in my office had a few years back.  30 year old defendant was charged with sexual assault of a child after he got his girlfriend\u2019s 14 year old sister pregnant.  She actually kept the baby so the police just waited and got a paternity test.  No surprise, defendant was the father.\n\nDefendant wanted probation; prosector refused to offer it.  He decided to plead guilty and have a jury trial on punishment (here in Texas, you can choose to have the jury set punishment).  Evidence mostly proceeded as expected.  The victim testified to having consensual (aside from not being old enough to consent) sex with the defendant, getting pregnant, etc..  Paternity test introduced.  \n\nDefendant took the stand.  His version of events was that he snuck into victim\u2019s room at night, covered her mouth, and held her down while he forcibly had sex with her against her will.  It seemed like his own lawyer had no idea that\u2019s the story he settled on.\n\nThe jury deliberated about fifteen minutes before returning a verdict of 17 years (the maximum possible as charged was 20).  When interviewed by the attorneys afterwards, one of them said they decided on 17 years so the defendant would never forget the age of consent in Texas again.",
            "Not a lawyer but happened to me and some buddies in college. \n\nSo a group of friends and I rented a 5 bedroom house in college. And being the group of guys we were partied pretty hard and were really rough on the house. We knew going in we were not getting out deposit back. \n\nWell part way though living there the septic started to have some problems whenever someone used the downstairs shower it would drain slowly, ie slowly fill as you used it. Also one of the rooms carpet would get wet. So we emailed the property service company to fix it. 2 weeks later they send out a plumber to snake the line and leave. \n\nWell that didn't fix it, so we emailed again. 2-3 weeks, plumber, snake, leave. Still not fixed, email and 2-3 weeks and they scope the line. Turns out roots had grown into the line so they had to do a big ol process to completely remove all the roots. Now it's fixed. \n\nWell we all move out, go or separate ways. One of my buddies goes to Australia for 9 months. When he gets back he comes home to a bunch of voicemails. Turns out the property company is coming after us for like 5 thousand on top of the deposit. They tried to pressure him into either paying the money or he would be taken to court. He told them he would see them in court. \n\nFor the couple months leading up to the court date he would get calls telling him to pay and it would all go away. Day before the first day of court they call him and tell him to pay 2k and give them info for one of the other people on the original lease. He says go to hell and see you in court. \n\nFirst day of court is just to make sure everyone shows and to schedule the actual case. Lawyer for the property company shows up, is scrambling to figure out what is going on. Had no records beyond the original lease, which changed a couple times as people moved in and out. My buddy helps him out by giving him copies of the multiple emails that we sent to get them to fix the septic and the damage it did to the house. Told my buddy he would let us know how they wanted to proceed, never heard from the company again.",

Client looks at her, back at the judge, tears well up in his eyes and he blurts out: \"I'm so sorry, I'll never do it again!\"\n\nShe threw her notes and everything else she had in her hands at the client (now convict) apparently.

My boss was representing the family that got hit (one where the two kids and the wife had died, but the father had not) and wanted the college guy's drunk-driving skin to be mounted on a wall.\n\nThis was back before Facebook was commonly used in Court proceedings and before tons of people realized that shit is too great for any attorney worth their weight in salt to pass up.\n\nSo, the kid (drunk driving college kid) had managed to get the judge's sympathy during the first part of the hearing by saying he was sorry, haunted, never going to drink again, this was going to ruin his life, etc.  The judge seemed to really be eating it up.\n\nThen comes my boss and immediately burns this kid's remorse to the ground by showing numerous Facebook statuses and photos of them binge drinking, partying, and even joking about driving drunk from the date of the accident up until a night ago.  The kid looked like he was being forced to swallow hot coals and the judge was absolutely livid.\n\nNeedless to say, the kid had to do way more than just apologize and be remorseful after that.",

The judge is ready to give him a prison sentence because he was driving a car this time, but the guy starts crying that he finally got  a job out of town and was trying to turn his life around.

            "I\u2019m currently representing a sweet old lady on a case. I\u2019ll be sparse in the details in case anyone figures out who I am. \n\nLong story short, this lady\u2019s neighbour convinces her that her house is basically unsellable, that her house requires all sorts of repairs, the repairs to the house would bankrupt her, and that she should just sell the house. To him. \n\nHe shows up at her house the next day with documents to sign. She has no idea what\u2019s going on. Doesn\u2019t read anything (actually has an eye condition) and signs everything. \n\nWhen she finally sees a lawyer to close the deal, he says wtf you can\u2019t do this. You see, the price of the transaction was about 36% of what the house is actually worth and there weren\u2019t any repairs that needed to be done that would justify the price. Not kidding, it was stuff like fixing a faucet in the bathroom. \n\nAlso she didn\u2019t understand that she would have nowhere to live afterwards. Old lady thought she could just stay in the house until she died. \n\nTo make matters worse, she\u2019s living off a modest pension and the other side is suing for the house. They\u2019re essentially trying to get her to cave because her legal fees are getting exorbitant. \n\nI hate people.\n\nEdit: to answer a few questions:\n\n1. We do have a lot in our favour, but there are a lot of steps to get to trial. By the time we get there, she\u2019s going to have to spend a lot of money. Money she doesn\u2019t have. \n\n2. She has an eye condition (uveitis), but it isn\u2019t bad enough to qualify as a defence (non est factum). At the time she was driving. \n\n3. She\u2019s a terrible witness. Her evidence is all over the place. When she was examined (deposed for you Americans) she denies being taken advantage of. Not great for our position. \n\n4. In Ontario, where I practice, contracts for the purchase of real estate don\u2019t have to be notarized.\n\nEdit #2: thanks for all the interest everyone!

One of the most common ways to get custody was to allege sex or porn addiction because the threshold for it was basically non existent.\n\nFor this hearing however, we lucked out with the judge, who I knew from other cases. Opposing counsel tried to \"gotcha!\" Me into settling before the hearing by showing me surprise sexts between mom and her new boyfriend. This is, of course, not law and order and you can't introduce surprise evidence. So we go through with the hearing, I object to the sexts, but say I would allow them to be ready into the record, in their entirety. \n\nSo the uptight very conservative local attorney gets to spend the next twenty five minutes or so reading sexts in open court occasionally asking if she could gloss over parts but no, I didn't feel it would be appropriate. I'll never forget hearing her struggle with the word nipple. It's not even a dirty word!\n\nBut this was like the third hearing we had to amend custody because this guy felt his ex wife having a boyfriend meant she was a sex addict. They alleged the sexts happened while the kid was in Mom's custody. But they based that on the timestamp of the screenshots. The timestamp on the texts was clearly at a time when the kid was not even around and mom was safe to get freaky over the phone. \n\nThe judge had heard enough of his bullshit and awarded attorneys fees and put in the order, consistent with the vexatious litigant statute, that if dad would continue to be liable for her attorneys fees if he kept pushing this shit. \n\nIt was the only joy I got from practicing family law",

His client (the creditor) had purchased controlling interest in the debtor (the owner of the building).\n2. He had been directed to fire the other attorney.\n3. He had been directed to withdraw the motion to sell the real estate.\n4. He then did both there in the Courtroom.\n\nI have practiced for almost 3 decades.

My dad was fighting for custody of all of us as we currently only spent weekends at his - but during that time we would all complain about what bad things would happen during the week with our mother.\n\nUltimately the judge ruled that the kids were old enough to decide where they wanted to be (my sister would make my choice for me). My mum knew for a fact she would lose all of us this way, she was aware all of us preferred our dad. It\u2019s at this point she stands up in court and says \u201cyou can have all of them but *(me)* isn\u2019t even yours, so you can\u2019t have her\u201d. \n\nMy entire family were there, nobody had any idea why she would say such a thing, a lot of people are crying and my dad is in a state of shock. Because of this, the judge orders a DNA test to be done, but either way, the kids still get to choose at the next court date as his name is present on all of our birth certificates - I guess she forgot that eh? The judge gives this extra time due to the state my dad is in, just in case this changes anything for him, and whether he will still want custody of me under these new circumstances. \n\nNow it should be noted that my mum was not fond of any of us, especially the boys, to which she already knew they were a lost cause. But she would no longer receive benefits or money from my dad, so she needed some kids around at least. She took this time to convince my sister that with her brothers gone, she would be able to afford all of the things she wanted. Ice cream, toys, later bed times, you name it. \n\nMy brothers chose my dad, my sister chose my mum. I had a pretty rough upbringing because of her decision, and to this day she regrets it.

Mom was a SAHM until I turned 16, and entered the work force at minimum wage, worked up to management. Dad worked a trade job at an auto company, making 3- 4x as much as her, in the 6 figures. \n\nAt the beginning of proceedings she tried to settle early on. She basically wanted enough to cover health care, because that was her biggest worry financially. He basically wanted to give her nothing. Things got very nasty, he hired a horrible see you next Tuesday of a lawyer, who would constantly insult my mother to her face. This pushed mom to ask for much much more than she originally wanted. Dad was told by his lawyer mom wouldn't get a penny. After a year of battle judge hand down final judgment. Dad has to pay $1500/ month. \n\nThree days after judgement, my younger sister is at dad's house. Mom picks her up, asks why he hasn't gone to work yet, sister goes in to check on him. She finds him barely breathing with vomit all over. He had acetaminophen poisoning. There was an empty bottle of hydrocodone/acetaminophen and another big bottle of tylenol on his nightstand. The doctors said there was no way to be 100% how much he had taken because the he went to bed early and my sister hadn't seen him for over twelve hours, but with the amount still in his blood and the degree of organ failure they could say with 70% sure it was an intentional overdose. \n\nHe did all of this before putting his brand new car in his name alone, and before any other payments to mom went through, besides splitting the sale of our house. And now, you're probably thinking there's no way a person could attempt suicide only out of spite. There was no note or anything. But when fighting with his sisters over who would make his medical and financial decisions, which is a whole other story, we found out he wrote his sister a check for $ 75,000, with a note saying \"don't let the girls have this\" meaning my mom and sisters. \n\nFord is still going after my mother for the car payments. The county administrator (edit: a judge decided to put a third party in charge of all decisions concerning him since it was contested) waited nearly two years before letting it get repossessed. Her credit was tanked. My sister (who was only 16 at the time) is still dealing with PTSD from finding him. And this wall of text was just the SHORT version. But my dad is still living with the side effects, it's basically like he had a very bad stroke, he's in an assisted living facility and none of his kids have anything to do with him anymore.\n\nTl;dr attempted suicide to get out of alimony payments is the worst thing I've seen someone do to screw someone else over in court.",

Then one day while the kids were with her, she emails me and tells me that she had enrolled the kids in a school near her.  As soon as I got that email from her, I went to my attorney.

Ex-wife originally gets custody of their son, due to the nature of the Submariner's operation schedule. Ex-wife later looses custody due to being convicted of Child Abuse/Neglect. The ex-wife wasn't having this, because now there was no more free money for her.\n\nThe Submariner gets a GF, and gives her guardian rights over his son while on deployment. They live in California due to orders, and the ex-wife lives in Michigan (if I recall). The ex-wife waits until Submariner goes on deployment and \"serves\" him papers for a custody battle, again on the grounds of his schedule.

The female judge who presided over the case sympathized with the ex-wife, decided that children belonged with their mother and not in the care of random women, and that the Abuse conviction was likely false. Ex-wife was granted custody by default, and the judge tried to get the Submariner on Contemt of Court for not showing up. Until his Chain of Command heard about it.\n\nSee, it's illegal in the US to punish a service member for missing a court date due to military operations or deployments.\n\nThe Submariner's Chain of Command called a JAG, who assigned the Submariner a lawyer. His lawyer took the appeal to the Michigan State Supreme Court. The original judge isn't a judge anymore, and the ex-wife is now permanently labeled unfit to care for children.",

She let husband believe the child was his until she was about five years old and they were divorcing. To stop him from getting custody, she convinced the biological father to try to get custody thinking that if he won she would wind up with the child.

She kept hauling things back to court trying to get more benefits from him and his lawyer just let it keep happening and it was destroying his life - allegations of child abuse, was taking so much money that he could barely afford a shit apartment and couldn't afford a car which both figured in later for custody. \n\nFinally the ex-wife's father (also a lawyer) asked to meet with the judge and mentioned a few things that he knew were going on...\n\n- One of the children was manic-depressive and the ex-wife would take him off his meds before it was the ex-husband's turn for custody. The child abuse allegations were from the ex-husband trying to restrain the child during a manic episode because he wasn't medicated.\n- The ex-wife had intentionally timed the child abuse allegation to fall just before the holidays so the ex-husband couldn't see the kids for Halloween - Thanksgiving - Christmas. She bragged to family that it would do the maximum emotional damage possible doing it then.\n- The ex-wife had forged documents to overstate the ex-husband's income when alimony was being determined\n- Oh... and the ex-wife was sleeping with the ex-husband's lawyer.\n\nedit: forgot to give the outcome.\n\nThe ex-husband's lawyer was reported to the bar (not sure what happened there). The Judge order a review of everything and arranged for a new lawyer for the ex-husband. It was looking like the alimoney would be vastly reduced and the ex-husband was going to get custody.

For the better part of a decade, I found it to be an exceptional, if not singular, place to have interesting discussions on just about any topic under the sun without getting bogged down (unless I wanted to) in needless drama or having the conversation derailed by the hot topic (or pointless argument) de jour.\n\nThe reason for this strange exception to the internet dichotomy of either echo-chamber or endless-culture-war-shouting-match was the existence of individual communities with their own codes of conduct and, more importantly, their own volunteer teams of moderators who were empowered to create communities, set, and enforce those codes of conduct.\n\nI take no issue with reddit seeking compensation for its services. There are a myriad ways it could have sought to do so that wouldn't have destroyed the thing that made it useful and interesting in the first place. Many of us would have happily paid to use it had core remained intact. Instead of seeking to preserve reddit's spirit, however, /u/spez appears to have decided to spit in the face of the people who create the only value this site has- its communities, its contributors, and its mods. Without them, reddit is worthless. Without their continued efforts and engagement it's little more than a parked domain.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong; maybe this new form of reddit will be precisely the thing it needs to catapult into the social media stratosphere. Who knows? I certainly don't. But I do know that it will no longer be a place for me. See y'all on [raddle](https://raddle.me), [kbin](https://kbin.social), or wherever the hell we all end up.

She claims she has been nothing but a loving wife, yet provides no proof he is cheating.

            "Not a lawyer, but worked in arbitration for a decade.  Truly one of the shadier sides of the legal industry when it comes to consumers.  We'd have hundreds of cases against the same company, alleging the same complaint.  But, given that arbitration is private, even if one claimant could prove something, the information wouldn't be on record for any of the other cases.  So a company could willfully screw over hundreds of people, and even if one of them could afford a lawyer good enough to prove it, the company would just pay up and continue fighting everyone else.  They had no real motivation to settle, since they could just wait out most of the people filing against them, and even if they lost a hearing, it's not on the public record.  It was cheaper to, say, leave asbestos in the walls of their buildings and fight the legal cases, than it was to actually fix the problem.",

            "I'm not sure how often trigger warnings apply here, but: triggers. It's long (I'm exhausted and get wordy when I'm tired), but I think our clients story needs to be heard so that maybe something good can come of it somehow. \n\nWe had this absolutely amazing, sweet, kind, well off older gentleman as a divorce client. One of our very favorite clients ever. He actually lived in the subdivision I grew up in (and my mom still lives in). Upper middle class, huge houses, average, etc. Adult children from prior marriage only.\n\nWe'll call him C.\n\nHe married this woman from the country north of us, a medical professional (not doctor, but not giving many details bc confidentiality). Maybe a couple years younger than him but not much, not terribly attractive - essentially, not a trophy wife/golddigger.\n\nWe'll call her V.\n\nThey were married several years. This man would do literally anything and everything for this woman, was just madly in love with her. \n\nShe starts being sketchy. He eventually finds out she's having an affair, confronts her, she doesn't really give a shit. He tries to fix things and eventually retains us for divorce. \n\nWe get the ball rolling - filed case, etc. Get V served. \n\nWell, V doesn't like that C actually filed. She does the usual shit people like her do - begs, promises to break off the affair, swears she loves C and that everything can be perfect from now on. He falls for it and takes her back. Insists he wants the divorce dismissed, so we dismissed it. \n\nSeveral months go by, and he catches her in the same shit. Now she's becoming extremely emotionally/psychologically abusive and physically threatening. At one point, when he tells her he's thinking about filing again, she injures herself (superficially), calls police, and has him arrested for DV. He gets charged and pleas out,  because he's having some pretty severe health issues (in his late 60s/early 70s) and she begs him to just \"get it over with\" so they can move on and rebuild their marraige.  The only offense he's ever had in his life - literally a model citizen and overall great guy. Eventually she goes back to her norm - a heinous, abusive fucking bitch.\n\nHe retains again. We file again. She manipulates him back into it again, because apparently love truly is blind. We tell him we need him to come in and talk to us for awhile before dismissing it, and try to talk some sense into him. Try to get him to see a therapist. We get permission from him to speak to his adult daughter about our concerns. Ask him to think it over, maybe discuss with his daughter and a counselor, and get back to us in a week or two. I have a psych degree as well, which helps when trying to talk with people about things like abuse in relationships, getting out safely, etc. \n\n*SIDE NOTE: The most dangerous time for an abused person is when they try to leave. And it takes many, many attempts before one can leave - IF they can leave. I'm not getting into the whole cycle of domestic violence here, but don't ever tell anyone \"why don't you just leave?\" or pass judgment because it is never, ever that easy, and is highly dangerous.*\n\nWell, two weeks later he came in, and we had another hours long sit down. Discussed everything, and he swears \"she's changed.\" An absolute fool in love. But, our hands are tied, and we have to respect our clients wishes and dismiss. \n\nAbout 6 months later, his daughter calls to inform us he had a stroke. Apparently C caught V with yet another guy and C & V got into an argument that was enough to exacerbate his HBP. Now, remember V is a trained and licensed medical professional. While C is having a stroke in front of V, V decides to just laugh. Hours after the stroke, she calls 911 and plays it off like she just found him. \n\nComplications from the stroke left C with very slurred speech, awkward gate, weakness throughout his body, and some other issues. He became very physically vulnerable. On the advice of his daughter, he came in again and we filed divorce attempt number 3.\n\nYou already know where this is headed. Eventually, despite my husband and I literally begging and pleading with him, offering to do the entire divorce free of charge, bringing his daughter in (she was a full POA at this point and we had waivers from him on everything - he was still competent though, so no conservatorship or guardianship), offering any and everything we could, and he adamantly insisted on dismissing it. We asked him to think about it for a week.\n\n I can still remember him coming into our reception area while I had him sign the papers to dismiss. He was a completely different man than we had met years before for divorce no. 1. He'd grown older, sure, but also pale. Physically smaller. Weaker, difficult to understand. He was so energetic, with such a bright light in his eyes, despite the pain of ending his marriage, when we had first met. \n\nIt was heartbreaking.  I asked him to please, please reconsider - for his kids, for his daughter who was pregnant with his first grandchild, for that baby. I told him that I knew he loved her more than anything, but what he loved wasn't her, it was only the manipulative personality she deployedqstood over him laughing and ignoring his crisis while he had a stroke. That if he stayed with her, she would kill him one day. He looked in my eyes and said he knows, but he loves her too much, and \"she promised\" to do better and try counseling.\n\nSo, we dismissed for the third time. Reminded him we will always be there for anything he needs, especially if he wants to try leaving (we live near him and my husband is a big guy, plus we know many LEOs). We've become friends with several of our clients after their cases; him, we considered family. \n\nAbout a month later I was watching TV and there was a \"breaking news\" headline - domestic violence murder in my (very small) hometown. No identifiable information at that point, but I knew. I texted my husband - he was on the phone with the daughter already.\n\nV called 911 after a bit. A friend of ours was the lead LEO on it, and was first on scene. V was standing in the middle of the road, speaking in tongues and behaving erratically. Tried building a NGRI or GBMI defense that thank God nobody bought. \n\nV had flipped on C over nothing, and while and his dog were in the living room, she snuck up behind him and and beat him and the dog with a cast iron fireplace poker. The dog had surgery, but was ultimately put down. C was life life flighted and operated on, put into a coma for about a week, then passed away. \n\nShe pleaded out, no trial. I hope she rots in hell.\n\nThat's the most heartbreaking case we've had, and we've had a lot of heartbreaking cases. And absolutely one of the worst ways we've seen a party get \"screwed over.\"\n\nTl;dr - please, please don't ignore or judge people who are dealing with domestic violence, and if you know someone who is, learn about the best ways you can help. What may seem like common sense to some can put then in more harm.",

The girl pulls one out of her purse and said that she already had one.\n\nThe judge then told her - well you have to have two witnesses (mind you, the only people in the courtroom were the judge, the defense attorney, me (prosecutor), the sheriff's deputy, the defendant and the girlfriend).  The Defense attorney immediately grabbed my arm and said we would be the witnesses.\n\nSo, for the next 5 minutes, I sat and watched the Defendant get married and then hauled off to prison.  He could not even kiss the bride.  It was incredibly uncomfortable.

In this case two appraisers were hired, one by the wife, one by the husband, both about three weeks apart. I was the first appraiser, it was a very nice house, great condition, had recently been fully renovated, and I had solid indicators of market value. Really a run-of-the-mill assignment. The husband was unhappy with my results, so before the next appraiser came, he felt it would be a good idea to trash the house. Pulled cabinets off the wall, took a crow bar to tile flooring, holes in walls, removed all the appliances, just generally trashed the place. Needless to say the next appraiser came in about $200,000 less than me. Long story short, the judge used my indication of market value and forced the husband to pay for all the repairs. There was about $150,000 in equity that he would have had to pay half of. But instead ended up paying closer to $300,000. Really just screwed himself.",

            "Public Defender here,\n\nHad a client who was accused of stealing catalytic converters from vehicles at used car lots.\n\nClient gets pulled over in a U-Haul with defective tail lights. Client bolts from the U-Haul, leaving two passengers inside and his wallet. Inside the U-Haul police find the bag of stolen catalytic converters totaling around $1200.00. Two passengers (one of whom is clients cousin) rats on client.  Police put out an arrest warrant. A short time later police find client. \n\nClient is on felony probation which he took under first offender. In my state, first offender allows a client to complete the sentence and have the felony expunged. If the client doesn\u2019t complete first offender however, the case is re-opened and client could be sentenced to the max (in his case 15 years). \n\nAfter working up the case and following through on leads, we end up getting a pretty sweetheart deal from the state, pre-trial diversion (Aka PTD). Great thing about client taking PTD is that he remains on first offender probation and he isn\u2019t re-sentenced. \n\nAfter speaking to the client about PTD and the requirements ($500 and an 8 week course), he balks and insists that he\u2019s completely innocent. Moreover, he accuses me of working for the state and conspiring with the ADA to screw him over. \n\nThe state doesn\u2019t budge and we move forward to the trial calendar. A couple weeks before trial, the state serves me with newly acquired supplemental discovery including a full confession from client. Turns out client had a conversation on jail phones (which are always screened by the state and admissible) with a compatriot admitting to stealing all the catalytic converters the officers found plus two more.\n\nClient gets offered two to serve. Ends up taking the felony plea. Judge revokes his first offender and gives him an additional one year consecutive to serve with a restitution balance of $1400.00.\n\nTL;DR client balks at avoiding prison. ends up  serving three years."

Equal parts utility and pleasure. 10 minutes, maybe 15.  \nFinally is the mental health shower. The steam, hot water, isolation, and repetitive motions are great for relaxation and meditation. You focus on relaxing each muscle group, from shoulders to ankles, regulated deep breathing, and let the water run over your body.

He actually kept trying to touch me and told me that I was going to go to his room with him.     He had a strange angry edge too.  So I gave the bartender a \u201chelp me\u201d look and said to him something like \u201cI need to talk to you about that thing with my tab, remember?\u201d  and asked if could do it when the bar closed (which was like 5 minutes later).     He looked at me and said, \u201cGive me a minute\u201d, made a phone call and then said, \u201cSo, they can help you at the front desk\u201d... meanwhile creeper is literally not leaving me alone is still trying to actually hang on me and keeps talking.  \n\nSo I start to leave and creeper is trying to kiss me and pull me close but I tell him I  have business at the front desk and walk to the front desk.  About 3 employees were there and I said \u201cThe Bartender said you could help me with my tab?\u201d And one of the employees  says \u201coh, I need you to come here with me to fix that\u201d.  And she says to the guy \u201cYou need to stay here, this is personal business\u201d.  The employee (a woman) and I start to walk away and of course the creeper followed us.  She actually walked me to a staff elevator and he tried to get on with us.  She told him \u201cGet out of here and leave us alone\u201d as a male hotel employee came up to him just then and the elevator door shut.  The employee walked me literally to my room door and stayed until I had it locked on the other side. \n\nI have had (and still occasionally do have) guys hit on me but never anything like this incident.  I actually wrote a long long email to the hotel corporate office and the actual hotel about the bartender and two employees because they helped me in what I would say was \u201cabove and beyond\u201d... the guy really frightened me.  I have been as brand loyal as possible to the hotel chain ever since.  ",
            "Something opposite happened to me. \n\nThis strange much older guy wouldn't stop talking to me (I was in my mid-20s). I was shy so I tried to act polite towards him but I was visibly upset. \n\nA female bartender came up and asked if this guy was bothering me. I nervously chuckled, \"Yeah, kinda,\" and gave her a look.  \n\nThe bartender laughed and said, \"Leave the girl alone,\" or something similar to him in a joking voice then walked away. The man said I was rude and walked away, only to come back and bother me a few more times. \n\nA couple days later a friend who frequents that bar said the bartender told him my story. She says I hurt the older guy's feelings and the bartender didn't appreciate it because he's kind of kooky but a regular and \"means no harm\". \n\nI don't go to that bar anymore.",
            "Another time I was in a bar in the states, I had been a regular here for a little bit and I knew the bar staff. A new guy comes in and starts hitting on the bar tender. At first she seems to just play along with it so I ignore it, not my business. Time goes by, he's starting to leave he starts getting more and more aggressive on hit hints at her. He wants her number, but she's giving him excuses like \"my phone is broke right now\" and eventaully she says, look enough no. \n\nAt this point I'm paying attention, and he says she's just shy and she knows he would she would like it. She gets upset, she asks him to leave, I tell him he should leave, he ignores me and still trying to smooth things over with her. Manager comes who is also a woman and tells him he needs to leave. I tell him he needs to leave now, by this point there was a group of 3 construction guys who had gotten him up and come on over to the bar and he was told he needs pay, and leave right now or we the guys will take care of him ourselves. \n\nAt this point he decides to pay and leave. Manager gave us all a round of free drinks. Guy came in again the next day, when the owner was there. The owner called the police and trespassed him. ",
            "Not a safe word per se, but my mom and a friend went to a bar and a guy mugged her friend outside. She entered with her purse messed up and holding a shoe, and their male friend called over to the owner. He called out something like \"Woman Down\" and a bunch of men stood and went outside to search for this guy.\n\nTurns out a few years prior a woman there got raped. After that the owner established a code phrase with the regulars for if a woman gets attacked. The place looks like a dive bar at first glance, but the owner was a serious gentleman and didn't even allow cursing in there.",
            "Had a bar call 911 once after they bounced a guy who was creeping out a woman. He stood outside the bar and flat out said he was waiting for her until she came out, which he did. He started following her and told people they were together. I literally had to stand with this moron while this poor girl and her friends got into the car, and dipshit tried to stand really close so he could get the address. I told the driver her address, but gave the address of the jail, which most taxis know, and he seemed to get the hint. Guy tried to complain later that we had \"unlawfully detained\" him just so he couldn't get the girls number and address.\n\nI mean... Yeah, basically that's what we did. Move along.\n\nEdit for clarification: I responded to the 911 call, I'm a police officer",
            "I've actually been used to escape by a random before. Was at a local bar with a bunch of friends and out of no where girl walks over, sits on my lap and between a teeth clenched smile just said \"pretend to know me\". I laughed and loudly said \"Hey you! Where'd you wonder off to?\" Thankfully my friends picked up on it because inside of 10 seconds a few of my female friends were chatting with her and standing between her and the guy she'd fled. \n\nI asked her after what about me made her know I was a safe person to turn to and she said \"because you're here with a bunch of women. Total honesty. Thought you were gay.\" Lol.\n\nEdit: holy crap. Welp. There goes my Reddit silver AND Gold cherry. Ya'll are awesome. ",

            "In 2012 I was at a nude beach in Toronto. A random 60 year old man approached me, at that time I was a shy 18 year old, and he simply would not leave. He talked on and on about how I could come live with him at his house and be his girlfriend, all the while not letting me get a word in edgewise. To escape this situation I decided to call the day a loss and leave even though I\u2019d only just arrived. As I walked back to the ferry he emerged from the trees and followed me back to the mainland. He was still planning out our lives together and offered to buy us lunch at a local bar chain. Not wanting to lure the scary dude back to my apartment I agreed in the hopes of stalling and figuring out a plan. We sat down at a table by the door and I said I had to go to the bathroom and as I passed the bar I gave the bartender, a 20-something female, the 411 on this creepy dude situation. I asked if there was a back door somewhere I could slip out of and leave without him noticing. She replied that there was one through the kitchen but it was for staff only and she couldn\u2019t help me. I felt so betrayed that another female wouldn\u2019t intervene at all and I cried a little bit in the bathroom. I was so young, new to the city and genuinely scared. I didn\u2019t even have a phone back then I was so broke. When I got back to the table the food came, I ate two bites and when he called for the check as he waited for the bill I said \u201cwell this was...\u201d and ran into the street. I figured he wouldn\u2019t ditch on the check to follow me but I still took some crazy side treks before getting on the subway. \n\nEdit: clarified sentence structure. ",

I wasn't comfortable so excused my self to the bathroom and saw a poster that said about ask for Angela if you're uncomfortable. Went to the bar and asked for Angela and immidietly this guy was playing along saying oh yeah she's working in kitchen tonight he got me a taxi and walked me out the back door and into the taxi to make sure I got there without any hassle. Never saw the guy again. \n\n",
            "I went out on my own one night and was having a few drinks at a local pub. I had just moved to the area so didn\u2019t really know anyone. A guy sat down next to me and was chatting. At first is was just casual but he eventually became really tipsy/handsy. Then the guy actually kissed me just out of the blue and I told him I was not ok with it. He said I was leading him on - which was not the case at all. He got angry and stormed off to the washroom. I was feeling really uncomfortable and unsafe. I didn\u2019t know my new neighbourhood yet. The bartender saw that I was feeling off right away - he didn\u2019t even know me but could tell. He asked if I wanted to be shown out the back door and if they could put me in a cab home so that I could go without the guy following me. They even paid - and apologized that I felt unsafe in their bar. I was totally blown away. I would totally go back there and feel completely taken care of. ",
            "This is a relatively new thing, but us girls have been doing some form of it for a long time. \n\nBack when I was a bartender, I noticed a girl stumble into the pool table. She was crying and clearly very intoxicated. I went over to ask if she was okay, and some guy I hadn\u2019t seen her with all night jumps up and says, \u201cI\u2019m her boyfriend, I\u2019ve got her.\u201d No the fuck you do not. \n\nWe got her to calm down and give us her phone to call her roommate so someone safe could take her home. It sucks that it\u2019s necessary, but I\u2019ll always love my boss from that bar because he threw that creep out, physically. \n\nWe saw her again. She didn\u2019t have a boyfriend or remember that night. ",
            "Working as a bartender and bouncer for the past couple years, I usually just try to watch for body language of people that are in the bar. If it looks like someone needs a quick escape, I\u2019ll approach and pretend I\u2019m an old friend that hasn\u2019t seen them in a while, if they actually don\u2019t need help, I can excuse myself by saying they look like a friend.\n\nEither that, or I\u2019ll try to position myself behind the questionable party and give a thumbs-up and cocked eyebrow as a sort of \u201cYou good?\u201d.\n\nEdit: Well, thank you to the people who commented on this comment, and thanks to whoever gave me gold!

            "My university town had the highest incidents of sexual assault for 5 years in a row, the school and community took it really seriously and implemented procedures all over the place. \n\n\nI asked my friend, who was a bouncer at my favourite bar/club, what happens when a girl orders the drink. He said it changes week to week in the ladies bathroom to confuse men when word gets out. You can use any of the former ones and the bartenders will jump into action.\n\n\nGenerally they find a way to get you away from that person whether it be a \"phone call\" or they need to show you something. Once you're out of eye sight they whisk you away to the opposite floor of the place (bar is on the bottom, club is on the top) and keep the date occupied until your gone. If he gets away from his \"company\" they radio that the drink got spilled and every bouncer abandons their post to try and keep him away from you.\n\n\nThey escort you out the backdoor into a waiting cab. They pay the cabbie to take you home and make sure you're not followed. When you get home they ask that you flick your front porch lights on and off and call the club to let them know you're safe. They also save the security cameras from that day in case you have need of it at a later date.\n\n\nI never used their service because my friends were the bouncers and usually intervened before I needed to say anything. My friends did though and they said it was a relief to be in a bar that took women's saftey so seriously because in other bars in that town you could pay a bartender 20$ to spike a drink. I learned the hard way to never accept a glass from someone who had their open palm over the glass. Some people really suck.\n\n\nEdit: I have received some dms about spiked drinks and the aftermath of dealing with it. We have to make the world a better place together <3 if you're in Canada and something has happened to you please don't be afraid to reach out to CASAC , it's a free service and has help me and many of my friends. Stay strong, stay together, and reach out. For all my other sisters in other countries I can offer no such service, but if you dm me I'll help in anyway I can. Just know that you're not alone and it wasn't your fault <3",
            "Recently happened to me. I met up with an ex after roughly 5 years of not seeing him. He seemed way off when i arrived at the bar. Forgot his wallet (not surprised) so I bought the round of beers but immediately closed the tab because I wasn\u2019t expecting to pay for him and didn\u2019t want him taking advantage. When I excused myself to the restroom I was already regretting the evening. I left the rest room and he. Was. Standing. Outside. The. Door. Every alarm in my body went off but I Just acted annoyed and questioned him. He mumbled something and walked over to a pinball machine.  Never played just looked at it for a solid 10 minutes. Which gave me enough time to call my bartender over and ask \u201cgirl to girl, this dudes on drugs, right\u201d she agreed and asked me if I felt safe. I obviously didn\u2019t so she let me exit through the backdoor and even got her bar back to walk me to my car. Not sure if anything would have happened but I\u2019m really glad that she was so cool about it. \n\nTLDR: my ex showed up for drinks obviously out of his mind the bartender helped me escape. ",
            "I'm a bartender in a small town. Anytime a new woman comes into the bar I let her know that if she ever feels uncomfortable or needs anything to ask me to go out for a smoke with her.  I've had plenty of people use it to get away from some just usual creeps. But NOTHING beats the night a guy asked this girl to go home with him. After she politely refused he grabbed her and called her a bitch. We already had our eye on this situation, my bouncer immediately came out of no where and tased this drunk asshole. \n\n(Edit) \"tazed\" ",
            "I had a creep corner me in a bar once and tried to stroke my thigh. I dude I've never met before came up and said \"hey sis I've been looking all over for you!\" And he put his arm around me and walked me out. Thank you so much stranger. \n\nEdit: since I'm seeing a lot of comments about this. It was pretty obvious they were not working together. The nice guy walked over from a group of friends (all college aged) and the creep was in his fifties. And when I said he walked me out, he just walked me to the door of the bar. ",

            "Semi related, but I was out at the pub on campus for a show, and had been there previously in the day celebrating our last exam with some friends. Some guy who was sitting at a table next to us and trying to chat us up earlier was still there with his buddies and was drunker and braver and of course he got me alone when my friend went to the bathroom. \n\n He wouldn't stop talking to me and getting in my face and yelling about himself and when I excused myself to go to the bar (literally was like \"ok bye.\") He followed me to the bar and ordered the same thing as I did and offered to pay and I said I was good and he did not. stop. talking. And I must have looked mad as fuck because the bartender walked over and went \"hey you were here earlier right? Buddy give us a second I need to speak with her about her tab.\" The guy leaves and the bartender tells me I looked distressed and asked if everything was ok, I told him I was fine but this guy was in my personal space and not leaving. So he said if he doesn't stop that I should come back and order a whiskey lemon and security would be notified, and he would walk me back to my car if I needed it. \n\nWe ended up moving tables and I think he got too drunk to stand up and left not too long after that but I was so relieved to know the bartender was watching out. I'm not one for confrontation and it just feels so much safer to be able to duck out with someone having my back. ",
            "I'm going to ask at work tomorrow if we could install a safeword drink policy at the bar. That would be such a great idea.\n\nEDIT: Wow, RIP my inbox! I suggested it to one of the managers and a couple others today and they like the idea! The next step is getting our general manager to implement it! ",
            "Not exactly a \"safeword\" drink, but some strip clubs will have an \"alcohol free\" code phrase for the dancers that don't want to get hammered and don't want to refuse drinks.  For example, \"with an extra lime wedge\".  The guy still gets charged for a normal drink so he's none the wiser.",
            "Not exactly the question but where I live we once had an epidemic of pick up artists on every corner. There was this one guy who was incredibly persistent and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. When I told him I had a boyfriend he wouldn\u2019t let me leave and said I had to give him one of my friend\u2019s number. Thank god a kind girl noticed what was happening and came up to us while saying, \u201cWell there you are! We have been looking for you! Come on let\u2019s go the show is going to start!\u201d She got me away from him and I was so thankful. To anyone out there please don\u2019t ever do it. It\u2019s such repulsive and scary behaviour.",
            "I'm a straight guy and had a girl rescue me once from an uncomfortable situation. \n\nWas at a bar with a couple of buddies and these two girls sitting in front of us; that none of us were even interested let alone said anything to them at all started trying to chat us all up. When asked what we do for a living I said I was a garbage man and had kids in the hopes that alone would be enough for them to move on; but, unfortunately no. \n\nSo I must have been looking around the bar with the eyes that said \"get me the fuck out of here\" and this nice girl I never met came by and did the \"hey you! I haven't seen you in forever!\" thing and gave me a great big hug which of course I thanked her for. She saw I was super uncomfortable and needed rescuing so she saved me. \n\nI repaid her kindness with drinks and we met up later on for a movie. Since then I've been more aware of the signs and would help a stranger if ever the need presented itself. ",
            "Ehhh this is a \u201cclose but not quite\u201d situation but it may get attention due to the lack of legit responses. \n\n\nA guy I was with was with was SUPER adamant about me keeping up with him slamming drinks.   He would drag me to the bar and order for me, then egg me on to drink faster, etc.  I did NOT want to be drunk with him. \n\n\nHe ordered me a vodka soda and I maintained that *slightly* pained look on my face, hoping to catch the bartenders attention.  When he looked my way, I widened my eyes just a little and subtly shook my head \u201cno\u201d.  \n\nI watched him as he poured me drink by faking the vodka pour and just filling me with what I presume was soda water (not normally my drink of choice so I wasn\u2019t sure what it was - kinda looked like stale Sprite) and he garnished it with a lime and everything.  Said \u201ccheers\u201d when he handed us our drinks.\n\nThis continued for a while until Drunky McSmashypants wanted to leave.  Bartender said to me \u201coh you had asked about seeing Megan, right?!  Yeah she\u2019s in the back, go ahead while he closes out\u201d\n\nI sort of hovered by the restrooms which were tucked away, watched the bartender BS with the dude for a while, and he eventually left lookin all annoyed.  When the coast was clear, I came out, said my thank yous, and he said \u201canytime, happens more than we care to admit\u201d so I thought it was pretty cool that the bartenders were aware enough to pick up on the little signs and help a sister out.  I guess during their conversation he basically convinced the dude that I didn\u2019t seem into it and he thought he saw me leave already.  Drunk dude was druuuuuunk so I guess he bought it without further intervention necessary. ",

Store did a lot of sponsorship, charities, community outreach etc and in particular was a partner with a women's advocacy group. \n\nThere was a product in the store that was never ever put on sale so that if any employee was asked what the sale price on that item was then one employee would distract the guy with customer service while she was \"shown\" to the product she was looking for (ie brought to the store office by way of the backroom)",

            "Well.  This doesn't really answer your question but nobody else is answering either so...\n\nOne time I was dancing at a gay club and this guy (I'm a gal) kept following me around the dance floor.  He'd work his way up to me, start grinding, put his hands where they weren't wanted, try to get himself pressed up against me, etc, and when I moved to a different part of the dance floor, he'd show up a few minutes later doing ther same thing again.\n\nAnyway we go through this three or four times and all of the sudden these two great big fuckers in fursuits (one skunk, one bunny) appear out of nowhere, greeted me with these grand courtly bows, and offered to dance.  Although bemused, I took their paws, and they lead me in this dorky ass square dance that had these 200lb masses of fur and sweat stomping circles around me and deterring anyone else from getting too near.   A few songs later, they bowed again and scampered off and I never saw the grotey guy again.  I did wave to the furries several times that night.  Nice fellas.\n\nCool thing is that wasn't even the first or last time that furries, leathermen, and fat guys in cupcake themed lingerie have swooped in to help out when somebody's creeping on me.  It's just the weirdest.   But I guess I'm not surprised that the kinkiest fucks are also the first guys to take action to stop sexual harassment. They're pretty brave already. \n\n\n",
            "This isn\u2019t exactly a bar story, but a bus story with a bartender. It happened back when I was in uni, I had to rush back home for a family emergency and the cheapest and fastest option was a greyhound bus that departed at midnight. It was a 4 and 1/2 hour drive from point A to point B downtown...anyways I sat alone, the bus wasn\u2019t very full. I fell asleep about an hour into the ride and woke up to a man in the seat next to me with his arm around my waist and head on my shoulder. I was creeped out but also afraid to make a scene in the middle of the night where I thought only the driver was awake at this time. I asked him what he was doing and to get off me. I was in the window seat and felt trapped and frozen, he tried to make small talk with me, saying I looked cold and needed a warm hard body. He said when we arrived that we should grab a coffee because he sensed a vibe between us (WTF?!) I kept recoiling and I remember telling him that I\u2019m very uncomfortable and that he should go back to his seat. In response to my request, he said not before I get something and he tried to kiss me. I pulled back so hard that I hit my head against the window. \n\nTo make a long story short (sorry for the novel guys), a woman\u2014a complete stranger a few seats behind me comes along and goes, \u201coh my God, I thought it was you I saw boarding the bus. We\u2019ve got some catching up to do girl!\u201d She said, excuse me sir do you mind really loudly to the creep and the bastard got up and went back to his seat. She hugged me and asked if I was okay and said she\u2019d sit with me until we arrived at our stop. I was so glad because I really thought he would\u2019ve followed me when we got off the bus. She told me she worked at a bar and is use to intervening when she senses something isn\u2019t quite right. I couldn\u2019t have thanked her enough. 8 years later and that woman is now one of my best friends.  ",
            "My bar didn't have a safeword drink, but my favorite bartender swooped in more than once and looked after me - even at times when I hadn't asked him to yet.\n\nI remember one time in particular, when I came in with my roommate. She and I were sitting at the bar with our drinks, while a couple guys were sitting on the next two stools. They bought us drinks, so we did the usual polite thing and said thanks, introduced ourselves, etc.\n\nWithin five or ten minutes of starting this conversation, they'd informed us that they were heading to an \"after party\" at their house and a bunch of people would be there - we should come with them. My roommate and I gave each other a \"Yeah, right\" look and said thank you, but no. \n\nWell, they wouldn't take no for an answer. They just kept right on trying to somehow convince us to leave and get in a car with two strange men to go to a house we'd never been to, and then just trust that it was safe?\n\nAfter a little while, \"my\" bartender came over to us. He didn't say anything to me or to the guys - not a single word. Instead, he leaned on the bar across from us and started to grin. I smiled back, and so did my roommate, and the three of us just kept looking at each other and smiling silently. The guy talking at us slowly got quieter, then stopped talking at all, and then he and his friend walked away. \n\nAs soon as they left, the bartender straightened up and went back to work. \n\nI have a lot of respect for anyone intuitive enough to pick up signals something is wrong *and* confident enough to resolve a potential conflict with so little effort.",
            "The bar I go to regularly doesn\u2019t have a \u2018safe word\u2019 drink, but we do have a drink called the \u2018Lucy Special\u2019. \n\nIf you have men that you notice are trying to buy you a lot of drinks, are sober and make you feel uncomfortable, or if you don\u2019t trust who you are around and want to keep your wits about you, the Lucy special is a glass of ice, soda water and crushed limes.\n\nEdit - A lot of people are commenting saying this IS a safe word drink. My interpretation of a \u2018safe word drink\u2019 was one in which the drink name was actually a code word to get you out of a situation or to get help/emergency services. The purpose of this is to make it seem like you are drinking when you are still sober - but yes, they both keep you safe!",
            "I've experienced the bartender hero before.  Out with a friend in DC.  Guy comes up, stands way too close, introduces himself and shakes my hand WAY to hard and WAY too long - i had to actually pull my hand away and he kept the grip.  I politely told him i was visiting a friend I hadn't seen in a while and wanted to spend my time with her and turned my back.  He kept standing there, trying to talk to me.  I again, but more firmly, told him I wasn't interested - he stayed.  He orders another drink and the bartender serves him - all the way at the other end of the bar.  Actually showed him his drink and said it will be over here and walked it as far away from us as he could.  I thought that was brilliant - he got a very very good tip from us.  \n\nEDIT - so many of you have asked - the bar was the Dubliner in DC near Capitol Hill.  If you haven't been there go - not just because of the intuitive and smart bartenders but for the Smithwicks and Guinness burgers.  With that one exception I've met a ton of cool people there.",

I make eye contact with the bartender behind me and mouth \"help\" She came right over and asked if I had been in recently because theres a scarf in lost and found that might belong to me.

She excused herself to te restroom and was in the middle of climbing onto a sink to get out the window when a server looked in, asked if she needed help sneaking out, and walked her through the kitchen and out the back door.

While we didn't have a secret drink, if a guy ordered a drink for the lady, and she seemed uncomfortable or really drunk, we'd address the lady and say, \"what would you like miss?\" This usually gave the woman a chance to signal how she felt about the guy, and we'd alert the bouncer.\n\nOne night a woman that was visibly intoxicated to the point of passing stumbled up to the bar. A guy that seemed to be forcing conversation with her approached the bar right behind her. He came out of nowhere and seemed almost sober. He ordered shots for him and the lady, so I turned to her and said, \"what would you like miss?\" She blurted out, \"not this fucking loser\". Me and her started talking until the guy got visibly upset and left with his single shot in a plastic cup. As soon as he was out of eye sight, the woman straightened up and said, \"thanks.

He showed up smashed, and then he proceeded to order a huge bottle of sake and poured us both glass after glass while we were waiting for the food.

I was way out of my comfort zone, almost entirely alone at this place at like 1 or 2am, and hadn\u2019t even received the food. I was panicking because I knew I\u2019d get too drunk to comfortably leave if I kept up with the drinks he was pouring. \nWe had a tea pitcher at the table, so I started dumping the shots into the pitcher when he would look away. Our server saw me and made eye contact, and he started coming to the table a lot to stand between us and pick up dishes.

            "Not a safeword, but Ive had to discreetly ask a bartender to help me get out of a bad situation while the guy was in the bathroom once.\n\nI was waiting for the EL at the Diversey stop in Chicago around 10 pm on a weeknight back in 2013ish. Phone battery is dead.  I get up to the platform and there's a guy on the phone ranting and crying. He looks like an aging punk rocker (dunno how else to describe it, but he was wearing a jacket with patches and chains etc, and looked to be in mid to late 30s) and seems tweaked out with his movements and expressions. We are the only 2 people up there with no train in sight, so I try to keep my distance. After 10 min or so, I see the train and the guy moves towards me, still crying and now ranting to me. Sounds like he got dumped. I said I was sorry.\n\nHe asks if I can go somewhere and talk to him. I said I'm sorry, but I need to go home.  The train is getting closer. He starts begging me to go somewhere with him to talk, and I say no, I really need to go home. Just before the train comes in, he leans in and says \"I can fucking kill you\" and kind of laughed. I felt he was strongly implying he'd push me into the train, but part of me wanted to believe he was making a bad joke. I said \"ok lets go to X bar\" that was very close to the train. I figured I'd be safer at street level and at a bar, so I went in and tried to act normal. \n\nThe guy immediately starts shooting hard liquor and was behaving extremely fidgety and jittery. It was like he was going out of his way to say things to make me feel uncomfortable and nervous. He wanted to play like weird psychological games that were meant to make me feel like he \"knew\" me better than I knew myself.  It felt like a control tactic. I dont know how else to explain it. I wont get into every detail, but for example,  I tried to pretend I was getting a phone call, and he told me he knew I wasnt and pushed my phone down. He then went on to tell me how he used to be an attorney, but was disbarred because he killed someone (I told him I was an attorney, which was true, and he definitely spoke easily about some things about attorneys that an average person would not have known, making me wonder how he knew that stuff ). He asked if I wanted to know how he killed the guy and I said no, that I was sure it was deserved or self defense and that shit happens. NBD. I just tried to downplay it. Make it seem like I thought he was normal and that I sympathized with him.\n\nHe pulled out his hand, made a gun with it, pointed it at me and said, \"I shot him.\" I again tried to downplay it. He then shouts \"JUST KIDDING!\" But just as I was feeling slighty relieved,  he jumps in and says \"actually, I smashed his head into a table\" and then kind of demonstrated how he did it and the circumstances behind it. So yea, the just kidding wasnt that he was kidding about killing someone;  he was kidding about how he did it. I downplayed it again. At some point, for some reason, he gave me his full name. \n\nHe finally gets up to use the bathroom and I ran to the bartender and just said \"I dont have time to explain, but I need you to help me get out of this.  Please hail a cab and make sure I get in it.\" Guy had been very weird and aggressive with thr the bartender earlier, so I felt like he wouldn't doubt me. He comes out of the bathroom and sees me talking to bartender and starts getting even weirder and now possessive.  I say I need to go, while the bartender (huge guy) sort of gets between us and says \"ok time to go home buddy.\" Guy follows me outside screaming at me telling me he I'll regret this etc. He tries to follow me into my cab, while bartender holds him back until I take off. \n\nWhen I got home, I was extremely shaken and googled his name and found his mugshot. I don't think it was for murder, but it was definitely him, as he was pretty distinctive looking. \n\nMy husband encouraged me to report it to the police, but I had a work trip early the next day. I asked a colleage who is a former chicago cop whether I should have reported it,  and he shrugged it off and told me that since I willingly went with him, it would look bad for me.\n\nTldr: had to ask bartender to help me out after being quasi-kidnapped at the EL by a tweaker who threatened me and told me that he'd killed someone before.\n",

A girl who had been near me and S.O for part of the night noticed and instantly came over and said \u201clet\u2019s dance!\u201d. We stepped off to the side and she told me she thought I was uncomfortable and that I might need a save until my S.O comes back.

It was a blind date set up by someone I\u2019m no longer friends with, and the date seemed like a fairly normal douchebag frat guy. I don\u2019t like guys like that, so I was already planning on leaving early. Anyway, he talked about himself almost non-stop, and every couple of minutes or so, he\u2019d mumble something quietly and get a weird look on his face. I couldn\u2019t understand/hear him when he mumbled, and I almost never got the chance to ask him to repeat himself, and when I did, he\u2019d ignore me. Eventually, I actually understood one of the things he said. He mumbled, \u201cYour skin would look better on my wall.\u201d I went to the bar, ordered a Paladin Hard Lemonade no ice, and I was escorted to my car.\n\nSecond story happened in my late 20s. I had a scarf wrapped around my head, since I was bald from chemo and got cold easily. I was on a blind dinner date at a nice restaurant that also had a bar counter. My date seemed really freaked out when he saw me, and I couldn\u2019t figure out why. After a few minutes of him being very on edge and me awkwardly trying to make small talk, he gets up and goes to the bar. He disappears with a waiter for a few minutes, and the next thing I know, a bunch of cops come in and I get handcuffed. It turns out he\u2019s got a phobia of Islam, he thought I was wearing a hijab, and the police were called because I was a terrorist who informed him of a plot to blow up a shopping mall.

One Friday night about an hour before last call, I see this extremely drunk girl (could barely stand) being ushered out of the bar by a group of 7-8 dudes. I had been working the door all night so I remember\nher coming in earlier and she was not with these guys. \n\nI did not like how drunk she was and the guys came across as \u201chungry\u201d around her. So, cuz I\u2019m a confrontational asshole, I pull her away from the guys and ask her if she knows them. She couldn\u2019t even answer coherently. I tell the guys she\u2019s not leaving with them, and they bitched and moaned but they left without further issue. I didn\u2019t even trust a taxi to take this girl home given how intoxicated she was. So, after about 12 minutes of trying to get the right phone number from her, I called the girl\u2019s mother to come get her. The mom was great and was there quickly and took the girl home.\n\nThe next weekend, in the early evening hours before the bar became a scene, this girl and her mom both come to the door and thank me in person for helping her out.

We had every shape and size males, from a huge Samoan, a scrappy Salvadoran, and a bunch of capable white and black dudes.

The one I was at for the longest was often referred to as having \"the best looking staff in the city\" (I was not included in that grouping) so we had this issue come up a lot with our staff actually.\n\nBeing the security manager there I decided we needed a \"safeword\" to make sure no customer took it too far (previous incidents). One of the servers decided on \"Domino's\" (ex. Hey wanna get Domino's after work?) since we could play it off. If they said it to me I would come in & play the 5-minute boyfriend or remove the offending party if it got too egregious. Only happened a couple times but always fun! After the bar shut down we all scattered around the city but still keep in touch.\n\nOne night I was working at a bar on one end of the city & the same server was now a bartender at a bar on the other. I get a text from her that just says \"Domino's.\" Obviously I can't get there & I let her know this & ask what's going on. She explains there's a creepy guy at her bar & its only him & her in the building & he's getting more aggressive & everything short of begging me to get there. Thankfully there's a bar I used to work at about a block away from her so I was able to text one of the guys there to see if he can go check on her. He was the first person that came to mind once I realized I couldn't personally help so it was nice he was so close.

I ran a downtown 3 story bar that was packed all the time. The safe word is a good thing. I've had many girls come to the bar looking for help out of a situation. I've had to get guys bounced out, I've had to pull guys aside and tell them to chill the fuck out. I've cut many people off for being too wasted in my opinion.  A young lady came up to me one packed weekend night. Apparently 3 guys were following her and constantly saying things to her and you could tell she just wanted to cry & get away. She had that look and she ordered the highest level safe drink \"a Hulk straight-up\" and right at that time the 3 guys come up and one said he'd pay for her drink while the other started rubbing on her shoulders. Man, when I saw that, I alerted security & jumped over the bar and grabbed 2 of the guys. By that time 4 bouncers were there helping and they were all 3 promptly taken out a side exit to the alley. Later the young lady explained how they followed her to 3 different bars, tried groping her on the dance floor & consistently hit on her trying to get her back to their hotel room. She thanked me for jumping into action so quick. Honestly, I don't even remember thinking. I just acted. My gut knew something bad was gonna happen.  I've got many more safe drink stories if anyone wants to hear em. Some crazy, some the usual drunk guy coming on too heavy. Be safe out there, that goes to the guys too.

I went round to the front door and explained the situation to the bouncer, who let me in and walked me round the club trying to find my friends.

            "I was the Kitchen Manager at a neighborhood bar. We had three safe drinks posted in the woman's bathroom. Basically just for severity and such, as some people didn't actually need to be walked to their car or anything, they just wanted help saying no to whoever was annoying them. \n\nOne night there was a home game that was on. That bar gets so packed, people just ended up standing all packed together after the seats fill up. As the game was ending, some people were leaving, and others who were sitting down were starting to close out. \n\nOne woman had ordered the safe drink that basically meant the other person was pretty much getting way too touchy, and she needed help immediately. The bartender immediately went to grab two bouncers. In the span of about ten seconds, the bartender grabbed the mans drink from his hand and the two bouncers picked him up (one by the neck, the other by the legs) and threw (literally) him in the grass outside. The general manager comped both tabs, and then walked the woman to her car with his gun tucked in the back of his pants.",
            "I'd gone out dancing with some friends and got turned around walking to the train station. When I realized my error, I started heading back in the same direction. A man came up behind me, pulled me close to him by putting his arm so tightly around me that I couldn't move away. He then grabbed my butt and asked me how much. I was in jeans and a hoodie (so y'all can stop before you even ask). I locked eyes with a bouncer that I'd passed and said very loudly \"Hey how are you? And broke away while the guy was distracted, to hug said bouncer. The bouncer went with it and invited me inside so I could sit and call for someone to pick me up after asking if I was okay. I've been eternally grateful for that bouncer.\n\nSo no date, just a random asshole on the street and a bouncer who knew what was up and was genuinely concerned. ",

None of my friends knew about it and I was about an hour from home.\n\nWe had some drinks and talked. I automatically didn\u2019t like him, but I wanted to see if I could talk $ with him first. He kept pushing more drinks at me. I ended up getting pretty drunk and he did too. Our server ended up cutting him off. He was getting really aggressive and was making me low-ball offers for sexual stuff. \n\nI was frightened. The manager came over and said, \u201cI think your car is being towed,\u201d to which I responded, \u201cA black Prius?\u201d She nodded.\n\nI walked with her to the front door and she offered me help. They kicked the guy out. He was belligerent. I tipped our server an extra 100%. She also ended up driving me in my car home once her shift ended since I was drunk and so far away.",

She got mad because it's her husband and he doesn't drink but I was just trying to make sure it's fine. That's the only time I didn't have someone appreciate it but if I see a weird situation I try my best to look out for you. I also try to make sure no one drugs your drinks if you're on a date. If you look very messed up after a drink I'm gonna make sure you go home separately. ",
            "Years ago drinking with friends and my now wife at our local bar, two yokels come in and are attracted to my group cus ladies.  They start ordering drinks and generally being creeps, but we\u2019re all drinking on them so ok. Clearly they\u2019re trying to get me pass out drunk being a formidable guy, and the girls drunk to creep.  Their mistake was two fold.  1. They drank every rediculous shot they ordered as well, 2. They came to OUR bar where we\u2019re regulars.\n\nAfter a few our friend behind the bar starts giving the girls water shots for each ordered and they play it off like \u201coooooooh\u201d every time.  \n\nThey order us guys rounds of 151 to really try to finish me off.  I let them drink to be manly men and I simply state \u201c I\u2019m not feeling it\u201d.

I was not close to the deceased but her husband was close friends with my family and the owner of a local bar/restaurant. After the funeral I went with my mom and her boyfriend to that restaurant. Due to the circumstances and because we knew the owner/staff I sat at the bar and drank soda with the adults. I got up to use the the restroom and on the way back a guy stopped me and asked if I wanted a drink, I declined. I tried walking away and he grabbed my hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m Bob.\u201d I released my hand and said \u201cI\u2019m sixteen.\u201d He started asking questions about why I was there and was acting as though I was lying to him. Luckily quite a few people were watching (family included) and I stormed off to my seat. Before I even sat down the bartender and the bouncer were rushing over to Bob and went off on him. It turns out that they didn\u2019t even square up his bill, they just wanted him out of there."

            "Not me but my dad. He got remarried after being divorced for about 5 years. I would have been all for it, but he met this woman in another state on a business trip, and would travel up to see her every weekend after they hit if off. They knew each other for 6 months before getting engaged. The engagement was only for 3 months. My brother and I tried telling him about all the red flags, telling him to take his time. My dad is very well-off financially, and we kept trying to earn him things were moving too quickly, that she was only in it for the money. She moved her whole family from their home town to the city my dad lived in, including their elderly grandmother who needed constant medical supervision. Before they were even married, the pantry was full of Whole Foods brand food instead of the local grocery store, as was tradition. All new furniture, and had the house repainted, all at his bride-to-be's request.\n\nThe marriage lasted all of 2 weeks. Apparently my dad's new bride had the gall to ask my dad to leave everything to her in the will, and write me and my brother out. Only then did he realize she was in it for the money. The next day he had the marriage annulled. \n\nSomeday I would like to know what it's like to fall so completely for someone that I don't recognize they are taking advantage of me. Must feel good for that instant before it all comes crashing down.",
            "When he choked me against a wall at a party. He was mad that I laughed at another guy's joke. People were passing by us but just kinda looked and kept going. \n\nLots of other stuff happened but it took me a while to \"wake up\" and break away. I was in denial for too long.",
            "Back in the early 1980\u2019s, I spent 6 years in the US Navy. In 1986 I was recruited to go into the US Army through a program for technical and intelligence experienced military personnel to become Warrant Officers. All the Navy offered me was sea duty and more sea duty. It looked like a real good deal.\n\nI was engaged to a young lady three years my junior and had a bit more than $20,000 in savings. Everything looked promising with a new career and family life. The wedding went off without a hitch.  I was looking at a vacation of about 3 months between exiting the Navy and entering training for the Army. \n\nIt was when my recruiter contacted me over my security clearance that things went south.  My credit report did not match my questionnaire. There was three credit cards with a $14,000 balance I didn\u2019t mention. It was no big deal, they weren\u2019t delinquent, but I needed to amend my answers to account for them.  \n\nTurns out my wife had opened up a charge card at our bank, then got a couple of store cards around town. She had purchased some serious clothes and jewelry, but the real kicker was she had bought a horse.  She had taken lessons as a child and decided this was going to be her new thing. There was the price of the animal, riding gear, saddle and tack, vet bills, stable fees, yadda yadda yadda.  I ended up dumping a big chunk of my savings into paying down these cards, then amending my questionnaire responses. \n\nShe was from a very blue collar family. They were very good people who worked hard for everything they had. But I don\u2019t think, credit ratings and compounded interest rates were much discussed at the dinner table. So I explained about credit cards, the huge interest rate, how long it would take to pay one down, then about security clearances and having a huge debt with no job would affect it. \n\nI treated this all as a bump in our relationship, but thing got dark really fast.  My ship date was coming up and things had to be done before I started training.  I was in good physical shape, but I was facing Boot camp, AIT, Airborne school, ranger school, warrant officer selection and advance training... basically 18 months of utter insanity.  I was prepared for what I faced, but there was a lot that could go wrong.  If I got through it, I was a Warrant Officer. But if I dropped the ball along the way, I would not only be enlisted, but junior enlisted in a job they would decide for me.  In theory, I could end up a line cook in some chow hall at Camp NoWhere. \n\nAbout a week later, the phone rings. It\u2019s about the horse. No one was taking care of the animal or cleaning the stable, or even feeding the poor thing.  The stable had covered down for the sake of the animal, but now were charging $350 a week for the extra services my wife was supposed to be doing.  She was leaving our apartment every day, and I assumed it was for riding and care of the animal, and for the first week she was. The second week, she was lawyer shopping. She wanted out. She must have gotten wind of what happened at the stable and didn\u2019t come home that night. The next day I got served with papers.\n\nTotal marriage time; 47 days.\n\nSo I ended up with an apartment with four months on the lease, no car and a horse. I found a new home for the horse. I had to defer my ship date and it took 14 months to settle the divorce.  My security clearance was approved two days after the papers were filed. I shipped the next day. \n\nIn the end, I had two pair of pants, three shirts and a pair of shoe that had no business on anyones feet.  I was working 2 minimum wage jobs, 14 hours a day, paying down debt, lawyers fees, rent and sometimes eating to get by.  \n\nI ended up at Fort Sill, Oklahoma mowing lawns for two months as I shipped without a training slot for boot camp.   I wasn\u2019t happy, but I was relieved. \n\nIn Airborne school, I met a ROTC cadet who was going to Airborne school over her summer break. She had a year to go before her commission and we hit it off. We\u2019d get together on holidays, between training, long weekends. When I finished training and got my warrant, still a cadet, she flew across the country to give me my first salute. I gave her a silver dollar as per tradition. Two months later, she received her commission, to which I saluted her, and returned the silver dollar. Married that Christmas.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together 31 years.",

We had a house we loved, a dog we loved, jobs we both loved working in...or so I thought. Married in October. \n\nShe goes to visit her sister over the next Labor Day weekend and I can\u2019t attend due to work. Comes back the Tuesday after Labor Day and tells me she\u2019s living a lie and someone else\u2019s dream and she needs a divorce. I had no idea. \n\nDivorce finalized in January.

We seriously argued over this for a good hour and she refused to even go into the pool with me because of sunscreen chemicals.\n\nAfter a scuba adventure with her she could hardly walk because she got so burnt on her legs whereas my skin didn\u2019t change.  \n\nShe then tried to convince me that it was all my fault because I didn\u2019t force her to wear the sunscreen and that the honeymoon was ruined. \n\nIt was then I realized I picked the wrong person.  After a few more psycho arguments (mad at me because of something in her dreams, mad because I didn\u2019t remind her to bring an umbrella....) \n\nI had to call it quits.

            "I had been fooling around with this girl for awhile. I never wanted anything serious, and I KNEW that from the start. Then my mom was killed...I went into a deep depression and this girl was there for me. Her mom had died of cancer about a year earlier and I guess we really bonded over that. It pushed us much further emotionally than we ever should\u2019ve gone. We ended up doing a courthouse marriage. I knew within the month that I had fucked up. BUT I didn\u2019t want to just give up and get divorced. Once the emotions of my moms death passed, I realized how toxic she really was. She was an incredibly unstable person and ended up just taking me into an even deeper depression. We divorced about a year ago (after being married for about 10 months), and I was immediately much happier. Marriage shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, but people also shouldn\u2019t force themselves to be in unhealthy relationships. We all make mistakes.

She got sick once and he told her since she didn\u2019t go to the DMV that day she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to a theme park we were planning on going to that weekend. He would demean her whenever she couldn\u2019t get a job or even an interview, and she applied to practically everywhere within a 50 mile radius. He called her stupid in front of me and when I called him out he told me to mind my own business. If he wasn\u2019t twice my size I would have decked him. She left him after about a year cause he\u2019s obviously a raging asshole. When she left he told her she has nowhere to go and if she went to stay with our mom she would just be a burden like me. I was like 19 and in college at the time. He\u2019s a rude fucking dick but at least she got the car and the dog.",

            "Best girlfriend I had to date at the time.  I was in my late 30s had never been married.  Dated about a year.\n\nGot married.  Shortly after she asked to have her name on all of my assets (a few rental houses, current house, and some financial instruments, the cars).  Not a problem as we were married I thought, but on a Wednesday she insisted it be done by that Friday.  I didn't have time to do that because work and a deadline, I could start it the next week I said.\n\nShe pitched a fit and said if I loved her I would do it by Friday.  I found this strange and decided not to start it and see what happened.  She moved out of our bedroom into a guest room.  Got cold around the house, told me she would move back in to our bedroom when I finished getting everything done.\n\nAt this point I thought \"Bullshit\" and told her so.  I went to my family lawyer to seek advice.  She advised me not to put anything in her name at this point.  Gave me the name of a marriage counselor.\n\nShe didn't want to go to counseling, she continued to live in the guest room, I took my lawyer's advice and did nothing about the assets.\n\nThe long and short of it was after 1 year off marriage, when on our anniversary she told me I didn't have her in my heart, I thought to my self, \"this is bullshit.\"\n\nAbout a week after that I told her if this is the way it's going to be, I'm not going to be married like this.  She then told me, \"Ok, so what are you going to give me?\"  Yes ... she said that.\n\nI consulted my lawyer on what a judge would come up with regarding community property for the past year. Number came up to 20g I took that number and added about 20 grand and proposed that to her so we can make it easy.  I was going to spend more than that in lawyers fees if it got ugly.\n\nIt got ugly.\n\nA week later I got served with papers, with all said in the complaint, when added up, she was going after $750k for 1 year of marriage.  1 year of divorce proceedings and 2 years of property settlement proceedings on what should have been a 2-hour problem.\n\nJudgement came, 215 points in the judgement, I owed her what would have been the community property (about 20 grand), but awarded me attorney's fees.  So in net, she owed me about 30 grand and left her to go buy her own car.\n\nTurns out this judge had worked her ass off through school to become a lawyer and the same to become a judge by 40 years old.  I was told by another attorney that normally this judge never gives attorney's fees, but was so pissed off at the gold dig my wife attempted, that she felt it was justified in this case.\n\nEven though I came out OK financially, it was an emotional train wreck to have this happen and go through all that.  It's been 15 years since it happened.  I was not date-able for about 2 years, but now very happy with where I am and who I'm with.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow, this reply to the OP really blew up.  Thanks much for the silver and gold.  These are a first for me. Not sure, how do I find out who gave those to me so I can thank them directly?  I can probably google that. :-)\n\nLots of good comments.  I'm trying to answer each question but might take me a while I'm in SE Asia right now and will be heading to bed soon.  Thanks much for your thoughts.  This happened 15 years ago so I am over the hurt but the thoughts that you have been sending me have been uplifting.\n\nFor the others with the stories similar to mine, and worse, I feel for you, I really do. I don't wish this type of thing on anybody.  Divorce can be nasty and I don't wish it on anyone.  But in the case of damaging relationships, it's a tough but needed remedy.",

She wasn't there when he got home from work, which was very odd for her since she got off work earlier than him and was *always* home when he got back. When she got back he mentioned that it was out-of-the-ordinary that she had been out and asked if she went somewhere. He wasn't accusatory, just curious because it never happened, but she dodged his questions at first. Eventually after he got suspicious of her dodging a simple question, she admitted that she'd quit her job, and when he asked why, she said she didn't need to work. So she was planning on using him as her cash cow. He doesn't remember how the conversation went exactly since it was 30 years ago. He tried counselling and asked her to get her job back but she always brushed him off and never took him seriously.

They both had fast moving careers, and while he was ok with her making money and having a career, he also expected her to cook, clean, take care of the dogs, etc. and never lifted a finger. He would just come home and pound drinks until dinner time.",

Here is the answer:\n\nI felt worthless.\n\nSo when you grow up feeling worthless, and a partner says \u201cYeah, you are worthless, and everyone can see that, but you know what? I will love you anyway.\u201d  You jump on that shit like it\u2019s the last living plant in a nuclear wasteland.\n\nI didn\u2019t leave because i honestly believed it was either him or suicide. I left because he was killing me anyway and I decided it would be less painful to just die on my own. Then I lived.\n\nI hear this question a lot. If you ask someone why they stay, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand the trauma they are experiencing. That means you are lucky, in that regard.\n\nBe careful with this shaming question. It is a part of our trauma.",

It started emotionally before I married him. Then by about 6 months in the physical abuse had started. Shortly after, it progressed to sexual abuse as well. Long story short, a close friend saw some bruising. She was concerned and went to my parents. My dad confronted my ex and basically forced me to leave with them. At the time, I was so brain washed I didn\u2019t get it. It\u2019s scary to look back on how out of it I truly was during that period of time. It almost feels like I was an observer of my own life. 7 years and a lot of therapy later, I am in a much healthier place and in a happy, healthy relationship.",

It was not a pleasant time for me....\n\nEDIT:  Holy crap, woke up to an awful lot of really nice notes!  Thank you everyone and to those who gifted silver and gold!  I am going to try to respond directly to some folks but I will say this here:  This happened about 25 years ago (yes, I am an old guy).  It really sucked at the time ... the day I found out I was a few months into both a major surgery and then daily radiation treatment, I was down to about 118 from my normal 155lbs.  But, as it turned out, it was really a good thing.  We did not have a house or kids and the divorce was rather simple.  I went on to get married again and have 3 incredible kids I would never have had otherwise.  The entire experience taught me a lot about the power of forgiveness (admittedly, it took me too long to learn this lesson) and I have a pretty great life today.  If you are currently going through something similar, please know that life can and does get better!  :)  Thank you all again and, while I watched Breaking Bad, I really never made the connection to me so many of these comments have me laughing out loud!\n\nEDIT #2:  So we tried the whole marriage counseling thing after I caught her.  The marriage counselor, however, was my wife's personal therapist.  We had one meeting and the therapist asked to meet with me privately.  She subsequently reported to my wife \"Um, Nika seems to have a lot of anger.....\"  Ya think!

            "Now that I\u2019m an adult I realize just how wonderful my father really is. Not just in comparison to others but he is an objectively amazing father. He taught us children the hard life lessons while still protecting us. He taught us to be self sufficient and independent. He taught us to work hard and don\u2019t give up just because things get challenging. He busted his ass to make sure we got to go on vacation and experience life. He taught me to hunt, fish, and fix a car. He also taught me to garden and grow my own vegetables. How to take care of livestock and other animals with compassion. \n\nHowever, he also treated me more like a son than a daughter. I only wish that my father would\u2019ve acknowledged that I\u2019m a girl and it\u2019s okay for me to like dressing up and that it\u2019s okay to \u201cthrow like a girl\u201d. Granted, I got a full ride to college for sports and that\u2019s partly because I had to hang with the boys and my dad didn\u2019t want me to be a great female player but just a great player in general. I think he messed me up only in the sense that it\u2019s extremely difficult for me to date. I\u2019m either too intimidating to strangers or \u201cone of the boys\u201d to people I know. I think I lost my feminine side because I am so close to my dad and he was slightly dismissive of my emotional side. I had to be tough and stoic. \n\nI suppose I shouldn\u2019t complain; I just feel like if my dad were less of a hard ass and treated me more like a daughter than a son I would fit in more. Maybe be able to get a date instead of always just being a \u201cbro\u201d. That being said I am thankful for the life skills he provided and the protective eye he still has watching over his baby girl.  [26yo F]\n\n\n\nEdit: news update; got a lot of confidence from all the positivity and now I\u2019ve got a date coming up with a guy who doesn\u2019t know me or my \u201cbros\u201d and I get to make an actual first impression without being seen as one of the boys beforehand. Wish me luck! He seems kind and intelligent; I\u2019m really excited to see what happens! Even if it\u2019s a flop it\u2019s a good step out of my passive ways!",
            "My dad actually was an amazing man and I think very special as a dad. He really encouraged our independence and our want to learn about anything and everything, which i think a lot of dads forget to do. He focused a lot on education and as a result my brothers and I were reading very, very early which helped us be interested in things like the science museum and the zoo and any sort of science program on tv. \n\nHe used to just let us run crazy as kids because he knew how important it was for us to savor actually being kids. When I was little I made a mud pit in the backyard. We had a hole that our Weimaraner dug and it got filled with water so 3 year old me thought it would make the perfect mud pit. After about half an hour of playing by myself my dad came outside and saw me, naked, covered in mud, in the pit. Where other parents probably would have been pissed, he laughed and grabbed the camera. \n\nAs we got older he encouraged our independence and hobbies. For my brothers it was gaming, and thy made a lifelong career from their interest in gaming. For me it was theatre, then science, and eventually Wildlife. My dad wanted to be a biologist but never had the drive or money to finish college, so I used to teach him all about genetics and about how the phylogenetic trees of various organisms had changed. He knew a lot, but wanted to know all about how science had changed and what the new concepts were. He outfitted me with field gear and when we would go camping or hiking together, we\u2019d rock flip and look for herpetofauna. He helped me with a plant project a few years ago and that was probably the most fun we had. \n\nHe just never discouraged our interests and passions which is so important. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t really have a point anymore, I think I just needed to write this out. My dad died three weeks ago very unexpectedly and no man on earth could rival how amazing he was. He truly is responsible for our independence and wonder of the world and I think more dads need to be like him. \n\nDads: let your daughters (and sons) learn freedom. Let them explore the world and make an effort to be interested in their interests no matter how weird or dumb you think they might be. Let your kids be kids and do dumb things sometimes. Also, always let your daughter know that you have her back. Whaatever stulid decision she makes, trouble she runs into, dumb man she dates or gets involved with - you\u2019ve got her and you\u2019ll be there for her when things fall apart. My dad was so good about that. ",
            "That it's great you're extending the offer to spend time together, but when you invite your kid to the garage to help with something, actually have them help with something. \n\nFor context, my dad would be working on his boat engine or something, and he'd say come help me with this, and then I'd sit on a bucket for 20 minutes watching him in silence, and finally wander off out of boredom. Looking back, it's great he wanted to spend time with me and I appreciate that, but being present and being involved are two different things.",
            "Treating every boy interested in your daughter as your enemy does both of you a disservice.\n\nMy dad was very over-protective. Any time a boy had a crush on me, he would be immediately added to my dad's shitlist. Even if he was perfectly kind and respectful.\n\nAfter a certain point, I just stopped listening to my dad's complaints. In my eyes, he had lost the right to give input about my relationships.\n\nUnfortunately, when I was 17 I became entangled in an abusive relationship. \n\nMy dad hated the guy. But since he also hated every one of my previous suitors, I didn't interpret his concerns as legitimate. \n\nOn top of that: since he was so busy trying to *prevent* me from having relationships, he never talked to me about what a healthy relationship looks like.",

Encourage open communication about relationships, dating, respect etc. If your daughter is afraid you're going to be \"waiting on the porch with a shotgun\" or you're going to \"read the riot act\" to whomever they bring home, they are more likely to sneak around behind your back.\n\nEDIT: it's not the threat of physical harm that is the issue (most people would likely agree they've heard of version of this and laughed it off as a joke). It's the sense of doubt that it creates in young women. The feeling that they are not capable of making good decisions on their own when it comes to the relationships they choose to persue. We keeps preaching that we want our daughters to feel empowered to make their own choices. It starts by removing the need for them to choose partners that meet your \"approval\". Instead, empower them by teaching them how to navigate relationships, have the tough and uncomfortable conversations - let them make a few \"bad decisions\" so they can appreciate and identify what healthy male interaction looks like.\n\n My dad is a great guy!

Being in pain makes you grumpy, but don't write off every instance of anger or bad temper as being 'because you're on your period'. Maybe her mom doesn't get bad ones, maybe you've never thought about it because your wife is a grown woman who has learned to deal with her periods and the assorted mood swings and pains and moved on; your daughter hasn't yet. Be a little more thoughtful, help teach her ways to manage what she's feeling. \n\nIf she's in a lot of pain, and it doesn't change after a while, take her to a doctor. Maybe nothing's wrong and she got shit luck, but she could have endometriosis or cystic ovaries. Stick up for her at the doctor - lots of women have trouble finding doctors who will listen to them about their pain, and it's very hard to advocate for yourself when you're only 14 and throwing up from pain.

            "I have the most wonderful father in the world. This post isn't going to be things I wish he knew, but more things he did that were awesome when I was growing up since I'm seeing a lot of daddies with little girls commenting that they're reading this post. \n\nMy dad never hesitated to do \"girly\" things with me. He was the one who took me school shopping (we would often hit Starbucks and then pick up chocolate covered strawberries afterwards). He would fix my hair for school and paint my nails for me. I remember wanting a head full of tiny braids (this was the 90s) and he spent hours of his Saturday afternoon braiding. We played with Barbies and he actually came up with storylines for them and put effort into it. On the other hand, he also never kept me from doing \"tomboy\" things. I raised baby calves, helped him wash cars, and worked on the lawnmower.\n\nWhen I was little we had \"Daddy-Daughter\" dates where we would go to Chuck-E-Cheese or mini-golfing. When I was in middle school and high school we would go to the pool together and lay out and talk. A few years ago we got tickets to see Miley Cyrus' Bangerz tour and got drunk together and had the best time.\n\nHe was always patient with anything regarding my self-esteem. He helped me lose weight when I was in middle school and waited for hours for me to get ready before we went somewhere, and never, ever commented on anything other than to compliment me.  \n\nThe biggest thing I think that he did (and still does) is to encourage my independence. He helped me through school and constantly reminds me that I am a strong woman and that I don't ever have to get married if I don't want to (my mother used to put a lot of pressure on me to \"settle down\"). He is my friend along with being my dad. I'm forever thankful for him. \n\n**EDIT**: MY FIRST GOLD! Thank you! Was not expecting that. And thank you all for the comments. I'm going to send my Dad this post so he can see what an awesome response it got and how special he really is. I truly am incredibly lucky to have him and I recognize that. I already tell him how much I appreciate him all the time and my first big tattoo was a portrait of us together but I think he will really love seeing this!

The problem she's sobbing about, whether its a boy or a fight with a friend or whatever, may seem trival or silly to you but she those feelings are so important to her right now. In ten years you can tease her about Jimmy from science class who she thought liked her but ended up asking her friend Alice to the dance. Now is not the time. Don't belittle her about it. Listen to her, ask her questions, learn about her life. It may seem boring to you but my dad listened to me, he remembered my friends names and would ask me about them. He asked me seriously about what I wanted form the future. And you know what, I'm 25 now and I still confide in my father. He calls me just to chat and I tell him about my feelings and I ask him about his. It only takes one mean joke to put that wall up and it is hella hard to take down. \n\nEdit: Yes, this certainly applies to sons as well. And other relationships too. Treat people's feelings as valid. \n\nOther Edit: What I think a lot of people are missing is that this does not mean you let your child throw tantrums in public or break things because they are upset. By all means please teach your child healthy ways to cope with their feelings. But don't tell them they shouldn't feel their emotions. To shut it down the way they feel. That they are 'babyish' or 'immature' for crying about something. The rest of the world is going to do it's damndest to make kids hard, to tell them to get over it. Don't be that.

He never wanted us (three daughters) to complain about our periods or use having cramps as an excuse to stay home from school because millions of women had their period every day and they were able to go to school, work, etc. I thought my debilitating periods and unbearable cramps were normal and I needed to just suck it up. Except as adults my sisters and I all discovered individually that our periods are not normal. In fact, we have endometriosis which not only left us in terrible pain each month, but also eroded our fertility month by month. Taught to shut up and bear it, none of us talked to our gynecologists about our terrible period symptoms and never sought birth control to help mitigate the damage done to our bodies. Now, two out of three of us have had to go through IVF to have children. My youngest sister assumes she will have to go through the same if she ever chooses to have kids. After my diagnosis and fertility treatments, i was able to get on hormonal birth control to help manage the pain. If I\u2019d talk to my gyno much earlier and gotten on BC, I could have been living pain-free and possibly preserved my fertility.

I'm so glad you taught me.\n\n* Thank you for bailing me out when I was in a pinch, no questions asked. No guilting, no attempts at squeezing out information.

You don't deflect back on me and pull the, \"I'm the parent and know better than you\" spiel. \n\n* You actually took the time to sit and watch my cartoons or (attempt) to understand my video games or other hobbies. Mom always turned up her nose. You didn't. Do you know how awesome it is to watch your Dad actually laugh at the cartoon your mother just dismissed as \"dumb\" minutes before? So gratifying.\n\n* All those times you went shopping for groceries and picked up ladies sanitary supplies without any hesitation, even if you did affectionately rename the long super maxi pads, \"low-salt maxis.\"\n\n* Thank you for all those secret times you let me pick something out of the vending machine to eat when we were on trips together - you knew Mom would never allow it.\n\n* You take great pride in \"embarrassing me\" - but you know exactly where to draw the line so it's endearingly goofy, not genuinely embarrassing. You know your audience and play to it. I feel no shame when my friends (or now-fiance) are around you.\n\n* It's okay if your hands were too callused to properly tie my ballet skirt before classes. I could tie it myself. But I didn't tell you at the time because I knew it made you happy to help me. So don't be embarrassed because the fabric kept snagging on your calluses.\n\n* I wish you took your dental hygiene more seriously.

Let them be pretty, and tell them they are when they've made an effort to be (\"I can see your dressing up today, you look very pretty\"),  but that should not be your go-to compliment. Praise her accomplishments. Praise her work, praise her intellect, praise her efforts even... dont praise her for something she can't control. This gives her the power to actually improve herself in life, and doesn't make her vulnerable to someone who only flatters her. \n\n2. Teach them how to lose. As much as you never want your kids to come up short, let them. Then show them the way to winning is harder work. They will face loss in their life, whether promotions, sports contests, or even relationships. These will break them if they don't know how to lose. Acknowledge the defeat, validate their feeling of loss, but don't let them give up. Also, make them acknowledge their part in the loss, but don't blame them (they already blame themselves). Then show them the way to get better. This does multiple things. It shows them that a loss doesn't define them, it shows them that winning takes hard work, and it empowers them to decide if they're willing to put in the work it takes to win. \n\n3. Be protective, not restrictive. They learn early that the things they are told to abstain from are actually fun, like eating dessert first. Don't be restrictive by telling them \"Dont drink, no sex, no drugs\". They're going to experiment with these once in their life, so set a goal for them to reach.

Now I have bittersweet memories, and I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world and, though he wasn't perfect, I wouldn't change a single thing about our relationship. Sometimes he just \"didn't get it\" but looking back, he knew much more than I gave him credit for. I watched him learn a few things, and I appreciate him learning for his girls. He tried to do things that we would like...I can't count the times we watched Anne of Green Gables because I wanted to. He would ask me to read to him so he could \"close his eyes\" after a long day (he was definitely sleeping while I read), so he fostered my love for books along with many other things. But my favorite thing he did was listen. He would let me go on and on about the stupid girl in my class who told me my shoes were ugly and once I was finished, he'd give be this look. He'd ask why I thought she said those things and would wait for an answer. He made me look at things from different perspectives. He taught me to empathize, to realize that everyone has something going on in their lives. I only hope that someday I can be as smart as he was, and if I ever have kids, I hope they have a dad half as wonderful.",

            "This one is for my sister, a girl with a fast developing body isn't \"slutty\" just because she has big boobs and hips! I was a skinny bean pole in high school and was allowed to wear whatever I wanted even though I actually was sexually active and a party girl. My poor little sister was shy and studious and my dad wanted her in basically burlap sacks just because she was so shapely. Every shopping trip consisted of me grabbing whatever but she would have to come out and do a 360 in every single outfit for my dick head dad to tell her she looked like a slut and to get baggier clothes. These clothes were just jeans and t shirts that fit perfect but you can't hide d cups, a tiny waist, and big hips. Meanwhile I'm in a tank top because I was shaped like a 13 year old boy. ",
            "No matter how worried you are, never ever read her diary. Ever. \n\nIf there's something that you're worried about, try talking to her, instead. I love my dad but there's a small kernel of resentment about that act, 30 years ago. ",
            "That treating both daughters equally, while wonderful, doesn't mean to buy them exactly the same gift at Christmas and birthdays... Especially when my sister is 6 years older than me. ",

That we're not on our periods constantly and if we're upset about something there may well be a legitimate reason. If you don't want your daughter with the wrong partners and having a bad life? Show her what a good partnership looks like, respect her, show her how a man should treat a woman (or a woman should treat a woman- and if thats what she's into that's what *SHE* is into, you don't have to be into it, just respect it). If you disagree, converse. This is setting the tempo for her entire life, and you could easily be setting her on a pretty nasty course."

            "I grew up with my grandparents bc both my parents had to work various jobs simultaneously, so my grandfather was my world. I took care of him during his last 5 years, when he became bedriden. I tried to visit him as often as I could. He lived with an elderly aunt who fed him, but needed me to bathe him and, eventually, change his diapers and so on. Early in our relationship, my now wife would come over sometimes. One time I got to his house and found his fridge full and him watching Tv, eating a bowl of ice cream. My wife had gone a few hours before me without telling me. 6 months later I proposed.",

He said not to worry about money or anything else besides solving my problem. Fast forward two months and I got a call from my surgeon. Apparently I missed the fact that they did a biopsy when they removed my polyps and found uterine cancer. Had I been stubborn and continued to ignore my miserable periods for years, who knows what could have happened to me. No one expects uterine cancer in someone under 30. He held me while I cried, took me to every appointment, and helped me when I recovered after my hysterectomy. That dude is my rock. ",

            "The last few years before my mother passed away, she had horrible diarrhea & had lost most of her mobility.  So it was not uncommon for her to be unable to make it out of the bed, much less to the bathroom.  Every time this would happen, my old man would get up, get her to the bathroom & cleaned up, then go back into the bedroom, pull the sheets off their bed, put them in the wash, and finish off with putting fresh clean sheets down.  Oh, and he wasn't in much better health himself.  But he never complained.",
            "My boyfriend texted me one day when he was at the gym that he believed his rectum had prolapsed. No idea how, but I started googling what we needed to do about it. I read that if it wasn't serious, you could just push it back in before going to a doctor, instead of heading to the ER. \n\nSo what do I do? Put on a pair of gloves, lube my finger up, and kneel in front of him while he's lying on the bed attempting to push part of his rectum back into his anus. \n\nTurns out it was just a giant fucking hemhorroid when he went to the doctors the next day. But I think that was a moment in our relationship where it was established that we both had complete comfort with each other. If your partner can try and shove part of your rectum up into your ass then nothing is really too disgusting or gross to discuss. ",

I had briefly had a couple small discussions enough that she knew what was happening. But was pretty unsure what to do. \n\nSo he handed her some toilet paper, told her the basic girl trick of putting it in her underwear and took her to the store. He helped her pick out some pads, detoured to the ice cream, chocolate, chips and bakery section and picked up junior Advil just in case. They settled in on the sofa he explained the basics of how to use it. Showed her a quick YouTube video. Made up a hot water bottle for her, popped her dirty clothes on to soak. And they snuggled and she talked about it and they googled answers if he didn\u2019t have them. \n\nI came home to them having a nap on the sofa looking like a slumber party exploded and a happy child. Probably one of the moments I\u2019ve love him the most. \n\nEdit: Holy crap I went to bed and this blew up. I was expecting it to get buried with how busy the thread already was.

My husband always felt so bad for me.  \n\nThen one time, my hubby lifted up a pair of pants out of the box and said happily, \"These will fit you.

            "I had an ingrown hair cyst surgically removed from my butt crack. My SO had to help me stuff new gauze in the 1.5 in hole in my flesh so it could heal properly. I bent over the bed while she removed the gauze used during surgery and she did her best. I ended up having to pull it out myself in the bathroom leaving blood all over the floor and myself. Even after the trauma of trying to remove the first gauze she came back to help me get the new gauze in place after I cleaned up.\n\nWe called it my double butthole.\n\nEdit: Yes it was a pilonidal cyst.

            "During her first pregnancy, my wife vomited brown, congealed blood every night for her entire second trimester. We went to multiple doctors and took a few trips to the E.R., never got a reason why. The vomiting happened every night after midnight, sometimes continuing sporadically for 8 hours. Don't know why, but it never happened during the daytime.\n\nOne night, she thought she was finally doing better, so she went to sleep early and seemed fine. Then suddenly around 1:00 AM, she jolted awake (which instantly woke me) and tried to run to the bathroom to puke, forgetting the puke bucket on her bedside table in her moment of panic. Unfortunately, she slipped and fell on her side (nothing hit her belly) and puked blood all over the carpet. She immediately started sobbing. \n\nThat poor woman went through such a rough time.\n\nSo I carefully picked her up, took her to the bathroom, held her hair back while she finished throwing up, then cleaned her face and got her some water to rinse her mouth out. I carried her to bed and then got to work cleaning up the carpet.\n\nWe were just kids, still in college together. Those three months of misery galvanized our relationship. Nothing serious has ever come between us in the years since.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add, another great side-effect of constantly seeing disgusting fluids erupt out of my wife is that we're both completely comfortable around each other's bodily functions. None of this \"I don't want my husband to know I poop\" nonsense.",
            "We were actually on a romantic getaway weekend in the mountains. I was still breastfeeding at the time. Right as we were getting ready for dinner I had to break it to him that I had a plugged duct and it was threatening to ruin our whole night, if not the whole weekend. I was very uncomfortable and I was worried about getting mastitis. My man went to town on that boob and sucked the plug out. I can\u2019t describe how awkward it is to breastfeed your own husband.

I took time off work most days just to be with him and feed him and give him his meds. I had to convince him that he wouldn't become addicted to morphine since he was actually in hospice so he finally started taking it every time I offered it. My mom (an RN and cancer research nurse for 52 years) couldn't believe how much I stepped up and took over my husband's care. He is the love of my life, all I can do for him is make him comfortable so that was my priority. I am going to do everything in my power to make him comfortable through the end of a fucking asshole of a disease.

I\u2019ve become so good at recognizing how she feels that I know when she\u2019s going to go before she does, and I\u2019ve gotten very good at catching her. It may look unromantic, and it can be.

The surgery site ended up infected, and for about 3 months he would have to stuff the site with gauze so we could allow it to heal from the inside out.

            "I'm prone to developing cysts. Mostly they just hang out, and sometimes go away on their own, but every once in a while one will get infected randomly. I had one such cyst on the back of my neck a few years ago. It was so, so painful, and I was in agony. One day, it just burst open on it's own. I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say, it was really disgusting. My husband is very squeamish about these kinds of things. But without hesitation, he very lovingly made sure that all of the infectious material was purged, cleaned out the crater it left in its wake, and put antibiotic cream on it. He religiously checked and cleaned the wound twice a day until it healed, and would put clean bandages on it as needed. I don't even mind the scar it left, because it reminds me of his TLC, even though I'm 100% sure it grossed him out. ",

My stomach cramps were so unbearable that I could hardly lift my head up, but he carried me in all my mess, helped me to shower, cleaned up my disgusting mess and nursed me back to health.

            "My partner and I went on a trip together in 2017 that ended in Washington, DC. On the last day of our vacation, he got food poisoning...but we didn't realize it until after we'd walked the two miles from the train back to the hotel, by which point I was limping on some pretty bad blisters and just wanted to sit down and elevate my feet. He sat down on the bed to rest and fell asleep before even getting his shoes off, and then I noticed that he had a really high fever. For a little while I tried to just keep a cold cloth on his face and make him drink water, but his fever got so high that he started to hallucinate and at one point he wasn't sure who I was. The ice machine was broken and the manager of the hotel wouldn't help me, but the security guard offered to keep an eye on our room to make sure that my partner didn't wander off if I wanted to go buy some ice and medicine, so I put my shoes back on and limped down the hill back toward the nearest pharmacy. I recall thinking to myself at that moment \"Man, I must really love this guy. If it was just me I'd just suffer.\" Thankfully, I found a little tapas place I hadn't previously noticed on the way there and they were able to give me some ice. When I took my shoes off, my feet were bleeding. I spent all night nursing my partner through the worst case of food poisoning I've ever seen and managed to get us to the airport on time the next day. It was pretty par for the course for that trip (it was our worst vacation ever and we're pretty sure we should just never go back to DC) but at least it's memorable!",

Everyone was already asleep when I started feeling ill.  I vomited once or twice in the toilet and then started the nonstop diarrhea.  I sat there shitting like the world was ending while vomiting into a trash can.  My girlfriend did her best to take care of me when it hit her too.  Luckily I had stopped and so she took her turn evacuating out of both ends.  While I waited for the next wave to come. \n\nThere was only one toilet we could use. \n\nAfter taking turns back and forth a couple times we both realized this wasn\u2019t going to end any time soon and there was going to come a time when we would both have to poop at the same time and honestly neither of us had the strength to hold it back for more than the time it took to make it to the toilet from the bed. \n\nI remember looking at her as we both laid in bed wracked in pain while it felt like something was trying to claw its way out of our bodies. I told her if the time came when we both had to go at the same time I would squat next to her in the bathtub and shit there so she could have the toilet. She told me she loved me and we managed to survive the most horrible night I have ever experienced together. We are now married. \n\n",

Unfortunately this time they needed to go through my femoral artery in my groin and I needed to remain on bedrest for about four hours after the procedure. I had not eaten all day in preparation for the surgery, so when I got out I was famished. The nurse brought me hospital dinner, but I could not sit upright to feed myself. My lovely wife of ten years, who has been a solid rock for me through this ordeal, was excited at the opportunity to feed me. I'm only 32 years old, so being in this predicament and being unable to feed myself was rather humbling. She happily cut my roast beef and potatoes and fed me a bite at a time. You could just tell that she loved being able to serve me in this way. It was not in any way a burden, or a chore, or a nuisance. She didn't take advantage of the situation to make a humiliating \"here comes the airplane\" joke. She just carefully fed me and saw to my needs. I know in her heart she had felt rather useless because all my fear and anxiety was pent up inside. She loved having some way to show that she was there for me in a weak and frankly scary moment of my life. She is much better than I deserve and I am so crazy in love with her. \n\nEdit: My first gold ever! My beautiful wife gets the credit. Thank you! \nEdit 2: Platinum too! Wow!

And since my husband would be at work, I cannot bear having to clean the bucket each time as I will not be able to take the smell of it, and of course i cannot let it just sit and stew close to me until he comes home and cleans it.

            "My freshman year of college, I got mono which turned into viral meningitis and gave me something called Gillian-Barre syndrom (basically I was numb and parylized for about a month). I was stuck in bed in my dorm for a few weeks after I left the hospital. A girl I had only known and been hooking up with for about a month brought me food and talked with me everyday. She also did my laundry. I kept thinking, \"Wow, she is really down for the long haul!\" We have been dating for about two years and are moving in together soon. I love her so much and hope I will be able to return the favor someday.",
            "10 years ago I was set up with a guy through a friend. A bunch of us stayed over at this friend's house because we were running a 5k the next day (and mostly to pre-party). This guy and I flirted all night and decided that we needed to drunk cuddle. Found and airmattress and snuggled. He was legit a nice guy, no expectations of anything from me. At some point in the middle of the night, drunk me managed to get off the airmattress and make it to the bathroom to puke. I made it in time. Whew! Close one.   \n  \nThe next morning I wake up at the buttcrack of dawn for the race. Nice guy starts laughing at me. Apparently, when I came back to bed he asked me if i was alright. I said I puked but I was good. (oversharing is caring?) and he asked if I made it to the toilet. I said no. (Say what?!) He asked where it was and I screamed \"IN THE SINK\" and fell asleep. Nice guy went in the bathroom and sure as hell... Puke in sink. He cleaned it all up for me. Shoved hunks of pizza puke down the drain and everything. He cleaned up sink barf for someone he knew for 4 hours! \n \nWe've been married almost 6 years now. And our code for anytime we need help from each other is \"In the sink.\" Example: \"Hey babe, you need backup putting together the ikea shelving?\" \"Naw, hun, I'm not in the sink yet. I love him.\n\nTl;dr Barfing in sink on a first date not always a deal breaker. ",

He was with me every step of the way. He stayed in the room with me while I held my cat and she was put to sleep. He drove me to get food at 3 am by the time the whole ordeal was over.

So, three days later, there are my husband and I stooped over the toilet sobbing and trying to collect bloody tissue in the collection vial they gave us.

            "My wife has epilepsy, and while it\u2019s under control, she has had numerous nocturnal seizures in my presence. They start with an awful guttural noise, during which she foams at the mouth and breathes wildly while convulsing for a good few minutes. Her eyes point in different directions. She usually loses bladder continence. She\u2019s seriously injured herself a couple times. When she comes out of it, she has no idea what\u2019s going on. As calmly as I can, I have to tell her multiple times that she\u2019s had a seizure; she looks terrified, asks me what happened, I tell her, she looks terrified, asks me again...it\u2019s an awful nightmare. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t know who I am right away. \n\nWe\u2019ve had some very tender moments after her seizures. They\u2019re great reminders of how close we are and how much we care for one another. ",

I ended up on blood thinners because I had 2 pulmonary embolisms and nearly died. I rarely see my husband cry, or even show fear, and I will never forget the look he had the night we found out how close I was to dying. He slept next to me in a chair and held my hand. I was too scared to sleep, for fear I\u2019d die in my sleep, that I just stared at him and cried. We\u2019re planning on having baby #2 this year and I\u2019ll be taking lovenox again, so he has the \u201cjoy\u201d of giving me 2 shots a day again.

We had just spent a night together in a hotel room (both live with family so sex can be difficult), and I was putting on jeans to go out, I tripped over them and a bunch of change fell out of my pockets, he jokingly launched across the bed to grab and laughed so hard he farted.

They don\u2019t stitch infected wounds cause they want them to heel from the inside out as to not trap any residual infection. So they kept me about a week and daily they would have to come in and remove the cause that was stuffed in there rinse it out and re stuff it. After a week I got released and had to go to wound care daily. Then they changed it to every other day and my wife had to change it on the off days and she never hesitated or acted grossed out. She just did it and never complained. It was extremely painful btw. \n\nAlso when we first started dating. We decided to hotbox a bong under the covers together.

We got to put swamp mud on our faces and sunburns!! How cool was that!! \n\n\nA year later, I\u2019m in the same vacation place with my family and boyfriend. No one wants to do the kayak tour with me except him, and honestly, he could\u2019ve done with reading a book on the ecosystem instead of kayaking through it.

He convinces these people to take us on a tour of the swamp (that he doesn\u2019t want to go into) and gets into a kayak (that he\u2019s very unsure about) in the rain so that I can learn more about crabs and mud. \n\n\nHe did end up having fun and we did learn a lot!

In the middle of the night, I woke up in a different bed with her father. I was so confused, but he explained that she had a temper tantrum and her mom went to sleep in her bed with her so they moved me to the guest room. I was young and didn\u2019t understand that\u2019s not normal that he was sleeping in the same bed as me, just him and me. I told my parents when I went home the next day and they were EXTREMELY concerned asking me if he touched me, etc. I was highly confused because my pure innocent mind didn\u2019t understand the concept of that lol. Now as an adult I\u2019m like, why didn\u2019t they just move me to the other room, why did the dad have to get in bed with me? Lol.

            "Here's an \"I was that family\" story.  My Godmother (who was practically an aunt) ran a fairly successful daycare out of her home in the 90s.  She was a first generation immigrant to the US, whose parents came to the New England area from Ireland.  My two younger brothers and I spent a lot of time at her home and I was generally the oldest child there. \n\nWhen I was about 8 years old, she started to have me make her her favorite drink. Gin and tonic. She drank these ALL DAY, while running her home daycare.  At age 8 I knew...how to mix cocktails, that forks were better for stirring than spoons, and that large plastic bottles of gin were cheap and low quality.  \n\nThis went on for years, on pretty much a daily basis, until my family moved out west.   My Godmother kept her daycare running until she died (I'm sure of health problems relating to alcohol).  I was 15 when she passed and I'm in my 30's now. I honestly went most of my life thinking NOTHING of it until I became a father a couple of years ago.   At which point I was like... \"How the fuck did anyone let her have a daycare?\"  \n\nSide note, I drink but would consider myself an average drinker, if not below average.  With that being said, I could never stomach the thought of gin and didn't try gin until I was 30. This was because I once licked my finger, early in my daycare bartending career, after a couple of drops of gin splashed on my hand as I was pouring.  That plastic-half-gallon quality gin was the worst thing I'd ever had in my life and I had no idea how my Godmother liked it so much.  Complete ruined my taste for gin...at 8.",

I jumped up, a bit panicked, trying to get the guy's attention to what just happened. The guy didn't even look up when he said \"Oh yeah, she does that sometimes\" and that was it. I asked him if there was a towel and disinfectant I could use to help clean it up and the guy says \"I'll just throw some Febreez on it after dinner\". I suddenly realized the musty smell I noticed earlier wasn't from his cool and rustic cabin being under a canopy of trees, or that the floor in the same location that bowed when you stepped over it was because it was old. \n\nAte dinner at a table that was couple feet away from the dog toilet.

I was facing away from the door, laying on my side. I hear the door creak...some footsteps and then the darkness of the room lit with a sudden flash. I got up just in time to see the door close. I know it was her mom taking pics of us. The weirdest part to me is that it was about 3am when that happened...meaning the girl's mom either had an alarm or just stayed up that late in wait....",

            "So when I younger my dad died. My mom remarried and had two kids. I was moved into the basement. Unfinished basement. I didn\u2019t think anything of it since I was 10. I had a sheet blocking my area from the laundry area. It had bare concrete walls, wood beams and piping across the ceiling and cement flooring. Used a heater and dehumidifier cause it was cold and humid. When I used the heater my parents would make my sheeted area around my bed so it would heat up the space quicker. Parents didn\u2019t allow any of my friends over and my brother and sister weren\u2019t allowed in my room. Distant family members also never stayed over and when we had family gathering, I was told to go into the guest room instead of my room while they were there. I thought cool, I have a huge room and no one can mess it up. My family would go on vacations yearly without me from when I was 12 till I was 18. I was the dog and house watcher. During one of those vacations when I was 17 I invited a friend come over. They pointed out how fucked up it was that there were bedrooms fully furnished with TVs for my brother and sister, a guest room fully furnished as well with a tv, and how I was in the basement with sheets for walls and bathroom mats on the floor. I completely dismissed it cause it was normal to me. It wasn\u2019t till I was 20 that I found out that the family trips that I didn\u2019t go on were paid for with money that I was getting from my dad passing away. I\u2019m sure I got some of the money in food and clothes and whatever I needed. But it\u2019s got me pretty fucked up cause my brother and sister don\u2019t have any memory of it and when I talk about it they always back my parents by saying we were raised right and I opted out of vacations. They also thought the guest room was my room.\n\nAdd-on. I just wanted to thank everyone for being so kind and welcoming with your thoughts. There is a lot and this whole day has been way more emotional than I could have ever, ever expected. I\u2019m trying my best to get back to everyone and if I miss you, it was an honest mistake.

So, this room, I only ever went in once, maybe twice in many years of being friends and going over their house quite a lot, it was their \"Christmas room\" it has decorations up all year round, and during the year when they bought presents they'd wrap them and just put in the room and leave them there until Christmas.\n\nIt was awesome in a sense though, a whole room for this is great, often when it came to Christmastime they'd forgotten what something was that they got for another family member.\n\nEDIT: Reading the rest of the thread, this is so tame and boring compared to the dog fucking mother or the cake in soup one.\n\nEDIT2: Thank you to every one for the upvotes, nice to see it's still getting read.

Sounded great to my nerdy friends and I.\n\nWell the day of the party comes along and one of my friends gets dropped off by the school bus with me, we walk inside and there's no pizza yet and the cake hasn't been picked up. I ask my dad and he starts screaming about how my Mom will pick them up on her way from work. She won't be home until 7pm at the earliest and my friends will be arriving around 4pm.\n\nAfter my friend and I left the room my friend (from now referred to as Mark(not his name)) asked me if something is a wrong and why my dad was so mad. It was normal for him to be that mad when he forgot something.\n\nThe rest of my friends show up around 4pm (friends Bill, Bob, and Frank (also not their names), I offer them fruit snacks when they arrive and tell them pizza should be there around 7:30pm.\n\nSo we're taking turns on Gran Turismo 4 when Bill asks if my parents are home, he'd like to meet them. I tell him that my dad's home but he's sleeping right now as he gets up kinda early (this was a lie, he was taking his \"medicine\" ((what I'd later (that evening) find out was heroin) and would be occupied for awhile) and my Mom would be getting out of work around 7pm (which was true). The lie seemed to work and we continued playing games.\n\n8pm rolls around and my Mom gets home. She has no pizza or cake. I greet when she comes into the living room.\n\nShe asks us if we ate the pizza and cake already, I tell her that dad told us she'd be getting them. She asked where my dad was so I told her their bedroom.\n\nShe said she'd be right back and went to their bedroom. It wasn't long before you could here them (clearly) screaming at each other.\n\nI noticed them arguing was making my friends uncomfortable but I was unfazed. It was them that I realized that what was going on wasn't normal. I felt awful.\n\nI told my friends that my parents would likely be arguing most of the night and if they wanted to go home I'd understand. They all wanted to go home.\n\nDue to the layout of the home the kitchen was closer to the bedrooms than the living room and that was where the phone was. So I went with each of my friends to the kitchen so they could call their parents to be picked up. The front door was also closer still.\n\nThey each took turns calling their parents, I had to talk to Frank's parents for him as he was too shaken by what was going on.\n\nAll the parents were there within the hour and picked up my friends. Mark was the last one to be picked up and asked if I wanted to hang out as his place for the night. I told him that if my parents found out I left without telling anyone, especially if I didn't leave a note saying where, they'd be even more angry. And I told him that I couldn't leave a note saying where I was going as I didn't want to have his parents dragged into it.\n\nWe hugged and he left.\n\nMy parents finished screaming at each other around 11pm when my dad left screaming about going to his buddies place for the weekend.\n\nI was reading a book in the living room when my mom walked in and saw that everything was put away and all my friends were gone. She asked me where they went.\n\nI'll never forget the pain in her eyes when I said they each called their parents and went home already.\n\nFor what I thought was normal, I thought everyone's parents argue endlessly. I thought everyone had a parent that they lied for. I thought everyone's parents lies to them constantly. I thought everyone's parents got angry at them without prompting.\n\nI thought everyone always looked for exits upon entering a new place.\n\nI thought everyone knew how to act without being seen.\n\nI thought everyone knew how to act under pressure.\n\nI haven't celebrated a birthday since. Or even tried. I feel no drive to celebrate it as all it does is remind me of that and many other horrible things around that time.\n\nI'm still friends with Mark all these years later, he's my one of my only friends and he's by far my closest friend.",

            "I was maybe 12 and visiting a friend who lived deep in the woods for the first time. They had two outdoor dogs, and one got free and ran over and attacked the other. The dog that got bit was quite a bit smaller and was definitely injured. My friend's dad came out with a pistol and shot both dogs. It changed my life forever. I was raised in a house where dogs are family. My friend and his family didn't seem fazed at all.\n\nEdit: This really took off, so I guess I can elaborate a little more. This happened around 1994. I grew up in an extremely rural town, so when I say my friend lived deep in the woods, I'm talking like they were completely off the grid backwoods. One of the dogs was my friend's and the other was his sister's. They were chained up outside 24/7 and just not treated as pets at all. I believe the logic behind the shooting was that the sister's dog was too injured to recover, and my friends dog had  killed his sister's dog. So it was only fair to shoot them both. About 30 minutes after the whole thing happened, we all ate dinner together like nothing happened. My parents picked me up shortly after, and I cried the entire way home. We only hung out at my house after that.",

I remember the Pom Pom on the top of his toque.\nI was on the steps with my boyfriend and his mom and she was speaking to me warmly about something or other. Then the dad said something about leaving soon \u2014 a very mild comment, I didn\u2019t even really hear it. Suddenly the mom, who had been speaking to me in a normal tone of voice, turns to her husband and SHRIEKS at him at the TOP OF HER LUNGS! I don\u2019t even remember what she said, but he\u2019d made her suddenly murderously angry, just by mentioning that we should probably leave soon. Dude\u2019s Pom Pom shakes a little, but he says nothing in response to her, zero, and she turns back to me and rolls her eyes, trying to get me to side with her over what a fucking asshole her husband clearly is ???

Future frat boy types. Upper middle class with some rich kids sprinkled in. Host kid is a recent-marriage stepson of a chiropractor. His mom was a trashy milf before we knew that word in the early 90s. Anyway.. we start to arrive and we're bullshitting around their place and making plans for mischief for the night. Host assures us that we can do whatever we want because his mom and stepdad are going out on a nighttime bicycle ride all night. \n\nNope. That's not what was going down at all.\n\nThe parents came out in full blown BDSM slave gear. Leather daddy zippers and shit.  Stepdad didn't have the head part fully zipped up, but mom was being led by a leash. Right in front of us. He said a few kind words instructing us to behave for the night, and then led mom to the car and drove off. \n\nAfter a moment of stunned silence, we then had a big group argument about WTF we just saw. Host, who thought this was perfectly normal, assured us that it was just a biking thing. We didn't know everything, but we knew enough to call bullshit on that. But a half hour later, it was behind us and we proceeded with normal tween boy stuff playing night wars outside in the woods/yard.\n\nEdit:  For those asking, \"night wars\" is probably a weird term, but it's what we used. Basically it was a catch-all term for tween boys running around the neighborhood unsupervised all night. Usually the boys would separate into groups of various sizes or sometimes just divide in half. We would play games or pranks or just go exploring in the woods. Water balloon fights.. toilet papering houses/yards.. egging mailboxes.. paintball fights.. I could probably think of more. A \"night wars\" night would be declared in advance and then we would work out the details (or not) later. This was the late 80's/early 90's in a small town with basically zero crime, if that helps clarify why a bunch of kids would be allowed to roam around all night like that.",

Rather than get mad and yell that we had knotched up the blades, instead he grabbed a long sword off the wall and started swinging at us like he was literally going to duel to the death.

            "[I find numbers stations to be pretty creepy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIH7cG3YmIo)\n\nTheir purpose is technically a theory, as the groups that broadcast them won't officially confirm even their existence for the most part.\n\nEssentially, spying is still a very real thing for most world governments. One of the most foolproof ways of delivering a coded message is through a one-time code - a code used just once before being discarded. Your spy has the key, you have the message, and once the key is used it is discarded and the next message is sent using a different key. Additionally, shortwave radio is an extremely secure way of sending these messages.\n\nIt sounds weird, that a radio station anyone with a shortwave radio can listen to, would be considered 'secure'. But the beauty of the method is that shortwave radios are ubiquitous, cheap technology throughout most of the world. What looks more suspicious - a person traveling with a radio, or a person traveling with a sophisticated computer or satellite phone? While the signal can be received by anyone, it leaves no record of who received it and can't be intercepted and traced by a middleman. They don't care if you listen, because the stream of numbers is nothing without the code, and because you're using a one-time code, it can't be cracked as it's randomly generated and used once. The only time a one-time code has ever been broken was an instance where the code was re-used. \n\nSo your spy just tunes in to the radio at a specific time on a specific day, writes down the numbers. Decodes the message, discards the key, and no one is any the wiser. Most stations are identified by a call sign or little jingle, and these can range from [kind of cute and cheerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIH7cG3YmIo) to [pretty eerie sounding.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NgnwCugHsg) If you listen in frequently, you'll hear messages repeated over and over until one day they change up - it's believed they'll repeat the message until their spy can communicate they've received it. Essentially, if you have a shortwave radio, you can listen in on highly secret spy communications from countries all over the world. You can also listen in on countries jamming the communication, either by broadcasting state radio on the same signal, or trying to jam it with noise or static. \n\nYou'd think the frequency of these transmissions would have gone down after the Cold War, but they're still going strong! The very first numbers stations appeared in the very early days of radio, during World War I.

I don't know how much this story fits into this thread, but I've never had a platform that seemed appropriate to share it, so here we go.\n\nWhen I was 20 (14 years ago), I moved from Iowa to Boulder, Colorado with my best friend Cory.  We moved there during the month of August, and shortly thereafter I got a phone call from a number I didn't know.  I answered it, and it turned out to be this girl that had attended the same high school as us, Ashley.  \n\nAshley had heard that Cory and I had just moved to Boulder, and she was calling because she, too, had just moved to Boulder to attend CU.  She wanted to know if we wanted to get together some time and hang out / party.\n\nAshley was a couple years younger than us and we didn't run in the same crowds, so we didn't hang out much.  But I remember her coming over to our apartment to smoke and chill once, then I remember asking her to get us weed--she did. She came with us to a party once, and I also remember us asking her for weed a second time, and her texting me back saying \"You guys just message me when you want weed, so no.\"  After that I don't think we talked to her again.\n\nFast forward 3-4 years, Cory and I are living back in Iowa.  \n\nOne night, I was out with a couple of people I'd gone to high school with, and we went to this dive bar called Thumbs.  In the back of Thumbs there is a single pool table, which is where my group went because we had planned on playing.  \n\nWe got to the pool table, and there's Ashley, racking a set of pool balls.  I was super surprised to see her there, so I walked right up to her and said something like \"Ashley, long time no see! What are you doing here? Did you move back from Boulder?\"\n\nAshley just stared at me for a second and then said \"What?\"\n\nSo I repeat myself and say \"Did you move back from Colorado?  I haven't seen you since we hung out in Boulder!\"\n\nShe looked truly confused, and then she said \"Um.. what are you talking about? I never lived in Boulder.\"\n\nAt this point I thought she was fucking with me because I specifically remembered hanging out with her more than once.  So I laughed and was like \"You're fucking with me, right?\"\n\nShe shook her head no, and one of the girls I was with (who knew both of us) actually overheard it and butted in to confirm that \"Ashley had lived in [our hometown] the whole time\".\n\nI completely dropped the subject to save face, but the experience was so unsettling that I made a bee-line for the front door.  I walked out onto the sidewalk, pulled my phone out of my pocket, and called Cory.  I said \"Cory, do you remember when we lived together in Boulder and Ashley came over and hung out with us?\"\n\n...and Cory said \"No man, that never happened.\"  He was my best friend so I knew he wasn't fucking with me, plus there was a zero percent chance he and Ashley had ever talked to set something like this up. When I pressed the issue, he insisted that no one we had gone to high school with had ever moved out to Boulder, and that we certainly hadn't hung out with them.  Since then, I've brought this up to Cory several times and his position has never changed.\n\nTo this day, I don't know what happened.  I specifically remember hanging out with her.  She wore a tie-dye t-shirt when she came over the first time.  And we hung out with her *multiple times*, I remember it so clearly.  I still have those memories, but apparently they never happened.  Even though the timeline matches exactly; she would have graduated high school *that* year and moved to Colorado *in* August for school.\n\nI know that the human memory is super unreliable, and I'm sure that's all this is, but that doesn't change that I am absolutely 100% fucking sure that this happened. 14 years later and I still stand by my story, wrong as it may be.",

            "The Vela Incident\n\nSeptember 1979, a US Vela satellite detected a double flash of light over an area of the ocean between South Africa and Antarctica. The prior 41 double flashes observed by the satellite were from nuclear explosions as this is what they were designed to observe. There also happened to be a typhoon happening in the area at the time so it seemed like someone wanted to detonate it without being caught. Carter administration reported that it was a natural occurrence due to a small meteorite hitting the satellite. However many other independent sources and even other countries have reported that they did indeed find traces of fallout and radiation. Because of the geopolitical climate of the times, there\u2019s very strong evidence that it was in fact a joint nuclear weapon test carried out by South Africa and Israel, and the US scrubbed the information regarding it because they didn\u2019t want to paint their allies in Israel in a bad light for working with apartheid-era South Africa.

            "That humans almost went extinct. 70,000 years ago a volcano in Indonesia erupted. There\u2019s theories that we have a genetic bottleneck around that time. Took our population down to 10,000-3,000 (like the size of one small town).

When I went to sleep this had 5 upvotes and now it's 10k. I'm glad that so many people found this interesting. I'd like to clarify that this is a theory, a hypothesis supported by a collection of facts. The theory is not fact and truth in itself, so don't take it that way. I have gotten a lot of messages where people think that I'm spreading falsehoods about this and I want to address that there is counter evidence against the volcano causing a genetic bottleneck. There is still evidence of the genetic bottleneck and the recent and abrupt diversification of humanity. Most of the research that I've seen on this comes from 2000. It's been 20 years so there has been lots of work done on this very topic in the time since. The point is, don't take it as fact. The thread asked for scary theories and I provided a scary **theory**, not fact. For more information and supporting evidence that human beings diversified recently, we can look at stories like [Cheddar Man](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42939192)! A dark skinned, blue eyed man that lived around 10,000 years ago in England.\n\nI have also been getting a lot of questions about if we have genetically improved as a species from this. The short answer is \"I don't know\" and I don't think anyone does. I think it's unlikely as I've never heard of a population bottleneck going well. **Pain does not equal gain** and \"survival of the fittest\" hasn't really applied to people for a long time and for a variety of reasons. We tend protect others that are \"weak\" because those that are different have still purpose and use to the community. We care about each other and want to see everyone succeed.

He was like 20ft away and we had our windows up. Right when he looked at me I panicked and did the chin down nod that guys usually do and he nodded back and turned away.

            "That all intelligent life kills itself.\n\nSo the theory started out with the Fermi Paradox, basically there are so many planets in this galaxy, let alone the entire universe, that it is statistically impossible that we're the only planet that developed intelligent life. So where is everybody?\n\nWell the secondary theory is that every intelligent species reaches the point where they have a technology that can kill their entire species. And that the vast majority end up killing themselves at that point. Those who survive this time in their history are so rare that we haven't found them and they haven't found us. As a species we reached that point in our history with the discovery of nuclear weapons, and were at the height of risk during the Cold War (at least thus far in our collective history) but there are various technologies that could bring a species to this point in their history. This would mean that while so far we've survived that it's statistically unlikely we will survive long term.",

If you really think about it, there should be tons of alien evidence all around the visible universe if they have gotten to the point of interstellar travel.

Well given an infinite amount of time, anything and everything that might be possible no matter how unlikely can and will happen, including the random emergence of a consciousness from a series of fluctuations in void: this consciousness is a boltzman brain.

However with infinite time, not only could boltzman brains emerge, but if they can, then in with infinite time an infinite number of boltzman brains will emerge.

Very quiet and not very chatty with people (outside of his inner circle) at all. I do not \"look\" like a nerd, and am often met with surprise when I express my interests in gaming.\n\nOnce we were hanging out with mutual friends and everyone was just chatting away to each other and I couldn't remember the name of an obscure NPC in an old game that I adore, and he chimed in across from me knowing exactly who I was talking about. We shared a smile and never stopped talking, we have been together for six years and will be married as soon as I'm well enough. He said later that he was so scared to talk to me, and I was just thrilled he was even listening to me as I often just assumed he wasn't interested in what I had to say. \n\nHe is my best friend, handsome lover, and my player 1, the most amazing man in the entire world, and I adore him with my whole heart, I am so glad he was brave enough to talk to me that day.\n\nMy advice would be that listening to people goes a really long way, engage with them if you share common interests. Ask them questions. Listen to the answers. Make dumb jokes. Express your opinions and see if you share any. Treat \"females\" like human beings rather than illusive creatures of myth, and remember that being honest and being your true self is far more attractive than pretending to be what you think someone might be looking for. Sincerity is rare and beautiful, and doesn't cost a thing.",

Never spoke to him again after that.\n\nSeriously, just treating women like a dude you're trying to be friends with will win over so many as long as you're genuine and dont treat them like shit if it turns out they dont want to sleep with you. You wont get every single one you want, there's no magic trick to it and plenty of women will turn you down.

            "Thanks for choosing Mybody\\_v.43! You're going to have fun this week as long as you can remember a few simple items:\n\n1. This body is 6'6\" tall (198cm) so most likely larger than what you're used to. Watch my head when passing through doorways, walking under ceiling fans, chandeliers, etc... and don't even fucking think about trying to fit into a sports car for more than a trip to the 7 Eleven - you won't be able to walk properly during the remainder of your body lease. Buicks are good. Also, please try to help old people and the vertically challenged to reach things on top shelves at the store. They like that. Expect a five minute conversation about if you play basketball. Tell them you prefer chess, it usually shuts them up.\n2. Mybody\\_v.43 spent 8 years in the US Army. Don't mind all the shit that goes along with that - blown out knees, painful back, scars, tinnitus, PTSD, severe anxiety in crowded settings, and nightmares. Just be grateful you wake up each morning - but take it slow. It helps to stand in the shower and fluctuate between hot and cold water while stretching everything below the nose for about 10 minutes.\n3. Don't freak the fuck out when you get in front of the mirror naked. Yes, those are a LOT of tattoos. Best thing is to smear vitamin E oil or olive oil over the whole body to keep 'em shiny. \n4. Mybody\\_v.43 is stronger than most. Keep that in mind when shaking hands, giving hugs, petting animals, etc... but also remember it comes in handy when lifting heavy stuff like horse feed, furniture, other people and engine blocks. \n5. Keep an extra set of glasses with you at all times. If one pair breaks, you'll be fucked and unable to get home.\n6. Mybody\\_v.43 needs about 2 gallons of water / day and about 5,000 - 6,000 calories to function optimally. Ground bison, rib eye, rice and carrots work well. Don't do sweets, drink soda, or eat anything with HFCS - headaches will ensue. \n7. Go to sleep any time you wish, but please be aware that Mybody\\_v.43 wakes up at 0530 hours no matter what. You deal with the consequences if you didn't plan for at least 6 hours of time with the Z Monster. \n8. Don't turn the thermostat above 65F or you will get swamp butt. The body you are leasing is most comfortable at about 55F and is used to working at or below 0F. \n9. Here's the most important thing... Mybody\\_v.43 hasn't tasted alcohol in any way, shape or form in 3 years and 11 days. Do not, I repeat, do not drink alcohol. You will either wind up in jail or in a ditch 50 miles north of Albuquerque within three days. Oh, and unless you want to remain alive and get your deposit back on Mybody\\_v.43, don't drink Tequila.",

            "I grew up with the Bay Transformers films, and while I\u2019ll always have a soft spot for the first three *holy shit* the lore might be the worst in all of fiction. In the first film the Allspark, a cube that makes Transformers and the cause of the war,  lands on Earth in the early 1900s, and it takes the Autobots and Decepticons 100 years to find Earth.\n\nOh wait, no it doesn\u2019t because they\u2019ve been on Earth since at least the 1800s and never thought to look for the very thing the war was all about. Hell the Primes, basically Transformer Gods, built their Sun Eater in Egypt and were buried on the damn planet. How did they not write Earth down in any records if it was an important planet to them?\n\nAlso did you know that the Transformers were the cause of the space race? And that they were making deals with the CIA and NASA all the way back in the 60s? And they still didn\u2019t think to look for Megatron or the Allspark in that time period? Also the Government organization made *specifically* to research Transformers had no idea about any of that? \n\nOh yeah, Transformers killed the dinosaurs too because Earth was actually being used to mine \u201cTransformium\u201d, which is what Transformers are made out of. Oh yeah about that, the Allspark did jack shit all along because *other aliens* made Transformers, so the war was pointless. And Primes are knights now, not Gods for some reason. \n\nSpeaking of knights, did you know that Transformers were at King Arthur\u2019s round table? They also fought in both World Wars, the American Revolution, they killed Hitler, served the Japanese empire, etc. all along because why the fuck not? Also a Goddess named Quintessa made the Transformers, not those other aliens and not the Allspark, to fight Unicron. Who\u2019s Unicron? Well he\u2019s the Thanos of the Transformers universe... and he\u2019s been Earth all along! Yep, Earth was a Transformer too.

            "There are so many confusing characters/franchises to choose as a comic book fan, but I've got to give it to Wonder Woman. \n\nFor those that don't know, DC tends to do soft reboots every once in a while which makes continuity...difficult to parse. But there are usually through lines, and little changes are explained by the continuity shift. Currently, they're trying to say all the old stories kind of did happen and the 2011 reboot wasn't actually a hard reboot like they tried to pitch it as. I realize this doesn't appear to make any sense, but in reality, for most characters, it actually works if you don't think too hard. \n\nBut not for Wonder Woman. Every time they do any kind of reboot, her back story is completely overhauled. Sometimes not even when there's a continuity excuse. To the point where there are almost as many stories dealing with retconning her origins as there are stories about her doing her superhero thing in the last TEN YEARS, and unlike Hawkman, there is no clever way to connect that disparity. Is she a clay golem given life by the gods? Is she the daughter of Zeus? Is she the daughter of Hercules? Who knows, and there's absolutely no way to reconcile the three. Is she a diplomat for Themyscira, trying to influence the UN to help with world peace? Nope, because someone recently decided she's NEVER BEEN BACK to Themyscira since the first time she left. And when was that? WW1? WW2? The Cold War? Sliding timescale of \"a while ago but in modern times\"? No way to know, because classic stories have taken place in all those timelines. Really, none of her early stories could have possibly happened due to current retcons, yet she's been a hero for at least 10+ years as a Justice League member, so...\n\nIts just a waste, is what I'm trying to say. Writers looooovveee rewriting Superman's origin but good God does it never stop for Wonder Woman. If they'd give her a few years to breathe and grow as a character instead of changing her origin which inevitably changes again, she'd be much more popular, which she deserves. And at least Superman has 2+ ongoing books even when they do decide to take his origin out for a spin in a new miniseries. At least she has her perfect costume, finally.",

            "Star Trek deals with time travel a lot and it only sometimes makes sense. Usually it can be reconciled with some general rules. Timelines in Trek seem to be linear. You can go into the past and change things and it doesn't just create an alternate timeline, it changes the one you are in. This is most easily seen in Star Trek First Contact, when the Enterprise is stuck in a temporal rift as Borg in the past assimilate Earth they see the planet in the present immediately get assimilated. However, there are an [infinite amount of alternate timelines and universes](https://youtu.be/Sv408cbBFSA), three of which are most prominent (prime timeline is the TV shows, Kelvin timeline is the 2009 JJ Abrams reboot, Mirror Universe is just an alternate universe that appears occasionally).\n\nThings start to get confusing when the shows actually do time travel. As I've established, timelines in Star Trek are linear. However, the Kelvin Timeline actually occurred because a supernova in the Prime Timeline shot a bunch of pissed off Romulans from the 2380s back in time to the 2230s of an alternate dimension where they destroyed the USS Kelvin. What is confusing is that according to the writers and what we see in the movie, this event actually somehow changed history *before* the Kelvin was destroyed, which is an explanation for why the ships are like twice as big as they should be if they were just regular Prime timeline ships (the real explanation is that JJ Abrams thought Star Trek ships were too small and made them bigger because he has no sense of scale).\n\nIn Star Trek Voyager, the finale of the show established that it took around 20 years for the USS Voyager to get home from the Delta Quadrant. A jaded and bitter Admiral Janeway acquires a Klingon time travel device and goes back in time bearing advanced technology with the intent of bringing Voyager home far earlier and with everyone alive. The problem is, as I've already established, timelines in Star Trek are linear. Literally the moment Admiral Janeway interacts with Captain Janeway and starts to mess with the progress of their voyage, she should cease to exist as the events that led her to that moment no longer happened. Instead, she sticks around long enough to sacrifice herself to destroy the Borg transwarp network and get everyone home safely.\n\nAlso, earlier in the series a Federation timeship from the 29th century threatened Janeway to stop getting involved in time travel stuff, but they are apparently okay with just letting the 24th century Federation skip around 15 years of weapon development and literally crippling the Borg. And mentioning that, they also let the ship's Emergency Medical Hologram return home with a mobile hologram emitter from the 29th century. Not very good time cops.\n\nThere's definitely others but I'll stop here.",

Yet not once does TWD group ever clear out a building first, they stumble into them and someone always either gets bit or nearly gets bit.\n\nWolrd War Z it took them 5 minutes to realize magazines strapped on your arms protects you from bites and it seems to be a TWD rule to only wear t shirts and maybe some leather if you're cool enough.\n\nIf you stick a pocket knife in a skull, you need both hands and a boot on the head to get it back. And if you're weapon had nails on it, it's gone after one use. Barb wire, not a vast improvement.

However, couldn't they have simply argued that the evidence of an illegal student group was what Malfoy wanted to find, and hence the room had created one for him?

            "Actually the reverse. I cannot get over how the not taking the eagles in Lord of the Rings is considered a plot hole. The literal whole theme of the movie is that Sauron is searching for the ring, and that they\u2019re SECRETLY taking it to destroy it. They can\u2019t have him know that they\u2019re taking it back to his lair to destroy it, and he doesn\u2019t suspect where they\u2019re going because he can\u2019t imagine anyone who wouldn\u2019t keep that type of power.

It is stated that Hermione doesn't like stealing and even left money for something once, so why not do that multiple times? Petty muggle theft of left over chicken tenders or bakery muffins wouldn't have attracted death eaters and if they don't want to steal they can leave the money behind. Also, it's stupid that they wouldn't steal when in the same exact book they broke into a bank and busted it to pieces, morals are morals but during war this is dumb.\n\nWhy would all of the professors (even Snape) tell Slytherin and the other houses to go back to their common room in the first book because a troll was loose?

            "Star Wars Expanded Universe pre-disney.\n\nOnce you understand how the multiple levels of canon work, and the way the EU had retconned many issues into making sense by roughly 2012, things were looking pretty good and far less patchy. \n\nForce Unleashed broke the lore for how the rebellion was made, force powers in general, and lots more. \n\nIt was utterly ignored by the EU writers because of it and basically wasn't really canon since the novelization nerfed Starkiller back down to just being a really strong jedi with no finesse. Still made no sense. \n\nSo that doesn't count. \n\nBiggest problem then is probably the argument between many EU authors on the nature of the force. \n\nMany believed older Lucas opinions, that the Force was not yin and yang, that the dark side was a perversion of the light, and that the dark, being unnatural, was what unbalanced the force. \n\nOthers cited the prequel-era belief that it was more of a yin and yang thing, and this led to the whole grey jedi thing that so many fans who think they're smart for escaping the light-dark dichotomy really liked. \n\nHowever, by the late years of the EU it was becoming apparent that through storytelling, exploration of characters, etc, it was kinda stupid for dark to be in any way natural. Between the original movies showing balance as being wiping out the dark, the Dark Empire graphic novel showing you cannot achieve good through the dark side, and many others, star wars was kind of inescapably \"good vs evil\".\n\nBut with decades of people trying to insert moral grayness into a good vs evil system, instead of insertion that moral greyness into the politics and worldbuilding, there just ended up being a lot of contradictions and literal decades of problems. \n\nWould have been nice to see how they would work it all out. \n\nNow we just see the same problem all over again but in its infancy with Disney's work. \n\nThere's a reason a lot of star wars fans are so jaded and negative, and seeing mistakes repeated is not helping us."

Then my wife was pregnant and gave birth to two babies as a very late term miscarriage. I held them and they were small babies. Charity's birthday is in two days. Hannah was born Oct 10.\n\nWe thought we did all the right things. We took their cremains and with our children, put one into the sea and another into a friend's lake. We talked about the loss occasionally. But we didn't do a lot of things we could have done--memorialized their birthdays, Christmas ornaments for them, that sort of tangible stuff that kids can grasp.\n\nAs it turns out, both of them grieved those losses deeply. They were 4 and 5 and we thought they barely understood it. But we were wrong. And it really wounded them and they exploded with anger and hurt at us a couple of years ago. We handled it well, we got counseling, we apologized, we started correcting course.\n\nRight now, neither of them really speak to us. They cannot seem to forgive us for that oversight of not properly memorializing their sisters. And it's tearing us apart. We were so close. And now they are so distant and act so incredibly injured over this.\n\nAnd I'm a profession in an associated area and so is my wife--we can't even grasp the depths of this loss from a professional, let along personal perspective.\n\nSo include your kids in on these sorts of hurts and losses.

So if a child does something bad, a lot of parents automatically (and unconsciously) assume that the child did this on purpose and out of evilness. Than they punish the child, because they think they need to teach them that evilness won\u2019t be tolerated.\nThere are things children need to learn not to do. But In a lot of cases parents need to understand that children act the way they act, because it\u2019s their only option. For example a kid doesn\u2019t scream at their parent because it\u2019s evil, but because its their only chance to mark a border that his parents repeatedly crossed. The problem here is the communication within the family, not the child. So you need to understand the real problem and work on your families communication.

It's about letting yourself be interested in, and learn from, other people and not focus so much on feeling like you have to be an entertainer. \n\nAnd being an engaged listener is really the opposite of the person who just listens and never wants to talk about themselves. You are putting yourself into the conversation with your interested responses, you are guiding it to places you find interesting.

            "My personal favorite: the beginning of the Battle of Stamford Bridge, in England, 1066. England's been invaded by a Norwegian army led by Harald Hardrada, king of Norway, and Tostig Godwinson, exiled English earl and estranged brother to the English king. They've already fought one battle, they've captured York. Things are looking good for them.\n\nThey're chilling, enjoying their success, waiting at Stamford Bridge for the hostages they demanded. It's a hot day. They're not expecting any trouble. But wait- an English army shows up. That's practically impossible. The battle of Fulford Gate had taken place only five days ago, and the Norwegians had completely routed the forces of the northern earls. The rest of the English army was known to be in the south, awaiting a Norman invasion.\n\nTurns out the English had ridden all the way up North in FOUR DAYS. \n\nThe Norwegians were, understandably, a bit unhappy. They form into a circle. They don't have their armor with them- it's at the ships. It's too hot to be hanging around in mail. They've got helmets and shields and weaponry, and that's it. \n\nThe English send a rider to negotiate. He tells Tostig that his brother the King is willing to offer him his earldom back and part of the rule of England if he gives up now. Tostig asks what his buddy Harald Hardrada gets for his trouble. \n\n\"Six feet of English ground, or as much more as he needs, being taller than other men.\"\n\nTostig says they're done here. The rider rides away. Harald Hardrada asks who that dude was, because if it had been him talking, he'd have just killed the bastard there. Tostig says oh, that's my brother. That's Harold Godwinson, the king. \n\nHarold Godwinson rode up to an enemy army personally and told the king of Norway, known to be a great warrior and general, that all he'd get from this invasion was a grave.\n\nBattle commences. Norwegians lose. Tostig and Harald Hardrada both die. Huge bloody mess. English army is crippled. And then three days later the Normans land in the south. Harold is fucked. He still marches his army back, gathers as much force as he can, and engages three weeks later. He's killed at Hastings. Normans conquer England. \n\nBasically a very personal fuck you moment that snowballed quite intensely.\n\nEdit: because a lot of people are asking- yes, this was the battle with the legendary berserker at the bridge. No, it probably didn't actually happen. The story appears hundreds of years later and is very inconsistent. Also, there might not have been an actual bridge there at the time.",

Caesar's army isn't big enough to take them all at once, and the Gauls have reinforcements coming so a siege is impossible.  So Caesar just *builds a bigger castle around the one he's attacking*.  He literally just built two walls back to back in a ring around the castle.  The first Gaul army was already too small to defeat Caesar, and his fortifications only gave him a greater advantage.  The reinforcements were also unable to defeat Caesar's army now that he was behind several layers of spike pits and both earthen and wooden walls.  Plus the Gauls inside had no way to communicate with the reinforcements outside, so they couldn't coordinate attacks.  Both Gallic armies were defeated as they attacked Caesar's newly built fortifications, and Caesar emerged victorious.  It's probably my favorite battle of all time.",

Then Henry died of dysentery. That sucks. \n\nAs the heir to the English throne is an infant command of the war goes to the dukes, and long story short they lay siege to Orleans after a few years. The siege lasts months. Enter Joan of Arc, a peasant girl who can barely write her own name, who convinces the French commander to give her a shot because God is with her. \n\nShe lifts the siege inside two weeks. \n\nShe spends a while going from victory to victory, robbing the English of all initiative and permanently turning the war in France\u2019s favour. So as you can imagine, England is not happy with her. Losing to this girl repeatedly is just embarrassing. Long story short, she gets captured after a year or so and handed over. \n\nThe English up to now have been portraying her as a witch, devil worshipper, whatever it took, and now wanted to try her for heresy. They basically wanted to make as much spectacle as possible to embarrass the French. Every church member on the trial was English despite Joan\u2019s protestations and everything. \n\nIt still wasn\u2019t easy. \n\nThe trials were loaded so heavily to trip her into self incrimination that it would be horrifying if she hadn\u2019t been dodging almost every trap - one of the more memorable exchanges was she was asked if she was in the grace of God. A no would be an admission of guilt, a yes would be heretical as Church doctrine was that you can\u2019t know if you are in God\u2019s grace or not. Her answer was \u201cif I am may I be kept there, and if not may I be guided there\u201d. Thus she dodged the trap. \n\nThe English archbishop running this kangaroo court was under huge pressure to get her convicted and eventually it came down to her cross dressing. She\u2019d been dressing in shirt and trousers in imprisonment ti dissuade the guards from assaulting her (a dress can be lifted up, shirt and trousers is more difficult to get around without leaving evidence) but had appeared before the priests in a dress. So, they argued, cross dressing was heretical, and she had done it, stopped doing it and then relapsed into heresy - which was punishable by death. So she was burned at the stake, her bones ground down so there could be no relics and the dust thrown in a river. \n\nA few decades later the Pope ordered a retrial where she was exonerated of all wrongdoing and she was later made a saint, but it didn\u2019t really do her much good at that point - the English had their revenge on her.

            "Olga of Kiev\n\nEDIT: To elaborate, here is a part of the article on Olga. TLDR at the bottom. https://www.historyanswers.co.uk/medieval-renaissance/olga-of-kiev-one-saint-you-do-not-want-to-mess-with/\n\"The Drevians sent 20 of their best men to try and persuade Olga to marry the living symbol of her husband\u2019s murder. Telling them to wait in their boat, she had a ditch dug and next morning had had the emissaries buried alive.\n\nRather than just leave it at this, a pretty definitive refusal if ever there was one, she sent word back to Prince Mal that should would accept his proposal, but only if the Drevians sent a part of their great and good to accompany her back to their territory, after all it was important that the proud Keivan Rus\u2019 see just how important this matchmaking was.\n\nHer would-be suitor obliged, sending a party of their chieftains to collect her. Extending a suitably grand welcome, she invited the visitors to wash up in her bath house and then locking the doors, burned the entire company alive.(...) \n\nOlga hatched a plan to do away with the rest of them all together and announcing that she would be soon arriving at the Drevian capital of Iskorosten and asked for them to arrange a funeral feast where they could mourn over her husband\u2019s death in that the very city.\n\nDespite the not having heard from either of the missions they\u2019d dispatched to Olga\u2019s court, the Drevians set about preparing the feast and after drinking themselves insensible on mead, Olga\u2019s soldiers put 5,000 of them to the sword(...)\n\n\u201cNow Olga gave to each soldier in her army a pigeon or a sparrow, and ordered them to attach by thread to each pigeon and sparrow a piece of sulfur bound with small pieces of cloth. When night fell, Olga bade her soldiers release the pigeons and the sparrows. So the birds flew to their nests, the pigeons to the cotes, and the sparrows under the eaves. The dove-cotes, the coops, the porches, and the haymows were set on fire.\"\n\n\nTLDR: Basically, she buried 20 men of a people called Drevians alive, then burned a bunch of Drevians in a building, then made her soldiers kill 5000 more of the Drevians and then burned the rest of the people's homes.",
            "On November 2nd, 1932 Australia declared war on the emus. Emus were considered a nuisance to farmers and the Australian government stepped in to control the population. They enlisted the help of the military (and civilians with guns) kill emus. Emus though are fast a fierce creatures they don't take kindly to attempts on their lives and would flee faster than the military could chase. The man in charge of the operation Major Meredith said, \"If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds it would face any army in the world\u00a0... They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks. They are like Zulus whom even\u00a0dum-dum bullets\u00a0could not stop\" that being said the Australian government gave up on killing the emus and just let the farmers do it. So in the end emus got to say 'fuck you' to the Australian government.\n\nTLDR: Australia declares war on emus and loses"
