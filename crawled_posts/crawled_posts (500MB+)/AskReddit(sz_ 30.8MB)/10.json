It was comin\u2019 back, from the island of Tinian to Leyte, just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn\u2019t see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you\u2019re in the water, chief? You tell by lookin\u2019 from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn\u2019t know. `Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn\u2019t even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin\u2019. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it\u2019s kinda like `ol squares in battle like a, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark nearest man and then he\u2019d start poundin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 and screamin\u2019 and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn\u2019t go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he\u2019s got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll\u2019s eye. When he comes at ya, doesn\u2019t seem to be livin\u2019. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin\u2019 and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin\u2019 and the hollerin\u2019 they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y\u2019know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don\u2019t know how many sharks, maybe a thousand. I don\u2019t know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin\u2019 chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosom\u2019s mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well, he\u2019d been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He\u2019d a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin\u2019 for my turn. I\u2019ll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.",

There must be security for all, or no one is secure. Now, this does not mean giving up any freedom, except the freedom to act irresponsibly. Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves and hired policemen to enforce them. We, of the other planets, have long accepted this principle. We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets and for the complete elimination of aggression. The test of any such higher authority is, of course, the police force that supports it. For our policemen, we created a race of robots. Their function is to patrol the planets in spaceships like this one and preserve the peace. In matters of aggression, we have given them absolute power over us. This power cannot be revoked. At the first sign of violence, they act automatically against the aggressor. The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk. The result is, we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war. Free to pursue more... profitable enterprises. Now, we do not pretend to have achieved perfection, but we do have a system, and it works. I came here to give you these facts.

He starts filling out the paperwork, but partway through he just stops and says, \"Screw this. I'm just going to break up with her instead.\" He picks up the cat and walks out the door, presumably to leave his GF. I hope he stuck to it and he and his cat got a happy ending.",
            "Not directly relevant, but we once took in a dog, whose human was asked to make this choice. Beautiful weimaraner.\n\nThe guy brought the dog out to our house (on a hill in the woods with acres to roam - dogs absolutely love it out here - and we spent some time walking around letting the dog get used to the place and meet our other furry residents. \n\nWe could tell it was really hard on both of them when he left. \n\nThe next day he kicked the woman out, and came back for the dog. Happy ending all around, I'd say.\n\n[Edit one year later. The dog has passed on, but lived out his time with his favoritest human.]",

Then she went into a big spiel about how I'm a loser, I'm missing out, there's only one of her, etc etc. Yeah, I knew all that when I put my foot down over her idiotic jealousy of the cat liking me more than her.\n\nThe cat is now 16 and still with me, happy in her senior years. There's been other women since her, ones that treated me a lot better than she did. It was a total win for both the cat and myself.",

I\u2019ve raised him since he was a baby with his brother, who passed away two winters ago. \nWhen we moved in with my in-laws over the summer, they didn\u2019t want me to bring my rat. I straight up told my partner that I\u2019ll live somewhere else for awhile (we\u2019d been living together for almost three years at that point) because my rat is my responsibility, he\u2019s very old, and that I was going to see him through to the end. They were a little upset and accused me of choosing the rat over them, but I explained that he\u2019s an animal that relies on us.\nIt worked out, I convinced my in-laws to let me bring him, and we\u2019re all still kickin. He\u2019s on his last days and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here with him. He\u2019ll be buried with his brother when it\u2019s time.",

She tries allergy treatments and they didn\u2019t work. No, He couldn\u2019t just leave his dog home alone all  night and just spend time at her place. Dog died of cancer/ old age around 12 years old. Neither was upset at the other during the breakup, it\u2019s truly a NAH situation.",

I didn't really think much of it. Around month 4, he started getting annoyed and one day, straight up asked me how long it was gonna take to \"sell a few spiders\". \n\nI thought he was talking about my actual job, so I was like, \"oh, I sell them in bulk to a supplier. He's coming round on Tuesday, actually.\" And my bf was so relieved, but I couldn't really understand why. \n\nSo the dude comes round on the Weds and sees the tarantulas in the house and goes on an abolute tirade about how I lied to him, how I've broken his trust, and how he's gonna need time to heal. NGL, I just burst out laughing. I was like, \"you really thought I was gonna give up my job for *you?*\" \n\nWell that was apparently not the reaction he expected. He stormed out, yelling about how I was such a dumb bitch for not realising how great he was lmao. Tried to crucify me on social media, but he just ended up looking like an idiot lol",

She said she did -- she had had him for 14 years and they had only been dating for about a month.  \n\n\nGuess he wasn't expecting that because he just kind of shut up and left the house.",

Still have him and he is 15 years old now",
            "I knew my husband was the One because he didn't ask me to choose between him and my dog.\n\nI was living in Chicago (husband was in New York) and we were dating long distance. About two weeks before husband was scheduled to come out to move in with me I rescued a little miniature poodle from under a dumpster in my neighborhood.\n\nDog was horribly matted, reeked of piss, and appeared to have been have suffered blunt force trauma to the face, which was already partly healed. I took him to the vet and they told me he needed all but two teeth extracted and his jaw re-set. I was a graduate student at the time and didn't have two coins to rub together so I asked the vet if they would put the dog down (he was elderly and clearly in a lot of pain - I would not have asked to do this lightly). A total stranger in the waiting room overheard this and offered to pay for the surgery on the condition I give the dog a loving home. Obviously, he got the surgery and come home with me the next day.\n\nI named him Leo (after Leopold Bloom, as I was writing a paper on *Ulysses* at the time), let him sleep in my bed with me and the rest is history. He seemed to understand that I was his savior - I have never seen a dog get so attached so fast. This dog *loved* me.\n\nTwo weeks later, my husband arrives and this little dog goes immediately into full-Freudian murder mode. He f\\*cking hates husband. Like, sees red, tries to kill him every time we hold hands or hug each other. We think probably whoever hurt his face and abandoned him also hurt his previous mom. Anyway this tiny dog with no teeth straight up tries to murder my 6'3\" 260 lb professional mover boyfriend multiple times every day.  Husband can't get up to pee in the night because the dog guards our door like a tiny, yappy, snarly sentinel. He never so much as mentions the idea of getting rid of the dog. In fact, he cares for the dog when I'm busy and covers half the vet bills.\n\nWe got married 3 years after that, and Leo was at the wedding trying to kill my husband the whole time. When Leo finally passed at 17 he had terrible doggy dementia. He could never remember where he was or how to find me, eventually we put him down when he started to wet his bed. But he never forgot that he wanted to kill my husband. And my husband never did anything but return equal love to the little guy's hate.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for all the love, kind folks! Husband and I had a good smile reading your replies. For those who are curious we now have two healthy dogs who love us both equally, as well as a commissioned portrait of Leo to commemorate his special role in our early relationship :-)",

            "Had an old friend who chose her ex's dog over the ex. And though there was no choosing in the \"ones not around any more\" sense, my dog 1000% loves my husband more than he ever loved me. If I had not married my husband, pretty sure my dog would have given ME an ultimatum.",

Then we broke up. *Shrugs*\n\nImagine feeling threatened and jealous of your SO (of 14 years!) petting a dog. They are well behaved, house broken, no behavioral issues, no financial burden, and honestly they are low maintenance in the attention department too.

We had only been dating for several months, but I knew this was for real and I did NOT want the responsibility of a dog - I had expressed as much to her.  Not that I don\u2019t love animals, I just don\u2019t love them in an apartment.\n\nShe had her stay with her ex because he had a large yard, but she had previously been attacked by his two pit bulls (pretty badly).  Well, her ex called to say she had jumped the fence into the green belt and got rolled up by coyotes (it was definitely those two dogs again).  When I walked into her apartment after she got her back, I almost started bawling.  This poor girl had several dozen stitches, and about 5 tubes sticking out of her body to drain (blood? Not sure).  Poor thing looked like a beat-to-shit hyena or something.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter, though.

My boyfriend now said the same things at first before he saw her and fell absolutely in love within 2 minutes. They\u2019ve been best friends for almost 5 years.",
            "I used to help out at a dog home and there was this lovely old German Shepherd in there about 10 years old. Her owner (a middle aged man) had gotten rid of her when he met a young attractive woman who didn\u2019t want him to keep the dog.\n\n She was a lovely dog and was abandoned by her lifelong owner. Dogs show us so much love and deserve so much better than some people show them in return. Fuck that guy.",

He didn\u2019t demand I get rid of my old man but he repeatedly made comments about how it was time to PTS because my cat was old and thin.  He always commented on my cat\u2019s weight.  Even went so far as to stop by a vet and pick up cremation pamphlets so I could shop for urns.\n\nI spent $$$ on all senior bloodwork, checked thyroid, etc.   He had a clean bill of health *because* I always provided the best nutrition and care.  \n\nOne day I told him, \u201cthe next time you mention me putting my cat to sleep or imply I\u2019m not doing right by him make sure your bags are packed.\u201d\n\nHe was gone 3 weeks after that.\nThe cat had 3 more wonderful years before cancer got him and I did PTS.   \n\nPeople:  15+ years of love and emotional investment will trump your new relationship, every time.",
            "I briefly dated a guy who pretended to not be severely allergic to cats. He came over for the first time doped up on Benadryl and I confronted him about it, and he tearfully told me he hoped to keep his allergy a secret long enough for me to fall for him and choose him over my cat.\n\nAnd that this was a repeat strategy for him.\n\nI laughed so hard (poor confused guy) and told him the only winning move was not to play. I happily never saw him again.",
            "Late here- my aunt started dating this guy a while after my uncle passed away. Seems nice at first. She ends up basically buying him a house. He quits his job, the whole 9 yards. \n\nMy aunt has 2 dogs. Now apparently this guy decided he hates dogs now and they\u2019re too loud and annoying and ends up giving her the ultimatum. When she chooses the dogs he tells her she\u2019ll never find love with those dogs around. So he\u2019s kinda jobless and out of housing right now. Good luck to him lol",
            "I was having trouble getting along with my wife's dog for a solid 9 months for a weird point in our marriage. Dog was just tearing everything up. Wife tried to give her away. I went to the shelter and picked her dog back up. No fucking way I was gonna let her pick me over her dog. Eventually I figured out what was up. She needed a friend and a large dog run to play and get tired in. No problems since. My wife was sad giving her up. Even if they pick you over the pet please don't let them do it guys and girls. That pet means alot to them.",
            "My (former) best friend gave up her dog and her cat for her boyfriend of <6 months! He said that he was afraid of animals but was willing to get therapy to deal with his fear, and then after they got serious he straight up backtracked (this was one of MANY red flags) and said he could never live with them. Her animals were the most docile, sweet pets ever - I was living with her at the time so took care of them frequently, as she basically abandoned them to stay at his place from the week they met. She sent them to live with her dad in Texas so she could move in with him ASAP - speaks to how desperate she was to have a boyfriend, but I felt so so bad for the dog especially as he really loved her. Couldn\u2019t look at her the same again after that!",

That didn\u2019t matter, HE wanted me to have one, so he demanded I rehome the cat. I rehomed him instead. The look on his face when I took him to his mother\u2019s house was pretty priceless.",
            "I stole my ex\u2019s dog. She\u2019s a little chi weenie that we fought over since day one. She\u2019s my little baby. She bonded hard with me. And my ex hated that. She hated that a dog would choose me over her. We fought constantly because she wanted to get rid of her. She peed in the house from time to time and was just mischievous. I always cleaned it up and constantly worked on her habits though they are still not 100% it\u2019s a lot better. I told her you chose to adopt a dog from the pound with a past not knowing her age, you don\u2019t have the right to take her back to the pound after she finally feels safe and has now bonded with my dog. \n\nAnyways, we split and she said she\u2019s taking Cleo. I laughed and said I will take this to court. I have documentation of you saying you are going to put her down or release her to the wild. Not to mention, you would cause issues with my dog due to them now being a bonded pair (if they don\u2019t go to places together the other loses their mind or gets super depressed until the other is back, vet trips are fun). Soooo I came home from work when she moved out and my dog was gone. She didn\u2019t believe I would take this to court. I went to her new apartment, took my dog and said we can do this if you want but I would prefer not to ruin your life. We argued and I told her I would gladly go to court if you want and you can fight for this dog but as of now she is coming home. Haven\u2019t heard from her since.",
            "My dogs have basically called my relationships in a way. I was in a relationship with a guy that seemed to like my dog (who I had had for 8 years at that point) but accused the dog of trying to come between us because he liked to lay on my lap on the couch. He\u2019d get right angry about that. We broke up. \n\nEnded up getting engaged to someone who had wanted me to get rid of my dog because they was allergic. They never made an ultimatum, but when I told them I couldn\u2019t get rid of my dog and maybe they could try allergy pills, they lost their mind. We did move in together and my dog was banished to certain rooms of the house. I hated it. My dog hated it. Luckily that situation only lasted a year. \n\nI got another dog who is scared of all strangers. When I met my now fianc\u00e9, I told him that she was scared of everyone and to just be patient with her. After a month of him being the perfect patient guy, she fell in love with him and now they\u2019re besties. I finally picked the right person.",
            "Plot twist: My cat doesn\u2019t like my GF when she comes over. He meowed me an ultimatum to choose between him and her, but told him I won\u2019t dump my GF over him. He pouts but learns to live with it.",
            "No me but a friend. Her Bf started cussing out at her dog cause he had gnawed on his shoelaces ( a little Boston terrier, a smart doggy but what a pita he was). Cussing amped up to trying to kick the dog. My friend laid on her BF something fierce, next thing she knows her soon to be exBF has pulled a knife out of the block and is lunging at her dog\n\nFor some goddamned shoelaces, of all things.\n\nShe grabbed her dog, kinda wrapped herself around him and.. Ahole BF nicked her arm with the blade.\n\nCops were called and A hole didn't even go to jail, one of the cops even going all the way to \"Just a fucking dog, should have let him skewer it and be done\". \n\nGood thing is the story did the rounds in the neighbourhood / town rather quickly and Ahole had to move away cause everybody wanted to have a .. stern word with him.",

            "My fiance and I were literally just talking about this. When I first moved in with him, he asked me if I had a problem with the cats because he knew I was very allergic and not a huge cat person. I said I'd bring my air purifier and my Zyrtec. As soon as I found a better job, I signed up for allergy shots.\n\nAt the same time, we had friends who were also moving in together. She had cat allergies, he had two older cats. She made him rehome them, and while looking for someone to take them, she posted online, joking that she was going to drown them in a burlap bag.\n\nI read her post while my arms were red and swollen from my shots and it just made me so angry. \n\nBTW, my fiance's cats had me wrapped around their paws within a year. They were both so sweet, they turned me into a cat person. They have sadly passed away, but we have two new kittens filling up the house again (and I am constantly fighting the urge to get a 3rd).",
            "My ex used to chase his cat around the house. Poor kitty was so scared. I took him to divorce court over that cat. Now she's sleeping on my lap with her sister and she never has to run around the house unless it's happy zoomies.",

            "Not quite how the rest of the stories go, but when I was in high school, I met a boy and started dating him about a month later.  We obviously didn't know each other super well yet, so I decided if he didn't like animals or didn't treat them well, he wouldn't be the one for me, though I didn't tell him this initially.  The first time I went to his house, he took me all over the neighborhood and introduced me to all of the neighbor dogs.  He knew every single one of them by name (and did not know a single one of the human neighbors' names lol) and they all loved him.  When I brought him to my house for the first time, my golden retriever fell harder for him than I had, and he had a blast playing with my chickens, ducks, and cats.   \n\nWe're in our 30's now.  For our 13th anniversary a couple years ago, we each got the other a lizard, and we have a bunch of other animals too.  It turned out that he did like animals quite a lot, and also he ended up being the one for me after all.",
            "He never specifically gave me an ultimatum but the few times this guy I saw was over at mine, he would legitimately POUT whenever I gave attention to my cats. Was just weird about it. I told him we\u2019re a package deal from the start and he said he was cool with that but spoiler alert: he lied. He turned out to be a total asshole in the end and I\u2019m much better off with my current boyfriend so if you\u2019re out there Tyler, thanks for dumping me over Snapchat for being \u2018too soft\u2019. I\u2019d rather be soft and snuggling with my kitties than with your rude ass.",
            "If they are giving me an ultimatum like that, I wouldn\u2019t even want that person in my life. Giving up my pet for a person that could potentially break up with me the next day (whether to be petty or the relationship not working out) ? Nah, I\u2019m good.",
            "I came home from a 9 month deployment in Afghanistan to find my wife had gotten a new dog. I suspect that while I was deployed she was getting drunk and abusing it. Within days of me being home the dog and I were best friends and it wanted nothing to do with her. We got into daily fights, usually multiple times a day, because the dog was following me around and got on the couch or in the bed with me. At one point she told me to choose between her and the dog and I told her I choose the dog. Believe it or not that was one of the things that led to the downward spiral that ended up in divorce. So now I'm single and I have her dog and she still hates me and gives me shit about it. The dog is a bulldog/poodle mix, her name is Naughty and we are still best friends. My ex-wife is still the bigger bitch.",

            "I love the (correct) assumption that everyone here chose their pet.",
            "He said he wanted back all the gifts he'd given me since I was choosing my dogs over him. I can't describe how satisfying it was to see his face when I pulled out a box with every single thing he'd given me over the past year, I told him I was originally going to toss it in the garbage but if he wanted it back then he was free to look through it and make sure everything was there while sitting on the porch since I was on my way out to walk the dogs. The whole thing had been brought about because he had originally stated he was planning on getting a husky, when I had asked if he had any experience with dogs in general because huskies aren't the best dogs for first time owners and require a lot of maintenance especially in California where we lived. He had shrugged it off and said it wouldn't be a problem because \"I'll be it's owner, what more is there to owning a dog.\" Then it spiralled into a week of arguments because he found out that I allowed my dogs on the furniture, i had to cancel a date due to a vet emergency, and one day he showed up early for our rescheduled date and I was about to walk my dogs so I suggested he tag along and see how he'd do with walking the more rambunctious of the three dogs. I showed him how to properly hold the leash, how and when to use the commands I had taught the dogs, and I have him a rundown on the dog I was letting him walk. My ex failed miserably for about 3 blocks so I had him switch with a different dog; that dog ended up just walking themselves, so I had him swap to the third dog which he refused to walk because \"it's not manly and it'll be embarrassing\" so I walked all the dogs by myself and told him to wait until I finished. I got back and got dressed for our date and on our way to the date we continued arguing and he eventually said \"I'm serious, it's either me or the dogs.\"",

When we started dating, I wasn\u2019t a dog person and just looked at Abby (the dog) like she was a cutie but nothing more. Then I started to take her on walks and play with her and we formed a bond that has kept strong for 8 years. I\u2019m no longer with this girl but when we broke up she knew she couldn\u2019t split Abby and I apart, so she let me keep her.

            "Depends on the bank. Landlords usually have the place mortgaged so they need to pay the bank bi-weekly. If the banks would be lenient then it would be possible for the landlords to be as well. Then you have to factor in monthly hydro/water if these are included in rent. Unless these companies are also lenient then all this would be coming out of the landlords pocket.\n\nEdit: 1: I am seeing a lot of misinformed accusations with obvious lack of knowledge. \n\nOwning a rental unit does not mean you do not owe money on it. It is likely mortgaged and the rent goes to paying that mortgage for the Rental Home\n\n        2. It is a long term investment. No one is making money from the rent. It goes to pay all fee\u2019s needed to make it a rental property.  (Mortgage to pay the bank, emergency funds for repairs etc). \n\n      3. Pretend you own a home instead of renting one.

            "I am a landlord with 3 buildings at 10 units plus a 4bdrm house. I am ALWAYS lenient with tenants. For example, I am currently reclaiming an apartment from a hoarder; it was morally wrong to allow him to live the way he did, plus it was.a health hazard for the building. He is not evicted; he is undergoing counseling and living with his son while I invest 15g in remodelling his 2bdrm apartment. When he returns, his rent will only increase by $50. It will take me more than 2yrs to begin seeing a RTO for the apartment. \nAlso in the same building, I have another tenant between jobs, so even though he's missed a month, he'll pay when he can with no late fees. Another tenant is in the same boat. \nSo in one building, I have 3 of apartments not making money. In another building, I had to evict a tenant for sub-leasing to a squatter (didn't pay rent, and had extended family). I have been without rent for that apartment for 6mos, and I will have to remodel. The 2nd apartment in that building is a family of 3 on a single income. The husband recently put them in a bind buying something online, messing up their rent schedule. Rather than being a dick, we set up a split payment with no penalty sonthey can make up their 3mos of late rent.\nThe 3rd building is at capacity and on time, but property taxes and water are atrocious. Fortunately there is enough profit their to still make the other two buildings float, and i mean just enough after paying 10g in taxes for ALL our buildings for the 1/2 year.\nI personally take care of my apartments, ensure my tenants have their fundamental right to live worry-free in their home, but I simply must have a RTO on the properties in order to maintain them plus the equipment I use to maintain them.\n\nTL;DR no reason for landlords to be cunts but tenants still need to pay rent; it's their responsibility.

We rented it out only because we were underwater and would have had to bring $10K+ to the table to sell it and we didn\u2019t have the money.  Have only had one tenant ever, 5+ years, never raised the rent on her.  Will probably sell it if she ever moves out, has been a great tenant and I\u2019m not going to get that lucky again.\n\nMy tenant works in early childhood education (preschool), is paid hourly, is highly likely to end up out of work for some number of weeks during this situation, and thus will have a month or two where she can\u2019t pay her rent.\n\nThere is no way on earth we would evict her.  Not only would it be morally repugnant, it would also be terrible business.  She\u2019ll do her best to catch up once she is back at work, and even if she never does, she\u2019s a good tenant and now would be a pretty terrible time to sell real estate.\n\nFor the record though, there\u2019s no way that her boss in a for profit company will pay her when they shut down (even though they will be asking the parents of their students to keep paying), and there is no way my mortgage company is going to do their bit and waive payments and interest accrual during this time.

If you've got a reliable tenant who doesn't tear up the property or the neighborhood and who's paid their rent on time up to now, what do you gain from evicting them? There's not going to be a line of people to take the unit, and even if you find another tenant, who's to say they'd be as good? You could be moving out a good tenant, and moving in a problem tenant, just to keep from losing 1-2 months' rent that you're unlikely to get anyway. Madness.",

Law enforcement should also be ordered to halt evictions, which lets face it, would only make this crisis worse.

And the second movie ends with George activating nukes underground in a last ditch hail mary and blowing Earth up.\n\n\nWhile yes, it could've been avoided if Zaius just helped George, _why should he have?_ Everything from both the Apes religious beliefs and their knowledge of history shows mankind to be an evil, destructive species (and while yes we're also doing good, lets be honest its always been our destructive efforts that have lead more lasting impacts on the world).

            "So this is a little trolly and not for the good of humankind, but I really hated calculus and there was this monk in the 13th century who nearly destroyed Archimedes Palimpsest by writing all over it cause he couldn't find fresh paper.  If he had shit his pants in that moment, he might have destroyed it by wiping his butt with it, and then we wouldn't have calculus.\n\nEDIT: Or the opposite could happen, and he could leave the room to clean his ass, come back with fresh paper, and the Archimedes Palimpsest would still exist.  This isn\u2019t a foolproof scenario.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for awards and upvotes y\u2019all. I definitely got this story mixed up.  Palimpsest is a type of document, the type of document that the monk was creating using Archimedes\u2019 notes on early calculus.  He destroyed the notes so I basically had this story completely flipped.  As I pointed out to another user, I\u2019d still shit pants this dude - cause in all reality, he probably set us back quite a bit, and we\u2019d be a more advanced species if he didn\u2019t fuck up Archimedes\u2019 notes.\n\nEDIT 3: Yes, Newton and Leibniz invented calculus. I was initially confused and misunderstood, thinking that Newton and Leibniz were actually influenced by Archimedes notes and that they were preserved.  This has since been pointed out to me as incorrect, and that is accurate. We only recently understood Archimedes role in the history of calculus and the records weren\u2019t preserved.  Folks, here\u2019s the lesson - even when you think you\u2019re being witty with history you need to double-check your facts. I just learned that the hard way.\n\nEDIT 4:  I don't know who is right anymore.  Turns out the Palimpsest is a specific document that was recently discovered and was almost destroyed but ultimately preserved - not a type of document as others are trying to point out.  Based on everyone's comments, and my original understanding of the document, I have to think that this is just a game of telephone with history.",

            "In Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963 at 12:30pm, United States President John F. Kennedy shits his pants while participating in the presidential motorcade. He doubles over in pain from a stomach cramp as the trigger is pulled. The bullet misses Kennedy and the Texas Governer in front of him, but the attack is definitely noticed and the motorcade speeds away to safety; the bullet meant for Kennedy's skull hits the vehicle's bumper instead, subsequent shots fail to slow the vehicle down or harm anyone. Only Governer Connally, their wives, and the secret service agents are made aware of the president shitting his pants as they rush away to save the President's life and, more importantly, his dignity.\n\nThe CIA is dismantled and the American-Cuban war begins after a bipartisan investigation implicates John McCone, Sam Giancana, and Fidel Castro as the conspirators to assassinate the president. Lee Harvey Oswald spends much longer at the Texas School Book Repository than he would have otherwise, whether because of his continued shots at the assassination attempt or because instead, as an innocent but paranoid communist defector with only a concealed handgun to defend himself from his capitalist demons, the news of Kennedy's assassination attempt and survival led to a different mood and different personal decisions that day... we'll never know. Because of the delay, Officer Tippit never runs into Oswald on the street and isn't killed. Tippit retires from police work 15 years later and after another decade passes away from the same cancer that would take his son almost 30 years after his own passing. The world never learns Oswald's name.\n\nFour months later all important assets retained after the CIA is disbanded are absorbed by the FBI; Project MKUltra is declassified and disseminated to the public 50 years early. The American-Cuban war ends with less than 100 United States soldiers injured in action, even fewer killed. Cuba becomes an unincorporated American territory alongside Puerto Rico. Castro is never officially documented as being found. Whether killed during the short war, taken as political prisoner to never see the light of day again, or successfully fleeing his country, the public is never told. Fringe conspiracy theories of his continued political imprisonment, reported sightings in eastern Europe, and multiple veterans taking undue credit for his assassination during the war are all that can be found about him. Canada's current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is never born.\n\nKennedy serves two full terms; Lyndon Johnson still succeeds him as the 36th President. Former Vice President Richard Nixon is never elected to a government position again, and former actor and Governer Ronald Reagan is found having unexpectedly passed away from an autoerotic asphyxia mishap in September of 1977.\n\n**Edit:** Johnson's and Nixon's fate changed........A user pointed out that the reason Nixon was even nominated as a candidate to begin with is invalidated if Kennedy serves two terms, and so Lyndon Johnson is more likely to win election instead.

She always did her best to be so cheerful and make learning fun. But the thing that truly solidified her spot as my favorite teacher was that for every student\u2019s birthday she would give you a personalized mini notebook. It was just a simple small composition notebook but she had filled the first couple pages telling me how much she loved having me as a student, how far she knew I would go, and other affirmations.

On one of the first days in her class, she explained how she went from being a kindergarten teacher to a high school senior teacher.\n\nShe always saw off her cute and happy kindergarten kids, but as they grew up and they came back to visit her, a lot of them came to her troubled and dissatisfied with their lives. It made her real emotional about how people had treated these kids she loved so much, how she couldn't afford to see kids so disconnected with life, and how she didn't want them to suffer as they headed out towards college and their adult lives.\n\nSo she changed curriculums and started teaching seniors. If I remember right, it always came down to sending her kids off with a smile, prepping them for the real world.\n\nI respect the hell out of her and she'll always be one of my favorites. Truly like a mother to all her students.",

The kids in there ranged from having mild aspergers to full on severe autism, and as such most teachers treated everyone from there like they had severe  mental health problems just because they were labelled as having autism or aspergers even if it was very mild. But there was one support teacher in the cdu who was genuinely just a nice dude, whether he was talking to kids who had severe autism or just some mild social anxiety he wouldn\u2019t talk extra slowly or call you \u201cbud\u201d or \u201cpal\u201d at the end of a sentence, he would talk to everyone like they were real human beings.

Small stuff like 10 minutes of playtime for example. bigger parts, meant bigger rewards. As the students did well (good marks, good behaviour etc), they got stickers and you stuck it on the picture. It was a class effort as you all worked towards the prizes and for our young minds this was amazing as we never had that kind of incentive.\n\nSecond there was student of the day. The MVP of the class and she would announce it at the end of the day in front of the class so that YOU knew that you were the MVP and EVERYONE else knew it and how you earnt it.

He would even offer rides if we needed them, no judgment. We all cherished him. Best teacher by far I've ever had.",

            "This may sound weird, but I grew up in an incredibly abusive household (spent years not knowing if I'd be alive the next day bad), in High School I connected with my English teacher who was an incredibly kind woman.  I do not know why I told her, but I'm pretty sure looking back now, it wasn't that hard to tell my situation was messed up.  Anyways, she was the first adult I ever told I was being abused.  Which for me was huge, I have massive trust issues given those who were there to protect me have never done so.  \n\nGiven that this was over 20 years ago now, there wasn't really the obligation to tell someone in the same way things seem to exist now.  It was just starting to be a thing.  I had told her because I wanted help for me and my younger brother.  However, I made the mistake of telling my mom, who immediately panicked and told me I was going to foster care and I'd never see my brother again, all the horrible things.  Knowing some kids in the system it did impact me, also knowing some horror stories as a survivor of sexual abuse and trafficking, I was terrified of ending up right back in that.\n\nI told my teacher the next day to please not tell anyone, she never asked me why, she just respected my wishes.  I can't imagine, knowing who else is as a person now, how hard that must have been.  She told me if I ever changed my mind, she would do everything in her power to help us, so in a way I felt better, if I could come up with a way to make it work.  From that point until graduation she made sure to connect me with folks (her church community) to help me obtain some basic needs things, such as glasses (I'm super blind, with a bad astigmatism so very expensive and growing up in poverty with no assistance doesn't get you far) and food. \n\nTo this day I have a lot of respect for my old teacher.  It may not seem like much and to some, her not reporting could be looked at as bad. However, she gave me a reason to keep going and showed me that I was someone worth caring about, in a world that until that point never cared about me.  I would say that earns a lot of respect, because she could have done absolutely nothing and she definitely did not have to listen, but she did.",
            "Some students decided to be completely silent for an entire lesson and got all of us in on it, so when our teacher greeted us, asked us questions etc., we all stayed quiet. He told us to discuss something and we all started typing or using made-up sign language. We could tell he was annoyed and said if we don't stop he'd make us do a test, and we soon broke and started talking/laughing.\n\nWhat really got me was our teacher saying that after thinking \"what's wrong with these children\", he started wondering if *he* did anything wrong to us. Normal teachers would have just snapped at us or assumed we were being stupid, but he actually thought about the things he did and tried to find an explanation.",

Then he\u2019d give a lecture for 20 mins. After that, we were free to do whatever we wanted. We can work on his homework, or homework of another class. He didn\u2019t care as long as we weren\u2019t distributive. \n\nHe also wouldn\u2019t care if anyone was late to class. When I asked him why he\u2019s so chill with the students he just said kids these days have a lot more on their plate than before. And not just academics. He said he can\u2019t even begin to understand how we process social pressures, family pressures, and even extra-curricular.  We were just kids, and sometimes giving kids 45 mins to do whatever they wanted instead of being told what to do is what we needed. \n\nHe also hung out with my friends and I a lot, and shared stories about his raids in World of Warcraft. I miss that guy.",

I have autism and I was trying to have a good day, hang out with friends, do my homework but it was Senior Prank Day and one of the seniors thought that it would be funny to be an asshole to me. I have emotional issues cuz of my autism. \n\nI was feeling angry and very upset because of it. (It's hard for me to control myself when I'm upset which is why I'm trying to see a therapist but I'm having financial trouble.) Luckily the math teacher seen it and sent them to the Principal's office and took me to a different room to talk to me, let me talk to my dad on the phone, and helped me calm down.

She took me into an empty class room and then rather than shit all over me for being an asshole, she spoke to me as an equal. She acknowledged that I was likely bored in the class and I was excelling. At the end of it, she calmly stated that in the future if I felt the need to call her a bitch, I was to asked her to leave class and do it face to face. I never felt the need to do it again.

            "I think I\u2019ve told this story already, but I\u2019ll tell it again because I love this professor.\n\nThis was during a time in my life where my mental health was spiraling down out of control and I was struggling to get out of bed let alone get to class.  I was in the middle of figuring out all the paperwork to transfer to a different university, I had zero friends at this point and I was also trying to find a new tenant to take over my lease so I could move back home when the semester was over.  On top of that I had 4 classes worth of work including a big term paper for a tech writing class.  That term paper was due the following day and I hadn\u2019t even started it because I was dealing with all that other stuff.  I emailed my professor asking if I could come to her office and talk.  She agreed and I went.  I told her I was not ok and that I was struggling with my mental health and so many other life things that I hadn\u2019t even started the term paper.  She looked at me and said she was sorry that I was struggling.  We literally talked for almost an hour just me talking through all of my shit with her.  That\u2019s when I found out that she was a counselor and a therapist before she became a professor.  She was so kind and understanding and she gave me an \u201cunlimited extension\u201d on the paper (basically I could turn it in anytime before finals week with no late penalty) and she said if I needed anything, even just someone to talk to, that she was an email away.  I thanked her profusely and went back to my apartment feeling like the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders.  I turned the paper in 2 weeks later and got an A minus.  To this day, I regard her as THE best professor I ever had in my entire college experience.  She\u2019s the only professor that actually made an effort to understand her student\u2019s struggles and make sure she or her class weren\u2019t adding to them.",

            "My 7th grade teacher referred to students as \u201cBright Eyes,\u201d the same name one of the apes called Charleston Heston\u2019s character in Planet of the Apes (In other words, there\u2019s signs of lower intelligence in there somewhere. I can see it in your eyes).",

            "Had a really cool art teacher back in high school (btw this is from almost 12 years ago). So there's a lot I could say, especially since he kind of herded the kids with home problems together and joked with us, got us out of our shells and told us stuff like we could sit in his classroom/office if we ever needed a quiet spot, would ask if we'd eaten and bring us food if we hadn't, try and cheer us up if we seemed down, etc. But I have two main stories. \n\nThe first is a smaller example before I get to the main one. But as a lgbt person myself, I like it a lot. Because it was high school, there was a rumor going around that this said teacher was gay, and the stereotypical people were spreading it and making fun of him and all that. The first day of my photo class, this girl on the cheerleading team decided that she was just going to ask a full grown man if he was gay, in this mocking/joking tone of voice. Entire class just falls silent, and teacher just stares at her. I mean full eye contact for a good couple minutes, stone-faced, hands clasped behind his back. The look on his face was like: \"you *really* said that, huh?\" When she eventually got uncomfortable and dropped eye contact, he said, very quietly & slowly: \"And is that any of your damn business?\" She mumbled a very quiet 'no.' and he goes: 'that's right.\" and told us that we were to sit quietly for the rest of the class block, so an hour and a half in silence. Instant respect after that. Girl ended up switching to another art class instead of photography.\n\nBut there's this one time that made me think \"that's the kind of adult I want to be.\" There was this kid who I guess you could call the class clown? Loud, kinda obnoxious, did dumb stuff just for the sake of it/seeing if he could get a rise out of teachers, never took anything seriously, etc. He wasn't mean/a bully; he just acted like he literally didn't give a shit and would challenge teachers all the time, and did really annoying \"pranks,\" but nothing that actually hurt anybody. Anyway, one day he was doing his usual schtick in photo class (I think he was flicking lights on and off in the darkroom while a couple of his friends were in there or something), and art teacher decided he'd had enough. But I want to stress: he was not angry. He was completely calm; didn't raise his voice or anything. \n\nIn front of the whole class, he walks up to this kid, and just asks: \"what are you doing?\" Kid laughs and makes some joke. Art teacher looks him dead in the face, completely calm/kind of pityingly, says: \"why?\" Kid makes another joke. Art teacher goes: \"no no no, slow down and really answer me here. Why are you doing this? Why do you act like this? Do you want attention? What's up?\"\n\nKid starts to act flustered. Teacher says: \"It just doesn't make any sense. Why do you feel the need to act this way all the time?\" There was COMPLETE silence (by this point we were all like 'oh, shit') and so he goes on, \"I'm disappointed. You're smarter than this. You don't need to act like this all the time.\" Kid mumbled something, looks away, and teacher goes: \"No look at me, you're not stupid. You think people are laughing with you? We're laughing at you. Is this really who you wanna be?\"\n\nKid was dead silent, bright red, starts apologizing and the teacher continues: \"I don't want you to apologize. I'm just trying to understand here. Do you really think you need to act like this all the time?\"\n\nKid finally lets out a quiet, 'no' and he completely calms down. Teacher goes: \"well then, don't.\" and walks away. \n\nFrom that day on, this kid did a complete 180 in that classroom. He was paying attention, answering questions, not pulling any of his stupid pranks, and started to do some decent artwork. I think no adult had ever talked to him on his level before that art teacher. Idk, maybe that kid had some problems at home or something, and his act was a defense/way to cope. The art teacher actually listened to him and that's what got through, I think. That an adult would actually talk to him like a person. All the other teachers would just not deal with it and kick him out and that sort of thing. They wrote him off, and I think the art teacher was the first teacher that didn't. Thinking about it now, the patience and kindness of that art teacher that day is amazing. \n\nI think of that a lot; if only for the reason that I try to remember to treat kids like actual people and talk to them with the same respect I\u2019d give an adult.",
            "This was almost 20 years ago, but same-sex marriage was a hot topic among the public and media in Canada because its legality was being decided either at the Provincial or Federal level (I can't remember the details).\n\nMy high school physics teacher was an old school, hard as iron, soft-spoken teacher - maybe in his 50s. The kind that would tell you to get out of his class if you didn't complete last night's homework by pointing to the door without any words needed to be said. You either feared or hated him, there wasn't any in-between.\n\nAnyway, one day we're all sitting in class doing work... and he's reading the newspaper. He sets down the paper and breaks the silence, without any context, about how he vividly remembers being at a park with his grandma when he was a child. He was thirsty and went to go drink from the public fountain, but his grandma stopped him and told him \"only dogs and n\\*ggers drink from public fountains.\"\n\nHe went on to say how that really stuck with him, because he was white, came from a middle class family, was Catholic and heterosexual -  he never faced any discrimination growing up. He was always in the majority. And how he feels so ashamed about that memory because time revealed how wrong his grandma's mindset was even though it was the norm during that time.\n\nHe simply mused out loud \"I wonder how people 50 years from now will view us and our decisions.\"\n\nThen picked up the paper, and didn't say another word until the bell rung.\n\nNo one said anything but we all understood what he was talking about.\n\nI don't remember anything from HS physics beyond f=ma but I remember that lesson real well.\n\nedit: looked it up, same-sex marriage was legalised in Canada in the summer of 2005!",

            "An English teacher at my high school taught through cancer. She was always a controversial teacher, butted heads with admin etc, but was the best teacher I've ever had. I took 3 classes with her in high school, and during the 2nd class, she was gone for the entire semester, but no one in the staff would confirm why, even though all the students had suspicions.\nI signed up for her again when she was still on the class list, and the first class, she showed up wearing a bandana. I'll never forget her line:\n\"No, this isn't a fashion statement... I have cancer. So if any of you decide to be sick, this is the one semester when I'm okay with you slipping my class. Sorry, but I'm not dying for one of you.\"\nShe continued to teach for the next 5 years, well after my class had graduated, and into the pandemic of 2020, still battling her cancer, until some of her friends told her it was time to stop. She had been slowing down, and it was easy to see trying to work was taxing her. She agreed, and took her leave.\nShe died the next day.

            "In my last year of high school a few of us made a volleyball team. The teacher was the head of the sports department and we had training 2 mornings during the week before school. One day he starts off by apologising for keeping his phone by his side. We think how odd? Did he really have to tell us that? Training finishes and he steps outside while we pack up to answer a call he must have been expecting. It was the hospital. His partner had just gone into labour! So he left for the day, but still managed to rock up at 7am for training. Absolute legend",

Ultimately, laughing wasn\u2019t cool. He spoke to us like peers about it and put it in way we understood.

            "Okay, if there's one AskReddit post where I'm late to the party, but I want people to see my response, this is the one. I'm a physics teacher myself now, and this teacher was a key inspiration to me.\n\nAt the beginning of high school this teacher established himself as probably the most rigorous person I've ever met. Each lesson about 6-8 students were at the board from the very first minute, he didn't waste one second of his class ever, all he talked about was physics, even in Christmas he sent us problem sets about heat, so we could \"get warmer with some physics\". Yeah, his jokes were rare, but that's what made them special.\n\nHis relentlesness was polarizing to most of us - at times we hated that we never had a free pass, at times it was reason for some good-natured jokes. But the teacher sure knew how to make us try hard snd work for our success.\n\nLuckily, I was one of the brightest students in the class. But naturally, I was an ass. I skipped a class? Yeah, sure I can afford it, but I WILL come tuesday morning before classes to make it square with him.\n\nWell, come year 12, he asks he will take the exam in physics through a sheet of paper with colums \"yes - no - maybe\". Already having the necessary minimum of exams, I checked \"maybe\". When he got the paper back, he loudly exclaimed for all to hear \"GoldenPotato checked maybe??? That's a good one, like I'll ever let him get away with it\". He scratched my name and put it in a \"yes\" column. See you every week.\n\nMind you, I loved learning from this teacher and he was a big inspiration for me even then. But his big moment for me was moments before the exam, administered by neutral scrutineers and city council representatives. He was giving us final tips, like \"2 points for the task - that means 2 formulas.\" Councilwoman heard that and said \"Arnold, you are required to leave now\". He explodes: \"I still have 2 minutes to use, and I shall use those 2 minutes to teach them all I can.\" Holy crap, with all his by-the-rules approach, he sure showed everyone that he was doing all of this in our best interests.\n\nAs I'm in my third year of teaching, I still try to uphold the best standards of teaching (still struggling with it), but I never forgot that these lessons are our common goal and while I'm teaching these high schoolers, I remember to keep their best interests in mind and if there's opportunity to prove that we're on the same side, I use it. Thank you, Arnold, and I hope we'll still have time to become colleagues.",

So fast-forward 6 years, I'm in a gifted grade 6 program at my original school after having moved schools multiple times. Tragically, we lost her. On the Monday after we had received the news, I see the gifted grade 8 teacher in the hallway who I never really knew; I just knew that she was close friends with my kindergarten teacher. She runs up to me and chokes me in a bear hug, telling me how much my kindergarten teacher told her about me, and how she knew I would be in her class one day. I've loved that teacher ever since that day, and I still keep in touch with her while in high school.",

            "Had an all boy class in the equivalent of high school for me country. We were all just tech guys eagerly waiting to get on to university and we couldn't give less of a fuck about what this guy was teaching us since it was the equivalent of an English class in America. \n\nThe teacher quickly realized that we weren't going to engage with him on any level about stuff like analyzing poems and language. He took another approach which was to start arguments about something (sneakily relavent to what we were supposed to be studying) and then he would absolutely demolish us when we tried to counter argue. But he wouldn't just stop there, he would personally attack us if we did stupid things or argued in a stupid way, which made the whole class sound like a rap crew whenever he threw around his artistically crafted and clever insults. He wasn't ever mean but if you couldn't argue your point he would just slam you so hard until the whole class was laughing at you. \n\nThe result was that everybody listened to him because you didn't want to be the one laughed at when you couldn't argue your point and we all tried to outwit the teacher but with little success. I talk with the majority of my class almost every day 8 years and this one teacher have changed everything about how we go about arguing and debating. We all became extremely sharp at debating and explaining our point and the trend of shitting on people for bad arguments have carried on to this day. We don't care whether we are right or wrong when we debate either. It's considered a win if you admit defeat and realize that your opponent was right. \n\nThis entire group of people have all had a major shift in how they communicate and debate, solely because of this man.

            "I should preface this by stating that I grew up in a working class, former mining town far from London, and I am of an immigrant background (Estonian by ethnicity, which was not a member of the EU when my family moved here before I was born).\n\nFirstly, one of the main points that people like to throw around when it comes to the Brexit debate is immigration, so let's start with that.\n\nImmigration, especially in terms of the quotas the EU was trying to impose on us, simply weren't practical for the ordinary people of the UK. Britain is a densely populated island. We are in the midst of a housing crisis and our NHS is on the brink of collapse. We are struggling to cope with our population as it stands, and importing hundreds of thousands of people per year who statistically are more likely to have more children is going to cause further pressures down the line.\n\nThe immigration argument is usually mobilised by remainers to try and paint Brexiteers as \"racist\" (or a similar word), when the way that businessmen make use of the high rates of immigration is actually pretty exploitative all things considered. Foreign workers are more likely to work for cheaper pay, which means that businessmen employed them in their thousands in order to be able to get away with underpaying workers for cheap labour. Native workers just couldn't keep up with that and lost a lot of work. This is where the whole \"immigrants taking our jobs\" thing comes from. Whilst many remainers like to mock this, it's actually a huge problem which affects not only the now underpaid foreign workers, but working class labourers too, who are now expected to accept lower pay for their work. At the end of it all, the main beneficiary of the immigration policy is businessmen who exploit foreign workers to increase their own profits. \n\nAnother problem with the EU is that, as a globalist organisation working on a huge, international scale, it is necessary for the EU to centralise where it can to save time and prevent dithering. That's understandable. What that did mean for the UK is that London became even more of the UK's economic centre than it was before, and meant that a larger proportion of capital flowed towards London. This of course benefited London and the South East (and is probably why London and SE voted to remain). However, it meant that less investment went to smaller towns whose industries were now being forgotten for cheaper industrial prices abroad (which is again facilitated by EU policy). Industries shut down, and people lost jobs. However, because the money that Britain was gaining from the EU was mostly going to London (as I will say once again, London mostly does benefit from the EU, hence why they voted to stay), we didn't get funding to create new jobs here, and our schools were (and still are) disgustingly underfunded. One of the nearest schools to where I lived has only 1% of students achieving the EBacc (which means you pass a certain amount of core academic subjects, it's not considered difficult usually), and the wider picture is not pretty either. Likewise, our local hospitals are constantly running out of beds to treat patients in, and again, we do not receive the funding to fix that. Meanwhile, because London got plenty of money from the EU, they were able to maintain their high speed railways and vanity projects. This was a bit of a kick in the teeth for working class towns and in my opinion definitely caused resentment. \n\nThere is a LOT more to it, but ultimately something that I don't see a lot in the Brexit debate is the idea that some areas benefit more than others. Did London benefit? On the whole, yes. But whether or not the forgotten working class towns in the North and Midlands did is an entirely different story. I'm not exactly a huge fan of socialism myself, but even I think that the EU's use of capitalism genuinely does harm the working class here, whether or not groups who profess to be in the working class' interests want to admit it.",

            "I voted remain, but recently, and for the first time, I'm seeing some well reasoned arguments for leaving. I think I may have fallen victim to the echo chamber effect, where all I was seeing from the Leave side were the most extreme examples of daftness and racism. Likewise, I expect Leave voters have only seen the worst of the Remain side. When I dig deep, I don't actually have any great admiration for the EU. What made me want to keep them was that I perceived them as keeping the UK right in check, particularly the Conservatives. I like that they mean we have certain workers rights, human rights, business regulations etc. I worry that Conservatives would ditch those in a heart beat. But what I'm actually doing is aligning with an undemocratic institution, because they've done some things that I like. In exactly the same way that Leavers aligned with the Conservatives when May tried to bypass parliament in triggering Article 50, and Boris literally broke the law to prevent parliament debating his deal. I still wouldn't vote Leave, but I wouldn't be so quick to vote Remain either. I think the Tories have been an absolute disgrace through this whole thing, and could have achieved a lot more by taking a measured approach to dealing with Britain's numerous issues that got blamed on the EU. As a member, we could have addressed issues with the EU itself. If we were going to Leave, they should have had a plan, and they should have had cross party consensus. That would have been the decent, democratic thing to do, especially given the split result. Instead, they're playing political games and using Brexit to desperately cling to power. I'm still terrified of them.",

            "I'm 29 and voted to leave the European Union for the following reasons (tl;dr at the end)\n\n* I work in the development of flexible and renewable power generation in the UK, have done for my entire working life, i've installed over 750MW in the last 7 years, a combination of onshore wind, energy storage (batteries), flexible gas generation and demand side repsonse technology.\n* My small industry is incredibly important to the UK energy market, not only because it is critical to the growth of renewable clean generation but also because we provide the peaking service which is critical to prevent blackouts, our market was effectively brought to its knees in from 2014 to 2019 with several key leaders in the market going out of business or laying off huge numbers of staff and essentially mothballing the industry.\n* The reason for the market downturn was because of the UK government being taken to court by an Australian energy consultancy who claimed that the method by which contracts are awarded to build generating sites was in breach of the EU's state aid rules, despite the EU initially approving the process several years earlier. Because of the court case there was a freeze on payments for existing contracts which had been awarded as early as 2014 and a suspension of any further contracts being awarded, it dragged on until September last year where it was confirmed that no breach of state aid had occured.\n* So to cut a long story short, for 3 years our market was frozen, hundreds lost their jobs and key developments to grow and modernise the UK energy sector for the future were halted or abandoned because of a technicality around whether the UK was breaching EU rules on state aid.\n* The impact wont only be for the 3 year period, investors lost interest and have moved on to other industries, there have been brain drains with development teams being disbanded or moving to other industries and developing a site takes years, companies are required to have many sites in the 'churn' because there is a low success rate, you can't have all your eggs in one basket, if you just stop all of that and let the machine grind to a halt it takes a huge amount of time and effort to get it going again and you won't reap any rewards for years because the return rate is low. In an industry as important as energy it will result in a gap in new generation coming online, maybe won't be seen for 5-10 years but there will be an imbalance between old generation going offline and new generation coming on because of this market stagnation and it will result in panic buying and short-termism by the UK government and a gold rush in the market with poor quality high emissions generation coming online to plug the gap, since that is the quickest generation to get online.\n\nPeople often argue the 'take back control' argument and are shouted down with claims that the EU doesn't regulate or specify laws in the UK, but as a developer of power generation in the UK i can categorically state that on a daily basis we are required to navigate EU legislation, from fairly complex legislation around emissions and environmental impacts to more mundane things such as undertaking impact assessments to determine if there are indangered species in the proposed development area.\n\nObviously it is important that this kind of legislation exists but the issue is that the EU is required to apply broad-brush policies which cover the diverse nations of the EU and it is impossible to lobby for special dispensations because the EU democratic process is so detatched from the every day business, and if every industry in every country was lobbying for special dispensation the entire concept of the EU falls apart. It is well known that the further you are from democracy the more disenfranchised you feel, which is why there has been a drive towards devolution all over Europe.\n\nIf you take the simple example of impact assessments to identify the presence of endangered spiecies in the development area, it can sometimes be the case that the species you are searching for don't live in the UK or do live in the UK but are abundant, but because that spiecies might be endangered in Poland or Italy every site developed in the EU needs to have this process gone through. It might sound trivial, but we typically have 50-100 sites in the churn at any one time, each report might cost \u00a33,000 and take 4 weeks.. all of a sudden it is a massive financial burden.\n\nSo tl;dr: I work in the development of power generation in the UK, my market was almost destroyed by EU red tape and misreading/interpretting of their own rules, although it might not be the case that the EU mandate the shape of banannas, it is the case in my experience that EU law and legislation needs to be navigated on a daily basis, navigating law and legislation is always going to be required, in or out of the EU, but lobbying, focus groups and consultations on legislation is far more effective at a national level, the EU is too dense and detatched from the coal face and it is literally a box ticking exercise and a burden.\n\nEDIT: just to clarify my perspective, some of you have interpretted my comment and come to the conclusion that the reason i wanted to leave the EU was so that we could become some deregulated wild west, where my actual belief is that the people who are most capable of putting in place effective legislation in the UK is the UK government, that doesn't automatically result in a lowering of standards and will probably more likely result in the improvement of standards in some areas and the lowering in others to meet the specific needs of the UK. I'd hope you'd give me the benefit of the doubt, i've worked in renewable energy my entire life and have no interest in the roll out of big fossil fuel generators and the destruction of our environment..\n\nEDIT2: it wasn't the Aussies fault! the company just happened to be Australian and had a vested interest in damaging the market, they did that by launching a courtcase which the EU failed to quickly resolve and it resulted in a long term stagnation in the market which will have long term repercussions for the industry and the UK's move to lowering carbon emissions and increasing clean power.\n\nEDIT3: for anyone interested: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/15/uk-backup-power-subsidies-illegal-european-court-capacity-market](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/15/uk-backup-power-subsidies-illegal-european-court-capacity-market) its a pretty nerdy and niche topic so i love how people seem to be interested in it!",
            "Depending on what industry you work in, continued EU mandates supporting European multinationals over small business's. I voted remain in '16. But after being made redundant in '19 due to new EU legislation absolutely murdering all but the biggest players in my industry (mobile power systems, stage 5 emissions requiring individual type approval rather than calculated outputs, rendered small bespoke solutions non-viable), among other pieces of more recent legislation (article 13, the moves to further solidify the pillars, EU army etc).\n\nI find myself quite happy that it is happening.",
            "Synopsis:    \n\n* There is huge inequality in the EU. Bulgaria uses horse drawn carts. Poland has abysmally low wages. This goes on.  British companies *love* this. Instead of having mechanised farms for instance, where soft fruits are picked by machinery, there is a plethora of cheap labour to do this.   \n\n\n* The knock on impact that refusing to innovate and embrace technology has is astounding. Suddenly you don't need engineers, service center with skilled mechanics. Education becomes devalued.  \n\n* The UK government, any not just the Tories, has systematically ignored this. If you talked about this under Blair and Brown you were labelled a racist.    \n\n* The governments have done nothing to control the abuse of cheap labour until the Brexit vote.  So the choice was made for them.    \n\n* Next, Europe is great for lots of things but the UK doesn't fit in. It never has. The CAP is a policy designed to keep French farmers in business and economically conquer Africa by ditching products, like powdered milk, at below cost prices. The policy never made any sense for the UK (due to being an island), hence the rebate.   \n\n* The EU has flawed with the implementation of a worrying amount of legislation.\nIt took the EU until August 2017, after the Brexit vote, to make it illegal to hire people in places like Poland and Bulgaria then send them to work in places like France, Germany and the UK at far below minimum wage in those countries. However it was legal as it was only \"short term temporary relocation\".   \n\n* As an expansion here, it's legal for companies to label a product as have specific %ages of ingredients and then \"tailor\" it for the local market. Birdseye, and every other manufacturer, has different fish/meat content of prepared food for markets like Germany Vs Czechia and Bulgaria.  Ever wondered how Dove soap can be so much cheaper across the EU? It's marketed as through its make for France, Germany and the UK and made as though it's for Romania.     \n    \n   \n* Then there's the hilariousness of being unable to eject a member. Luxemburg steals about \u20ac4k of ~~tax~~ **taxable** {my bad, on a mobile} revenue *per EU citizen* a year. A country of < 500k people, including foreign workers.  They have a huge history of blocking change, with even Juncker himself blocking legislation.  \n\n\nThe concept of the EU is great. The current implementation is absolutely awful.   \nLeaving is stupid.  \nStaying without serious reform is also equally stupid. And the latter is not an option as the club has grown too big too quickly.    \n\nTo be 100% clear, Farage and co are shit mongering thundercunts.   They have only polarised and divided people on what is an incredibly complex topic.    \n    \nEdits: formatting\n\nEdit 2: Yes I have not answered the question about how it will benefit, because right now no one can answer that question. Anyone who tries is a liar. No concrete legislation has passed that can allow you to forsee. Everything now ranges between \"bad\" and \"rather bad\". Check back in 10 months.\n\nEdit 3:\nFor those asking about Luxemburg, [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/155724/EPRS_STUD_627129_Shell%2520companies%2520in%2520the%2520EU.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjVhO6E7rDnAhV7AmMBHXRZDl4QFjACegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw28D3p7oWSi8jqxL86Gc7ns&cshid=1580578759894]) is an EU parliament paper about how special purpose vehicles are used for foreign direct investment. This is how companies like Amazon avoid tax.\n\n   \n\nAll this Brexit stuff is academic anyway if we don't fight climate change, so use Ecosia and pay to plant trees to fight climate change.",

            "I voted Leave during the referendum, and whilst I stand by my reasons for this initial vote, I came to change my view over the course of the absolute nightmare that has been Brexit.\n\nWhen I voted, it was primarily because of the federalisation of the EU. I am not opposed to this in principle, but I have never been very convinced by how the European government is structured. In particular I was concerned that the European Parliament votes on legislation and cannot *propose* new legislation; they can only debate and amend legislation put forth to them by the European Commission. I believed, and still believe, that there is a fundamental democratic deficit in the European Union and that full integration into a supranational quasi-federation would not be desirable whilst such a deficit exists.\n\n(I feel that the EU *needs* to either fully federalise  or draw back into a looser confederation. The half-and-half state it currently in does not feel robust or stable enough to be properly efficacious)\n\nI was very torn when it came time to vote. I have never considered myself \"european\", and as stated above I had a lot of reservations about the EU; but I also recognised the advantages of membership. At the time I believed that federalisation was inevitable if the EU was to survive and so long as major reforms were not put in place - reforms I had despaired of ever occurring - then I felt the UK would be drawn into what would in essence be a federal oligarchy.\n\nWhen I voted, I made a number of erroneous assumptions about how the Brexit process would unfold which tipped my hand in favour of Leave and which did not come to pass:\n\n1) The Conservative party is self-serving and cruel, but they're not insane\n\n2) Brexit is by nature a political poisoned chalice because of the strong opinions on both sides; Europe has always been a divisive issue and the government must understand this.\n\n3) Because of 2, a bipartisan commission or committee would be established to negotiate Brexit. This would allow the Tories to have their cake and eat it. Setbacks could be blamed on Labour/EU and their own involvement downplayed whilst successes and positive outcomes could be bigged-up since it was still their sitting government \"delivering the will of the electorate\".\n\n4) Even if the Tories did decide to go it alone in the negotiations, they wouldn't be *utterly* incompetent, surely.\n\n5) An election is probably right around the corner because of this mess; maybe we can get a Labour government, or a Labour-led coalition who I believe would negotiate somewhat more competently than a Conservative one.\n\n6) The Leave vote probably won't win anyway, because it seems like everyone is in favour of the EU, or at least willing to look past its flaws.\n\n7) There will be a deal. We will negotiate a deal; it might not please everyone and it might take quite a lot of negotiating, but the PM isn't going to try to ram one particular version of it down Parliament's throats three or four times with little to no amendment or negotiation because that would be stupid.\n\nWhilst I stand by my criticisms of the EU, if there had been a second referendum I would have voted Remain.",
            "Copy and pasted this from a post of mine in a different subreddit.\n\nTo give you a genuine answer from an actual Leave voter, the reasons are multitudinous but without being overly long can be boiled down into the EU becoming an ever-more pervasive supranational organisation. The [Solemn Declaration on European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solemn_Declaration_on_European_Union) is where the creed of 'ever closer union' originates and is generally a goal the EU is working towards.\n\nA very brief history of pre-EU EU is that it was borne from the European Coal and Steel Community, a group of 6 countries that created a common market for trading steel and coal. Free trade is fantastic and this grew into the European Economic Community whose goal was to create a common market and customs union. The UK joined during this period and, for what it's worth, I think economic co-operation is a great thing.\n\nAt that point there were only 3 political institutions which held legislative and executive powers. That would evolve into what we know as the EU with the Maastricht Treaty, and those 3 political institutions would [grow into what is now significantly more](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies_en), while the European Parliament remains the only institution that is elected by European citizens, but has no legislative initiative. It can only vote on proposals, typically from the European Commission, which proposes legislation and has executive authority, but whose members are not directly elected.\n\nOver time, the EU has grown to encompass more than just a trade union; the [Treaty of Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lisbon) in particular consolidated a lot of power concerning the judiciary, foreign relations and security and defence, among others. \n\nThe Lisbon Treaty was not popular at the time, by the way, and was rejected twice by French and Dutch voters respectively. However, a common theme for the EU seems to be to just try again if something they want does not pass. We saw that again with Article 13, which was first defeated and was [widely unpopular](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) but got voted on again and passed.\n\nNow with the EU working towards an [EU army](https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-emmanuel-macron-eu-army-to-complement-nato/) and [joint parliamentary sessions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47692475), it is obvious that full integration of nations into a supranational entity is the goal.\n\nThe UK already had an opt-out from many aspects of the EU, from ever-closer union to the Euro and frictionless travel in the Schengen Area. The UK does not want to be so closely tied as other countries seem to, and thus it seems for the best that we part ways. It's not about racism or immigration but about a desire to remain more independent than integrate closer together. We can still be good friends without being partners.",

            "A lot of it comes down to domestic politics being stagnated, and the EU was a scapegoat for other issues. Towns and small cities across the UK are deprived of industry, jobs, and evolution onto the modern stage.\n\nAside from the facts above, a majority of people are sad with the status quo.\n\nThirdly, the notion of restrictions, the EU places high legal/economical restrictions on trade (goods have to be of specific quality) - ergo making less money. Additionally sovereignty of parliament is eroded with the EU institutions superseding binding authority.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons. I think ultimately its the scapegoat argument. Myself and many people alike are trying to remain optimistic, about future prospects. Finally we have a majority government that can pass legislation and actually get stuff done. So heres to the UKs sovereignty. Hope we dont fuck it up, and moreso retain friendship with our EU friends.\n\nEdit: Oh wow, so unexpected... thank you for the silver kind stranger.

            "It's tough to just pin down one aspect of why I voted to leave.\n\nFirstly, there were/are some aspects of the EU I actually like. Most notably that it gave freedom of movement but I also liked a large chunk of what the ECHR did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found the EU to be too much of a centralization of power for my taste though. I strongly believe power should be decentralized as much as possible. A law that's good for France may be bad for Italy and completely redundant in Spain. I love the diversity of culture in Europe but a diversity of law and government is also a part of cultural diversity. Getting people the little people heard is challenging enough at a national level nevermind when laws are being passed at a continental level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I think the British government is absolutely pathetic and wildly outdated on multiple levels and to fix it two things need to happen. Firstly we need to focus attention on parliament by removing the EU as a distraction and secondly, we need parliament to be shown as the complete joke it is to spark the desire to reform it. Both these things have happened due to Brexit and I believe in time it will cause a reformation of our government.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't vote Brexit expecting some immediate gain and I even accept there is the risk for immediate loss, I voted on the hope that it will instigate positive long term changes at the local, national and international levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not look for immediate benefit, I'm not a revolutionary, I'm a reformist.",
            "Mainly because I feel that in order to ensure that we remain a relatively free society (UK free lol I know) we cannot continue to support a continent-wide government that will only continue to absorb more and more power from the member states. The idea of federalisation is a leading light in the EU and it's a lot easier to put the boot down on a whole continent if you're governing the whole continent.\n\nAlso the idea of statehood is incompatible with EU membership, where legislation commissioned and voted on by foreign politicians outweighs our own Acts of Parliament. Yes every member state gets a veto, but I can't even trust my own government to not spy on my emails, what's stopping them selling us down the river?\n\nAt least after Brexit I'll only have to deal with one lot of privileged, uncaring, nanny-statist fucks.",

            "I voted leave because I think that large, all-encompassing systems of government are dangerous. They're all fun and beneficial until they become something like China.\n\nI don't want to live in a superstate and that's what I feel the EU will eventually become. I didn't vote leave for any short term benefit or flaws - I voted it for the long term.",
            "I'm a Leave supporter but wasn't quite old enough to vote at the time (and didn't really care back then either), but I'll quickly summarise my reasons now, as an EU law student. Also I should say, my mum's an EU migrant (and a Leave voter) and we're from a diverse fairly working class background\n\nFirstly, the EU is a bureaucratic clusterfuck which is staggeringly broken at the most fundamental level. EU institutions/functions are just honestly bizarre and unnecessarily complicated. It has a bad track record and repeatedly legislates on things with little foresight or proper consideration, despite the overly complicated process. They make massively impactful laws which just make simple things a hassle. The whole \"meme ban\" is the clearest example, GDPR is another one; having to click away a cookie popup on every single page is obtrusive and epitomises the \"well intentioned but poorly constructed regulation that imposes a blanket rule without considering the practical implications of it, leading to janky implementations which end up a hassle for everyone involved, including the average Joe it's designed to benefit\" that the EU does so well. The USB-C law they're poised to bring in doesn't allow for any innovation of the technology and is making a huge deal out of a minor issue, and their solution will probably make it worse. They focus on the wrong things because they're unelected and don't represent anyone, and the select few people making the decisions are bizarrely out of touch, moreso than regular politicians\n\nThird, both my parents regularly interact with EU regulations. I hear a lot from them about the copious amounts of red tape put in place by the EU which could cripple departments. An example from Port Health:\n\n* Profiling of importers' track records is done centrally by the EU, so an extensive database can be collected to identify the best/worst traders. Great. Except they only keep the records for a year, which isn't long enough to properly profile them and the database constantly proved unreliable. And it's centralised, so a complaint from one port means squat and they won't improve the system. Instead, the airport had to conduct their own profiling, which took years and only held data for that port, not the entire EU as would be ideal\n\n* The EU imposed a mandatory check on every Xth good being imported.. which was a different number to the UK and WHO regulations and was inflexible, meaning a ridiculous number of checks had to be conducted which was hideously expensive (these are laboratory checks) with about \u00a3400 of the cost being paid by the importer, per check that happened to fall on them. Most importantly, the port's regular, high volume importers were also their most reliable and trustworthy importers, so the end result was that the ones being hit by all the extra checks were the 'good guys' anyway because they made up the vast majority of goods imports, whereas the 'bad guys' didn't really see much difference\n\n* The EU had a threshold at which laboratory tenders had to be opened up to the whole EU. Basically this was just a nightmare for them, delaying the process and making things more expensive. But the two points above were the main thing\n\nSo there's 3 main problems; firstly, massive backlogs for Port Health. It was unable to cope and there was no way to get around it or speed up the process, to the point that shipments like lobsters or crabs coming in took so long to undergo these checks they'd actually die and the traders would lose money on top of having to pay for the check. Which leads to the second effect; traders opt to import elsewhere rather than face extra delays and costs. The third is that the issues the regulations were designed to prevent, mostly didn't exist in the first place and in fact they did nothing to solve them anyway, the good guys just absorbed all the impact. These are just a few of countless examples\n\nWhen something like the above happens there is little to no possibility of reform and the UK does not alone hold the power to solve such problems, and definitely not quickly. It's another issue with the implementation of the fundamental concept. If you're going to impose universal standards on countries that do not operate in the same way and have different needs/issues/desires, you need to be very careful that it's done right. The example above I believe was implemented due to issues in some Meditteranean countries that didn't really apply to the UK so we just suffered from excess regulation\n\nThat brings me to my final point which is that the UK is the \"least EU country in the EU\", if that makes sense. We don't really fit in, we don't share the variables that many EU countries do that make them a good fit for each other. You see it consistently and I think we're better off separate but close. The UK doesn't have that \"EU identity\" that the other countries do, we don't feel \"European\" in the way that they do. We're not integrated enough with the mainland EU countries at a social/geographical/cultural/any level to suit being a leading EU member, and we're far too big to be a backseat member. The UK suits a degree of independence that the EU doesn't allow. The ideologies/goals/issues/whatever that most EU countries hold often do not apply to the UK. The squabbling married couple agreeing they're better off as close friends is honestly a great metaphor. We're not right for each other in an EU way but I want us to have a close relationship\n\nThere's a comment from a Swiss person that I wholeheartedly agree with and feel like I want to put here because it largely applies to the UK too. This is maybe a better explanation than I was able to quantify\n\n>I'm a Swiss citizen who has consistently voted against any involvement of my country with the EU for a few years now (Switzerland is not part of the EU). I know that it's not really an answer to the question, but maybe my perspective may interest a few people. As it stands, the EU practices policies that are simply at odds with what we practice here: \n\n>* The amount of regulation the EU pumps out every year is absolutely enormous, and doesn't fare well in a country with a deeply rooted laissez-faire, \"mind-your-own-business\" culture.\n\n>* The competences of the EU - that is, the topics on which it can legislate - are not well/rigorously defined, and tend to expand every year. In Switzerland, which is a federal state, institutions at the federal level can only act when the Constitution explicitly allows them to. If that is not the case, the Cantons are competent. So from our perspective, a governmental body whose competences aren't defined and regularly expand is suspicious and scary\n\n>* The EU exercises its power in a deeply undemocratic way - at least from the perspective of a country that practices direct democracy. Long story short, the Commission - a non elected body - has all the power and takes its decisions in a very opaque and unaccountable way\n\n>* The EU dwarfs the voice of the individual, because it's one among 512 million people. It's simply too big to manage in a centralized way and that scares people\n\nAlso this comment from a pharmacist:\n\n>I work in pharmacy. Recently an EU law means that every pharmacy needs to adopt FMD; every medicine from manufacturer to patient is tracked along the way in a sealed box so we know where it's been and if it's legit. This was brought in to stop the dispensing of fake medications in pharmacies\n\n>Sounds good right? Well, how bad was this issue in the UK? Nonexistent. Our suppliers are fantastic and our systems are robust. Most pharmacies use one of three or four suppliers and those suppliers themselves are owned by the four biggest pharmacy chains, fake medicines would be a massive media scandal that would destroy them\n\n>What did the law mean in practice? Every computer needed new QR reading scanners. Every staff member needed training to change the dispensing process they've used for years to insert a step they thought was pointless. When the drugs enter the pharmacy they need to be scanned, when they're picked off the shelf they need to be scanned and when they go to the patient they need to be scanned. Every manufacturer had to change their packaging to what is now absolutely horrible; they're sealed shut so when you're dispensing split packs, something we do a lot of in the UK, they're torn open and don't seal closed again easily. So they need to be put in another box\n\n>All of this is a burden placed on a sector that is already struggling. We're told \"scanning only takes two seconds\" and yes, it does, 3 times per box. When an average pharmacy dispenses 400 boxes a day that's about 40 minutes added labour, and thats a very lowball number. It's not much but it's a cost and stretched pharmacies, not seeing the point of it, don't do it. If they get caught not doing it: fines. I'm a locum, I travel to all pharmacies all over the country and I can count on one hand the pharmacies that follow the FMD laws. It's an absolute waste of money and time\n\nI acknowledge that leaving could be even worse than all that. I've always seen it as a leap of faith, a risk, but I'm happy to take that risk and don't want to just live in an unhappy relationship that is incapable of change because we're scared of going it alone. I would rather take the leap and I'm excited to see where we go from here and whether we can make it work. However, I hate everything that's happened so far. It's been a terrible start because everything had to be worked out while May was leading a minority government. That's just unfortunate and if Cameron had stayed on or someone else had won a majority, the journey so far would've been considerably easier. Uncertainty is the most damaging thing about Brexit, we desperately needed a majority government with the power to be decisive at a time like this and the lack of one only exacerbated the economic impacts so far, which should've been small and worthwhile",

            "I have no regrets what so ever. The EU is moving closer and closer to becoming a federation. \n\nOther than that the EU is quite flawed. And the idea that it can be reformed from the inside is quite ludicrous. I don\u2019t want to be dragged down by the Romanian or Greek economy. If it was a union between the Nordics, France, Germany, Britain I don\u2019t think anyone would complain. The countries being so similar in economics, culture etc would make such a union far stronger. Without being dragged down by far worse economies that don\u2019t care what we say anyway.\n\n\nEdit: \nThis blew up a bit more than I thought it would have. To respond to some of the questions. \nYes Belgium and the Netherlands can join. \n\nThe entire argument I made there was about economics. And how I disliked being a constant money pig for the union. However. I didn\u2019t mention race.  I didn\u2019t even mention immigration. Yet half of the comments here are calling me racist for wanting something other than what the union currently is. And you wonder why you keep loosing elections.",
            "I am 29 and live and work in mainland Europe with my European fiance.\n\nI voted brexit because I believe that Europe has got itself so tied up in beuracracy its missed the iceberg about to hit the EU in a huge way.\n\nThe euro has destroyed the economies of the southern countries and left 4 States effectively putting money into the EU budget. Germany, France, UK, and Italy.\n\nUK has just left, Italy is in dire straits, unemployment in Germany, is rising with a downturn in the economy, the same is true for France, in a different way.\n\nWhen the next recession bites, in I think the next 3 to 5 years, no one will be able to keep the EU afloat.\n\nThe Greek crisis will be nothing to when Italy goes belly up, when that happens, and it will, the choice will be to bankrupt Germany and France or let the EU die.\n\nI don't want the UK to be in the firing line for when that happens.\n\nAs I said I live in Europe and love the countries and the people. However the European project to effectively make us a united States of Europe was 50 years too early. It will cause far more hardship than good. I don't want to look back on history and think I was part of that.",

            "The EU is NOT a democracy. the EU parliament has no parliamentary roles. It is a fake. Unelected people run this state, and obviously do not represent the people of this area. The UK may be only the beginning of either a complete reform of the EU or its deconstruction.",
            "What's the point of replying to this post If your a genuine leaver? For expressing you opinion on voting to leave a trade block you are going to be downvoted to oblivion. Everyone here does realise this is the precise reason a large portion of people who voted for leave in the referendum did so. Their opinions, shot down before anyone asks why people are feeling that way. \n\nMost leavers did vote in that way because of immigration. So what. If you disagree with their reasoning, debate them. Don't just label them racist nazis cause they are worried about 300k people entering the country a year, every year for 20 years.\n\nPersonally, as a true liberal, I voted leave because I believe a smaller governing body is better for the people as they are more effective for the smaller amount of people they serve. An unelected closed off group of people, shouldn't be able to dictate laws to 28 different countries. I don't feel that the same laws would be effective in two culturally diverse countries.",
            "I voted to leave in 2016, kinda swung back and forth and in the election that put Boris in power i voted for the lib dems (the only uk party which promised to cancel brexit, other then the greens).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI moved to my town in 2010. by 2016 the demographic was noticeably different in a few years. I felt intimidated in my own high street in the evening as it was full of groups of eastern Europeans drinking and smoking in alleyways. Not doing anything illegal, but from a culture point of view it made me feel uneasy. Some times i would walk down my high street and not hear any English conversations. it was weird, it was such a quick  and dramatic change that i honestly can say i felt overwhelmed by it and slightly threatened. I started to even feel alienated by it. \n\nAt the same time i was also working in a prison, the majority of people we locked up were British but 30-35% of my prisons population were foreign nationals (compared to the national population of around 11% foreign)  so they were massively over represented and most of them were eastern European.  They were not in prison for culture misunderstandings like not paying for a tv licence, they were there for murder, rape, drug dealings and while i must admit most of the serious crimes were done on other eastern Europeans they, particularly when it came to rape, had a lot of British victims.\n\nwe have a large population of Irish travellers  who also cause  a disproportionately high amount of crime. london was targeted quite  heavily by Roma pick pocketing gangs. what my prison was experiencing was the same  for all large town and city prisons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand you know what? i was angry, really fucking angry. Some of these people had  criminal records from their home countries. but we just let them in,  walk right in and cause problems and i, for the life of me, never understood why crime was a minor part of the leave campaign or not mentioned at all. so i voted leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfast forward a few years   \n\nThe longer it went on the more i started to realise how much of this was actually our fault. When eastern Europe joined the UK was one of only a handful of western Europe that didn't place restrictions it was allowed to use. and as such we got the brunt of the migration. Why apply for Germany when you can just go to the UK  no  questions asked? and once it was established and a community set up, that then enabled the next decade of immigration. \n\nGermany, as an example, regardless of how it looks for allowing in all those Syrians, deports tens of thousands a year for crimes and not behaving themselves. the UK, despite being the 6th richest nation in the world, still does not have a properly funded boarder force.  It like deporting a criminal, which under freedom of movement we can do, was to much effort, not a legal impossibility. \n\nI then watched my country tear itself apart, almost. After Scotland voted to remain and what i thought was the issue put to bed its now a real possibility that the country i love wont exist by the end of this decade. I'm not English, I'm not Scottish, Irish, i'm Welsh 2nd but i'm British first and it pains me to see the discourse that now exists. the rise in actual racism against all people. the UK does not feel like such a nice place as it did pre-2016. \n\nThe culture issues, as i have got used to eastern Europeans being here and understanding the culture norms has also lessened that \"threat\" that i once felt. I think the numbers thinning out post brexit vote has helped in some way  but i dont feel the same way about them i did 5 years ago.  I am much more positive about Europe and Europeans then I once was and I see it less as \"them and us\" then i used to. My brother is married to a European now!  \n\nI think and still think the economic doomsday arguments are Bullshit. i remember even voting leave was meant to put us in a hard recession. But when you start to weigh up the pro's and con's i value the union with the UK more then the EU and if staying in the EU keeps the UK together then i'd be willing to put up with it, even more so when actually, my major issues with it are down to my own nations failures to tackle long standing social issues. \n\nin all, i am confused, if i am honest. I don't know how to feel. the only thing i wish is that we could go back to 2016 and call the hole thing off. i was not happy or sad on brexit day. and i dont think i will be able to say if it was the right or wrong choice untill the 01/02/2030.",

            "I don't think it will benefit me personally, nor do I think it will harm me personally. I work for an American company that's unlikely to be affected directly. That said there's a number of reasons I support brexit. \n\nThe biggest one is that the EU was moving towards a federal system and I don't think democracy could work at that scale. Blair promised a referendum on the EU constitution, no referendum was had (another state said no first; but the lack of a referendum prevented a public debate) and then Brown signed up to Lisbon without public support; permanently transferring power from elected officials to unelected EU comissioners. When Cameron felt a new EU treaty was risky for the British financial sector (a huge part of our ecconomy) and asked for assurances in the treaty the EU said no. Cameron vetoed it, and so the EU did it anyway excluding the UK. The EU was slowly but surely moving towards a federal system and the \"protections\" for states who didn't want to move had been proven not to work. \n\nAnd ultimately I think that when you have 28 countries with different languages, cultures, economies, etc in a federal system it won't work. Democracy would become a system where you vote based on local issues to your country and then all the leaders would hash out deals in smoky back rooms behind closed doors; I don't think that's real democracy. I hate the sound of that. I want decisions to be made where we can see them by people we can vote to kick out if we don't like what they decide. \n\nNext: It brings back the option for left wing policies. There's a reason why old school left wing politicians like Corbyn hate the EU (not that he'd say it with his voter base). I don't think we're going to have a Labour government any time soon, and with Corbynites in charge I don't want one. But I believe that the state should act to protect people from the unfettered power of global capitalism. [That's tricky under EU law](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41392469). The short version is that the EU gets a lot of love form the British left wing because it was left of Thatcher and provided the left with some protection from her, but it is at heart a neo-liberal institution and I'm not a neo-liberal. If people vote for a little more economic/cultural protection I think they should get it. I think that was a big part of the reason why people voted for brexit, and now that we have a government with a new working class voter coalition I think they're going to get some of what they asked for too.   \n\nBut the biggest reason: It won the referendum. I had extreemly mixed feelings on referendum day. After referendum day I felt that we would not be a real democracy if we were a country where if you vote the \"wrong\" way you have to go back and vote again until you get it right. Once the vote was in I felt it hand to be honoured, and I'm still annoyed that so many politicians were fighting over reversing a referendum result rather than helping the government implement it in the best way possible.",
            "I could see many years ago the EU end game was to create a 4th Nuclear and military super power to even up the balance between the West and Russia and China.\nI didn't want a future of seeing America and the EU police the planet and invade anyone in the middle East or Africa that refused to join the central bank.\nI also can't fucking stand Angela Merkel",
            "There are multiple reasons that I could spend several hours writing about but one of the biggest reasons for me which hasn't really been explored in other comments is how profoundly undemocratic the EU is. The Parliament is a bad joke, MEPs can't put forward legislation, only propose it. The only body able to put laws up to vote is the Commission which is unelected. And no, the fact that the Commissioners are appointed by national governments does **not** in turn make them democratic.\n\nEven the EU parliament recognises how much a joke this is when Ursula von der Leyen, a German politician barely anyone had heard of was made the President of the Commission, completely overriding the recommendations of the Parliament, who warned it only gave ammunition to critics of the EU.\n\nTo put this into perspective for American readers, imagine if the President of the United States (albeit a weakened president) was unelected but appointed by states. And that President and his cabinet were the only one allowed to propose laws that the Senate and House could vote on. It is an utter sham of Democracy.\n\nHonorable mention also goes to the circumstances in which we joined, a grievance though not a reason to leave, and the slow power grab that has been growing since the 90s, a very real reason to want to leave. When we entered in 1973 it was a trading bloc and was sold as a trading bloc. Not a superstate, a trading bloc. Under the SNP's idea of what constitutes a reason for a referendum, i.e. changing circumstances, the moment the EU changed from a trading bloc to a growing superstate with political and fiscal union and an obvious desire for more we should have been allowed to hold a referendum if we wanted to remain a part of that. We weren't. On top of this is the fact that for years we were told that the EU wasn't looking to grab more powers from national governments and especially that it wasn't looking to create an army. The very suggestion of a European army when brought up by Leavers in the debate was denied with sneers and eye rolling, with Nick Clegg infamously calling it a 'dangerous fantasy'. Yet the moment the UK steps back from the table after the referendum the EU goes full steam ahead with [plans Merkel, Macrons and the EU presidents support](https://twitter.com/guyverhofstadt/status/1062433746123739136), plans the UK always vetoed.\n\nAnd you can sure as hell bet there's going to be a referendum wherever any citizen in the EU even wants an EU army.",

            "Oooh, finally my time to... shine? I guess? In high school I briefly dated a \"nice guy\" (complete with an actual fedora in 2000 before they were really a thing - thanks art school!) I had been in a really horrible, abusive relationship with a guy in his 20s just before, and in fairness my \"nice guy\" then-friend had been instrumental in helping me to realize how fucked up our vibe was and helping me to leave an objectively horrible situation. \n\nHe then promptly swooped in and started pushing for romantic intimacy between us. He never actually declared feelings - he was never that straightforward about his own thoughts and desires - just talked about the way I deserved to be treated (like a queen, obvs) and made it clear he felt he was the only one who would give me that. Many of my friends were pushing for it as well - he was nice, afterall, and my previous boyfriends had been so objectively awful. \n\nI felt a lot of obligation and kind of went along on autopilot. There was a lot of negotiation around anything sexual - \"I treat you so well, don't you want to?\" from him and \"I know you want to treat me like a lady so you'll be okay to take it slow\" from me. One of the hardest parts was that he clearly wasn't out to hurt me or to fuck me. The sexual acts between us (we never slept together, but did other things that seemed like a huge deal to teenaged me) were only a demonstration - proof that I loved him. *That* was what he wanted. But I didn't, and I really thought that meant there was something wrong with me.\n\nIn the end, I only lasted about a month. He decorated my locker, brought flowers, and left notes for me taped to my desk in each of my classes to \"celebrate\" our fucking one month anniversary. I was mortified. My math teacher caught a good look at my face (before I managed to plaster a smile back on) as I opened the note he had left in her class. She asked me to stay back after for what turned out to be one of the most important talks in my life (Mrs. Brown, just the best). I felt panicked, telling her over and over how happy and lucky I was. She kept asking questions until I burst into tears and it all just came out. I don't really remember what all she said, but I remember her saying \"it's okay to be alone.\" She said it over and over, like Robin Williams going \"it's not your fault\" in Good Will Hunting. \n\nAnd soon enough I was. I broke up with him - kindly but firmly, and about 5 different times before he accepted it. He cried. He got angry. Absurdly, insanely, his mom called my mom, who dropped the hammer on her in a way I haven't seen before or since. I took a ton of shit at school for \"breaking his heart\" and \"ruining his life\" but I felt so free that I didn't really mind. I dated around, but didn't have a \"boyfriend\" again until I was 21.

He quickly scrambled upstairs to get two child-sized egg chairs and planted them in front of the TV.\n\nThe TV was playing a movie that was mostly porn, super innappropriate for a first date. I figured he was trying to get me horny? It just made me uncomfortable. As did the egg chair I didn't fit in.\n\nHe promptly signaled for me to come sit on his lap, I figured it might be more comfortable than the chair I was in.\n\nAt one point he went in for a kiss and I thought what the heck, might as well try to enjoy myself. It was AWFUL all I could feel were his teeth and his lizard tongue punching my uvula. I actually had to hold back gags.\n\nAfter that I waited about 15 minutes before signalling that I was going to leave. Mostly to preserve his feelings.\n\nSo after the date I messaged him saying I couldn't see a 2nd date happening, I was as nice as humanly possible. He LOST it:\n\n- \"You're just a whore!\"\n- \"Didn't want you anyways!\"\n- \"Now you are showing your TRUE colours!\"\n\nAnd then switched to:\n\n- \"I love you though!\"\n- \"I was going to bring you to Greece!\"\n\nHe flip flopped between those two states and called me (no answer) every 3 minutes until I blocked him on everything.\n\nI deleted tinder.",

So, she gave him a chance. At first, she was happy. He pulled out chairs, lent her his jacket, brought her gifts, that kind of thing.

Telling him I wasn't interested didn't work the first or second time, so the third time I decided to just come out and tell him I was asexual. I hadn't done so before because I wasn't sure how he'd take it. He decided that I was lucky he was such a nice guy, because if he wasn't then he'd have taken that as a challenge.\n\nI haven't hung out with This Guy since then.

We met up shortly after for a quick date (I think we got coffee) and chatted. It was instant chemistry, he had 2 sons and i have 2 kids, both open to blended families,  goal oriented, smart, easy conversation. We decided to go out again the next night, really nice date and he was a complete gentleman. He mentioned on the date we'd have to get the kids together to see if they like each other. I laughed it off, like \"yeah maybe down the road, we just met\" and continued the date. Two days later, during our texting I casually mentioned I was going to take my kids on a nature walk and I'd text him when I was back. He shows up with his kids. Now, I dont have it in me to be mean to children so I played nice and introduced myself (they were around 5 and 7, and very sweet boys) but inside I was creeped the fuck out. After we parted ways I called him and told him that was not cool AT ALL. Of course, he played victim and hurt until i said i was uncomfortable with what he did.. then it was \"I'm just trying to love you and your kids\", \"how can we be together if they dont meet\" and \"you should appreciate a man trying with a woman with 2 kids\"... as if he didnt have 2 his damn self. He sent angry messages for about a week, I never would respond and he went away. \n\nTo clarify, this all happened in a 2 week span. From start to finish.",

I missed out on a lot of things, including missing out going to see Phantom of the Opera with his mom, because he didn't want to go and would get sick at the last minute. \n\nWhen I lost my virginity to him, he said I basically raped him because he didn't realize he wasn't ready for something like that till after we had sex. About a year and a half into our relationship he got religious. So then, whenever we had sex, he would want is to pray for forgiveness afterwards. But if I refused sex, I was a cold bitch. \n\nI actually left him for a female partner, (I am bi) and that's when I realized that it was a super unhealthy relationship.\n\nEdit: Holy shit.

I told him I would be back home after finals and that it would take 2-3 weeks before we could meet in person. \n\nIt was good to talk to someone who wasn't outright trying to sexualize/fetishize me. I don't remember the convos, but I thought it was good enough to meet him in person.\n\nAnyway, so we meet. I got dressed up and he was in t-shirt and cargo pants. I bought us both a latte (it was a coffee date). We sat down, and he talked mostly about himself and his job. At some point, he stood up, walked behind me, and started giving me a shoulder rub, while I was seated. I never asked for a massage and why would I accept one in public? \n\nI got bored, so I pretexted a family supper to leave and he was like \"Uh, too bad, I could have had brought you home\" and I thought \"I thought I told him already it wasn't going to happen so soon\".\n\nI decide to let him know on Skype that there wasn't any spark and that I wished him good luck on OkCupid.

Stopped staying at his house and fastened to his hip.\n\nAnd one of my other ex's always played \"nice guy\" until I responded with 'I don't know' when he asked when we could hang out and then he replied with \"You are ugly anyway\". Had a good laugh out of that one.",
            "My ex had a \"friendzone\" guy in the classic sense of the word. She knew he liked her, basically abused him to buy her food and clothes and stuff, he sort of seemed to expect her to come around and like him some day, he had very little social skills and didn't look after his appearance.\n\nI met my ex in 2nd year of my uni, she introduced me to her \"best friend\" who was the most quintessentiall neckbeard looking guy. (Though admittedly he grew a thick beard all over his face, but never trimmed it). Long story short he had been her flatmate in halls and they developed a \"friendship\" which was her stringing him along and him buying her shit. \n\nShe would take him for \"friend dates\" at least once a fortnight, he brought her crazy expensive gifts (designer clothes, handbags, perfumes). I was always uncomfortable with her abusing him but I mean... The guy was so cringeworthy it hurt. This is how bad it was, at a party once we missed the last train, she called him at 4am and he drove over to the other side of the city juat to give us a lift back to my flat!\n\nThe whole relationship she seemed fine with me but we broke up on graduation mostly amicably due to us moving to different cities. \n\nSo friendzoned guy lands a massive job and is paid like \u00a390k as a graduate in some software thing, all of a sudden she comes round on him lol. She made an Instagram post about how she finally fell for her best friend. \n\nLast I saw on Facebook they are engaged. She does not work except for selling stuff on Facebook and Instagram.",
            "I did it. I was really young (13 I think). The guy asked me to date him, I said yes. Then he made fun of me to his friends so I dumped him. He harassed me and my little brother who was in the same school until I accepted to get back together. He even followed me to the toilets and teacher had to intervene.\n\nHe was actually pretty nice as a bf and bought me a few stuff but I was afraid of him and what he will do to me if we break up. I dumped him by text at the beginning of summer vacations to avoid seeing him (I know, not great but I was a child).\n\nHis parents got divorced and he was sent to boarding school in September so I didn't have to deal with him again.",
            "Yes. Turns out he is extremely racist, sexist, and could not make me orgasm for the life of him.",

            "In college. Was besties with a dude who lived on my floor freshman year. He was into me, I didn\u2019t really feel the same way. Then he basically bullied me into dating him by throwing a tantrum saying I was a bad person to not give him a chance. He ended up being the most controlling and manipulative bf I\u2019ve ever had. Managed to get out of it but wasted a year and a half of my best years on that shit head",
            "Ahhh my time to shine! I met him on Tinder. He seemed like a really nice guy.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t bad looking and was a little dorky. Just how I like them. He was in school and a hardworking guy, so he seemed nice.\n\nOn our first date he took me to eat wings  and everything went well.\n\nThen shit got weird. On our second date he drove us to the place and he started doing this weird thing where he would get out the car, and then LOCK ME inside while he came around to open the door. I understand he probably wanted to be chivalrous but that was a bit strange. He could\u2019ve just said \u201cI\u2019ll get the door.\u201d\n\nThen he started texting me nonstop asking when we would hang out and stuff. Even when I told him I was busy and I had things to do. If I didn\u2019t answer him on time he would blow up my phone. He also had this weird thing where he had braces because in his teens he had had crooked teeth and whenever I would tell him off, he would be like \u201cyou\u2019ll see jakebakescakes, whenever I get my braces taken off you\u2019ll regret treating me like this\u201d. Like what??? You\u2019re the one blowing me up. \n\nThe final nail on the coffin was when I went to his house and we were in his bed, I told him I didn\u2019t want to do anything and then we started making out, and I still told him I don\u2019t want to any further than that and he still tried to put his penis inside me. \n\nI guess he felt like he deserved it because we went out on a couple of dates.",
            "I met a \u201cnice guy\u201d in college in my early 20\u2019s and he was in his late 30\u2019s. At first, he was fun/funny and seemed confident, and was well liked by some of our classmates.  I was kind of quiet but he approached me and made conversation a few times and eventually we agreed to hang out. He offered to pay for everything, would randomly surprise me with things he knew I liked, was pretty good in bed, all was well I thought. Like most young women who get groomed by older men, I didn\u2019t think much of the age difference. \n\nOver a short period of time he suddenly didn\u2019t seem confident at all and was out of control crazy jealous. If I said \u201cthank you\u201d when a waiter refilled my water, I wanted to sleep with him.\n\nOne time we were at the mall and I was buying sunglasses and a pair of pants. He was talking to someone on his phone and when it was my turn to pay, I stepped up and put my stuff on the counter. The cashier told me my total and as I was taking my debit card out of my purse, nice guy reached across me to hand his debit card to the cashier, all while still talking on the phone. It made me feel like a little kid.\n\nOver time, he started to \u201cneed\u201d sex more and more because I was so \u201cirresistible,\u201d and would pressure me to do it in public places where I wasn\u2019t comfortable and afraid of being caught, but there was apparently no way for him to control his \u201cneed\u201d except to get off. Of course he would become furious if I didn\u2019t, so I usually gave in to calm him down and thankfully I was never arrested for public lewdness. Toward the end, he once whispered in my ear during sex, \u201cI want to keep you barefoot and pregnant.\u201d This was 15 years ago and I still feel kind of nauseous when I think about it. (Particularly because I\u2019m in my mid-30\u2019s now and would never sleep with a 20-year-old. They look like children to me.)\n\nAt the end, he was furious one time when he showed up unannounced at my house and I wasn\u2019t there because I was out with friends and hadn\u2019t told him I was going out. (I was trying to distance myself at that point and figure out how to end it.) He blew up my phone until I relented and told him where we were. He showed up and acted normal in front of everyone, but made sure to shoot me looks when no one was paying attention so I knew how mad he was. Eventually I said I was tired and wanted to head home, and of course he followed me out to the parking lot. He stood in my driver\u2019s side doorway of my car so I couldn\u2019t leave. I told him I was sorry but I couldn\u2019t do this anymore. Eventually I did end up putting the car in drive and just driving, and of course he moved. Then came the texts, calls, and voicemails for hours, threats such as \u201cyou messed with the bull, now you\u2019re going to get the horns\u201d (this one makes me snicker now... who tf says that?) and of course telling me I made the biggest mistake of my life and I\u2019d always regret it. I got the police involved and he de-escalated and mostly left me alone. (We \u201cran into\u201d each other on campus a couple of times after that, obviously intentional on his part, and he tried to be a \u201cnice guy\u201d again, offering to buy me a soda or a snack, offering me gum, asking me how I was doing. The only thing I said in response is that I would call the police again if he didn\u2019t stop approaching me. I also involved campus police and they told him if he kept stalking me he could be expelled from the college. He finally left me alone after that and fortunately I haven\u2019t seen him since.",
            "Yes, I did. He didn\u2019t \u201cthrow a tantrum\u201d BEFORE I dated him, though. He just preached how he would treat me like a queen if I gave him the chance and did the whole \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy\u201d spiel. I can usually see right through these kinds of guys, but I was single and truly damaged at this point from past experiences with men so I figured I\u2019d stop judging people so harshly based off internet memes and give someone a chance to treat me the way I felt I deserved. I also figured I wasn\u2019t trapped if I said yes. Boy, was I wrong lol. \n\nI went over to his house one day and he got me a bong with roses inside. I don\u2019t smoke weed, ever, so that was a bit off putting, but I tried to look past it and be appreciative of the gift itself. He handed the bong to me and asked if I\u2019d be his girlfriend. I said yes, and we hung out for a few hours until I needed to go to a family dinner. He told me he\u2019d prefer if I didn\u2019t go since we were having such a \u201cgood time\u201d(Me watching him play Rocket League on PS4 and wouldn\u2019t let me have a turn.) When I said no, he had a full on melt down like a toddler because he claims that on our first day of us officially being together we should spend the whole day with each other. I told him that my family was in town and I wanted to see them and that was that. End of discussion.\n\nHe went into full blown panic attack mode where he was crying, hyperventilating and blowing snot bubbles. I had to sit with him for an hour because he kept saying he was going to hurt himself if I left and manipulated me to the point where I was late to seeing my family. I tried physically removing myself but he held my legs and blocked the bedroom door. I told him I\u2019d come over right after dinner and would miss him every second I was away from him (even though I knew I was never going to talk or see this guy again). Thankfully he bought it, was happy to hear that I\u2019d be miserable without him, made me promise I\u2019d come back, let my legs go and said he would, \u201cALLOW ME TO LEAVE.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say I blocked his number and never talked to or hear from him again.",
            "After weeks of \u201cchances\u201d which was him saying he liked me and me trying because we was a very nice person and my friend and I wanted to like him but I just did not have those feelings for him. He ended up sending me a picture of him crying saying \u201clook what you did\u201d because I just did not have romantic feelings. I literally told him for weeks I wanted to be just friends and he kept guilting me and trying to force me to kiss him and hang out alone. I finally stood up and said this isn\u2019t good for either of us because it\u2019s just making him upset  because he was trying so hard to make it a relationship and it was upsetting me because I couldn\u2019t force my feelings to be romantic and I just wanted to be friends. \n\n\nI was 15 and stupid by letting people pressure me into it because I didn\u2019t ever have a boyfriend before besides one online. I really wish I had just stood up after the first kiss because, I just did not like it I felt sick after because it felt so forced. It would have saved us both lot of grief and we probably would have still been friends and he wouldn\u2019t hate me and think I was evil :(",
            "You guys should know that gay men do this too. \n\nI was talking to a guy several years back and on paper he seemed fine. We had conversations here and there and after a few weeks he wanted to meet. We\u2019d planned on meeting halfway and getting to know each other in person. \n\nA few days before we were to meet I messaged him saying I was a little nervous and I wanted to message a bit more first. Then he blew up with the stereotypical tantrum. You know how it goes. \n\n\u201cNo, we aren\u2019t waiting you ARE going to meet up with me. How dare you string me along. I\u2019m a catch you\u2019ll never do better than me I could have given you everything\u201d blah blah blah. Big yikes. \n\nI didn\u2019t even respond, I just blocked him and moved on. Bullet dodged.",
            "He didn't throw a tantrum to get me to give him a chance, I genuinely was interested in him, but his motto/catchphrase he said all the time was \"girls only ever go for the 'bad boy' with tattoos and piercings and wonder why they get abused, they never give a nice guy a chance.\" I was in high school and naive, and I didn't take it as the warning it should have been.\n\nAt first it was ok. He doted on me and spoiled me, talked about being in love like a week in (another red flag I naively ignored). Then he started to systematically isolate me from my friends. He claimed he didn't trust people not to hurt me, so he discouraged any time I wanted to spend with friends. I thought I was madly in love with him and obliged. After a couple years I was wrapped around his finger and we eloped when I was 18. I took my life savings out of my bank account (only amounted to a few grand but that was a lot for me) and deposited it into his account and moved to another state to be with him. He had joined the military and I moved where he was stationed. The isolation continued, he would get butthurt if I talked on the phone with any of my friends, and he started to discourage me talking to family. He also didn't want me to work because he was afraid that leaving our apartment alone in our city would be dangerous, so he wanted me to stay home all day.\n\nEventually he got out of the military and we moved back to our hometown. I got a job, we bought a house, I spent less time with my family but we were expected at his parents' house every Sunday morning. He did all kinds of \"nice\" things for me. He would bound out of bed at the asscrack of dawn to clean so I wouldn't have to. He cooked, he did dishes. He made sure that my free time was free to do my hobbies. But I was expected to put out on demand, and our free time never consisted of quality time together. I tried taking an interest in one of his hobbies (painting minis) and he threw a tantrum about me being better than him. So I gave it up. I tried getting him to play games with me to have fun together, but he threw a tantrum if he lost and would literally throw game pieces around like a child and rant about how much he hated that game anyway. So I gave up playing games with him. \n\nI think this stemmed from how his parents, his dad specifically, made him feel like a genius about everything. His dad always went on about how smart he was (he was average) and how driven he was (he wasn't, he started 3 businesses and gave up on all of them) and how he was going to be rich someday (doubtful). His dad also went on endlessly about how friends and family always fuck you over so it's best not to have anyone at all because then you can't get hurt or taken advantage of (himself being the obvious exception). \n\nAnd since this is getting long enough already I'll wrap up. I stayed married to him for 12 years and eventually got him to grow a small social life. But our home life didn't improve and he kept treating me like a trained pet rather than a partner. I wanted kids, he kept using that as the carrot on a stick every time I talked about divorce to get me to stay. He once told me he didn't want to have kids with me because he did all the work as it was and didn't want to have to change all the diapers, too. Implying I would do nothing at all and be a bad mother. I left him finally. When I did, in typical NiceGuy fashion, he told me that everyone else out there would drug me and rape me, use me and never call again, ghost me, and that he couldn't wait for my first Facebook post about getting ghosted. As if he was the last \"nice\" man on Earth and I'd never find anyone half as good as him and my life would be miserable. But considering how lonely and sad I was already, I figured it would be better to be sad and lonely by myself than sad and lonely with my spouse. At least on my own I'd be allowed to pursue hobbies and have any friends I wanted (he always had an issue with my best friend) and go places without someone blowing my phone up 1000 times until I went home. I'd have some actual freedom on my own.",
            "This has happened to me like three or four time where a guy became almost obsessed with me and everyone told me I have to date him and I\u2019m nasty if I didn\u2019t and one of the guys even said he doesn\u2019t think he could live if I didn\u2019t date him so all these guys I dated and all of them failed within literally days either they then just act like your friends or they want to know everything that\u2019s happened and be around you 24/7 or make you feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong. I hate when people pressure you to date someone because your \u201c such good friends \u201c or \u201c but he really likes you you have to give him a chance!\u201d \n\n\n\nFUCK YOU",
            "Yes but the same problem in opposite direction. Dated a girl where we had been friends for a while. She shot me down in my teens but we stayed friends, talked all the time. Eventually she decided to give us a shot. Cheated on me with a co-worker after 6 months because I treated her as an equal and she \"thought I'd treat her like a princess\" instead of my equal. Found out on Christmas Eve lol.",
            "I use to be one of those guys. Always in the friend zone. Back messages. Why won\u2019t they give me a chance? Keep giving them chances to give me a chance. Why do they keep going for the jerks?\n\nI got lucky. I was hanging out at a girls house with a bunch of friends. Huge house. Her Mom knew all of us and could see what was going on. Her Mom and I crossed paths one night away from the others and we got to talking. I mentioned how hard I was trying and how lonely I was and no one would give me a chance. She said maybe that\u2019s the problem. Maybe I kept giving them too many chances. They knew they could always come back if they wanted. Instead of trying to be what they wanted, just be myself. Give someone a chance and if it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s more fish in the sea.\n\nIt really caught my attention. I still think about that conversation regularly. Instead of trying to fit myself into someone\u2019s life because I found them attractive, I started finding people attractive who were more like me. I started dating a larger variety of people. I broke up with people when I wasn\u2019t happy instead of trying to stick it out for sex.\n\nI became much more happy myself. Eventually I met a waitress where a really good friend of mine worked. We hung out. I asked one time if she\u2019d like a back message, and she said yes. We moved in. We got married. We have two wonderful kids.\n\nThe problem was I kept trying to fit myself into someone else\u2019s life and expecting to be compensated. But I turned it around and got my own life. Then found someone who\u2019s life meshed with mine. No \u201ccompensation\u201d needed. Sex happens when we are horny (and the kids cooperate by not staying up too late. XD ). It doesn\u2019t hinge on things. It\u2019s its own thing.\n\nAnyway, just thought my story might be helpful to someone.",
            "The more I read these kinds of posts, the more I cringe. Not only because of the entitled, manipulative and selfish behavior of these \"nice guys\", but because I think I was one. I recognize a lot these behaviors as things that I felt, though didn't act on most of them. I didn't get a girlfriend until my first year of college, and looking back, I pouted when she turned me down for sex, bargained with her for sex, tried to guilt her into it, and internally raged at the fact that though we had lost our virginity to one another, we rarely repeated the act. I never blew up on her, but rather internalized it in a shame spiral that fucked me up for years. I thought I was ennobled by my reverence of her, that I was different from other guys because \"I was a nice guy who treated her like a queen\". But I didn't. I'm pushing 40 now, and looking at my younger self, I was on a dangerous path towards abusive behavior. We broke up after 2 years, and I met another girl who was more compatible sexually, but the possessiveness continued. I was distracted by the abundance of sex, so I didn't work on the issues I should have. I don't know if we just grew apart because college was wrapping up, or if the slow acting poison of my smothering behavior killed things from within, and she broke up with me a month before graduation. But in the end, with a lot of introspection, I learned how to treat people with dignity and recognized their needs and desires had exactly as much value as my own. I think its hard for some people to process their feelings. We feel them, so we have to be right. Its the other person who just doesn't get it. Thats not an excuse, but recognizing the flaws in that thinking can lead to growth and becoming a better person and partner.",
            "He destroyed my life for 3 years, he has now paying his dos... He gets to live with what he's done and the uncomfortable questions, I moved away and I'm so happy.",
            "I always tell girls to never ever give someone a chance if they already know they don\u2019t like that person exactly because of this\n\nWe tend to feel guilty turning someone down (I know some girls are dicks about it and some guys are dicks about it but that\u2019s another topic) we feel guilty either by empathy or because we\u2019re just as influenced by media and social conditioning as everyone else. There\u2019s a message that it\u2019s \u201cmean\u201d to turn someone down and that if you don\u2019t like how someone looks then it\u2019s not a \u201cgood reason\u201d or makes you \u201cshallow\u201d. All bullshit of course but this stuff was more or a problem in my teenage years when I was obviously still young \n\nYes I have a few a chance. One was absolutely awful. I gave a chance. Tried to see if i could like him. Couldn\u2019t. Often it\u2019s just a week or so of feeling sick to your stomach (maybe better for girls who don\u2019t fear confrontation but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d love to hear from them) because you\u2019re afraid of the reaction. Some girls are legit afraid for their safety when they turn someone down but in my case I feared how people would make me feel about it\n\nPeople who were making fun of me for going out with him to begin with were suddenly so sympathetic for him. (No one cares about your comfort and wants. Only about his) and we\u2019re tactically begging me to take him back \u201che\u2019s writing your name on shit and saying how in love he is\u201d\n\nTried again. Absolutely no self awareness or social skills. I am socially awkward too, but I don\u2019t abandon someone without a ride at a football game and laugh and his mannerisms were just all around weird and I couldn\u2019t enjoy him. Never go out with someone to give them a chance if you already don\u2019t feel you would want it. So I simply broke it off. I was as gentle as I could be. He went around lying and saying that I slept with him. It was more fun to believe him than to believe me so I was bullied for it a bit but I was bullied most of my life anyway\n\nAnother time was a train wreck too. I met a guy because a mutual friend tried to fix us up. Wasn\u2019t particularly attracted but he didn\u2019t seem so bad to be around. So I kept hanging out but it was obvious that I wasn\u2019t getting any feelings. Then one of his friends (I\u2019d known this guy already and always thought he was alright) hits me up and tellls me that the guy is not interested anymore and has a girlfriend. Oh okay! Then HE asks me out and I agree\n\nGuess who was lying? The other guy never had a girlfriend and his friend made it look like I was just hanging around to get to him. Of course it all comes out and his friend gets his ass kicked. His friend ended up with a reputation for being a liar and a player but thankfully this all went quickly enough that nothing happened but either way. By this point it was clear I was not going to have feelings for him and I don\u2019t think he and his family would have ever been able to shake the doubt about me being genuine so it was best to go our separate ways and I think I heard he\u2019s gotten married since so it\u2019s all good\n\nA third time... wasn\u2019t so bad. It wasn\u2019t so much that I didn\u2019t like him but gave a chance, but more that I already went on a date and thought he was awkward until he talked me into a second date and we got along really good so that ended in a two year relationship. I still use him as a warning example though because this guy was the example of someone who \u201cwants a chance\u201d and \u201cwould totally treat you right\u201d and it\u2019s true but only until they find confidence and glow up a bit. I don\u2019t fault anybody for wanting to date around, but once he had his glow up, he turned right into the cocky, shit they tend to think they are so much better than. These guys believe they would be better, but when they think that they can start to \u201cturn the tables \u201c (they tend to think of dating as a power struggle) then they\u2019re just the same as the people they wanted to prove they were better than\n\nHappily married now and doing great. Ten years strong. Didn\u2019t mean for this to be as long as it was but the point is not to dog on men, but to just kinda be at peace with going for what you want. Girls with low confidence can do the exact same thing.",
            "This will be pretty long because I\u2019m bored and want to explain a lot.\n\nIt was not a tantrum, more like emotional blackmail, with tantrum following after the relationship.  We met online and shared pictures and on the first day he was complementing me a lot, and I was obviously flattered and complemented him too. I never knew his intentions, seemed pretty nice (haha like yk a nice guy) but no genuinely I thought he\u2019d be a great friend and we even talked on the phone for a bit. I was 17 at that time, and the guy said oh my age is a mystery, so I know most people will say \u201cyep it\u2019s an obvious red flag\u201d. I knew it was, but I didn\u2019t care because I wasn\u2019t going to do anything with him anyway.\n\nLater he started saying things like how he wished I was his girl and all that, and let me let you know that I already told him I was never in a relationship before, don\u2019t plan on being in one now or anytime soon, oh and that I did like someone who I didn\u2019t plan on telling either (we\u2019re friends so we talk a lot) and knowing all that, he still said those. I said sorry, I can\u2019t really date plus my family is pretty religious and I\u2019m trying to follow that path, so it\u2019s all a no no to me. He still proceeded to tell me how he\u2019d be so sad if I didn\u2019t give him a chance, and that he wished that I knew to give other guys a chance cuz I never know what might come out of it, yada yada. He\u2019d say how he\u2019s so lonely and deserves and chance and all. Oh and also he was super clingy from the beginning because he\u2019d ask why I\u2019m not replying even if I\u2019m gone for like 5-10 minutes, even though I\u2019ve been working on my assignments which I told him about too. And he\u2019d say stuff like \u201cit\u2019s okay you can talk to me instead since I\u2019m more fun ;)\u201d (he\u2019s not)\n\nSo after I gave in, I said fine but I still like the other person. I let him know that because I knew this wasn\u2019t going to turn out good anyway. This guy was like \u201cI can change that\u201d so I said ok cool. Also asked him his age because this man started talking about trust, and when he said well that\u2019s a mystery, I said well no trust no relationship. And then he said guess and I started guessing and they weren\u2019t correct and yes turned out he was like 21 or 22 (I forgot) so right away I was like nope i don\u2019t like older guys plus I\u2019m a minor, and he proceeded to tell me how I seem mature plus I\u2019m going into senior year anyway, and I said still it\u2019s wrong, you should know that considering you\u2019re a whole adult. He then started to emotionally blackmail me (again) and I gave in (again)\n\nSo now comes the start of the relationship part. It was fine honestly, it was kinda cringe with all the emojis he\u2019d send and stuff he\u2019d say but I went along to make him feel better. Then he asked me to send him another pic and I did cuz why not. Then he said can I send you a dick pic and I was like nope. He then said why? We\u2019re in a relationship. I told him okay so if we are, you should consider my feeling and not send it since I\u2019m not comfortable with it, and that I still am I minor so it\u2019s wrong. And then he said fine and we talked some more, acted all cringe, then asked me for some pictures which I said no to, and he asked if I wanted a dick pic and I said no. And then he said you know what? I don\u2019t think you have feelings for me, and that you\u2019ve been faking it. I said \u201cya I like someone remember\u201d  and he said you said you didn\u2019t and I sent him a screenshot of us agreeing to be in a \u201crelationship\u201d even when I don\u2019t like him just for his sake and he said I can\u2019t believe you would do this to me. And I told him how he said that he just wanted a relationship, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019d meet him since my parents were strict.\n\nHe then proceeded on telling me how I\u2019m like those girls who broke him, how I\u2019m just like the other girls and that all girls are the same, and that he doesn\u2019t want to ever talk to me and that I hope I think about what I did and apologize. I told him I have nothing to apologize about, and that he should be the one to do it since he forced a relationship on me by guilt tripping me and also insisted on sending me nudes. He said you\u2019re crazy were breaking up, I said good, and we argued some more about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, and ya.\n\nThat\u2019s the story of how my first ever \u201crelationship\u201d ended in 8 hours.",
            "This will get lost in the many comments, but I tried going out with a nice guy after I initially rejected because I felt guilted into \u201cjust one date\u201d. He proceeded to hover over me and awkwardly touch me throughout the entire date- even though we were in public. (We went to a movie) \n\nHe tried reaching for somewhere he shouldn\u2019t, I told him no and tried to go back to watching the movie. He proceeded to whine \u201cwhy\u201d and then try to do it again. And again. Eventually I crossed my legs and arms, stopped touching him and just watched the movie until the end. \n\nAfterward, I told him that I didn\u2019t like how pushy he was. I\u2019d given him a chance but I didn\u2019t connect with him or like him. He screamed at me in public about how all girls are the same and what a stupid whore I was, that he paid for everything for nothing and that I was just leading him on. It triggered a panic attack and I started to tremble and cry like I was having a seizure. This didn\u2019t even seem to FAZE him and he continued- but then some people stepped in. \n\nIt was two girls and their dad- they were maybe 14 and 16, and their Dad was a grizzled looking guy probably in his 40\u2019s. The 16 year old ran over and took me by the shoulders, hugging me and basically yelled at the guy to back off and leave me alone. The 14 year old joined in to kind of hold me and their Dad walked up and just started to quietly talk to the guy and he ended up leaving. The three stayed with me, calmed me down, and even got me an ice cream. They made sure I had a safe ride home before they even walked me to my car to make sure he didn\u2019t approach me again. \n\n\nAfter this episode, the guy blocked my number and I thankfully never heard from him again. Because of this, I will never, EVER, EVER go out with a \u201cnice guy\u201d who decides to throw a fit if I say the n-word. (No.)\n\nEdit: typos",
            "Anyone that's a self proclaimed 'nice guy' is usually controlling, abusive, and narcissistic, and pretty much a big mistake to get involved with. A genuinely nice guy does not need to boast and make statements about it, he just behaves in a respectable manner.",
            "Male speaking and this is my nice guy moment from about 7 years ago. I contacted a girl of afro/Caucasian descent that I used to be in a school club with. We got along well but we're mostly just acquaintances through the club but I thought she was cute. \n\nAt some point I made the smartest decision and said something along the lines of \"I don't normally find black girls attractive but you ..\" and she rightfully got offended that I was SO considerate to like her. That hit me like a ping pong ball against a battleship and I got pissed because of what she said, I did nothing wrong after all! What was the big deal in saying that!? Respond pouty.\n\nAt some point in the next 5 minutes of rereading to try to understand what happened it finally hit me that I had been a pompous asshat and that there was nothing smooth or charming about that and I apologised and now the memory helps keep me company when I'm trying to fall asleep XD\n\nUh moral of the story? Nice guys can mature out of their state I guess? Married almost two years now (different lady).",
            "I know this will be at the bottom but had to share.  I read this thinking, who the hell would do that?  Then I remembered. Me. I would do that. An intelligent, loved kid who felt pressured multiple times to \u201cnot hurt someone\u2019s feelings\u201d. The one that this thread made me remember when I was a sophomore in HS and a sophomore in college asked me out.  We met at a charity event. Our mothers were there and knew each other. I was still uncomfortable. \n\n\nTold a friend about it. She was horrified I would \u201cpass up this opportunity\u201d to go out with a college guy.  He was calling and seemed nice enough. Fine. Set up a double date.  On the way home from the pizza place it was just us and I realized that not only did I have nothing In common with him but he made me nervous. He pulled into the parking lot at a local school. One that was a quarter mile long and surrounded by trees. No neighbors in site. Closest house was half a mile away.  I was crying and asking him why we were stopping. He went into this whole thing about how I led him on and  when I explained I was uncomfortable he kept telling me what a nice guy he was.  I believed it. \n\nI was lucky. He didn\u2019t force me or hurt me. He took me home without touching me but I was convinced that I was the bad guy in that situation.  It made it hard for me to ever say no to any guy who showed any interest because I \u201cknew\u201d I was \u201chysterical\u201d and over reactive. I ended up doing a lot of things that I really didn\u2019t want to do.  But, overall, I was and still consider myself lucky because no one raped me or hit me. \n\nLooking at that sentence as a 30+ year old with kids it makes me want to throw up. I want so much more for my daughter (and sons) than to feel they were lucky they weren\u2019t raped."

            "This wasn't a win but a glitch that gave my mom free parking at meters for about 12 years.\n\nWhere I live (in a big city) there is no free parking anywhere unless its a store owned lot. Anyways, back in the early 2000's they started adding a card reader to the old-school coin parking meters and to use them you would purchase the card from the city and then load funds onto the card. The benefit of this card was that you could put more time onto the meter than you thought you needed and when you got back to your car, if there was still time left you could insert your card and the extra time would get loaded back into your card.\n\nThis was great because you could always put more than enough time and never have to go back to top off the meter if you were gone for longer than expected. The meters had a little screen that would tell you the balance of your card when you first inserted it.\n\nOne day my mother had extra time on her meter and put the card in to get back the difference. The next time she parked her car at a meter and put her card in it showed she had a $45k balance on the card. The machine had glitched the last time it put time back on her card and gave her that insane balance. Took her a while to believe that it would actually keep on working but 6 months later, when her actual balance would have for sure been spent, it still showed the ridiculous number and it would deduct the correct amount of money she would spend on the meter off of her crazy balance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor around the next 12 years the city kept that system in place. They had added kiosks to pay during that time but still had the individual meters with the card readers until they eventually removed all of the meters and now everything is pay by app. During that time while they were still around my mom would give her card to friends and family to park when they needed it and every time she would park she would put like 8 hours of credit on the machines and when she would leave, if she saw a car getting ready to park she would let them know to park in her spot once she pulled out because it had free time.",

If the program was about to lose because of bad cards, it quit the channel and logged in again automatically again for the next run.\n\nThe program was playing day and night, and after some weeks, he had won several TV sets, video cameras, cruises, you name it.\n\nEventually, the organizer of the game locked my father out - which was illegal. So he sued the company which organized the game and reached an agreement: They paid him an amount of about 10k, and he never played again.\n\nSo instead of a lifetime supply of beer, he got a lot of stuff and this is why I, as a teenager, had my own video camera (Which, at this time, was so expensive that people had to lease them.)",

He made me an offer - one eighth ounce of marijuana a week for life in exchange for $2k so he could buy the lights.\n\nIt seemed a bit risky, but I decided to go for it. Every Monday I would pick up books from the book drop for the local library, stop by his place, stash the weed beneath the books and then deliver the books to the library.\n\nAfter five years I realized I\u2019d gotten over two pounds in very high quality weed from him over the years. My state was on the verge of passing legalization so I let him know I felt he\u2019d made good on my investment. He was willing to continue the deal, but I just had to refuse. I honestly felt guilty.\n\nAnyway, fast forward five years and 9/10 times if I see his farm\u2019s label at a dispensary I buy his weed.  It feels really good knowing that he has a thriving agricultural business that grew out of that desperate illegal home grow when his supplier got arrested. Last I heard he\u2019s expanding out of state, looking at opening farms in Canada, working on a CBD energy drink for sale in grocery stores and seriously considering opening up to an IPO if possible.

Basically, he could go in once a week and exchange one of the vouchers for one meal off the menu. Which is actually pretty solid considering he didn't actually like Arby's that much.

Then we\u2019d use them as needed, occasionally getting them fresh when we wanted. I was a kid and honestly it rocked. Can\u2019t imagine doing it for over a year though.\n\n\nEdit: Guys, we probably ate the pizza every single week for about 6 months straight, but after a while you do start to get sick of it- especially since it\u2019s the same type from the same place. However the deal was use it or lose it, so if we wanted to skip a week it didn\u2019t double to the next. When everyone started to get sick of it, my dad would have them partially bake it , then freeze and cook at a later date. Frozen was better than no pizza at all, and with 3 kids in the house it was perfect to have a bunch of pizzas for when we all had friends over. Free pizza is free pizza.",

            "I have no pericardium. \n\nWhen I was 6 months old, I had bad acid reflux, and Drs were concerned about damage to my esophagus. One CT Scan later, my esophagus was okay. But they saw a hole in my pericardium, which is the sack of protective fat around the heart. Now this is a problem because as I would grow up, my heart could start to grow through the hole, and choke itself at some point, killing me out of the blue.\n\nSo at 7 months old I had heart surgery. They went in all ready to patch the hole.\n\nOnly to find what had looked like a hole on the scan, was actually the pericardium. All of it that formed at least. I am one of 23 people at that time (if I remember correctly) who had been found to have this while alive, and not post morten during autopsy. \n\nThey removed the small peice that was all that had formed on gestation, so I have no pericardium. \n\n\nIt does not effect me negatively in anyway, and I am immune to pericardial diseases (not that many exist to my knowledge). I tried to get into a military academy, so had to see a cardiologist to get certification that it was a non issue. He confirmed I could do anything I wanted, heart health wise.

            "I am adored by cats (for no seeming reason) and hated by dogs (for no seeming reason). \n\nI have had random dogs attack me on the street completely unprovoked on multiple occassions. One time I was walking in a crowded street and I heard extremely distant angry barking. I look over my shoulder and I see this tiny white speck in the distance coming from an uphill street ways, WAYS away from me. I walk a little further and the barking gets louder - I turn around and the dog is even closer, looks like it's running straight for me. But like, I'm in such a dense crowd - how the heck would it see me? Why would it CARE about me at all? So I'm like 'nah, no way' and walk on a bit more - the barking comes super close. I look back just in time to see the same damn dog, make its way THROUGH the crowd, barking and snarling towards me and I ended up having to fight it off with my bag. \n\nThat was the weirdest one - I've had dogs attack me in a similar way so many times over the years. I'd pass them by minding my own business, often not even realizing they were there, and they'd suddenly come barrelling after me. I've had so many people swear to me that their dogs are normally sweet and nice and never attack people. \n\nI'm not evil or menacing or anything, I don't think.

            "Worked at Wendy's when I was a teenager. Just me at the register, the manager and another girl in her early 20's at the drive-thru, another guy in his 20's was on the grill and an older woman at the sandwhich station, who I chatted with often.\n\nIt's almost closing time. The manager is in the office doing whatever it is they do. Woman at sandwiches starts doing dishes and the other two are outside taking a quick smoke break. So I start cleaning up the dining area and take the trash out to the dumpster.\n\nThe dumpsters are enclosed around a fenced gate to keep pests and animals out. As I approached the dumpster, I heard someone whisper \"shh shh\" followed by a quiet \"What?\". I am now aware these two people are not actually smoking and probably doing something my 16 year old eyes don't wanna see, especially since it's my coworkers. So I stand there for a moment figuring out what to do, as I'm tired and ready to go home. Then without a second thought, I heave the trash bag over the gate and yell out \"Throw the trash in dumpster for me when y'all are done\". I walk back inside to finish cleaning up. The two love birds walk in about 5 minutes later and do whatever they can to avoid eye contact with me. As I'm heading to my truck, I check the dumpsters to see if they threw the bag in the bin. To my surprise, they actually did",

Storage rooms, offices , empty barracks rooms. Went on for months. One day our platoon sergeant pull us aside and tells us he knows what's been going on. Says he saw us in one of our large warehouse areas. He said as long as it never happened again, he wouldn't make a bid deal of it. He kept his word, good dude.",

            "At my old job in a sheet metal factory we caught two elderly employees having sex In the back of his suburban. We\u2019d long suspected it because they went from being extremely close to kinda trying not to be seen talking that much. Also because it was a job that had unlimited OT, they\u2019d both show up at the same time and leave at the same time even though we didn\u2019t have set hours. It was wild because both his son and her sons worked for the same company. His wife would show up and bring food for the whole staff in our department too and you could see the mistresses guilt whenever his wife was there because she\u2019d always leave. After we caught them, we kept our mouths shut about it but they both starting being really nice to us all, the woman would bring us all lunch every day.",
            "There was a girl who had sex with some employees for pay. When caught, they transferred her to another building and took some minor disciplinary action against all involved.\n\nThen she did it again at the new building, so they transferred her back (couple years had passed, so no old \"clients\" in her area).\n\nThen she did it again. 3rd time was the final straw to get her fired.",

            "I worked with a guy at my previous job who was a night security guard for the main facility.  Very smart guy but had tons of self destructive behavior when he was doing well.  He was caught on camera entering an office with a night janitor and she confessed that they had been having sex at work.  When confronted, he admitted to having sex with her and they said that he would be terminated.  He agreed but first aksed them to show him where it explicitly said in the company policy that having sex on company grounds was prohibited.  He had already reviewed the company policy and knew he had a claim of potential wrongful termination and they did as well. Soon after we had an updated corporate policy release with some clarification on what was considered appropriate work behavior.  The guy actually stayed with the company for years and went on to work in manufacturing where he was terminated for more self destructive behavior.\n\nEdit: Several asked for other stories so I'll share a few of the ones I recall and aren't too personal to him.  \n\nOnce he we just beyond the city limits (large city) to a decent size river/creek.  Was shooting a sawed off shot gun into the water when the police came after numerous complaints. He had all the license required to \"duck hunt\" and could legally hunt there but the officers had to talk him into moving to a safer location.  He was not hunting at all.\n\nThe other story I recall was him driving a tiny front loader at work that a 3rd party contractor had brought in for the day.  He ended up fucking something up and then using the safety policy against the company as a way to protect himself.  I can't recall the exact reasoning behind this one, but we all thought it was the end for him, but he managed to work himself out of it.",

He just asked me if it was consensual, which it was, and lectured me on how inappropriate that was (obviously I agree). He also said he wished us a happy relationship lol.

            "I used to work at a high end restaurant for a few years so I got a few stories. For instance one time after closing up shop we were getting ready to go home when I heard a noise in one of the broom closets. Found 2 customers fucking in it after we'd closed down. Another time I walked into our walk in freezer after we'd mostly closed to do a quick inventory only to find one of the waitresses getting fuckin plowed by one of the other chefs. I laughed and said don't let me interrupt I'm just counting inventory. Another time one of our corporate chefs got fired for jerking off in the managers office, that was pretty neat. But the best one by far has to be the time we were closing up shop and this waitress and cook kinda had a little thing going on and the whole kitchen staff knew about it. So one day we saw them walk into our outdoor cooler and shut the door behind them, someone mentioned it to me and naturally I told everyone still there. We all waited outside the door and listened to see if we could hear fuckin sounds, we did. So when they finished they walked out only to be greeted by the entire closing staff shouting \"Fucking Finally!\" Oh they were so embarrassed it was great.",

Apparently she has been trying for several years with her husband and it finally worked. Fast forward to her last day at work before her maternity leave we decided to throw her a small good-bye party at the branch employees room after closing hours, the husband was present as well. 15 minutes passed and suddenly the husband decided it was time for a toast and that apparently he made a lovely video for his wife to show her how grateful he was on a usb stick and insisted on showing us the video.. so the manager brought him his laptop so we could watch it.. The video was a hidden cam i guess in their bedroom of the advisor having sex with another guy with sound and everything. We were all so shocked the video played for a good minute until the manager closed his laptop and basically sent everyone home the advisor was crying her life out the husband had this evil smile on his face took his usb stick out of the laptop and said \"see you in court\" and left.\n\nSorry for my bad english!",

They assured us they were up to nothing but we heard noises a few times so I played a hunch. I was IT and one day coming out of the server room passed them in the hall and she asked what I was doing in there and I fabricated a security system that no one bothered checking. I explained I was in charge of the tapes and updates - that due to robbery and theft, we had hidden camera in every room - including their office. I hadn't looked at it in months and was restoring the system to look at some stuff from the past weeks.\n\nFast forward about 20 minutes, they are TEARING THE ROOM APART looking for a camera. You can hear her sobbing through the door, shocked at what I \"have on tape\". They got a warning, I pointed into a vent as a heads up for the camera and warned it got the whole room.\n\nWe eventually fired them both.",

            "I use to work for Telus Mobility in Canada in one of the call centres and people would get caught fucking like once or twice a year.  The call centre was mostly people in there 20's and early 30's, long hours and shitty employee morale, so sometimes it felt like people were just fucking to pass the time. \n\nIt was a union job so it was generally hard to lose your job, you really had to fuck up hard to actually get fired, and even then the union would fight to get your job back. So usually when it happened the punishments were a write up and/or suspension and getting moved to a different team if needed.  \n\nThese are a couple times that stick out in my mind.  \n\nThe first one was the time that a couple got caught in the \"nurse's room\".  Essentially it was a quiet room built off of the company lunch room where if you weren't feeling well you could go and lay down on the bed that was in there.  I assume that people were fucking in there a lot but after the one couple got caught it was renovated I think into an arcade room. \n\n\nThe second time was a buddy of mine, who was a call centre rep who was given a developmental opportunity with the management training team.  He was the on call manager one night and he was caught in one of the conference rooms, on a completely different floor, with his girlfriend.  Now they weren't actually caught fucking, as far as I know, he had given an excuse of his girlfriend needed to use one of the scanner/printers (or something like that).  Everyone universally assumed that they had been fucking though, he was removed from the management training and was put back on the phones.\n\nEdit: one time that I can't believe I forgot to mention was the time that one of the Loyalty managers was caught fucking his team members.   It had apparently been going on for a long time and he was able to get away with it because he was the manager of the at home team.  From what I was told he would pop by for \"home inspections\" and was fucking a couple of different reps on his team.  He only got caught when one of the people on his team reported it.  \n\nThe company and the union did their investigations, that manager got fired and two other managers who were apparently aware of what he was doing also got fired. \n\nI don't know how things are now, since I left Telus about 7 years ago, but for a long time people were fucking like their lives depended on it in the Telus call centre.",

            "I was a projectionist at a local movie theater when I was 20, and walked into the hallway that connected the projection booths to the managers office.  I heard loud moaning and walked towards the stairs.  Unfortunately the floors were unfinished wood, so they made a lot of noise.  Moaning stopped and the managers door slammed.  I walked down the stairs and went on my break in the concession food prep area.\n\nGot fired for no reason 2 days later.  They tried to make up some BS about me swearing in front of a customer that COINCIDENTALLY was from corporate.  UTTER BS.  Joke is on them though. When my uncle heard about this, he went into full on lawyer mode and started digging.  Turns out that no one from the corporate office was even on the west coast that week, and he initiated a lawsuit for wrongful termination which we ended up winning and getting a decent amount of money from the company.  Both the managers were fired, and now the theater is owned by AMC.",
            "Not me who was having the sex, but when I was managing a fast-casual restaurant we were so busy that we had a line wrapped around the building and every table was full, online orders filling the entire wall and one of our cooks called off. I look up to see two of my servers are missing but we're so busy and somehow managing to work register and kitchen (tricky to do since you have to be diligent about washing between the two) so I can't go look for them.\n\nEventually I see them both come out of the men's bathroom and he is still pulling his pants up. In front of a jam packed dining room (maybe 75 customers around). Part of the problem with this was that they were 16 and 19 years old. I gave them the whole \"you have got to be fucking kidding me\" thing and send one of them to clean the dining room and the other to start with trash and dishes. When I finally had the chance to confront them she said that she only blew him, no sex - as if that was supposed to help her case.\n\nMostly pissed that they abandoned the rush and left their co workers and myself to struggle and that they didn't seem to care that everyone in the building saw them walk out of the bathroom like that more than I was angry that they were doing whatever they were doing in there, not having sex or whatever. After they finished cleaning up after people and doing all of the cook's dishes, I fired them. They both cried (bc they are actual children).\n\nThe next day the 16 yo girl's mom came in ready to fight for her baby, towering over me about why did I fire her daughter and clearly having no idea what happened. I could see the girl sitting in her mom's mini van out in the parking lot while this woman is screaming in my face about her little angel being mistreated by our establishment. That was a fun conversation for me, and an enlightening one for that woman. I made sure she knew how on display this entire event was. \n\nThe real kicker was when I got a call from two other stores shortly after bc they were both trying to get their jobs back at other locations, not knowing that if you apply saying you've worked for the company before, we call each other to make sure there aren't any red flags. Needless to say, they were not hired.",

I worked mornings and he worked afternoons and we didn't see each other for more than 5 minutes between I left and he started working. We were both 16 and this was my first job. \n\nAfter about a month, my boyfriend gets fired, out of the blue. He was given the reason that his performance was not good enough. I find out later from a classmate/co-worker, who was a total slut, that he was fired for having sex with me in the freezer. Uhhh... No. Never happened. \n\nI confronted the the owner and was told to shut up and get back to work. Turns out, the slut and the boss were the ones who were having sex in the freezer and my boyfriend walked in on them, awkwardly backed out, and went back to work. It explained all the weird frozen splotches of white on the floor of the freezer. \n\nI left a month later and the owner was suspected of raping a minor. \n\nHubby and I have been happily married for 9 years despite never having freezer sex at work.",

My office is very private and I almost never have any visitors.  My door is always open unless I leave for the day.  On this day as my assistant came walking in on us with the IT guy who was trying to pull ethernet cable through the drop ceiling. They saw the door closed and assumed I'd left so they just walked in.  Shame on me for not locking the door in the heat of the moment.\n\nSo my assistant and the IT guy walked in on my wife doing some very kinky stuff.  They immediately panicked and left.  Never talked about it again, but my assistant always knocked after that.  At least it was my wife and not something more illicit.

They thought it would be a great idea to have sex in the hospital... in an Operating Room. What they didn't realize is that every OR is sterilized post-surgery to make things clean and safe for the next operation that happens (instead of right before the operation). What they *also* didn't realize is that every OR has a camera filming it live. \n\nNeedless to say those two caused that OR to get a deep clean while the next surgery was postponed and were no longer students at our medical school before the end of that rotation. \n\nRumor on the grapevine is that they broke up from the ordeal, found new medical schools, and went on to be full doctors getting residencies in competitive fields albeit in hospitals that nobody would want to be trained in if they had a choice.

He always told me they used to get it on in the stationary store room (tiny room) inside the managers office. One of the overnight cashiers walked in to get something and caught them. It was a long time ago but I don\u2019t think anything happened to them because that tiny room had no cameras and it was passed as they were \u201ccleaning\u201d the stationary storage room together. I won\u2019t mention the fast food chain, but many of the managers were sleeping with each other. I believe this was another reason that no disciplinary action was taken.",

The only food being served that year was beef tartar, and as nice as that is, it doesn't make a meal. \n\nSo most of us proceeded to drink on empty stomachs and were inebriated pretty quickly.\n\nThe rest of the night is a blur. One of our interns had a thing for me, and with our inhibitions removed, we had a heavy make out session in front of everyone (who thankfully were mostly also in similar states of inebriation).

She and I were not twins, but people always asked if we were anyway and then it allllllll made sense why I was being stared at during my short work assignment at the company.\n\nSuddenly the oddly short duration of most of her temp assignments made much more sense after she revealed that info, always claiming that she was never clear on why she was removed from assignments or wasn't getting placements from any temp company more than once.

One day, mr important WaHo dude for the southeast came into our house as we were a recent open and the owner must\u2019ve been absolutely desperate to impress him, so he decided to go all in about his bacon-cooking prodigy reluctantly nicknamed \u2018the Baconator\u2019. (For context, every time one of the absolute characters, who are longtime WaHo workers, would call for the classic \u201cPull 1 bacon\u201d, they would make a big deal to their customers about the rookie \u2018Baconator\u2019 and I would proceed to shake my head over the grill and remind myself that this was the absolute rock-bottom). So mr important WaHo man tells me to fry him up some godly pieces of bacon. I pick out 4 thicc slices of bacon, toss those badboys on the grill and let them sizzle for precisely 40-45 seconds, but mr WaHo is telling me to throw the iron on them as is standard procedure. But I continue to let the bacon cook uncovered for just the right amount of seconds before I threw the iron on for half the time. Lifted the iron off the bacon, scooped and served, so they would hit the plate knowing another 10-15 seconds of cookin are still going to occur. Bossman takes a look at their flawless appearance, takes a bite, and this freaking infectious smile emerges. The smile only provided by bacon sizzled to perfection. \n\n\nWell they wanted me to work Christmas, but my family had booked a cruise for the week. Parents were in the beginnings of splitting up, so I kind of saw it as the last traditional family hoorah. Manager was adamant that I work the holidays regardless of my notification during the hiring process. So on Thursday at work, the day before we had to head to the Florida Keys to embark, my dick manager snidely says \u201csee you Saturday\u201d (holidays on the weekends at waho are pure hell) and I replied, \u201cyeah man, if you\u2019re going to be in fucking Barbados\u201d Proceeded to kick open the the greasy, black, unlockable back door (because 24/7 waffles duh) one last time and Kobe the fuck out of my bacon-grease-lathered black apron into the shit bin for the absolute final time with my yellow name tag saying \u2018BACONATOR\u2019 still attached.  \n\nAfter the cruise I came in to pick up my last pay check before returning to college just trying to slide in and out unnoticed because I was sure they fired me. They hadn\u2019t. It was like they completely forgot. I was instead offered a management position by mr regional Waho at one of the wahos in my college town. (I had talked with him about progress in college and stuff so I guess he figured I was the most qualified, unfortunately the Baconator\u2019s achievements weren\u2019t enough) I would have hopped on that if I wasn\u2019t at that very moment specifically determined to finish school so I never had to scrape WaHo grease off those bloody tiles ever again. Or have damn Karla the semi-functional meth head call me Baconator one more god damn time with a hoarse laugh right before she heads out back to chain smoke cigs for half an hour. \n\nMy drunk ass just realized this post has absolutely nothing to do with the OP, so enjoy this random anecdote from the 2 most pathetic months of my life",

I'm talking about companies who pay people to kindly smooth over issues and solve problems that don't really have a department that can provide an answer (hint: that's all the problems). Let's look at the freight industry (where I work).\n\nFreight is simple. We pick things up, move them somewhere, and set them down. Where it gets stupid are the expectations of customers who really don't give a crap and just want their stuff *right now*.\n\nI remember we were in the middle of a blizzard where our terminal was located and we were understaffed due to, you know, a blizzard and people getting stuck in the road. Trucks were going off the road and being blown over.\n\nBut nevermind that. *Where's my stuff?* One of our customer service reps was calmly explaining (as other lines rung off the hook) to an irate, rural customer that we were in the middle of a blizzard and could not justify sending a truck out to the boon docks. The response?\n\n\"It ain't snowin' out *my* window!\"\n\nMy other favorite is when customers call in and think the driver who picks up their freight is the exact same guy who is going to deliver the freight across the country. Like this dude wakes up at six, brings a whole 54' trailer to your business, picks up your single skid of absolute horsecrap, and is then going to soldier forward to the coast to deliver it immediately after.\n\nIt's our going policy to keep this Disney-world illusion for our customer. Freight is actually a really difficult industry to understand and it just isn't worth the time to explicate it to a customer who will realize mid-explanation that all they really care about is when their freight will get there. Thus: Yes, indeed, the freight industry is driven by basically Santa Claus-like powers.\n\nCustomer service at honest, hard-working companies is here to manage your stupidity and make you feel smart and satisfied about it.",

            "I have a few.\n\nThere is 6 feet of DNA inside every nucleated cell. I say nucleated because red blood cells have no nucleus.\n\nSpeaking of red blood cells, 85% of all of your cells are red blood cells. Your bone marrow pumps out about 2.4 million every second. Each red blood cell contains about 270 million hemoglobin molecules. Each hemoglobin molecule can carry 4 molecules of O2. It takes about 60 seconds for a blood cell to completely circulate your entire body.\n\nEvery 7 years, every cell in your body will have completely replaced itself. Different cells divide at different rates, however. You need a new stomach lining weekly and a new skeleton every 7 years.\n\n\\[Edit: I guess the above isn't exactly true. I'd just heard it before somewhere. [A few types of cells are not replaced over time](https://www.discovery.com/science/Body-Really-Replace-Itself-Every-7-Years#:~:text=Brain%20cells%20don't%20regenerate,also%20with%20you%20for%20life)\\]\n\nEvery square inch of your skin is covered in bacteria.

(*Update: apparently this is no longer the case, but we didn't cover that particular detail  when I took human development for some reason... Leaving for context of the comments- but would be more accurate to say our distant ancestors were all aholes at some point)*\n\nEvolution is very weird, so instead of evolving scales/armor/etc, humans mostly just evolved to still be squishy with easily punctured skin, and developed redundant or duplicate organs. You can lose several feet of you intestines and be fine, you only need 1 working kidney and 1 working lung, your liver regrows, the heart can beat on its own, and you only need half your brain (if it is removed early enough in life, there's minimal to no deficits). \n\nA kidney donor has 1 kidney, but a kidney recipient typically has 3. It's usually easier/safer to just graft in the new kidney than to remove the old (assuming the old isn't dying/infected and just stopped working)\n\nMost mother's are chimeras due to some fetal cells crossing the placenta. The cells can lodge and survive in the mother's body with no adverse effects. \n\nSpeaking of chimeras, a woman once failed a maternity test, despite giving birth to her kids. Turns out she was a chimera from 2 zygotes that fused, and her reproductive tract was from the absorbed twin and had different DNA than the cells in her cheek (where the test sample was taken). Only cells collected from her reproductive tract matched her children.",

Up until those studies, we could only really do anything about an ischemic stroke if it happened within the last 6 hours. These 2 studies showed that, using various criteria, we could perform thrombectomy up to 24 hours from symptom onset with statistically significant improvement in outcome for the patient.\n\nBefore, if a patient woke up with stroke symptoms, there likely wasn't a damn thing we can do. Now, we can actually attempt to clear the clot and potentially restore some function.\n\nAnd compared to our stroke care 10 years ago which basically boiled down to \"Well, that sucks.\" and then not having anything to do, stroke care has made some huge strides.

            "One of the more recent theories in psychiatry gaining popularity (although it was acknowledged decades ago) is the role of inflammation and the immune system in mental illness. There are studies showing that in schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions, [inflammation attacks the brain](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00372/full). Some of the damage by inflammation might be irreversible, so the hope is that early intervention could prevent chronic schizophrenia. Trials have been attempted with anti-inflammatories like fish oil, with mixed success. \n\nThe role of inflammation has been extended to multiple mental illnesses, like [depression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322308015321), with raised inflammatory markers and other evidence being a common finding. Ultimately mental illness is multifactorial, and the causes are often biological, psychological, and/or social. So we can't reduce something so complex and heterogenous to just an action by the immune system. But it has gained some excitement in the field because there could be people out there, for example, with schizophrenia for whom one of the *primary* causes is immune system dysregulation, and researchers are racing to find a prevention.

            "Astronomer here! Most of you have heard that the universe is expanding. Astrophysicists believe there is a relationship between the distance to faraway galaxies and how fast they are moving from us, called the [Hubble constant. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law) We use the Hubble constant for... just about everything in cosmology, to be honest. \n\nThis isn\u2019t crazy and has been accepted for many decades. What *is* crazy is, if you are paying attention, it appears the Hubble constant is *different* depending on what you use to measure it! Specifically, if you use the \u201cstandard candle\u201d stars (Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae) to measure how fast galaxies are speeding away from us, you get ~73 +/- 1 km/s/Mpc. If you study the earliest radiation from the universe (the Cosmic Microwave Background) using the [Planck satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_%28spacecraft%29#2015_data_release) , you get 67 +/- 1 km/s/Mpc. This is a LOT, and both methods have a lot of confidence in that measurement with no obvious errors. \n\nTo date, *no one* has come up with a satisfactory answer for why this might be, and in the past year or so it\u2019s actually a bit concerning. If they truly disagree, well, it frankly means there is some new, basic physics at play. \n\nExciting stuff! It\u2019s just so neat that whenever you think you know how the universe works, it can throw these new curveballs at you from the most unexpected places!\n\nEdit: some are asking if dark energy which drives the acceleration of the universe might cause the discrepancy.  In short, no.  You can read [this article](https://astronomynow.com/2018/07/13/cosmic-mystery-deepens-with-conflicting-measurements-of-hubble-constant/) to learn more about what's going on, and [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/06/29/surprise-the-hubble-constant-changes-over-time/#6cdf042d9c9a) can tell you about the expansion of the universe.

Truly terrifying and very little is leaking to the public via mass media or being mocked as a conspiracy theory.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature  \n",

            "There are CPUs that can change their internal circuitry on the fly to suit whatever problem they are working on. This can give massive power savings and free up the traditional CPU cores for other things. \n\nImagine being able to encode a 4k game stream using just a few watts of power and almost no CPU time.\n\nThe downsides are that it costs an arm and a leg, and your programs will now take 8 hours to compile (if you are a dev).\n\nEssentially it is a CPU with an FPGA next to it in the same package. The FPGA is available as an OpenCL target and being in the same package as the CPU shares the global memory with the CPU.\n\nThe part number is Xeon Gold 6138P. \n\nEdit: some people have complained that my pop-science explanation is misleading.\n\nAn FPGA doesn't physically change it's internal circuit structure. It uses RAM-based lookup tables and multiplexers to implement a particular digital behavior. Running a computation on a FPGA is significantly more power efficient than on a CPU, but still much less power efficient than a custom physical circuit. The benefit of an FPGA is that you can change the circuit it is implementing whenever you like.\n\nYou can implement a CPU on an FPGA, and I believe you can buy kits that walk you through that, but this will be orders of magnitude less powerful and efficient than an actual physical CPU.\n\nThe reason that you are able to get speed and efficiency from an FPGA for a particular computation is because the compiler implements a bespoke pipeline on the FPGA as opposed to a general purpose CPU pipeline.\n\nNow, FPGA's have been around for a while, but the recent advancements are:\n\n *  Compilers that effectively turn programs written in high-level languages into bespoke pipelines. (Before you either had to use hardware-design languages or heavily stripped down versions of C.)\n\n *  Much better clock speed and circuit density on FPGA's\n\n *  Integrating FPGA's into CPU's and making all the interfacing with the FPGA transparent to the programmer",

            "Meditation.  \n\nIf you sit and try hard until that timer goes off, for an hour a day, you will go a significant portion of the way down the path to buddhahood.  \n\nEnlightenment is not impossible. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s not some magical event that only happens once in ten million lifetimes.  \n\nSit down, *actually meditate* when you sit, and you will relieve a ton of psychological tension, understand your mind and consciousness better, and be well on your way to finding and fixing the bug called dukkha.  \n\nThe word \u201cattachment\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect mapping. There\u2019s a very distinct and simple thing your mind does, but it\u2019s not possible to explain in words. That\u2019s not because it\u2019s fundamentally strange though; the flavor of orange juice or the smell of garlic is also impossible to explain in words. Those are very distinct things, everyday things, but you can\u2019t convey the experience of orange juice or frying garlic to someone in words.  \n\n\u201cAttachment\u201d refers to a very specific mental activity, one that is sandwiched into every thought and action. One you\u2019re feeling right now. But it\u2019s like the peanut butter in a PBJ, for someone whose entire diet consists of PBJs. Peanut butter is its own thing, but if you\u2019ve never eaten peanut butter separate from a PBJ, someone could tell you \u201cthere\u2019s peanut butter in every PBJ you\u2019ve ever eaten\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t tell you what peanut butter is.  \n\nMeditation, sitting with a timer and trying to keep your mind focused on one thing the entire time - like your breath or a dot on a sheet of paper - is an exercise that forces you to map out your own consciousness.  \n\nThe map becomes higher and higher resolution until one day you see a little part of that map that hurts, and you just reroute around it, and you stop attaching to everything, and you can *literally do all the things you did before*, but that \u201cattachment\u201d thing is gone and everything is less heavy.  \n\nAn hour a day for a year is some serious meditation training. You might not get all the way to enlightenment that quickly, but you\u2019ll be well on your way and enlightenment isn\u2019t the only benefit, nor even the major one.  \n\nYour prefrontal cortex will be thicker and have more processing power. Your willpower will be stronger. Your emotions will be better regulated. Your overall affect will be more positive across the board. Your sleep will be better. Colors will be more vivid and flavors will be more sumptuous. You will have resolved and refined psychological problems that are too simple to articulate in words. Your muscles will be more relaxed. Your lung capacity will be larger. Your endocrine system will be healthier and better regulated. You\u2019ll be able to enter a meditative state for a few seconds at a time as needed throughout the day and center yourself well. Your metacognition will be more developed, allowing for better insight of and easier control over your thought patterns.  \n\nMaybe someday, if you keep it up, you might find that enlightenment switch, but that\u2019s just icing on the cake.",

            "You wouldn't be an expert, but if you spend an hour a day learning programming, and spend the time well, you'd certainly be employable, and jobs in the tech industry are pretty damn great in my experience. I've never worked on a weekend, I work 40 hours a week at an absolute maximum. I'm generally treated pretty well. There's lots of money flowing around, lots of free lunches (they exist!), lots of side benefits and perks. \n\nThis is a personal soapbox of mine - lots of people think that programming is something only highly intelligent people can do. This is a misconception - it's a skill that just about anyone can learn if they're willing to put time in. \n\nA lot of people also think that they have to be sterotypical nerds, or have a \"passion\" for programming if they want to write code for a living. Also bullshit. How many people in the world get paid to do the thing they're passionate about? Think garbagemen are passionate about picking up your trash? No, but they're paying their bills. If you accept it as a given that you might not make your living doing something that like, deeply fulfills you, then you may as well find something that you're not passionate about that pays well. \n\n\ntl;dr - wanna get a job that's better than what like 90% of people have? Learn to code.\n\n\n\n\nedit: \n\nthis got more attention than I thought it would. Let me clarify, since I think some people are assuming I mean more than I do here. I absolutely don't mean that 365 hours of programming is going to make you a senior level software engineer, or even that you're going to be able to do much of value on your own. If you do only 365 hours there will be lots of gaps in your knowledge, you won't be ready to run a team, you likely won't know enough to put together anything that could be reasonably called an \"app\". You're not going to work at Google.\n\nBut what you _can_ get in 365 is enough knowledge of the basics of what programming _is_. The amount of demand for devs is enormous right now and there are lots of shops that are willing to invest in people who've shown that they have the determination and grit to learn. If you can parley that basic knowledge into your first entry level coding job then you can go very far, if you're willing to keep learning. Getting paid to code for 40 hours a week will obviously skyrocket the rate at which you learn more. \n\nI also don't want to suggest that this is an easy thing to do - it would take serious dedication and hard work, and a certain level of grit to push through the MANY times you'll encounter things that you don't understand. But it's certainly possible. \n\nAs for learning resources, Google is your friend. But I'll offer a small piece of advice - start out by learning Javascript and HTML. Lots of people will tell you that this isn't the best way, but the fact of the matter is that the web browser is a really powerful and fun programming environment, and HTML/Javascript are the lowest barrier to entry if you want to create interactive and graphical software. [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) is a really highly regarded source for beginner oriented JS content (and it's fun too).",

            "With the hope that this post doesn't get burried, a good rule of thumb in my experience is that it takes around 4000 hours of practice to become an expert in something. There's a reason why we call them 'experts', the title doesn't come cheap.\n\nA few examples:\n\nGaming: Competitive gaming is a very easy measurement, because programs like Steam (or xfire back in the day) would keep track of your hours. Basing myself on personal experience (having wasted my own adolescent years grinding away at FPS games), most expert gamers would have had at least 3000 hours of experience for the talented ones (often more for professionals), with most reaching 4000-8000 hours (see also this link:  [\"CS:GO Pros Answer: How Many Hours Do You Have In CS:GO?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-867UhgNgQ8))\n\nEducation: Similarly, considering that most educations to get a graduate/masters degree require four years of study, taking 4 years \\* 40 weeks \\* 40 hours, you'd get around 6000 hours. Assuming all of those hours are well-spent, which usually isn't the case. With 70% productivity you'd get 4200 hours.\n\nMartial arts: I've seen some people state that martial arts would be an example, where I feel they underestimate the time it takes to become an expert at MA. To become a teacher in martial arts, the third black belt is used as a rule of thumb before one is deemed to be able to teach independently to beginners (hence the name 'sensei', note that it might differ per style), it takes at least 8 years with daily practice and private tutoring to reach the third black belt. Let's say one practices 6 times a week for 1,5 hours each (which approximates my own practice routine). After 8 years he would have around 3750 hours. Speaking for myself, after 7 years I now have my second black belt, with the goal of reaching my third black belt in 2 years time. This while having the luxury of having a very talented martial arts teacher.\n\nTL;DR: You can't. It takes 4000 hours to become an expert (assuming there are no impediments), within one year you can become 'somewhat ok'.",

            "Simultaneous interpretation. This might be the most unusual answer on here, but hear me out.\n\nTo start, learning this skill requires you to know at least two languages *really well*. You got that? Good. \n\nChoose one language you're really really really good at, who am I kidding -- one of the languages is your native language. We will refer to this as your active language. During practice, you will speak your active language. \n\nOne other language will be your passive language. During practice, you will listen to your passive language. \n\nOn youtube or on news websites (or wherever), find a video of someone talking casually in your passive language. Casually is a key word here: do **not** choose a video of someone reading from any kind of script: no news, no stories, no podcasts. Find a video of someone talking freely: in a speech or in an interview or similar.\n\nUse headphones. \n\nNow do the impossible: *translate what they say while they are saying it*. Speak at your computer screen; translating everything said into your active language as closely as possible. Do not pause. Try not to let anything go untranslated; but, knowing that some things will be lost, try to tactically choose what *must* be translated and what isn't a priority. \n\nWelcome to the world of modern-day conference interpreters. \n\n(Side note: Some things (like puns) are genuinely impossible to translate.

When I moved out on my own, his coworker called, offered to help. Showed up with antiques from his late mother as a housewarming gift for my wife and I. The man who's grass I cut? He passed away, and left me his piano, since he knew I liked to play. The friend with the carpet? Hooked me up with a decent paying job right out of college. The internet-illiterate ones?

And the only heat we had was radiator heating but the only radiators were in the living room, but we hardly used it bc we couldn\u2019t afford it, but I did not know that back then, dad just said it broke. So we usually wore layers and used a ton of blankets. Only when it was balls cold would the boiler get used and we usually huddled in the basement right next to it. \n\nSummer sucked even more. Usually the windows are always open most of the year. But when peak of summer came along it was just unbearable. We had one window unit and it had its own special outlet bc again, the house was old as fuck. It was in the living room. We only got to use it a few times a month bc it was \u201cbroken\u201d most of the time. \n\nOur power would randomly be turned off, we were told they were rolling blackouts. Really we could not afford the bill. \n\nWhen dad was not going to have enough gas to the next pay day, something either got pawned or my dad would find any type of side work. Of course didnt know that back then. \n\nIf something broke, it either stayed broke or we fixed it. There was no such thing as hiring anyone. \n\nWe did not have a phone at all until I think I was 7. When we got one, it was on the kitchen wall and we could only take incoming calls because it cost money to make calls. \n\nOur version of a luxury meal was noodles with butter. Yes just bow-tie noodles and butter.\n\nWhen I was almost 10 my dad got another job but it was in North Carolina, he had to live with a co worker for months and would come home on the weekends to come see us. After a while we moved there and life got a little better. The house was not in the city which was a culture shock to us. Nothing was in walking distance.\n\nWe started riding the school bus bc apparently we could there. We didnt have a choice bc dad still needed the car. Grocery day was every Sunday. We went to churches for canned food, and what else from the grocery store if we could afford it.\n\nThere was a river about a mile from our house, I used fishing line on a stick to fish every day. It was great having something other than bread and beans to eat.\n\nWe had a phone, it was on the kitchen wall, we could only make local calls and could answer any incoming. \n\nI started working on a farm right by the house to make money when I was 11. They raised livestock and grew crops. They knew we were poor and would let me take meat home but only if I butchered it myself, and they did limit me to a 20 qt cooler once a week. Could take a bushel of crops home once a week if it was harvest season.\n\nEventually I had enough saved up for a shotgun, dad got it for me and the people I worked with taught me how to hunt deer and how to butcher them. Every season I would get a deer at least 2x and had to drag them back myself. \n\nOnce I turned 15 our life got way better. My dad sold the old house by then and was making decent money too. We got a 2nd car which was insane to us bc we never had 2 cars before. We ate better too. By then I had figured out we grew up poor. I made a friend around then and he lived about a mile down the road and I hung out there a lot. They looked confused when I asked if the blackouts affected them a lot, asking them which churches they went to for food. Then I started noticing things they had that I never knew existed. Like cordless phones, food that wasnt recently butchered, the fridge was always full, tv with cable.\n\nThen when I turned 16, my mom left my dad bc of bullshit. My 2 sisters went with mom, I stayed with dad. Then life started sucking again. But I was working all the time so I had bought my own beater car, I mowed a ton of grass. Usually worked 2 part time jobs during school. Usually 1 full time and 1 part time during summer. Oh and was still working the farm. They showed me how to drive a dump truck, semi, and damn near every piece of equipment out there, and taught me how to weld. \n\nWhen I turned 18 I left for the military and my life completely changed after that. Im 31 now, there isnt shit I cant fix (im actually a mechanic for a living), I can weld anything, I can hunt and fish. And to this very day, I dont pay anyone to fix any of my shit. Sadly im still poor, just not the kind of poor I was growing up. Im part of the working class thats always getting fucked over.\n\nIt taught me a lot in life. I am better from it. But I am doing everything in my power to make sure my son has a better chance than I did. \n\nSorry for wall of text. Its not often I get to tell my life story.",
            "So it was a double sided world. On one hand, I was expected to better myself and to get out of the situation and make better choices than my family. But on the other hand, there was almost a hatred of me and anyone else by the community when me and a couple others succeeded.  A lot of my friends dropped out of school in high school and had one or two children before 20 years old. I don't judge anyone for anything but the writing was on the wall everywhere that if you want to get the hell out of poverty do NOT do a,b and c stupid things. The rate of addiction in that community was high as well and lead a lot of people down some dark paths. Oxycontin was pure evil to my friends and family and I'm glad I made it out of there alive.",

We will likely find some new species, but as to whether they'll be drastically different to what we already know... Well who knows.

Errors in Punnett Squares are incredibly common, and I wouldn't trust anyone who said they could do it off the top of their head. I'd look it up even if I'd done one last week. They REALLY didn't like that answer. They wanted to know where my husband worked and where we lived, and they concluded that our 6-month rental location was completely incompatible with the commute to their location.

It was one of my first real job interviews after school so I was trying to stay positive anyway, but lost it shortly after we started. I gave them a synopsis of my background and how I got into programming by creating video games when I was a kid.   \nTheir response? ....\"we are a bank, we don't make video games here.\" I didn't even know how to respond... like did they think I was actually that stupid? \n\nAnyway, I wasn't expecting to ever hear back, but around 3 months later, got an email for the job offer. Obviously didn't take it, but I'll always be genuinely curious if that was meant for the real Jessica.",

They switched up who went first each time, and one kid completely froze when it was his turn, so we all had to sit there in the most uncomfortable silence.",

Wasted all that gas and lost hours that I could have worked and went out of MY way wasting my precious time going to another town just for them to say oopsie? \n\nThey PLANNED this! I realized working for them would be a huge mistake. They had no respect for me as a person, a potential employee, my time, money, gas. What made me think they would care about me once I'm hired?

            "I was being interviewed for a video editor / post production kind of job in a video production company. This company was owned by a couple. Their son, at the time maybe 18 or 19 conducted the interview. He asked me to write an essay (?!) which I spent a good hour or so working on and then went on to interview me asking a lot of really weird questions totally unrelated to video production or anything to do with the job. I left the place feeling weird and pissed off about the time spent working on the essay and had absolutely no hopes of getting the job. Eventually I went on to work on something else. \n\nA couple of years later this couple was murdered. Both were shot while working in their offices - a brief police investigation found the culprit and the son was arrested and convicted. He's still in jail.

Most people were polite and nervous and I enjoyed sort of putting them at ease. But there was one guy, maybe 18, who had obviously been forced into it by his parents.\n\nHe showed up dressed nicely, but his attitude was horrendous. While waiting, instead of polite small talk, he insulted the company, the position he was applying for, and me. I was shocked and just stopped trying to talk to him. We sat in silence for a few minutes until the manager came out and greeted him. He must have been similarly rude to her, because after he left the interview she came out shaking her head and said he wasn't getting the job.\n\nTwo days later his dad shows up in my office asking why he didn't get hired. That was awkward. In hindsight I think it was actually the father who called to schedule the interview, not the son, because the guy on the phone had been perfectly nice.",

At the time, I was studying magazine journalism, was a Government reporter for the school-run newspaper and had worked at my hometown newspaper as a page layout designer. The interveiwer was obviously OVER interviewing kids and he was very snotty to me. He pointed out my experience and said, \"So you're studying magazines, you write for a newspaper, you do layout... what exactly do you want to DO? This is a lot of very different stuff.\" And I replied that I didn't think it was a bad thing to have a lot of experience in various aspects of journalism. He kind of snorted at that and continued being snotty to me. I figured out pretty quickly that I wasn't getting the internship. At the end, he pointed at a pile of stuff and told me to take my AP-branded lanyard and tin of mints and I said, \"Wow, it's just like Christmas\" in a deadpan voice as I left.",
            "I had an interview where I knew the answers I gave were good, solid examples. I understood the technical side well. But the interviewer kept sneering, being rude and saying \u201creally?\u201d In a skeptical tone and I got the distinct impression he hated me. About 20 mins in, I thought about politely calling it a day and leaving but in my innocence thought it would be good practice to stay. 40 mins in, it\u2019s like a light switch goes off inside and he\u2019s the nicest guy, his eyes light up and he started hard selling the role and position to me. Introduces me to the team. The director interviews me and he and the team are lovely. Apparently, their interview technique is to be rude to see how you perform under pressure and they\u2019d all been observing using a camera and were impressed I remained so polite and calm throughout. They couldn\u2019t understand why I declined.\n\nEDIT: to save me responding to comments. I understand pressure testing is a legitimate technique, and whilst I felt deeply uncomfortable and my gut was screaming at me to get out of there like in a nightclub when you know the creepy guy is really bad news and you need to get out, I understood that it was a possibility that that is what he could have been doing.\n\nHowever to add more context, they had my work history including 10 years in the ambulance services which involves resuscitation whilst the public yell at you and threaten you. I\u2019m used to being polite and professional whilst being harassed and threatened. \n\nNothing spreadsheet based, even pulling all nighters is going to match that for pressure and I\u2019m well known for staying calm and composed all the time (even if I\u2019m exploding inside).\n\nMy biggest objection was not realising I was being broadcast and hearing them discuss my reactions to my face, like I was some kind of movie actor.

            "I was right out of high school, looking for a job to save money for college. I had an interview at a hotel and casino to be a hotel housekeeper. Not a glamorous job by any means, but I was 18 and needed a job so I was actually excited to work here. \n\nI come in for the interview, dressed nice in a skirt and blazer and heels. I'm ushered into a banquet room full of people. Probably 20-25 people are in this room sitting in chairs facing a podium. My immediate reaction is \"fuck, this is an MLM\". I hesitate at the door for a few seconds and then think \"fuck it. May as well see what this actually is\". And thus begins one of the worst and cringiest experiences of my life. \n\nAfter a few minutes, a woman comes to the podium and explains that this is a group interview. What the fuck. They go around the room and ask us basic interview questions. It takes about an hour and a half because there are so many people. I come to find out that this is a group interview for every position at the casino and hotel. Restaurant cooks, hotel front desk, casino dealers etc. Every single position.\n\nAfter the question and answer portion of the group interview, the woman calls a bunch of names and about half of the people go to another room. My name was not called, so I stayed seated. At this point it's been almost 2 hours and I have to pee. Woman comes back and explains that the remaining people have passed on to the second portion of the interview. \n\nThe second portion is with the departments we are interviewing for. I and a few other people go to housekeeping, meet with the manager and are told we need to show them how we work. We literally have to clean hotel rooms for this interview. Keep in mind, we are dressed business casual. I'm wearing heels. I was not prepared to clean fucking hotel rooms, FOR FREE, during an interview. Stupidly, I stayed. I have to get on my hands and knees and clean bathroom floors, make beds, vacuum etc. The room cleaning portion of the interview took maybe 20-30 mins. We are also told we can't use the bathrooms in the room, so I still have to pee. Fuck. This. \n\nOn the the third portion of the interview. We are ushered into a (different) banquet room. At this point there are maybe 12 of us. At the head of the banquet room is a table with 5 or 6 people. We are told they are the president of the casino, and a few other execs. We are told to get in a circle, and get this, DANCE. We are told to dance because you know, this is a FUN working environment. Barf. At my turn, I hobble out into the middle of the circle and do a stupid little dance, obviously pissed because my feet are killing me and I'm about 3 seconds from pissing myself in front of these people. After the dancing, we are told to sell a pen to the president. I must have blacked out by the anger and embarrassment of this experience because for the life of me I can't remember what I actually said to try to sell the pen. \n\nAfter almost 4 HOURS of this interview hell, we are told we can leave. I sprint to the closest bathroom, pee for what feels like 20 minutes, and leave. \n\nBy the time I get home, I have an email saying I didn't get the job.",
            "During the summer after my freshman year of college, I applied for a part-time job at a mall outlet. Despite having zero retail experience, I got through the first round of interviews without any trouble whatsoever, performing well enough that the assistant manager wanted to give me the job on the spot. Since she didn't have the authority to do that, though, I had to meet with her supervisor a couple of days later.\n\n\"It's really just a formality,\" she told me. \"You know, to make sure you're not, like, a serial killer or something.\"\n\nI told her that I'd only ever murdered people in video games.\n\nIt, uh... it wasn't as awkward as I'm making it sound.\n\nAnyway, when the date of my second interview rolled around, I was in high spirits. The manager had me fill out a brief questionnaire, then started asking me some fairly dull questions. Everything seemed to be going smoothly... until a particular enquiry caught me off-guard.\n\n\"What's the most that you've ever stolen?\" the man asked. \"Give me a dollar amount.\"\n\n\"Uh,\" I stammered. \"Is that really a question you can ask?\"\n\n\"I'm just looking for a dollar amount.\"\n\nI racked my brain, trying to think of anything that I might have actually stolen over the course of my life. I'd certainly gotten up to my fair share of mischief, but actual theft had never been part of my repertoire.\n\n\"Zero,\" I finally said. \"I don't think I've ever actually stolen anything.\"\n\nThe manager's plastered-on smile suddenly dropped away. \"I see. Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Really.\" The beginnings of a suspicious glower darkened his eyes. \"Go ahead and answer again. Just give me a dollar amount.\"\n\nWhat had started as a dull interview had become a downright bizarre interrogation. I thought about getting up and leaving... but it occurred to me that the whole thing might have been a test to see if I would change my answer.\n\n\"Zero,\" I said again. \"Zero dollars.\"\n\nThe man sighed and put down his clipboard. \"Come on. Do you actually want this job?\" he asked (mirroring my own thoughts). I nodded in reply. \"Then you need to start being honest with me. Just give me a dollar amount.\"\n\n\"Fine, it was sixteen dollars!\" I finally lied, pouring sarcasm into my words. \"Sixteen dollars and forty-two cents!\"\n\nThe transformation was immediate: All of the disapproval evaporated from the manager's face, being replaced by a warm, visibly amused smile. \"Hey, now, that's not so bad!\" he cheerfully said. \"So, what was it?\"\n\n\"A toaster.\" \n\nI hadn't even bothered to think about what $16.42 might actually purchase; I'd just said the first thing that had popped into my mind. It didn't seem to matter, though: My answer caused the manager's grin to grow even wider, and he spent the rest of interview laughing and joking with me.\n\nThe next day, I got a call, and I was asked if I still wanted the job at the mall.\n\nI told them that I'd already taken a different position elsewhere.\n\nFor the record, that was also a lie.\n\n**TL;DR: I was forced to lie about being a toaster-thief.**",

            "I was fresh out of university and had spent months applying for hundreds of jobs, getting no response more often than not, so when I finally received an invite to an interview I was elated.\n\nIt was further away then I liked but it was in my field and would be decent experience. As I had to take public transport I left with time to spare. Everything went brilliantly until I arrived at the company I was interviewing with:\n\n1. I arrive 15 minutes early, approach the front desk and politely introduce myself and inform the receptionist I have an appointment with 'Miss A.' The receptionist raises her brows at me and tells me this person has no appointments today as she never works in the office on Tuesdays. \\*Cue Panic\\*\n2. I pull out my phone, which thankfully has the email confirmation and I show this to her. She nods, tells me the same thing again. I ask her if she can please call the interviewer. She rolls her eyes but does as I ask. After three rings the interviewer picks up - I suppose. The receptionist nods, hangs up and tells me to: 'Wait over there.\" waving me off in the direction of the entrance.\n3. A little confused I head back to where I came from, as there is no waiting area, seats or benches I stand there quietly. Half an hour pass and still no one has come to collect me. In that same time however a number of other young people like myself, looking out of place, have arrived. \n4. 45 minutes late, a girl who cannot have been much older than myself comes down, calls out 5 names and gestures for those people to follow here. She got my first name wrong, but it was close enough that I did not question it and followed.\n5. The 5 of us follow her sheepishly into a room which has 5 tables and chairs ready and waiting. Each of us is directed to one of the tables and informed we will be completing a number of assessments. We are also directed to present the diploma's/credentials and passports we were asked to bring.\n6. A multiple choice test is laid out in front of us and Miss A leaves us alone. The test, in reality is one of those thinly veiled personality tests which take no more than 10 minutes to complete. Fine. A bit of warning next time maybe, but fine.\n7. About 5 minutes into the test, Miss A swoops in and takes my diploma and passport from my desk and starts to walk away. \"Cue suspicion\" So I call her name and ask her what she thinks she is doing? She informs me all of these will be copied for their administration. I quickly tell her she will do no such thing, and there is no need to do so until after I have been hired. She tells me that if I don't comply I might as well leave. I tell her that if she walks off with my passport and diploma without reason, I will have no option but to suspect her of attempted identity theft. She grumbles some more and puts the items back on my desk. The individuals around me now voice similar concerns and the papers are all swiftly returned.\n8. Miss A leaves us waiting for another 30 minutes. She then returns, takes away the tests results and tells us we will now each have a 10 minute interview. For some reason (\\*Ahum\\*) I am left to last. When I am finally called into the room, I can immediately see the CV she has in front of her is not mine.\n9. She starts by calling me the wrong name, I correct her. She follows by getting the university I studied at wrong, I correct her. I tell her she has the wrong CV, she tries to correct me. This is followed by more statements which are all wrong such as: ' I see here you have done an Internship at ABC' which I counter by: 'No I did an internship at XYZ, you have the wrong CV'  She is however, incorrigable. This continues for what feels like an eternity, when she turns to the personality test. She draws in a sharp breaths and goes: 'Yeaah I don't think you'll be a good match for this company.\" I raise my brows at her and keep quiet, to which she goes: 'Well now you correct me and tell me why you would love to work here!\" I tell her thank you for your time, grab my stuff and get the hell out of there.\n\nEasily the worst interview - ever.",

            "September 11, 2001 @ 10:00am\n\nI had been watching the news early morning and debated whether or not to even go, but it was for a position at a temp agency in Ohio, so I wasn't thinking there would be much of an issue. \n\nAs I was waiting in the building's waiting area, a custodian rolled a TV out to the area and flipped it on. This was a few minutes before 10a, I know that because I watched the South Tower collapse just a few minutes before the recruiter came out and said my name. \n\nHer face was red and puffy from crying; tear tracks, both dried and fresh, lined her cheeks. I immediately offered to leave and reschedule at a better time. She dismissed that and said it was okay...she needed the distraction. \n\nThere was a terminal on the credenza behind her (that's a computer station for you youngins). There were lots of cities listed in the first column, then names in the second, then two columns with either red or green lights. The first column header read \"Connection?\" The second header read \"Status?\".\n\nWe were going through the standard interview stuff, but she would occasionally say, \"excuse me one second,\" roll over to the terminal, and stare at the bottom of the screen for a minute...sometimes sniffle or wipe her eyes...them come back.\n\nAfter the third time, I asked her if everything was okay. She started to apologize, but then said, \"No...honestly it is not.\"\n\nShe was good friends with her counterpart in the NYC office for this same staffing firm. When people from my city would move to NYC (or vice versa), they would talk. Over the years, they built a relationship. She said that first column of lights was indicating if the corresponding terminal was connected to their nationwide network. It was green for NYC, which was fine. She said what worried her was the second light was also green. That only stayed green for ten minutes after the last key press (no mouse on these terminals), and her friend's/coworker's office was in the North Tower...she had been at the terminal within the last 10 minutes. By this time, it was about 20 minutes after ten and the interviewer said,, \"I don't know why she hasn't evacuated! I hope this is a mistake in the system.\n\nThe terminal had a billboard-based messaging system, so the interviewer thought she was maybe accessing that, but no messages had been left. Other people had a few threads going just asking how she was, but no responses. \n\nAt 10:28am, we heard a loud collective gasp come from outside the office; this was followed by sounds of crying and other emotions. The front desk admin assistant knocked on the door jam and said to us, \"The North Tower...it just fell.\" \n\nThe interviewer had apparetnly already spun to the terminal when I was looking at who had knocked and then received the terrible news. When we looked over at her, she was collapsing. I mean...she literally fell onto the credenza sideways and just slid to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nI looked at the terminal screen and the NYC line was kind of blinking every few seconds. Both lights were red. The front desk girl was sitting on the floor with the interviewer, kind of holding her. Honestly, I just took my things and left. I had met her 30 minutes before, we had experienced the real-time affects of this terrorist tragedy together, but I could not help her.\n\nI stopped at a sports bar on the way home and watched the TV coverage until late afternoon.

            "Pre-covid Skype interview for a programming job in the health field.\n\n- Scheduled for 7 PM (which is already ridiculous but they even managed to be 15 minutes late)\n- The guy who interviewed me was a tech guy\n- Spent the first half of the interview telling me how hard and stressful their job is and how they need someone who is basically available 24/7 in case of emergencies and that people should be proud to work with them because their work is super essential, serious, important, etc.\n- Spent most of the second half of the interview asking me increasingly personal questions like \"Do you smoke?\" \"Do you live alone?\" \"Are you single?\" \"Are you married?\" \"Do you have any health issues?\" \"What do your parents do for a living?\" etc. When it gets to \"when and how did your father die?\" I say I don't see how that's relevant and he's like \"oh, just curious.\"\n- Finally I tell him I'm not interested in the job because I don't think it's a good fit and he immediately gets defensive, first asking me \"how do you know if you haven't even tried!\" and then telling me \"you will never get anywhere if you're scared of confrontation\". I just tell him \"well, thanks for the advice\" and refuse the offer.\n\nAnyway, covid hits and they make a test screening app for the local government. Guess what company has been recently involved in a pretty huge security/privacy scandal because anyone could see anyone's covid status just by entering their basic info?\n\n\nEDIT: Since it's the first time one of my comments gets a few upvotes on AskReddit I'm gonna add a few more details that I remembered:\n\n- I didn't apply for this job, the company contacted me on LinkedIn and the first time they called me on the phone to schedule the interview I spoke with a girl who whispered almost inaudibly for the entire call. It literally sounded like someone calling 911 from inside a closet.\n\n- The guy who interviewed me only ever called me by my last name and didn't even try to make eye contact. He spent the entire interview looking at my resume with the snootiest look on his face.\n\n- I'm a native Android developer with some iOS experience and they made it sound like that was what they were looking for, but it turns out they build all their apps using a *proprietary* cross-platform framework (YIKES!).\n\n- During the interview I tell him I'm a pretty creative person who really enjoys working on the UI/UX side of things and his reply boiled down to \"we don't do that shit here\".\n\n- When he asks to see a project I worked on I direct him to the Play Store and show him the last published app I developed at my previous job (for a huge retail client, by the way) and at first he tries to insinuate I didn't actually work on it, then claims it's nothing special because it's nothing like what **they** do (no shit Sherlock and thank fucking god)\n\n- Despite his ridiculously confrontational and demeaning tone and my clear refusal, he actually asks me \"so you're *not* interested?\" like another 3 or 4 times before ending the interview.\n\n- A couple weeks after the interview, the same company contacts me on LinkedIn again with the same exact message as the first time like they forgot I had already interviewed and refused their offer.\n\n- I have a much more experienced and qualified friend who also interviewed there before I did, he met the same guy and had the exact same interview experience. I initially assumed the interviewer was acting like that cause I'm a junior developer, but it turns out he's simply a socially inept asshole whose job should probably be anything other than doing interviews/interacting with other human beings.\n\n- I also have another friend who actually works there. He was basically their first hire and they treat him a bit more respectfully than most other employees, often going to him to ask for advice that they don't listen to. Most common question they ask him apparently is \"why can't we get anyone to work for us?\". After the covid app scandal a couple months ago, he said the company basically plunged into chaos and hasn't yet recovered (probably never will).\n\nHonestly, I'm just glad it wasn't my first interview experience, cause I probably would've been traumatized for the rest of my life. I feel bad for anyone who has been in that position and/or couldn't afford to refuse the job.\n\n\nEDIT 2: I went back to read on the covid app scandal and it's actually a lot worse than I remembered since they didn't just accidentally give everyone access to their users' covid status, but to their *entire medical records* stored on their servers. Considering that this company developed a lot of the IT infrastructure for public health in my area, I'm sure there's no need to explain how huge of a fucking mess they got themselves into.",

We're just having a hard time finding the right person.\"\n\n*Nope, pretty sure it's you that is the issue here.*\n\nI thanked her for her time and asked to withdraw my name from consideration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHad an interview with a fairly large company for an entry-level graphic design position. They started it off in an extremely tiny room. Like a broom closet with a desk and I had to take a test, basic math, science, and English. \n\nIt was in a little packet like a standardized test you'd do in school. The interviewer made me break the seal in front of him and then he initialed and dated each page. He said \"Sorry, they make us do this so there's no cheating.\" I asked if that was an issue previously, he said that people would try and get their friends hired and slip them the test in advance. Then went on to say how it's mostly college kids in these lower positions and it's basically a revolving door so they want to make sure that the people they hire are qualified. \n\nHe got about halfway through the booklet and I told him \"You know what, I'm sorry, but I already don't feel this job isn't going to be for me.\" and started to get up. He got snarky \"How would you know? You haven't even interviewed. But with that attitude, I'm going to ask you to leave.\" I couldn't help but laugh a little. \n\nBitch, you cant hire me! I quit!",
            "I was just out of high school, interviewing to drive an auto parts store truck around from shop to shop. Interview went well. \n\nAs I backed out of parking lot, I rolled over a curb and into a sign. No one saw. When I put my car into first gear, I had to gun it to get it back over the curb. EVERYONE heard that part of it. \n\nDidn\u2019t get the job.\n\nEdit: word",
            "I applied for a full time job as an assistant brewer and had just graduated from a brewing diploma program. \n\nWe had two phone interviews, both about 30 minutes long. \n\nThen I drove 90 minutes from home to attend an in-person interview. I got a tour of the new brewery which was waiting for their brewery license. They show me all this janky but brand-new equipment and I'm thinking \"I could do this long enough to find another job\". We interviewed for about 30 minutes after the tour. Then the owners dropped a bomb on me. \n\n\"We know you applied for a full-time job but we were thinking we might hire two part-time assistant brewers. If we do that route we would hire two people to work 20 hours per week and would probably promote one of the two after 6 months to a full-time position. Would you be interested in the job if we went that route?\"\n\nMy exact words were \"Absolutely not. I'd have to move to work this job and I need 40 hours to pay for rent and student loans. I'm not moving to work part-time here and part-time at McDonalds.\"\n\nThey didn't call me with an offer. They closed 12-18 months later.",
            "I drove 3 hours for a job interview in a city I planned to move to. The girl looked at me, made me wait in the lobby, took me on a quick tour of the facility, brought me back to an office and asked me if I had any questions then proceeded to not answer any of my questions and walked me to the front door. I drove 3 fucking hours.",
            "I was interviewing with some guy that looked like David Bowie.\n\nThey liked me, so they \"brought me upstairs\" to sit down with someone else.\n\nNow it's 2 on 1.\n\nThe head honcho tells me about how much work it is. Lots of hours. Overtime expected, etc.\n\nHe saw my hesitation at that point and asked me point blank how I felt.\n\nSo I told him \"I just moved to the area with my family.  I value a work/life balance over anything else.\"\n\nThe next 60 minutes was spent as the two guys tried to browbeat me into \"oh. Don't you want to make money to provide stability for your family?\" Etc. Etc.\n\nIt got bad. I thought it could be a conversation about my values and how I can fit into the company. Instead they just  kept on trying to appease some bullshit macho image of being a provider.  The guy even said \"Don't you think I want to see my family more? But I come to work every day and put in these long hours knowing that I'm providing for them in the most important way that matters.\"\n\n\nSo I just \"yea. Uh huh. Ok.\" Them to death until finally they asked me point blank \"so are you interested?\"\n\nMy reply was \"No sir.  If you didn't value my priorities enough to at least pretend like you cared.  I have no interest in working for you.\" \n\nAt which point they politely (but very tersely) walked me back downstairs and pointed me to the door."

My friends were all in the same age group, so newly 21 year olds drinking their fill, you can imagine what happens later: the bathrooms start filling up with a bunch of new drinkers blowing chunks. \n\nMy cousin and her SO happen to be at this party, she\u2019s about ready to throw up. Her boyfriend is already taking care of her brother, who had just thrown up, I should mention that the boyfriend is also drunk as fuck. He has a bowl in one hand, half full of the brothers vomit, and nothing in the other hand, my cousin is heaving and all the bathrooms are locked (trash cans and sink are free but we were upstairs, no way are these three making it down there).  So boyfriend looks at his hand in a drunken daze, then to the hand with the large bowl in it, then to his heaving SO who\u2019s ready to throw up. I look at him, and I can practically see his brain trying to tell him what to do....no good, his motor skills are fucked, so in attempt to help my cousin, his SO, he hurriedly moves his empty hand to below her mouth, and catches all of her vomit in his empty palm. \n\nI watch in horror as it spills onto the white rug of our friends house. The boyfriend, as vomit flows through his empty hand, stares at his other hand with the bowl in it, and mouths a silent \u201cfuck\u201d as he realizes slowly that his body did not perform the way he wanted it to.

As I walked, I took my car key between my fingers, and my brain told my hand, \"Okay hand, the next thing you're going to do is insert that key into the ignition to start the car.\" And my hand was like, \"Okay, word. I got this.\" Then as I sat down in the car, my brain said to me, \"[Panhead09], you should probably take your phone out of your pocket and charge it before starting the car. The battery is getting low.\" And I said, \"That's a good idea brain. You should pass that along to my hand.\" And my brain said, \"I think I'll do just that.\" So my brain relayed this message, which had to pass through my arm. And as the message was about at my elbow, my arm said, \"Charging the phone? Got it. I'll get this process going.\" And so my arm started moving to get my phone out of my pocket.\n\nBut here's the thing. My arm started moving before the new message made it to my hand. So while my arm was all excited, going \"Oh yea that phone is gonna get so charged...\" my hand was still in its own little world, thinking, \"Insert the key and turn on the engine...Insert the key and turn on the engine...\"\n\nAnyway that's how I ended up stabbing myself in the leg with my car key.",

Their choice was a U.S. Marine General named Smedley Butler, as he was a decorated leader of the highest rank. Butler, a loyal patriot, played along until they were seriously about to attempt to collapse the U.S. economy by holding the financial stability of the country hostage. He rolled on them and testified to Congress about the planned coup. No one was prosecuted.

            "The CIA was working on a heart attack gun back in the 1960-70's. It started off as a conspiracy theory but gained enough momentum nationwide that it forced the US Government's's hand and they finally admitted the theory was \"mostly accurate\".\n\nShort version, they never had a fully functional heart attack gun, but they did have a \"nearly working prototype\". The idea was that it would have a very small projectile that would be laced with a chemical that would induce a heart attack and leave a hole smaller than one left behind by a syringe. While they never had a fully working version, they did have a prototype but abandoned the project once they more or less had to admit the conspiracy was mostly true.\n\nI find this to be among the creepiest/scariest things declassified by the government simply because of the consequences of them admitting to having been working on such a weapon. For one, it shows that the US government was very serious, at least at one point in time, about being able to take someone out with it being easily traced back to them. Whether they would have used this on private US citizens or on foreign agents is debatable, but they easily COULD have used it to silence people who were pushing to further advance Civil Rights or people who generally spoke out against the government in general. Its also scary because it makes you stop and think how many conspiracy theories are correct or at least scarily close to being correct.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a conspiracy theorist. I do find them interesting and tend to read up about them but have never bought into very many of them. I mostly just find them interesting.",

Jim Jones started a cult called the Peoples Temple (yes, without the apostrophe) and eventually they moved to a new settlement they built in Guyana called Jonestown, named after their leader. Since he made them believe he was some form of the messiah (as a lot of cult leaders did), he could control them all to do whatever he pleases, and one of the things they did was practice drinking Flavor-Aid - not Kool-Aid as commonly believed - to prepare themselves for the time when they commit \u201crevolutionary suicide\u201d. These practices were just normal Flavor-Aid / Kool-Aid, but Jones told them it was poisoned just to see their reactions. When the time came, someone recorded what was, essentially, the sounds of people drinking Flavor-Aid laced with cyanide, alongside a fatal cocktail of other substances, many victims including young children (which you could hear screaming in the audio). 900 or so people died, only a few didn\u2019t. This was the biggest loss of American life in a deliberate act until 9/11, and there is an audio recording of it. And just a VERY strong reminder: This wasn\u2019t mass suicide, this was mass murder. Many people were willing to die at his hands, but all the children and some of the adults didn\u2019t. Since all of them were forced to take the drink, it wasn\u2019t their own choice to drink it, it was Jones\u2019s. So, whilst people believe that it was a suicide, they were all duped into being murdered by Jim Jones.\n\nEdit: Fixed the \u201clargest loss of American life\u201d fact to add \u201cin a deliberate act\u201d,  and talked a bit more about how it was mass murder, not mass suicide.",

His experiments were designed to first \"depattern\" individuals, erasing their minds and memories\u2014reducing them to the mental level of an infant\u2014and then to \"rebuild\" their personality in a manner of his choosing. To achieve this, Cameron placed patients under his \"care\" into drug-induced comas for up to 88 days, and applied numerous high voltage electric shocks to them over the course of weeks or months, often administering up to 360 shocks per person. He would then perform what he called \"psychic driving\" experiments on the subjects, where he would repetitively play recorded statements, such as \"You are a good wife and mother and people enjoy your company\", through speakers he had implanted into blacked-out football helmets that he bound to the heads of the test subjects (for sensory deprivation purposes). The patients could do nothing but listen to these messages, played for 16\u201320 hours a day, for weeks at a time. In one case, Cameron forced a person to listen to a message non-stop for 101 days. Using CIA funding, Cameron converted the horse stables behind Allan Memorial into an elaborate isolation and sensory deprivation chamber where he kept patients locked in for weeks at a time. Cameron also induced insulin comas in his subjects by giving them large injections of insulin, twice a day, for up to two months at a time. **Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.**",

( He agrees that my mom was abusive and feels she was way worse than his dad; I think his dad was worse)\n\nAdmittedly my family and neighborhood set the bar low on good parenting. Most of my uncles and both of my grandmas were physically abusive, I have cousins that were raped by their own brothers and made to repent as young children for their hand in their own sexual assault (Great job Mormons). And other cousins who weren\u2019t allowed to finish high school. We took in a lot of cousins. My parents also made it very clear who in the family wasn\u2019t safe, wasn\u2019t to be trusted or listened to, and which uncles could use a solid kick to the dick before I ever give them a hug.\n\nMy neighborhood has gangs and drive by shootings and drug dealers and girls selling themselves in junior high. My mom parented by fear the whole neighborhood equally. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the leader of the mafia, my mom will scream in your face, try her. Nobody shot a gun at our house during drive bys and no one gave her babies drugs (I literally believed marijuana was BBQ because my whole neighborhood successfully lied to me, but that\u2019s another story)... I\u2019m 1000% positive the whole neighborhood didn\u2019t want to be on her bad side, but I think they all wanted to be on her good side too. We\u2019ve got neighbors that randomly show up to chat with her, instead of going to their drug dealer next door and buying drugs. She\u2019ll be an ear and keep them strong and clean.\n\nSo when I say she wasn\u2019t perfect you all know what I mean, but when I say she did a lot of good I hope you know what I mean too.",
            "My aunt was unpleasant or weird with everyone but always particularly cold to me. One day when I was about 14 she took me aside and said she'd held a grudge against me because of my name - she had wanted to call her first daughter that name but my parents had had a child first and used it (they had no idea she wanted the name and aren't the kind of people who would have done it on purpose). She said she'd tried really hard and had just about forgiven me for it.\n\nI just remember being baffled by it and then feeling sorry for her for being that spiteful, to be honest, but it palled later in comparison with all the other crazy horrible things she did to her own family",

            "When I was young my mum was best friends with one of the neighbours down the street, who also had a boy the same age as me.  As a result I played a lot with said boy and was encouraged to be best friends with him.  Whenever my mum wasn't around though, his mum was a complete bitch to me.  She would come out to where we were playing together and shout at me for some minor trivial thing.  If we were both doing something bad (only minorly bad, we were not bad kids) she would blame it all on me and never reprimand her son at all.\n\nThis was all when I was like 7-10 years old and so I couldn't process it at all and had no idea how to react and it really got to me.  I found out years later she was basically jealous because I was doing much better at school than her son and she wanted to 'take me down a peg'.  Ultimately the son and I ended up going to different secondary schools and drifted apart, which meant that fortunately I stopped having to interact with her.\n\nOur mums are still good friends and she has always been pleasant to me as an adult (she even did the flowers at my wedding), but even 30 years later I still keep her at arms length because of how unfairly she treated me as a child.",

Unfortunately at the district level, there was a stick in the mud who believed that he wasn't doing his job unless he rejected every proposal at least once. He rejected mine after an hour and a half of arguing, for not including \"ladder safety measures\". So I printed out a 150 page manual on ladders and put that in front of him. Unfortunately it was not the same guy so I didn't get to see his face. I told the other guy what happened when he asked why the proposal was so massive.  He thought it was hilarious.\n\nEdit: I had three levels of clearance. Scout master, board of review and then district. This happened at the district level to be clear.

He would say \"hey, consolidate x files for me\" and then just walk away. And consolidating x files consisted of finding one of thousands of file paths on the server, finding another one in thousands in that file path, and then searching for a very specific type of legal document within those thousands of files. And then make me schedule a meeting to ask questions like \"where are those?\" or \"what makes x x compared to the y documents\" that take all of 2 seconds to answer.

I caught him smoking a black-n-mild and eating a burger on top of the parking garage during one of his \"client meetings\" once.\n\nHe would give me nothing to do most of the time and rip on me for not doing anything. I would literally go around the cubicles asking for something to help with, do all of my co-workers grunt work, and then have 4 hours between getting that done and my meeting with him to ask questions. And he'd come rip on me for not doing anything/ not \"trying\" (it would've taken days or weeks for me to go through every single file path instead of him just telling me) during those 4 hours. And he'd rip on me for leaving at 5pm after 5 hours of nothing to do. Sometimes he'd sit at his desk till 7, just chilling on his iPhone, and I'd have to sit there staring at a blank screen because he'd stare at me if I took my phone out.\n\nDuring our 360 review process, my coworkers gave me an average score of 3.0 on a 0-4 scale. He gave me an average of 0.75.\n\nI was the leader of my team of interns for a charity drive. The other interns on my charity drive team were all on separate teams within the office, but we were paired together to be even with some of the larger teams in the office that had more interns. We were in 2nd place out of 10 and had by far the smallest amount of highly compensated employees in our \"zone\" of the office which makes a substantial difference. I thought I was doing a really good job. The team beating us had the highest amount of highly compensated employees in the office and were thousands of dollars ahead on the last day so I figured \"hey, whatever, we had a good run.\" Nope. I come in on the last day of the charity drive and this asshole has a janitor cart loaded with trays of breakfast tacos. I try to plead with him that this won't make the difference. I'll even pay him back for the tacos not to do this. Nope.  He makes me go office-to-office, team-to-team selling tacos. My first interaction with 99% of the people I sold tacos to. People laughing at me and shit. I've been a dishwasher. I've been a busboy. I was a Jimmy Johns driver. I was a pledge and got the shit hazed out of me. I have never, ever felt so fucking degraded in my life. Probably would've quit if that wasn't a week or two from the end of the internship.\n\nOn my last day I had conversations with everyone. Most of my coworkers said something along the lines of \"we'll miss you, sorry your boss was a dick.\" And my boss basically ripped me apart. Told me that I should change majors and that this wasn't right for me. Said a ton of really hurtful shit with little to no constructive aspects. At the end of it all he says something along the lines of \"well we'll miss you and I hope you learned a lot.\" And I had enough. To preface this, I got the job through connections and my dad worked for the company, and was very close with the head of our entire division. I'm not normally one to play this card. 99% of the time the \"do you know who my dad is\" card is incredibly cheap, beta, cringy, and usually unwarranted. I believe it was warranted here. Nobody at the internship knew who my dad was and that was by design, I wanted to be treated without bias to know who I could trust and where I stood. I responded, with tears in my eyes, \"Yeah I had a great time I can't wait to tell my dad about it.\" \"Whose your dad?\" \"Oh he did x really important thing for the company for a while but he's retired now. He's really good friends with your boss's boss's boss's boss.\" Dude goes white in the face and says \"oh I almost forgot your present.\" He goes and gets an extra company water bottle from his desk that he definitely just had sitting there. 180 change in his demeanor. He wants to be my best fucking friend now. All of the sudden it's all smiles and chit-chat and \"well if you ever come back you'll always have a place to stay.\" Fuck you.\n\nHe died in a car accident 5 days later and I couldn't really say anything to the company about how much of an absolute dick and lazy employee he was due to the optics, which really frustrated me.",

            "The McStay family disappearance and murders. In February of 2010, the McStay\u2019s, a family of 4 (Mom Summer, Dad Joseph, and sons Gianni and Joseph jr) seemingly vanished from their home- abruptly. A carton of eggs was left open on the counter and the family dogs were still outside in the backyard. The scene was eerie, and complicated because the home the McStays lived in was in the process of being renovated- so a \u201cneat and orderly\u201d home wasn\u2019t the norm at this stage. It appeared there was missing furniture and the usual mess that comes with construction (some freshly painted or redone surfaces mixed with older versions).\nFrom the outside- it appeared the family just took off. Neighbor had surveillance that captured what appeared to be the bottom of the family SUV leaving the driveway. Since they were living in California, the boarder to Mexico wasn\u2019t far and authorities found footage of what appeared to be the McStay\u2019s walking into Mexico with their two little boys in tow. The family SUV was found abandoned in a mall parking lot near the Mexico boarder. \n3 years passed before the bodies of the McStay\u2019s were found buried in shallow graves in the California desert. The bodies appeared to be in advanced decomposition and there were signs of blunt force trauma. A sledgehammer was also found buried with one of the bodies. \nChase Merritt, a business partner to Joseph McStay, was arrested and charged with their murders on 11/5/2014. His trial was delayed for years until 2019. He was sentenced to death. Motive- Chase had a gambling addiction and had been and continued embezzling money from the business. His DNA was found in the McStay\u2019s abandoned vehicle. He bludgeoned this beautiful family to death for money.\n\nETA link with more info - https://people.com/crime/mcstay-family-murders-killer-sentenced-death/",

            "There once was an urban legend/conspiracy theory about a video game called \"Polybius\". The story goes as such: a mysterious arcade cabinet appeared in Portland Oregon in 1981 with never-before-seen gameplay. It was captivating to the point of addicting, but that's not all. Many who played the game fell sick or went mad. Some versions of the myth detail that it caused hallucinations and nightmares or drove players to suicide. Every version of the urban legend mentioned mysterious \"men in black\" who would check on the game every now and then, leading some to believe this was some kind of government psyop to make people go insane.\n\nSeveral times over the years, it was proven to have not existed, usually by pointing to lack of contemporary media coverage and/or an FOIA request that found no records of such a video game, but this left people unsatisfied. If it truly WERE a psyop, of course these channels would come up blank. It wasn't until a retro gaming youtuber and journalist called AHOY (who is a god-tier youtuber btw) made a video detailing his investigations. He not only proved it to be false, he found the exact person, place, time, and purpose for which the rumor was created.\n\nCheck the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7X6Yeydgyg\n\nHonestly one of my favorite watches on yt and possibly my favorite \"documentary\" ever made.

For years conspiracy theories and talk of Alien abduction by wackos circulated.  \n\nTill 1998, when mountain climbers on a remote mountain found an engine, pieces of metal, and clothing at the bottom of a glacier on the side of Mount Tupungato.

Being in the jet stream reduced their airspeed in relation to the earth and they smacked themselves straight into the side of a mountain, after which an avalanche covered the wreckage. The wreckage took decades to flow down the side of the mount with the glaciers.  The glacier preserved the wreck so well that 50 years later the recovery team found identifiable remains, personal items, and could read serial numbers on the engines.

But Kelvin, the number one superstar of physics at the time, had used thermodynamics to calculate the age of the Earth based on the temperature of its insides, and he said it was quite a bit younger. This was a mystery for many years, and was considered one of the major flaws of then-current evolution theory.\n\nIt was not until the early 1900s they found the answer: Radioactivity!

            "The Andreen McDonald case. She and her husband Andre (yes, Andreen and Andre) originally were from Jamaica. They moved up to my town in Texas where Andre was air force and Andreen was a body building business owner. Andre was pretty jealous that Andreen was more successful and was constantly begging/demanding that she make him co-owner of her company. She always said no. \n\nOne day he had had it, and \"did away with her\". The gym that she frequented, every single morning, got concerned when she stopped showing up. She was very close with the ladies that she worked out with, and even gave them a key to her house. She told them that if she ever went missing, that her husband probably did it, and they knew he had an attitude. \n\nSo one day while Andre was out, the ladies went to check on Andreen. Her car was there, her wallet was there, but she wasn't. They found blood and hair in her bathroom. \n\nThat's when cops were called. \n\nCops showed up when Andre was home and asked about Andreen. He said she was in the hospital. They asked him, \"if she's in the hospital, how come her wallets here?\" He responded simply, \"talk to my lawyer\" \n\nThey got a warrant and were able to search the house further. Saw *more* leftover evidence in the bathroom, and evidence of clothes had been found burned in the fire pit in the backyard. \n\nBut no body. \n\nSo all they could do was charge him with a missing persons deal. \n\nAndre was super snarky about it too. How he'd be proven innocent. How the cops would never catch on. \n\nLittle did he realize how loved Andreen was. And how much Texas ranchers hate corrupt and snarky murderers. Crowds gathered daily and were given permission to sweep over rancher's land for any sign of Andreen's body. \n\nJust as crowds started feeling defeated, and Andre started to see hope of being release, a rancher was scoping his field. He had heard coyotes out and went to see what could have entised them. Sure enough, he found human bones, later identified as Andreen. \n\nSo yeah, proper charges were able to be filed.\n\n**Add on:**\n\nSo some ask why she stayed or why he felt jealous that she was more successful. Remember they're from Jamaica. The whole point of coming here was to better themselves, and bring pride to their families. So she was doing great, but because she was doing so good, his family was kind of looking down on him because his wife was better/more successful than him. \n\nAnd then she stayed with him, mainly because she wanted to try and make sure their daughters life could be as normal as possible.

There were no Google results at all for either Geedis or The Land of Ta. With multiple people researching that was where the mystery was left off and people kind of forgot about it.\n\nBut a couple years later it was solved. A podcast was made where they investigated the mystery, got a hold of the former art director of Dennison back in the 80s who referred them to a few potential artists and they found the daughter of one of the artists who had passed away and in her father's stuff was the original pencil drawings of the creaturs of The Land of Ta. It was never anything but those stickers. This internet mystery still appeared on lists for awhile as unsolved.\n\nThe only mystery left is who made the enamel pins, which is still a mystery but not quite as big as \"who is this character and this land that seems familiar but that there's no record of?\"",
            "I have one that most people seem to not know about. Grand Duchess Anastasia was in fact killed with the rest of her family in 1918. She never escaped and the several women throughout the 20th century claiming to be her lied.\n\nThe site of the execution of the Tsar and his family was completely untouched until 1991. Excavation found only 9 of the 11 expected remains. It wasn't until 2007 that two further sets of remains were found a small distance away from the previous grave site. DNA testing found that one of the sets of remains belonged to Tsarevich Alexei and the other to one of his sisters. With this find, it proved conclusively that the entire Imperial family was in fact executed and buried in 1918.",
            "This is a personal family mystery that got solved a few years ago, so nothing exciting that would have gotten media attention, haha. But my maternal great-grandmother once ran away from home to the big city, and came back pregnant. She refused to disclose anything about the father. Either way, even down to my generation, we have had unusually shaped feet. Rather flat, with a strange angle, and it has made most regular shoes uncomfortable. It's not so bad for me, I take physically more after my paternal side of the family, but my brother and mother have it really bad. So does my cousin, who ended up seeking the help of a physical therapist. The therapist said that her feet are truly unusually shaped, and referred her to a specialist doctor who's an expert on feet. (Apparently that's a thing!) The doctor examined her feet and said that the only place in the world with distinct feet like that is a certain county in France, with winemakers who have been stomping on grapes for centuries. He said that he is 99% certain that the feet come from there, that we must have close family lineage from there. My cousin told our family, and we were very confused. We most certainly don't have French relatives! Until we realized... *GREAT-GRANDMA.* The city she ran away to was known to house traveling craftsmen from all over the world. She must have hooked up with a French winemaker. We joked that now she rolled over in her grave, because this strange feet doctor discovered her secret!",
            "The Golden State killer/ East area rapist - Joseph James DeAngelo\n\nA former police officer (who was sacked for burglary) and mechanic. \nAmerican serial rapist, murderer, burglar. \nCommited AT LEAST 13 murders, 50 rapes and over a 100 burglaries between 1973-1986\n\nI was listening to the 6? Part podcast called casefile and they hadn\u2019t yet caught the suspect. \nBut a year or so ago they finally got him after collecting DNA evidence when he put a tissue in the bin outside. \nIt was a confirmed match.\n\n**Edited to add as I just did a brief summery. Although it\u2019s been covered in the comments by me and a few others I\u2019ll add here for clarification. \n\nHe was caught a few days over 3 years ago. \n(Time flies) \n\nHe was only a cop for a short time before getting sacked, he was found shoplifting at store for supplies, like a hammer,dog repellent, at that time and not robbing a house. \n\nHe left semen as evidence. Because he wasn\u2019t uploaded into the data base or caught before hand there was no DNA match in the system. \nThe way they got onto him as a suspect BEFORE gathering hard evidence of the tissue, was a familiar match uploaded onto GENMATCH by what was a 3-4th cousin of his. The officers in charge of case then went through 1000 DNA profiles from his tree to finally narrow it down to him. \nThey then swooped in to gather the tissue to get 100% clarity before the arrest. \nHe was living with his daughter and 15 year old granddaughter at the time of his arrest and was acting perfectly healthy and very fit for his age. \nWhen presenting to court he was in a wheelchair and pretending to be senile. Such a act. \n\nHe is also described by all his victims as having a very small penis. Unusually small. \nAt crime scenes he would pretend to talk to some one else. Go to the kitchen and make himself food or drink. Leave beer bottles at the site and go back to raping. \nHe would break in and prepare the home before coming back a few days later to rape. By doing this he would leave little objects (like guns or rope cut at certain lengths) and steal items,  by then he would know the layout of the house.\nHe would shine a torch in people\u2019s eyes to blind them. \nHe\u2019d often cry apologising to his mummy or saying he wants his mummy. Other times he was cussing a woman named \u201cBonny\u201d\n\nBefore breaking in and raping he would stalk and call the phone line several times.\nHe would then call the victims after the rape and breathe heavily into the phone and or whisper. There is audio of one of these calls. It\u2019s quite disturbing. \nHe also went back to rape a victim. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, listen to the podcast Casefile True Crime, you can find this on Spotify. \n\nI highly recommend it. The narrator is a Aussie who does and incredible job and his voice is lovely and very easy to listen to. \nHe gets right into the story and doesn\u2019t mess about.  \nLook for the episode number 53 it\u2019s a 5 part case with a following 2 bonus interviews. And a update before casefile episode 83.\n\nIt\u2019s also been mentioned the HBO series \u201cI\u2019ll be gone in the dark\u201d is a must watch and about Joseph. \n\nAnd a book titled \u201cI\u2019ll be gone in the dark\u201d by Michelle McNamara\n\n[the phone call I\u2019m talking about is at 2 minute mark](https://youtu.be/z6QSNLi-OPI)",

            "In 1981, a Soviet submarine ran aground in Swedish waters. This was a huge deal - although the Soviets claimed the sub was in distress and didn\u2019t purposefully enter Swedish waters, basically everyone in Sweden saw it as evidence that their waters were being invaded by spy subs. Plus, they did some snooping of their own and determined that the sub was emitting radiation, meaning it had nukes on board. So they went along with the Soviets\u2019 clearly false claim about an accident and helped get the sub out of there, but panic was in the air. \n\nSo the Swedes did exactly what you\u2019d expect, and they prepared for more Soviet subs. I mean, when you see one Soviet sub, surely there are more, right? So Sweden developed advanced acoustic technology to detect subs and they created a plan to basically seal off their waters when they heard a sub. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, a year later, they found a Soviet sub! Well, they didn\u2019t *find* it, but they absolutely heard it. And they cut off the bay and figured they just had to hunt the sub down. But after a month, they couldn\u2019t find it. They gave up and reopened the bay, but they assumed the sub found a way out. But they\u2019ll get it next time! And then it happened again, but they couldn\u2019t find it again. And then again and again with no clear pattern for a decade. What the heck!\n\nThankfully, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed. So... no more subs, right? Nyet! Because the Russian subs were still coming! Wait, what?\n\nOkay, so now nothing is making sense. At this point, the Swedish military brought in outside experts to figure out what was happening. This included oceanographer-types who were obvious experts in the surrounding waters. The military then played the audio evidence of the Soviet submarines, only to be told they weren\u2019t submarines at all - they were *fish*, and the propeller-like sound was water being released from their swim bladders. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the story of how the Swedish military spent ten years and tens of millions of dollars chasing fish farts.",

            "Fast Radio Bursts, or FRBs. First discovered in 2007, its a radio pulse a few milliseconds long typically coming from extra galactic sources. In April of 2020 the CHIME radio telescope found the first one recorded in the milky-way. The source was a magnatar; a highly magnetic remnant of a large dead star. Magnatars are a special kind of neutron star because they have such an intensely strong magnetic field. If a magnatar was a moons distance away it would be able to rip your car keys out of your pocket. \n\nWhat causes these FRBs is a magnatar quake. Magnatars are so dense that the surface is under a lot of strain to collapse in toward the core but the physical density of the neutron star is holding it back. A very slight shift in the crust of the magnatar releases a huge burst of x-rays/gamma-rays along with radio waves. And that is the Fast Radio Bursts we see.",

            "I've been waiting for this question. Buckle up, this is a long one.\n\nOn September 15th 2010, Greg Fleniken checked into a hotel to start his work week in Beaumont, Texas. His job was securing leases of mineral rights and land for mining. Greg rarely left his hotel room. There was a bar downstairs but he wasn't a big drinker, he just preferred to spend his nights in.\n\nThe following morning, his wife didn't get a call from her husband, which was strange. He *always* called her every morning when he was on a work trip, that was their routine. She tried calling, but he never picked up. She then tried calling his office in Beaumont Texas, and after a few rings, his co-workers answered the phone and told her that Greg never showed up for work. \n\nShe asked them to go check up on him in his hotel room, and so they did. They drove to his hotel and made their way to his room, and they found him dead on his floor. The room was exceptionally warm, and they found him face down, still holding a cigarette. When they took his body to an autopsy, they found no obvious trauma on the outside. Just a bruise where his face had hit the floor, and a small abrasion on his crotch.\n\nHowever, the inside of his body was a completely different story. They found that his ribs were broken, the inside of his body was filled with blood, parts of his intestines had been lacerated and food was spilled out, and there was a hole in his heart.\n\nThe medical examiner shared this information with the detective on the case, and said that his internal injuries were more in line with someone who had been in a car crash. The medical examiner believed that someone had beaten him to death, which made no sense, because there were absolutely no bruises anywhere near the injures, but this definitely was not natural causes.\n\nThe detective (detective Apple) took this information and started to do some digging to find out if there was someone that wanted him dead. He found that Greg was actually universally liked. He had no enemies, got along with his co-workers, he loved his wife and his wife loved him back, and he overall was just a quiet guy that kept to himself. He was just a nice normal guy. \n\nAfter months, Apple couldn't find any leads. The only thing that was odd was that the room was particularly warm when they found him. His wife claimed this was out of the ordinary because Greg *always* slept with the AC on. He couldn't fall asleep unless his room was cold. But that still didn't explain what happened to his insides. But then he made a discovery.\n\nHe looked through the maintenance logs on the night Greg had died, and found that Greg had blown a fuse while making popcorn in his room. He had actually affected all the rooms around him. So Greg went down to the front desk, and the hotel sent a maintenance guy to fix the breaker. One possibility was that the maintenance guy, who had a criminal record, had attacked him. This didn't make any sense at all though, because he wouldn't have had a motive, and there was no evidence to suggest that he did it.\n\nApple started asking around to all the rooms affected, and they said they had no interaction with Greg at all. After detective Apple couldn't find any leads, the case went completely cold and unsolved.\n\n7 months after Greg had died, Greg's wife decided to hire a prominent private investigator named Ken Brennan, who specialized in cold cases. She told Brennan about the case, and he gladly accepted it. Brennan flew out to speak with Greg's wife to get as much information about their marriage as he could. After he had found nothing, he asked her if there was anything that stood out about the crime scene. She once again said that Greg only ever slept when the room was very cold, and it was strange that the room was warm when they found him. \n\nBrennan then got in contact with Detective Apple, and they agreed to work on the case together. Apple hands over all the photos of the crime scene and the autopsy report, and Brennan spent the night looking it over. The very next morning, Brennan came to let Apple know that he had solved the case. Apple is obviously confused at how Brennan could have solved it in a day, but they go to the hotel room and Brennan begins to explain.\n\nIt is likely that Greg had turned on the AC the night he died, but when the power went out and then turned back on, it had not turned on the AC. The room would have still been cold from being air conditioned all evening, so Greg wouldnt have known that it was not working. They are in Texas, so the room would have gotten warm pretty quickly, and so Greg would have gotten up and turned the AC back on if he was still alive. So now they know that he died after 8:30 (when the power came back on) but before 9:00 (when the room would have been warm).\n\nApple thinks that is impressive, but doesn't understand how that helps at all. Brennan assures Apple that he's just painting the whole picture. Brennan doesn't think Greg was beaten to death, because he had a cigarette in his left hand. Brennan had talked to Greg's wife earlier that day and asked her which hand Greg smoked with. She said that Greg only smoked with his right hand.\n\nBrennan thinks that Greg was in his room watching TV and smoking with his right hand, something happened, and then he got out of bed, made his way to the door to get help, transfered the cigarette from his right hand to his left to reach for the door, but then collapsed and died. Brennan says that he has a theory about what the trauma was, but he has to be in the hotel room to confirm it.\n\nWhen they get to the hotel room, Brennan looks all over the wall and sees a spot where it looks like there had been some patch work. They then make their way to the other side of the wall in the next room, and Brennan takes his finger, and pushes on the patchwork, and reveals a small hole, pointing directly at Greg's bed. They get into contact with the two men who had been in that room the night that Greg died, and they find their answers.\n\nThe two men were electricians, and they had been drinking at the hotel bar the night that Greg had died. They made their way back to their hotel room and one of them began fooling around with a pistol. He then pointed it at his friend, and his friend wacked it out of his hand and onto the floor, where it went off, and fired a round into Greg's room. The two electricians were unsure if anyone had heard the gun shot, but they assumed no one was in the room because they couldn't hear anyone. They got some toothpaste, and covered the hole. \n\nWhen the gun hit the floor, it had fired a bullet through the wall and into Greg's room, exactly where Greg had been lying on his bed watching TV. The bullet entered Greg's crotch and traveled all the way through his body, cutting up his insides, and landing in his heart. It would later turn out that the medical examiner had not done a thorough job with Greg's autopsy, and had somehow mistaken the bullet wound in Greg's crotch for an abrasion, and had also not found the bullet in Greg's heart.\n\nGreg got out of his bed to get help, but he died before he got to the door. The two men had no idea that they were the ones that killed Greg. They had heard the cops saying that Greg had died from a heart attack, and so they thought it was a coincidence. \n\nIn the end, the man who owned the gun was charged with manslaughter, and was given 10 years in prison.\n\nI have a couple other cases like this, I'll try to find them and type them out.",

In 1979, the family's remains were located...but they only found 5 bodies. Had 2 of the children managed to survive after all?\n\nNope. In July 2007, the remains of the other 2 children were found by an amateur archaeologist not far from the first burial site. Fun fact: the late Duke of Edinburgh assisted in the identification through DNA, as both he and the Romanov children were descended from the same daughter of Queen Victoria.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia",

            "The Hanging Gardens of Babylon have long been a mystery, since no archaeological evidence was ever found for any such garden in Babylon. King Nebuchadnezzar, who many associate with the gardens, was not known to have enacted any major works of engineering, which would have been necessary to water the gardens. Many have suspected that they may never have existed at all.\n\nA popular modern theory is that the gardens weren't Babylonian, but actually Assyrian. The Assyrian king Sennacherib was well known for his waterworks and aqueducts, and his palace in Nineveh was documented to have lavish gardens.\n\nIt's believed that people mistakenly attributed the gardens to Babylon. The name Babylon means \"Gate of the Gods\", and was used to describe several cities in Mesopotamia. Nineveh's gates were named after different gods by Sennacherib, so it would likely have been referenced that way.\n\nArchaeology at the site of Nineveh has been difficult in recent years because it's very close to Mosul, Iraq. The region had been occupied by ISIS, who intentionally damaged parts of the site.",

            "The disappearance of flight KAL 007 in the 1980s. Headed from Alaska to South Korea, the flight took off as normal. In spite of multiple systems and scanners on the plan to ensure an accurate flight path, at some point it lost contact and eventually disappeared over the pacific ocean. It was searched for by Korea, the U.S. and even Japan. No one could find anything. The flight was supposed to come close to USSR borders. The USSR refused search efforts within their borders, but offered to look themselves. Once civilian debris from the flight began washing up on Japan's shores, it was largely accepted that the plane had crashed. But why? How? The USSR claimed total innocence...until they couldn't any longer. \n\nWe didn't get the full story of KAL 007 until the USSR fell in the 1990s, ten years after the crash. It was then we were able to find out that not only did they know what happened, they were RESPONSIBLE. \n\nIt's believed 007 was given the wrong coordinates before leaving the Alaskan airport. Coordinates so wrong, they ended up way off course and actually bouncing in and out of Soviet airspace. At this time it was the middle of the night. The Soviets believed it to be a spy plane sent by the U.S. intentionally into their air space. Two fighter pilots were sent to check out the foreign plane, and ordered to give warning fire. At this same time, KAL 007 had requested permission from a korean air station to fly higher to conserve fuel. It was the last contact anyone would have with them. When they went to fly up, a warning shot damaged the hydraulics that control the plans movements. Suddenly it was shooting up and down uncontrollably. This was the only sign the pilots had that anything was wrong at all. \n\nThe fighter pilots following the plane, though having reported in that 007 \"had lights like a civilian aircraft\", transcripts show they were told to basically shoot it down anyway. When the plane began moving erratically, the soviet fighter launched a missile that struck the back of the passenger cabin. At more than 30,000 feet, people and items were basically sucked out like a vacuum. Nothing but warped body parts and luggage was strewn across the ocean for quite some distance. Records show the pilots and plane went down a distance later, near an island off the coast. Days later a search team found what was left. \n\nThe USSR decided to cover it up and pretend they had no idea what had happened. For 10 years 230+ people's families had no idea what had happened to their loved ones. Truly awful and I was surprised I had never heard of this case before. A civilian flight shot down by the USSR. With proof they pretty much knew it was a civilian flight and didn't care. They had all the evidence -transcripts, 2 black boxes from the plane, the crash site, everything. And they lied and kept it a secret.",
            "Quite a recent mystery, but there were screenshots of a The Big Comfy Couch video game circulating that had people confused, namely as one of the screenshots showed not just combat against the dust bunnies, but what appeared to be blood splatters--which is kind of antithetical to a kid's show like The Big Comfy Couch.\n\nAfter a bit of poking around, it turned out that one of the developers found out that people were circulating that mystery, and confirmed the game was not only legitimate, but the reason for the blood splatters was that the game was built off of an action game's engine that had blood splatter abilities enabled by default, and he just forgot to turn it off (he also jovially referred to it as \"grape juice\"). He also ended up showing two other games that ran off that same engine, and one of those was honestly probably more interesting than The Big Comfy Couch game--it was a massive Capcom crossover.\n\nLSuperSonicQ has a good pair of videos on the ordeal, it's pretty interesting.",

This is the man your parents warned you about at night. He was a child rapist, cannibal, and murderer. While he committed several disgusting, disturbing, and depraved acts, the one that got him caught was the murder of a 10-year-old little girl named Grace Budd. He responded to an ad for work her brother put in the paper, but when he met the family, he changed his mind from killing him, to killing Grace. After he killed and ate her, he then wrote a letter to Grace\u2019s mother, explaining in detail what he did to her daughter.

When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs.

Buckle up, it's a long one.\n\nOn June 29th 2003, John (14) and his best friend Mark (16) (names hidden for private reasons) were walking down an alley in Manchester England. Mark had asked John to turn down this alleyway, which John found strange, because it was just a dead end. Mark turns to John and puts his hand on his shoulder and says \"I'm sorry bro, I love you\", pulls out a knife, stabs him in the stomach, again in the chest, and let's him fall to the ground. As he's on the ground dying, Mark says \"I had to do it. If you knew all the details, you would understand.\" \n\nAfter a few minutes, John goes quiet and Mark calls the police, believing John to be dead. Once the police arrived, Mark began frantically asking the officers when \"Janet\" was going to be there, but they had no idea what he was talking about.\n\nThe ambulance arrived, and actually was able to keep John alive long enough to get him to a hospital where he made a full recovery. John let police know that it was Mark who attacked him, but he had no idea why. The police confronted Mark and he confessed, then was arrested. The detectives did some digging on the motive, and the entire story is absolutely batshit crazy. \n\nIn February 2003, 4 months before the attack, Mark was a 16 year old student with ok grades in school, he was actually quite dimwitted. But he had a good family that lived in a modest neighborhood, and really was just living a normal life.\n\nMark had found an online chat room for teens in Manchester England, where people would talk about fashion, sports, and other teen stuff. Over time, Mark became an active user of this site, and began spending more and more time on it. He became obsessed with it, and let it take over his life.\n\nAt the same time, John was 14 and also living in Manchester England, but not near Mark, they hadn't actually met yet. John was smart, kind, charming, and was an excellent student at a prestigious school. However, his home life wasn't too good. His mom would have shitty boyfriend after shitty boyfriend, and John never knew his real father.\n\nIn order to escape his home life, John found the same online chat room where he would later meet his best friend Mark, however they didn't meet each other right away. The purpose of this chat room was for teens to talk about fashion, movies, sports, and entertainment, but obviously that's not what teens want to do on the internet. They were there to flirt with each other. \n\nJohn's interactions with girls online were more innocent and friendly, but Mark fell absolutely in *love* with a girl named Rachel. She was 16 and worked at a gym, and after looking at her picture, Mark sent her a DM. That night, they stayed up all night talking. They talked for the next few days, until Rachel said that she wanted to introduce him to another boy she met in the chat room. She thought the two of them would get along great. That boy was John.\n\nMark and John hit it off right away, and the 3 of them created their own little thread outside of the main chat room, where they would talk 24/7 non-stop. Mark and John would then become extremely close friends, and Rachel and Mark would continue to fall in love.\n\nWhile they were in this thread, Mark and John would use webcams to talk to each other, but Rachel never had hers on. She made excuses like hers was broken, she didn't have the money to get one, she was shy, and this really frustrated Mark. But eventually, Rachel suggested that they meet up in person. \n\nAt first Mark was super excited and would talk to John about how happy he was to meet his girlfriend, but Mark ended up getting cold feet, and made an excuse not to show up. Rachel would offer a few more times, and each time Mark would chicken out. After the last time, Mark suggested that Rachel come to see him, but then *she* started to chicken out. This went back and forth until they just stopped asking each other, and they decided that their relationship would be online.\n\nOne day, a new member appeared in the main chat room. His name was Kevin, and he only typed in pink text, so he really stood out. He would tell everyone that he was a stalker and had a foot fetish. Everyone thought this guy was weird, but thought he was just a kid trying to get attention.\n\nLater on, Kevin actually emailed Mark directly and told him that he knew he was Rachel's boyfriend, and that he is her stalker. He also told Mark that he was going to hurt her. Mark didn't know what to do, so he told Rachel about it, and she didn't know what it was about and just told him to ignore that guy. He also told John, and he would say the same.\n\nThe next day, Mark logged onto that chat room and saw that Rachel wasn't there, which was odd. He asked John if he had spoken to Rachel at all, but John had not seen her either. He asked around the chat room and no one had seen Rachel at all. That is when Mark saw that he had another email from Kevin, this time saying that he had Rachel, and he would only let her go if Mark showed Kevin his feet, and also masterbatred for him via webcam.\n\nMark didn't know what to do, so he did what Kevin told him. Kevin emailed him back saying that he had released Rachel. That night, Rachel came online and thanked Mark for what he did, but she felt bad for putting him in that position. She decided that they *had* to meet in person so she could apologize and give him a hug.\n\nThe next day, Mark met at the meeting spot, but Rachel never showed up. After that day, he never heard from Rachel again. He went home that day and asked John if he had heard from her, but he said no. He asked around the chat room but again, no one had heard from her. That's when he noticed a rumor start to circulate around the chat room that one of their members had abducted and killed another member. Those rumors would turn out to be about Kevin and Rachel, because they had both logged out at around the same time, and were both inactive. \n\nOddly enough, Mark just kept logging in every day and acting like he was not bothered at all, and eventually the rumors were just forgotten about. John would periodically check in with Mark to make sure everything was alright, and Mark insisted he was fine. Over time, Mark and John's friendship would get stronger, and they would eventually start hanging out in real life. This is where things get crazy.\n\nA month after Rachel vanished, a new woman named Janet appeared in the chat. Janet reached out to Mark and told him that she was 44 years old, married, had 2 children, and was a real-estate agent, but secretly, she was a spy for the British secret service, and in fact, she was the 3rd most powerful person in all of Britain, and that she had been sent to recruit Mark. She told him that if he joins, he would be fabulously wealthy, famous, and that he could be her boyfriend.",

            "A coworker was featured on SuperNanny. They had a pretty good experience filming and were so excited for their show to air that they hosted a watch party. I\u2019m sure you can imagine what\u2019s next-the way the show was edited made the parents look SO bad\u2014like, neglectful bad\u2014and made the kids (who were pretty wild) look even worse.

            "I'm a little bit late to this one, but my younger siblings, mother, and then step-father were on a programme in the UK called Mum's On Strike in the mid 2000s.\n\nThe premise was that the mother would be sick of doing everything around the house, and would be whisked away to a luxury spa for a weekend, leaving the clueless father in charge of trying to take care of the household duties.\n\nA lot of the conversations and scenarios were faked. I supposedly visited them for the weekend, but I did multiple different shoots across a few hours on the last day of filming, then went back home.\n\nThey'd cause fights between the siblings by purposely creating situations where one was favoured over the other, so the others would throw a tantrum.\n\nThere was a shoot on location in our local town centre, and they encouraged my little brother to run off into all sorts of different shops, causing hilarity as my step-father tried chasing after him with two other children in tow.\n\nMealtimes were a bit of a farce as well - as it was a weekend, my step-father had to cook a traditional roast dinner. The production company intentionally supplied incorrect ingredients to make sure my step-father looked like an idiot. They filmed my reaction to him trying to add beans to the roast a few different times, so they could pick the best one. In the end, after they'd got all the footage they wanted, they sent one of the production team out to the chippy to get us some actual edible food.\n\n\nTL:DR - Contrived, exaggerated, sometimes faked, full of drama.",

People gave me crap about it forever and still do. I was made into a \"screamo\" singer, the experience is interesting to say the least. The money and flight/trip to NYC though at 17 years old made the whole embarrassment worth it.

            "Like 3 years ago, I lived in a big 5 bedroom house with 4 other friends in college.  The house was in an episode of Supernanny. We found out because our nice neighbor literally gave us a signed headshot from Jo Frost as a gift out of the blue. He literally told us \u201c I think y\u2019all would like this more to than me and get a kick out of it.\u201d It made our week and we found the episode online and watched it. I asked about the family to the neighbor as our house was rented out and owned by a property company. He told me after the show the parents fought all the time, lost all of their money due to 2008 crisis, and lost the house to foreclosure. The picture stayed on our mantle for three years and I thought about that family everytime.",
            "One of my friends in gradeschool was on nanny 911 as a kid (maybe around 5 years old). There were a lot of kids in her family and one of the biggest problems the nanny had with their household was safety. She baby-proofed the entire house and lectured them on safety precautions they have to take in their lives to ensure that the children wouldn't get hurt. She even gave them all helmets to wear whenever they rode bikes or 4 wheelers. After she left, a lot of the safety precautions went out of the window and later my friend told me that they still had the helmets but they were all sitting in a dusty corner.",

A couple other guys there went on shows like this and they never worked, hence being at the correctional school.\n\nThe school did pretty good straightening most of us out, HOWEVER unfortunately there's always a couple guys who just wont follow rules.\n\nIf our school couldn't help you, you would be sent to \"the other place\" which was basically a terrible juvenile prison in Mexico that was ran by US Marshal's.\n\nOne day one of these marshals  came to give a talk. He spoke about \"the other place\" and basically scared the shit out of us. At the end of his speech he said \"and unfortunately one of you is coming with us today\" and we all simultaneously shit our pants.\n\nHe says the name of the kid he was taking, we'll call him Collin. He then tells Collin to empty his pockets, take off his shoes and belt, and places him in handcuffs.\n\nThe director of the school said some encouraging words to him and asked if any of the students wanted to say bye or wish him well...dead silence\n\nThen his roommate stands up and says \"I packed your stuff. you had no bags so I put all your shit in some trash bags\"...\"oh and uh, I'll miss you I guess?\"\n\nA piece of Collin died that day..\n\nI never heard from him or about him after that day.

            "Didn\u2019t end up on it, but my family was approached to take part in a German version of the reality show \u201cThe World\u2019s Strictest Parents\u201d (Die strengsten Eltern der Welt?). The reason being my father is somewhat well known in my country for being a bit of a wild man; looks like a Viking, very into the outdoors, fishing, hunting etc. They\u2019d found a special of him on 60 minutes and a few clips of him adventuring online and thought that Germans would enjoy watching bad kids being set straight by the \u201cbear man\u201d.\n\nAnyway the interaction was done through a middleman so to speak, who outlined what would be required of us, and what (small) compensation we would receive for going along with it. At the outset it seemed fine, even a little exciting. We had had close ties with a lot of exchange students in the past (we lived in a very small community in the mountains and we all loved traveling), and my father didn\u2019t seem to mind the sound of helping out some struggling kids and possibly showing them a different side of life. Not necessarily that hunting and the outdoors are the only way to go, but more open their minds a little and take them out of their comfort zone etc. We watched a few clips of the show online and decided that we were laid back enough as a family that the drama wouldn\u2019t really wind us up or anything\n\nWell alarm bells started ringing after a bit more correspondence with the middleman. He started insinuating that there would be times where the kids would be told to play up situations, and that we would have to either roll along with the staged drama, or actively join in and amp it up for the cameras. My dad laid it out pretty straight, saying he\u2019d be happy to take these kids under his wing and show them some pretty cool adventures - he had glacier crossing, hiking through rainforests, caving, white water kayaking, hunting (or at least watching him hunt) and tons of other activities across our country all planned out. I\u2019d just become a SCUBA instructor and even offered to take them out diving on geothermal vents. But they really stressed the whole \u201cpeople watch this show to see bad kids act batshit crazy, so that\u2019s what you\u2019re expected to encourage\u201d vibe. We politely turned them down at this stage.\n\nA few months later the middleman actually emailed us and told us it was probably a good idea that we hadn\u2019t gone along with it. Apparently they never paid him for any of his work organising host families or setting up scenarios. Ah well, dodged a bullet there I guess. All my friends in Germany seemed to think so!\n\nTL;DR German reality show wanted us to encourage struggling teens to throw temper tantrums and make my Dad look like an angry bear man. Turned them down",

The nanny stayed in their neighbors house across the street, and the kids behavior didn't improve for a very long after the nanny left.

It was my school and those exact kids! They had come to an Indian family, whose children went to my school. The episode was a lot of drama. The parents were kind of obnoxious, at least for the episode. However, the last I heard on asking a few friends was that those parents were fine and their children are doing reasonably well. Not sure about the \"foreign kids\" who came.\n\nWhat a small world! Seems like ages ago.",

            "Not really relevant but along in the same theme of parents and kids being told to over act and stuff: when I was 13 me and my parents were interviewed for a BBC show called Living With The Enemy for an episode where the parents were to spend time with the band Cradle of Filth because their child was a fan and they supposedly disapproved. My parents weren't being outraged enough and it was suggested they should be more upset about their precious small child liking such a band because it would make better television. My parents just didn't have it in them because they really weren't that bothered because I was a good kid.\n\nThe family who ended up on the programme were massively over dramatic and the 'kid' was 18 so probably not the same impact as it would have been with me, an oh so impressionable little girl, had my family cooperated.\n\nI also still have the interview tape over 20 years later as they sent it to us, along with a bunch of signed band merch for me!",

            "Ah crap, this is me. On my degeneracy throwaway for reasons.\n\nHere in Australia I think we ended up with a super nanny rip-off or spin off or something eventually, but all three major networks had something in the works similar to it. Because every parent wants that Thursday evening sigh of relief of 'oh well at least my Timmy isn't like THAT boy'.\n\nMy parents loved TV, every dinner was in front of the telly and they constantly would try to be in studio audiences. They ended up in rove lives audience a couple of times. And lo and behold there was a casting call for parents at their wits end with unruly children.\n\nWe ended up on a short list along the way somehow, with me as the subject. Two middle class parents in suburbia with two angelic girls and an unruly boy in the middle that they couldn't deal with. I was two faced, cruel to my siblings, reckless and disobedient.\n\nBut where's the narrative? What made our family interesting enough? Well, they asked for copies of my transcripts and look, he's a student that performs well, is loved by teachers, but has a couple infractions for mean words to his cohort.\n\nThey came around with the idea that they could get a grasp of this really interesting narrative of the teacher's pet gremlin who is cruel to his peers, to his sisters, to his family and probably to his dog at that rate.\n\nI remember not knowing what was going on at first, it wasn't the first time my parents had planted me in front of a child psychologist (they thought I was mentally handicapped for a bit: nope just missed the lesson on how to use a ruler so my teacher recommended getting me tested when I couldn't). And there were a few interviews with my parents and I on camera for the casting process. I only found out about what exactly it was from my only friend telling me he was in the casting call too.\n\nSee, my only friend at the time was a kid who'd bullied the shit out of me (teachers pet, likes maths) but then his partner in crime moved away and I was the only schmuck desparate enough for friendship. His mother suggested to mine to go on the program, since she was also at her limit. That friend was genuinely a terror though but a product of drugs in the family so I don't see that being camera friendly.\n\nThat child psychologist they sent me to was an absolute fucking godsend. He quickly came to a conclusion that something wasn't right. Basically because he asked 'would you say you're a bit disruptive to your family?' or something along those lines and I parroted back 'absolutely yeah I'm a proper terror'.\n\nTurns out I was pretty much just the family scapegoat for that part of my life. Yeah sure I never studied like my angelic sisters, and something about how I coasted along on my smarts pissed my family off. I was punished in one way or the other pretty much every minute of every day. Usually no video games or no books or whatever I was using at the moment I was punished for something arbitrary. I remember later in childhood having a calender for a while tracking when each punishment ticked over to another so I could change my leisure entertainment.\n\nBasically after a bit of observation where I was a pretty shy polite kid, that was convinced he was a pain for those around him, and read a lot but didn't like vegetables or studying, they received the child psychologist report and abandoned ship. The reason my mother later told me they gave her was because they couldn't get permission to film at school and catch me being two faced.\n\nThe big thing was that the psychologist they sent me to offered at a very steep discount to keep seeing me promising he could help with their situation. He instead helped me learn to be more resilient, how to understand my own worth and taught me some really good social skills. He really did help me a lot, and when my parents said they couldn't make the commute that far to so ehim he helped pay for sessions with a more local therapist. He understood what was going on. He never used severe language that blamed my family either, he just helped.\n\nI now have a good job (for someone of my age in this economy), still live with my parents and sisters because I'm still convinced I'm not going to be able to survive on my own, am scared of driving because I know I'll somehow cause an accident (so never got my license) and am a functional Alcoholic. So not the happiest ending, but we're getting there! \n\nTldr: was nearly on one of those shows. Was rejected because I was pretty normal but my family wasn't.",

The show was called something like Born Silly, and was supposed to air on Channel 4 (this is in UK by the way) but never did, or my episode didn't anyway. I knew I had been auditioning for a show, but didn't know what it would be until the \"prank\" actually happened. My mum told me all it was, was being an audience member on a random show.\n\nAnyway, we went down to this massive shopping centre in Watford, where we were apparently going to be filming the audience thing. So we sat outside this juice bar for a bit, when the chaperones came over and my mum pretended they were old family friends. One of them took my mum to get her mic setup, and one stayed with me where I talked about very personal things thinking she knew my siblings and the like.\n\nMy mum came back over, they left, and we walked towards where the \"prank\" was to happen. So there was this weird blue bench thing that was really out of place that we had to sit on. My mum kept on encouraging me to sit on it, but I was more interested in sitting on top of a bench above some stairs to watch all the crowd go by. Eventually I gave in and sat with my mum. This is where it would happen.\n\nSo a woman came over in a Mary Poppins outfit with a small purse around her arm. She sat next to me and put the bag down. The bag had a small hole in the bottom, and the purpose of the weird bench was to store items for her to pull out. She pulled out a few instruments, and even a plank of wood if I can recall correctly. She told me she was in a rush, and wanted me to put it all back for her. She ran off and the hatch closed (I wasn't aware there was a hatch at this point obviously) and the \"prank\" was just me trying to put all the things back in the purse. I knew what was going on at this point and played into it. I acted like I was shocked. Eventually the woman came back over and revealed it was a prank. She showed me where the cameras were and I had one more thing to do. We sat on the bench above the stairs I mentioned earlier and they put a camera Infront of my mum's face where she had to pretend she was holding a phone, and asked me things about how it felt to be pranked. I kept looking at the crowds below (should probably mention I have ADHD and it was quite out of control at the time) and wouldn't pay attention to the camera. We finished filming that, and I got to talk to some of the crew for a bit while they packed up. They were all very friendly, but the person who did the Mary Poppins impression was awful acting wise.\n\nAfter that I got a badge (which I still have somewhere) with the logo of the show on it and we went home. I'll look for the badge and post it if I find it.  \nEDIT: Badge: [https://imgur.com/a/L1ohqYD](https://imgur.com/a/L1ohqYD)",

The only thing that was \u201cscripted\u201d were the producers setting up scenarios to easily score drugs or directing us to specific neighborhoods to go to. One night they also stole most of my cash to instigate drama. They told me at one point that I couldn\u2019t sit around and watch cartoons all day because they were making a tv show after all :) \n\nDuring filming the interventionist was very much acting as if she was my new found BFF and we are going to be super close for the rest of our lives. After the cameras stopped rolling I never heard from her again though I did reach out several times. I did stay in touch with a couple of cameramen and a producer though and we remain friends to this day all these years later.",
            "Family in my neighborhood was on, I believe, Nanny 911. We lived in a gated community, which I think often fosters a grossly entitled and cliqueish community. The family basically became the hot gossip and they were openly shamed and ridiculed. Within a year they had sold their house for signfificantly less than they paid and moved a town over to escape the communal ostracism.",
            "Not sure if this counts, but my Grandma was on hoarders. Me and my cousin were around 6 at the time and we had been driven over to see her. The whole camera crew and stuff was there. They had just finished up, and we were amazed by how clean the house looked. We didn't get taken there often because of it, but we knew how messy the house was.\nA couple of the guys told us to just play and run around the house, even jump on the bed. It was likely for some post-cleaning \"omg it's so much better everyone is happy look even the kids are scene\", but it was just fun for us to run around.",

He threatened to go to law enforcement unless she agreed to go to his 90-day intensive rehab program, and she reluctantly agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's doing surprisingly well since then.

            "Man I'm so late, but maybe OP will see this. I haven't seen anyone talk about World's Strictest Parents, which I was on in 2011. My family was selected to be the \"strict parents\" part of the show. They basically showed up at the church my dad preaches at and asked people who they would recommend to be on the show and they recommended our family. We did NOT want to be on the show lol. But you get paid a little bit so we went with it. We went through psychiatric evaluations to make sure we weren't psycho, then got okay'd to be on the show. \n\nFor me, it was a great experience. I was a senior in high school who wanted to go into broadcast production, so I hung around with the producers and watched the process. They sent the two \"bad kids\" to us, and they stayed with us for 4 days. During the 4 days, the producers had events planned that would annoy any lazy teenager really like \"make them do yard work at 2pm on a hot day\" or \"make them build a shed with basic tools\". My parents were really not strict ESPECIALLY compared to other parents on that show, so the producers had to cause a ruckus most of the time to get some conflict going. This included them planting a porno DVD in the boy's suitcase then making my dad go through his stuff the find it. \n\nIn the end, we became really close with the two kids and had a good time with them. I still talk to the boy today and he's doing well. The show didn't change them really, but they definitely appreciated the experience and advice my parents gave them.",

Immediately afterward I had a lot of trouble sleeping and ended up using to control my anxiety. In the end I don't think it helped or addressed any of the issues that were underlying my behavior and it actually made them worse.

            "I worked on a production for an un-aired pilot of a show similar to Wife Swap. None of it was scripted, because casting did extensive interviews and found people that acted natural and excited on camera. I picked up the \"talent\" from the airport, took them to their hotel, and helped with anything they needed on-set.\n\nFrom my experience, everyone was super nice to one another. The crew was super grateful to the homeowners/talent, because we were in their living space for 12 hours each of the 3 days of filming. I think they all had fun being around the set environment. And since it was a small crew and everyone had a good time, the wrap party was chill and fun (drinks back at the hotel after filming had wrapped.)",

They said they told my aunt to act bossy and bitchy and act like her and my cousins wife had issues when they 100% did not.  It was very strange and almost entirely staged."

I asked someone where he was and he was out by the fire with a group of people chatting and hanging out. I was astonished that we could just go our separate ways in a social setting and that was totally fine, we didn't have to be attached at the hip the whole time.\n\nEdit: When I say he would follow me around I literally mean he never left my side. And these were parties and things where he knew everyone as well. At one point my friend was upset so I went into a bedroom with her and another friend to talk to her and within five minutes he came into the room and even though this was obviously private he just stood in there. And I did tell him multiple times that we didn't constantly have to be beside each other. If you and your partner like to hang out at parties that's fine but it was suffocating to me. He was jealous of my friends and complained when I would make plans with them. Honestly we were young and he's probably a totally fine dude now. We were just not right together.",

It's hard to say when exactly I stopped loving her, but it was a relationship of comfort and convenience more than anything, and when she eventually cheated on me and broke us up, it was still just so easy to get back together on and off after that that I could feel myself falling back into a commitment I didn't want to be a part of. Now it's wild to actually think about a future with my partner. I genuinely look forward to stuff like maybe living together, or getting married and seeing the world and all that romantic stuff.

Was fingering her profusely, doing all sorts of things and was getting frustrated because I thought she wasn't into me, or I was doing something wrong.\n\nEdit.  \nGoodbye inbox.  \nAlso, yes, OK I get it. Its pee.  It didn't smell like pee, and or look like pee but whatever its pee. But it was also almost 17years ago.  We still talk to this day though so ima send her over and let her know that her pee pee is Internet famous",
            "You shouldn't have to be the only one putting in any effort. My first bf never let me get to know him, it was like pulling teeth to get anything, he knew I had siblings, that I was a closet pagan, I liked experimenting with cooking, and a bunch of other things, but I had to basically stalk his socials to learn anything about him. If I asked his opinion on an outfit, or basically anything, he didn't care. I never learned what he liked, and I got tired of doing what felt like all this extra work for someone who  didn't care about me.",

My current gf and I have been dating for 3 and a half years and she only cries when she\u2019s in pain or having a panic attack. Both of which are not my fault and I can help her through. \n\nDamn I thought every girl cried like 3 times a day. If any of you are dating a Kendra from Southern California, get the hell away.",
            "That mental/emotional abuse and not doing things together was normal...if that makes sense.\n\nWe met online and our first date was okay...but that was the last time we ever really went out in public. He was older than me so after work he would come to my college dorm. He forced me to have sex, and would get angry with me if I didn't....mock sadness and disappointment in me. I didn't want to but I thought I loved him and I thought he knew best.\n\nHe would avoid me for months at a time, just saying he was busy (usually during the summer. He was a teacher), and then try to convince me everything was okay come September.\n\nHe got engaged to another woman while still trying to convince me we were a happy couple. They got married two months ago.\n\nYes, I should have registered the signs, but he was my first relationship ever and I just wanted to believe it was all normal and okay. :(\n\nOn a much happier, lighter note, I am currently engaged to the actual man of my dreams, and he treats me like a princess :)",
            "It was very minor all things considered.  I got used to never being complimented, just criticized.  I take that back, he did compliment me, once.  He told me that in Saudi (his parents worked for an oil company and had moved there) I'd be worth many camels because I was \"buxsom, had child bearing hips, and reddish hair\".  Yeah, he actually said buxsom.  I've been married 22 years, and he was several years before that, and I still don't do well with compliments.",

            "Honestly? A lack of love. I did some things wrong in my first relationship early on, and my ex held that against me for years on end. Not even anything as severe as cheating, but just me being young, inexperienced and stupid. She practically used those things as an excuse for us to never be intimate for a decade to follow. We barely ever had sex, hugged, or even touched at all. It was always me instigating any of that, and her only sometimes being okay with having it happen.  \n&nbsp;  \nAround the time we were breaking up, I started, in my own awkward manner, telling her that I would like for her to 'do things for me'; I constantly did small things, like buying her chocolate or making her hot water bottles for bed, and she never did anything of the kind for me. There was never a back-rub, a touch, a gift from the shop, or even a birthday present that was anything more than 'a sweater she thought looked good'. And don't get me wrong - you don't always have to get someone a spectacular present, but it was like this for years.  \n&nbsp;  \nNow that I've met someone new, I keep being amazed by the fact that she's actually... loving towards me. She wants to help me if I feel bad. She doesn't berate me for not solving the problem if I share one with her. She will, out of her own volition, do something nice for me just because she wants to. The fact that this concept is so fucking alien to me sort of shows me how wrongly I was situated in my past relationship. I've put women on a bit of a pedestal since I was young, and I rolled into that relationship assuming this stuff is normal. That guys just put in all the effort, and women reciprocate if they feel so inclined, but never have to. But I don't have to settle for that at all.",
            "You're apparantly not supposed to be afraid of your boyfriend, and a man doing his share of his own housework is not impossible to come by nor something you can't realistically expect!

(I'm living a much better life nowadays, truly! :) )",
            "Having a partner accommodate your emotional needs without communicating about their own. \n\nI talked about my anxiety and other mental health issues, but she didn't really talk about hers. She did a lot to take care of me through that, and I regret that I didn't do the same for her. I was surprised to realize (after the end of our relationship) how bad her anxiety and depression were becoming because it wasn't something she'd ever talked about. \n\nI did not have much emotional intelligence at the time, so I didn't perceive that she was struggling, and it didn't occur to me to ask. I loved her very much, and I didn't realize I was fucking up until she moved across the country and broke up with me. And I didn't start figuring out *how* I'd screwed up until some time later. She was doing a lot of emotional labor for me, and I wasn't reciprocating it. I didn't realize I was being selfish, but I was. \n\nSince then, I've definitely gotten better about trying to recognize and meet partners' emotional needs (and I've been in relationships with people who are more able to communicate about their emotional state and tell me what their needs are), but I still really regret not being a better partner in that first relationship.",

And one day I realized that if/when it happened, I could forgive him. I wish I had told someone that so they could have told me I should never even consider that possibility.\n\nI also thought that violently swinging from rage to sappy romantic in less than a second was sweet, since it meant he was sorry for whatever he did or said.",

I was never really attracted to men, so every sexual interaction (in  my first 2 year long relationship) was either me choking on dong or getting painfully pounded. \n\nIt took three years to realize I'm not into men. Then another three years to stop being in one sided relationships with women who only wanted to experiment with me and wouldn't return head. If they did, it was reluctant and fumbling, and they didn't want tips or a learning experience, they just wanted it one way. Luckily I met a woman online who moved from Seattle to central Illinois and she delights in the opportunity to eat me out. She makes me feel more comfortable with my body, and I do the same for her. It's incredible.\n\nEdited for how long my first relationship was.",

He sat vigil with us and played her favorite songs on guitar while she was unconscious. Then he drove me home so I could go to work that week (I started a new job in the middle of everything), and got me back to her state for the funeral. He also played the live music at her service, despite wrestling with stage fright his whole life.

I shared a room with my sister, his parents were a little weird - 98% of the sex we had was in the back of a car, in a field somewhere.  I don't think I've ever though about having sex in a car since then, because we dated through a bit of college (we both commuted so no dorm rooms) - by the time I was in my next relationship, I was living on my own.

Never hung out at his house until 4 years in, never introduced me to his friends, never talked about moving in together, never spent holidays together. Went out to dinner maybe twice in almost 6 years. I just thought it was normal that he didn't really want anything to do with my life or family. I didn't end things because \"he just wants to sit around watching Netflix\" seems like a pretty shallow reason to break up with someone. But the relationship really had no substance- I was depressed, lonely, and just plain bored. People always said there were ups and downs, and that the grass would always be greener on the other side, and that if I just stayed and worked on things, I would be happy. And I just couldn't think of a good reason to break things off.\nOne day, I realized that I didn't need a \"good reason,\" and if I didn't break things off, I'd end up in a miserable marriage with someone didn't actually like all that much. I had to see if that grass was greener on the other side. So I left. My current SO goes out with me in dates, to restaurants and museums and shows. We live together, spend holidays together, laugh and talk and have stimulating conversations. I didn't realize a relationship could be this good.

            "You should never feel that your significant other is dating you out of pity, and finding out she only agreed to go out with you the first time because she wanted to make your friend jealous is probably less of a reason to try to make things work than it is to cut things off completely and retain some kind of dignity. \n\nI had terrible self-esteem.",

We were young and constantly having sex, so this must mean that were meant for eachother (high school, right? and I would be liar if I told you I didnt participate in the conversation myself). She would constantly talk about the future and how once he graduated our life together could finally begin. This was especially important to her since her mother did not approve of me or just her dating in general and would always try to break us up and prevent any communication between us. This situtation caused her to always be texting me and calling when she could, to the point where all I did after school was make sure I was available to talk to since her mom was always trying to get in the way of that. If was not available she would cry and get mad at me for not being there for her, etc. The tipping factor was deciding what college to go to. I wanted to go somewhere new, meet new people, learn different things, but she was telling me it would get in the way of our future and hurt our relationship since I could not be available to talk to her if was doing all these things. I realized that I just didn't care about that enough when deciding about colleges to go to.  Once I decided that I wanted to go out of town for college, I decided to break up with her. To my friends it was like I was revived from the dead, since I became a recluse from being emotionally drained from always having to make sure I was available to talk to my ex.

The baby is born and as the doctor places her on the mom\u2019s chest the first words out of her mouth are \u201cThat\u2019s not my baby! That\u2019s not my baby!!\u201d \n\nThe baby in question, still attached at the umbilical cord, has beautiful dark curly black hair, and dark skin. The nurse looks at her and tells her that this is definitely her baby because \u201cshe\u2019s still attached to you\u201d and she, not so quietly, tells the nurse \u201cThere\u2019s no way, I never slept with a black man! It\u2019s not mine!\u201d \n\nThe \u201cfather\u201d is standing there silent, not sure what to do. A long awkward silence fills the room. \n\nWe clean her and baby up as cheerfully as we can. We see the extended family filter out of the room and the \u201cfather\u201d leave to get a cigarette. About ten minutes later a tall black guy walks up to our front desk asking how to get to the patient in question\u2019s room.",

            "Paramedic here, our crew delivered a full birth in the back of our rig. We have 2 paramedics in the back with the PT, a driver, and I\u2019m working on the laptop listening to info they are telling me to add to the report.  All the sudden, it goes kind of quiet, I hear the mother let out a very loud \u201cOh shit, it\u2019s not white!\u201d (She was very white)\n\nFew more seconds of silence, and I\u2019m like, \u201c?\u201d\n\nThe driver alarm(beeping light on the center console sent from a button in the back) was pressed 2 times quickly, generally meaning to turn around to get info for the report. I turn from the front passenger seat to see a very dark skin colored baby.(I\u2019m guessing Cuban) I can\u2019t see the mothers face, but all I see is her shacking her head. She begins to worry, saying that \u201cher husband is meeting us there at the hospital! He can\u2019t see this!!!\u201d. I just continue the report, and am not sure what the problem is, but I guess we\u2019ll see when we get there. \n\nFlash forward, to the ER. We stop outside the ambulance bay, I get out to open the doors, and am met by another very white heavyset guy in a uniform shirt, dress pants and glasses, asked me if his wife was in there and she was in labor when he was coming home.\n\nHospital policy dictates that we can\u2019t have random people that we can\u2019t confirm identity that close to the rig when opening doors for PT safety. Security is there quick, holds him back a bit. We open the doors, roll the PT and her newborn out. He takes one look, sees the color of the baby, \n\n*JAW DROP*, LOOK OF DESPAIR.

I know it looks weird, but I can!!!!\u201d\n\nWe wheel her into ER. No sign of husband. Last I knew, the husband didn\u2019t check into the hospital as a visitor.

And although my mother definitely didn\u2019t cheat, all the midwives were convinced she had. And yeah it\u2019ll be buried but I think it\u2019s a funny story so I\u2019m going to share.\n\nFor background: my mother (J) is white, and had got married young to another white guy (D) (actually forced to by my grandparents who were horrified she was living in sin). Their relationship petered out and they separated but remained very good friends. Then she met my father (A), a black man, and began a relationship with him. Mum was still married at the time, neither her nor her husband were in a hurry to get divorced, and he became good friends with Mums new partner (my dad). \n\nMum fell pregnant with me. Time moves along. She goes into labour and needs to head up to the hospital. Dad was working and couldn\u2019t make it home in time to get her there, so still being good friends with the husband, she rings him and he comes around to drive her to hospital and decides to hang out until I\u2019m born.\n\nAfter an hour or so dad arrives. He was freaking out a bit so his best friend (H, also a black guy) drove him because dad didn\u2019t trust himself. They arrive at the hospital right as mum is ready to deliver. The midwives come out to the waiting room to grab the \u201chusband\u201d to be there when baby is born.

He freaked out and yelled \u201cNo no, I\u2019m not the father, I\u2019m just the husband! The father is Aboriginal!\u201d\n\nDad and H pulled up into the car park as this is happening, and dad leaps out of the car. Decides he needs to have a quick smoke to settle his nerves before he goes in. His best friend H doesn\u2019t smoke (cigarettes but does smoke weed and is pretty stoned) so he walks in ahead. \n\nJust then the midwives come running back to the waiting room to grab the actual father, and see the only black guy in there. Obviously him right? So they take him and suit him up to bring him down to delivery. Being pretty stoned, H doesn\u2019t question this and just goes along with it. The midwives reach the delivery room and shove him inside.\n\nMum, legs in stirrups and at the pushing stage goes absolutely ballistic. \u201cNOT THAT BLACK GUY, HES NOT THE FATHER, GO GET THE OTHER ONE\u201d.\n\nThe midwives hustle H out and return him to the waiting room to wait with D. A (my dad) has come inside by now and the midwives marched up to him and said something like \u201cI hope you\u2019re the father this time otherwise I\u2019m going to just give up and she can birth alone.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s the story about how the hospital went through three different men before they finally got to my actual father.",

Come a few moments later, I was approached by another occupant of the home who informed me that this was a home for victims of sexual assault and that the father of the baby was indeed also tho father of the mother and was currently incarcerated due to the aforementioned \u201csituation\u201d.

            "This isn't exactly what you are looking for, but my mom is black and my dad is white. My mom had kids with her first husband who were black, and they were born somewhat light-skinned which is common among black children. So she was expecting this, but when she gave birth to my eldest full brother she thought something was wrong because of how pale he was. Nurse said that happens and he will get color. Fast forward to when it's time for them to go home, the nurses that are now on duty refused to let her go because obviously there had been some sort of mix up. She was literally accused of trying to 'steal a white baby' and even with my dad there apparently, this kid was still too white to be mixed race. This was the early 80s so crazy stuff went down in hospitals. Mind you, we lived in an area where mixed-race families were nonexistent at the time. \n\nAnother fast forward 16 years, and my brother has a mountain biking accident and a TBI. He is literally hanging on by a thread. His friend calls and my mom rushes over to the hospital. His friend is literally there saying 'yes this is his mom' and she has her ID (bro didn't have an ID though) and they are refusing to let her in. They ask for clarification if he is adopted or something but apparently, the truth was the wrong answer. Hospital security escorted her out and she had to have my dad come, who by the way was just let right in. I highly doubt under any other circumstance they would erroneously not let a parent see their injured child because they don't look like them but my mom being black with a very light-skinned child was apparently an issue.\n\nBut anyway, back to the question, I wonder how many families have had drama thanks to genetics being so unpredictable. If my mom was white with a black husband, I am certain everyone would think she cheated on my dad with a white guy. Heck, people even accuse my mom of using an egg donor. Sometimes genes even skip generations so a trait that hasn't popped up in a few generations can just randomly show up.",

So this lady claims that when she gave birth the hospital gave her baby a shot that turned him black. Therefore, we refer to this kid as \u201cblackshot\u201d.

            "I already made a comment but I do have a story about a close call of this nature. \n\nSo, a few years ago I respond to an ad of the NSFW nature (I was feeling adventurous) of a request for a man to fulfill a cuckold fantasy. Basically they wanted a man who looked similar to the boyfriend of the couple to fuck the girlfriend while the boyfriend watched. There was a whole act about it, she'd call me by his name, I'd act clearly different and more sexually aggressive than him, let the \"lie\" slip up a few times and badly cover it up which she'd buy it 100%, y'know, make a whole act about it. Like playing out a porn script.\n\nAnyway, the deed is done and 9 months later I get a call from the girlfriend. She's pregnant and expecting within the week, and they're worried i might be the father, i did use a condom but she wasnt on the pill and the paranoia was understandable. Also they hadn't had sex for a week before and a couple weeks after so the timing matched up.\n\nThe baby came out, either of us could be the father as it looks vaguely like both of us (it was a boy btw), naturally it was fucking tense and awkward as hell. It took a week for the DNA test to get back, the delay was agonizing. Thankfully it came back that I was in the clear, there was actually a bit of a celebration. When I got the word I cheered, they hugged, I gave them a handshake and a hug, said my congratulations, went home and drunk a whole damn bottle of absolute vodka to celebrate.",

Aunt and her husband are both caucasian midwesterners from long lines of the same sort, going back to Germany.  There was evidently a shocked moment, and then the aunt's father, my friend's grandfather, quipped, \"Well, they say 1 in 7 babies is born Chinese,\" and everyone laughed.  The tension broke, long enough for the Doctor (also a white midwesterner of German stock) said that likely the kid's color is just off due to the events of the birth. That baby is now a man in his 30s or 40s, and looks like your typical midwesterner; he just had some tinge to his skin for a few hours following the birth, plus some dark hair at birth that has since lightened up.",

The father of the baby filed for divorce, even though the mother kept saying the baby was his. A few years later, they found out that the mother's great grandmother was African and that the baby obtained strong genes from her.\n\nThey didn't get back together, because too much had gone down at that point, but the mother was right all along.\n\nTldr; Two middle-easterns had dark-skinned baby, husband divorced but later it was found out that it was genetics.",

Apparently the issue was they were just friends and he lived in another state with his wife and kids. \n\nAnother woman had an affair with her cousin\u2019s husband and got pregnant, calling him her fianc\u00e9. Her own husband died during this period and it prompted her to go out and sleep with a few other one night stands. At this point she tried to get an abortion but she was turned away because she was overweight and hypertensive making the procedure too risky. She never followed up with the Dr and gained weight to over 400 lbs. it was too late for an abortion at this point and she had been taking medication for the hypertensive thing and the medication can cause death/deformities. When she delivered it took the entire staff to prevent her from having a stroke and the baby\u2019s kidneys... do they work? No one knows. \n\nMost of the stories are that the man cheated, if the mother cheats there\u2019s no real reason to bring it up so they don\u2019t really know. Lots of having to tell a mother who has only slept with one man that she and her baby have chlamydia. No weird stories of white babies to black parents or vice versa.\n\nAlso if my wife\u2019s friend sees this she will know who it is.

My uncle thought my aunt cheated on him with the literal milk man.. apparently that guy had dark curly hair - bad luck.\n\nTurns out... My uncle's mom had dark, curly hair when she was born (and throughout her childhood) but started coloring her hair blonde and straightening it when she was a teen. My uncle never knew his own mother's natural hair or texture and there were very few pictures of her as a young girl so he hadn't know it wasn't her natural hair. Thankfully, when my aunt and uncle's marriage was on the rocks, my grandma casually mentioned how much this girl would hate her hair when she grew you and would color/straighten it, just like she had...

The nurse telling me the story said she took a moment of silence as she realised what had happened, then she tried to act normally, but waiting for the outburst. She said the tension was unreal. \n\nThe guy stared for a minute at a child that was very obviously not his. The mum was already in tears and talking very fast. \n\nThe guy stood up, looked around for a minute, then left the room. Never said a word.  He wasn't seen again at the hospital, the mum spent the rest of the day on her phone, the nurse doesn't think she ever found him. \n\nThe last part is even more distantly related gossip, but allegedly the father cut all ties immediately, speaking regarding care of his 2 actual kids only through his lawyer. \n\nIf any of that is true, I take my hat off to the guy.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, the story goes he was very much into raising/looking after his actual kids, but wanted nothing further to do with the mum or the kid that wasn't his.

            "Probably going to get buried but still wanna share. \n\nNot my story, it's the story of my dad's friend.\n\nIn highschool my dad's friend \"Carl\" was always into this girl \"Cindy\" but she was always dating this one guy \"Jimmy\". Jimmy breaks up with Cindy and she goes off the rails sleeping with everyone. Carl sees it as his chance to be the good guy and starts dating her. \n\nI'm not sure but they either had a Ross and Rachel thing where they kept on breaking up and getting back together (she broke up with him) or that she was always cheating on him. Especially if Jimmy was hinting at them getting back together, they never did though and he'd just sleep with her. But Carl never listened to my dad or his friends because of \"blind love\". She was perfect in his eyes.\n\nSo highschool is over and Carl goes to the army. They weren't officially dating but everytime he was able to comeback he'd end up with her a night or two. My dad and his friends knew that she was sleeping around the whole time but Carl didn't care.\n\nEventually, while he was still serving, she convinced him that they were dating again, he proposed to her and she looked around for a house for them that he paid for with his army money. He comes back for good and they get married, a year later they have a beautiful baby girl together. \n\nThat baby girl is his everything. This guy grew up a migrant worker and now he has his highschool sweetheart, a home, a decent job, and his own little princess. Five years later his wife gets pregnant again. This time she has a baby boy. Now he has to start working more to ba able to care for the new baby while mom continues to be a stay at home mom. \n\nWhen the son is around 2 and the girl is around 7 he comes home to divorce papers and all his clothes packed up. \n\nTurns out the lovely house the wife *had* to have was because it made her the next door neighbor to Jimmy. This entire time she was still sleeping with him despite him also having a partner. The little girl and baby boy Carl thought were his weren't, they were Jimmy's kids, and Cindy knew it. \n\nJimmy's partner had left him so he finally wanted to be a family man and Cindy jumped at the chance kicking out Carl and divorcing him. He went into a depression and ended up losing his job because of it. \n\nI'm not sure what happened after that but I hope Carl found a nice loving girl in the end.\n\n*Edit*: wow, I didn't expect this to get so popular. I just wanted to add that this was a story (it really did happen) that my dad had told me when my ex-boyfriend cheated on me and I was thinking about getting back together with him again because he was \"oh so sorry\". \n\nMy dad had to watch as his friend went through all of this and they couldn't do anything because he didn't want to be saved. He didn't want the same thing to happen to me so that why he talked to me about this when I was 14 and dating a known player. \n\nMy parents are very big on \"learn from my mistakes\" and I'm very greatful for that. Though in this instance it was \"learn from my friends mistakes\". Especially since had I not been told this I would have had this exact thing happen to me. (But with him having kids with other women)\n\nSo those of you saying things like, he was asking for it, and, how could he get her to respect himself when not even he did. You're right! \n\nIf all of your friends are telling you someone isn't good for you *listen to them*!\n\n__Edit 2__: so a lot of people seem confused. \n\n1st: Carl stopped serving right before they got married, but he still worked in a job that requires long hours and Cindy was a stay at home mom so she still had plenty of time to cheat even though he wasn't gone for months/weeks on end.\n\n2nd: I was pretty young when my dad told me this so I didn't think to ask how come he never thought it was weird that their neighbor happened to be Cindy's ex that she frequently left him for in highschool. I just thought he must have thought it was one hell of a coincidence.\n\nAs someone else said it's hard to see the truth when you're wearing rose colored glasses. \n\n3rd: as for the house situation that's also foggy. I'm not sure if he felt bad about having to kick them out (I think Jimmy was only renting the house next door). If he thought letting her have the house would make her change her mind. Or if even though they used his money to buy it it was under her name.\n\n4th: I think he still tried to be in the kids life after but neither of the birth parents wanted him to, and despite the fact that he truly did love them he just could look at them with out being reminded of what happened.",

She had decided to give the child to a couple who were close family friends who couldn't have kids, and then told my dad. He handled it pretty well, since she wasn't asking him to be a father, just emotional support, and in his words, he already knew that he found the woman he wanted to be with for the rest of his life.  However, back in those days in my country it was still looked down upon to have a child while you were single/out of wedlock, so my dad told everyone the baby was his, and that they were planning on getting married.

Straight after birth, mum was exhausted and went straight to sleep. However, the nurses see that the baby is clearly not white, like both my parents, and go to tell my dad that the baby had been born but he might be in for a little bit of a shock. Apparently they looked so sorry for dad, thinking this poor sucker had been cheated on and lied to. When they told him that 'his' little girl was probably not his, he burst out laughing and just said \"i know\". Poor nurses got such a shock, couldn't make sense of the situation, and just walked away while dad sat their giggling to himself. He's a strange guy my dad, but a great one. After telling me that story, he said he always knew his mum was his soul mate, and going through that helped him realise that mum was the one for him. When mum told me that story, she said exactly the same thing. 33 years later and they're still going strong.",

It's a shock to find out legally, your ex-husband is still the baby's father unless you get all that other stuff sorted.\n\nEdit: Just as awkward for the husbands that know their wives cheated and don't want to be on the birth certificate.",

            "This is my granddad's story (he was a gyno), but it's amazing: it must have been in the 70s, when a married white couple came into the hospital with the woman in labor. Baby is born, my grandddad is called to cut the cord, but ...the baby is all grey! The nurse is in terror, and holds the baby upside down and smacks it on the buttox (as was custom to clear the airway) and is almost in tears \"Doctor, the baby is only getting darker and darker, I don't think it's getting enough oxygen!\" My granddad, having worked in the field for a long time at that point, just started smiling, took the baby and said \"I think a good bath will do just fine\" and perceided to wash all the blood and fluids from birth off of the baby, reveiling a healthy and half black child.\n\nHe used to tell that story all the time when I was a kid. He said the husband just stormed out and it was a huge scandal in their village. Since it was Germany in the 70s in a rural area, there weren't that many candidates for the father either.",

            "Go do a discovery flight, and log the time. \n\nGeneral Aviation pilot here. You probably have 2-3 flight schools within 30 miles of your house. They will have something called a \"discovery flight\". You sit left-seat where the Pilot In Command normally sits, and it's usually somewhere around $70 for a ~45 minute flight. \n\nThe instructor will handle the take-off and landing, and when you get up there, s/he will give you some headings to fly, maybe an altitude or two to hit, and then take you back to the airport. \n\nYou get an incredible view of your area, you get to FLY A PLANE, and if you buy a pilot logbook (~$10 on amazon or at the flight school), you can have the instructor sign it and have actual time logged while flying a plane--which you can then use towards your license if you ever pursue it.\n\nEven if you have zero desire to actually become a pilot, it's an awesome experience. Gift certificates for Discovery Flights are my go-to for christmas/birthday presents for people that I really like, but don't know what to buy.\n\nEDIT: wow, this blew up. Thanks for my first (second, and third) plat!\n\nFor those commenting on the price, your mileage may vary when it comes to that, but in general, Discovery Flights are operated at a loss. For example, at my flight school, C172 time is $130 wet (fuel included), per hour, and instruction is like $55/hr. So $185/hr to fly. But discovery flights are less than half that.\n\nTaking a bit of a loss on the discovery allows them to possibly hook a student pilot who may burn ~$7k-11k in a 6 month period to become a pilot, so it's usually worth it for them.\n\nSome places may be more, but if you're in an area where they're very expensive, there's also likely multiple options--and one probably far less than the rest. You likely have some places with a few Cirrus and a Piper, and another place with a Cessna 172 and a 152 or something.",

            "I would say to conquer a major fear in your life.\n\nI grew up with major social anxiety and because of that, I was horrible at talking to people, which cycled back into said anxiety. It sucked, to say the least, to feel horribly alone and disconnected, yet bring terrified of putting myself out to anyone but the closest of close friends. \n\nThen, I made a decision that changed my life forever. I founded my high school's robotics team. As nerdy as that sounds, it truly made me break my social anxiety and even made me realize that... I was an extrovert?!?!! I was pushed by so many supportive mentor figures and friends in my life to break out of my social turtle shell. Because I was one of the founders and the elected president, I was required to talk to parents, teachers, sponsors, and many other people. I ran booths at STEM fairs and talked to huge crowds of people and ended up on the local news several times. \n\nThis shattered my social anxiety; after that much public speaking and personal interaction, I overcame that fear, and I grew so much because of it. Heck, I realized I was an extrovert! Me! A shut in dorky nerdy loner for 10 years!\n\nSo I would recommend facing a major source of fear in your life. You don't even need to fully conquer that fear; just do something that your fear would otherwise prevent! \n\nAfraid of heights? Try a skywalk or skydiving at least once.\n\nAfraid of public speech? Try giving a public talk at least once.\n\nI'm not saying that every fear can be overcome. It's mentally exhausting to fight fear; and sometimes it's not a war you can win. My case involved 4 years of fighting to overcome that social anxiety and I STILL DO HAVE SOME ANXIETY. Overcoming a fear will NOT be as easy as doing something once.

The size boggled my mind, but I bravely walked in to check it out.\nThe guy says, yup, show me your work ID (for local address) and you get a membership card. \n\nMe: how much does it cost? I only own $80 total till I get my first pay.\n\nHe (bemused, almost laughing): it's free. You don't pay anything.\n\nMe (after a brief recovery time from shock): so how many books am I allowed to take home? (Expecting that to be a catch - maybe I need to put down a security deposit for each book)\n\nHe (now positively enjoying himself): how many can you carry?\n\nThat day I took home 30+ books, just being greedy.\n\nAnd quickly called my dad to tell him about it. \n\nFor a guy who painstakingly would browse used books stores in small town India just to get his kids great books to read, he was suitably amazed. He was puzzled if that would kill the book-store business, because who'd buy if such free libraries existed?!?\n\nTill date I remember the gratitude I felt that day for being able to come here. And when Dad visited some years later, I would drop him off at a library on my way to work and he'd be lost in it all day.\n\nEDIT: wow, a few hours of sleep and this has blown up! Guess it resonates with a lot of you!\n\nThanks, y'all, for the plat, gold and silver! I'm humbled.\n\nTo address some of the comments:\n\n- yes, by 'take home' I meant 'borrowed, to return'\n\n- carrying those books home has a story too. The librarian saw my dilemma, and wanted to stick to his original 'how many can you carry' comment and would not allow me to discard any: so went of and got me two large bags made of cloth/canvas, like grocery bags. AND when I lugged all that on the train back to New Jersey that evening, I had to walk home from the train station (no car), a mile away. Normally not bad, but with those books was  tedious. A cop saw me, and gave me a lift home! He loved my story about the library too.\n\n- India today is slightly better, but as a kid in a small town, the only library I saw was at my school, where books were never allowed to be taken home. And there was this single shop where you subscribed to borrow some pulp fiction. The Asiatic Library in Bombay was big (seen when I visited my cousins), but it had a wait list, I think of 4 years (because they couldn't handle too many members) !!\n\n- I am always amazed at what all libraries offer. I took my parents for a a movie showing once, set up as a once-a-month thing for seniors, and they were shocked that it was free, AND they were giving cookies and stuff too, along with pleasant company!\n\n- my girls have learned to love the library as much, and probably have read more books than most kids at school. My daughter won an award for some accelerated reading, and, at age nine, gave a speech about the impact of libraries for her, and how much her dad and grandpa loved them.\n\n- Thank you, libraries and librarians!",

Mostly electronically motorized as getting out to open your gate is a HUGE risk.\n\n\u2022Having something we call burglar-doors. These are usually sliding metal door shaped gates that are in front of your door. Most of the old ones used to lock automatically when you closed them.\nThis is standard in almost every suburban house in South Africa.\n\n\u2022People choosing to live in luxury apartment, standard apartments, complexes or estates because it's a closed off gated community and therefore safer-ish. \n\n\u2022High walls and electrical fences EVERYWHERE.\n\n\u2022Locking the front door everytime you leave or enter a house.\n\n\u2022EVERY. SINGLE. WINDOW. HAS. WINDOW-GRILLS.\n\n\u2022If you choose to live on a property that \"stands-alone\" (is not part of a gated community.) Then getting a \"guard dog\" or even just a big pet dog is usually the next point of action.\n\n\u2022EVERY. SINGLE. HOUSE. Has movement detectors in every room that light up red when triggered. These detectors are connected to home-security systems. These security systems have arming and disarming buttons (you need a password.) There are panic 'EMERGENCY' buttons strategically placed ALL OVER the house.\n\nEVERY. HOUSE. HAS. A. PREINSTALLED. SECURITY. SYSTEM.\n\n\nGeneral examples:\n\n\u2022Checking whether you car is locked in a parking lot by pulling the door handle before going on your way.\n\n\u2022Adding an additional tracking alarm systems to your car, in case you get hijacked or its stolen.\n\n\u2022Checking behind you every few moments when walking anywhere. Never know when someone will sneak up behind you... (I think this is more learnt habit than people having many experiences like that. Better safe than sorry.)\n\n\u2022We wait for our gates to close behind us before driving into our garages/complexes. Only ever leaving enough room for the gate to close.\n\n\u2022Red traffic lights (we call them 'robots') dont mean jack past 9pm. You keep driving if you dont see any cars crossing. ESPECIALLY if you're a woman. It's an actual law that women can jump red lights late at night at empty intersections. You regard them as Stop streets for your own safety.",

Now, nobody, not even 7th century Anglo-Saxons, wants to go around trying to pronounce that dense forest of th's, so she was commonly known as St. Etheldreda, and later, linguistically lazier people called her St. Audrey.\n\nSt. Audrey was the patron saint of a town called Ely, and the folks of Ely held a fair every year in her name. One of the primary products on offer at these fairs was lace. \"St. Audrey's lace\" was said a few too many times, and got slurred down to \"tawdry lace.\" \n\nOver time, the lace fell out of favor. It was mainly made by peasant women, and thus viewed as cheap, and the Puritans looked down on lace garments of any kind as ostentatious. \"Tawdry\" then began to be used to describe other things that were cheap and ostentatious, and the modern definition of the word was born.\n\ntl;dr: \"Tawdry\" comes from the fact that \u00c6thelthryth is really hard to pronounce.",

I can expand on any of these as well! First of all, etymology facts:\n\n\n**\"Scuttlebutt\"** was first a nautical term for a cask (butt) of drinking water with a hole (scuttle) for drawing it out. The term came to mean \"rumor\" or \"gossip\" because sailors would gather to idly chat around the cask. It is the predecessor of the term \"watercooler talk\" for workplace gossip.\n\nBefore 1860, the word **\"pollution\"** commonly meant \"semen,\" specifically semen released somewhere other than during conjugal activities, or \"defilement\" or \"desecration.\" Also, the words \"seminal,\" \"disseminate,\" and \"seminary\" derive from the Latin \"semen.\"\n\n**\"Meteor\"** comes from the Greek met\u00e9\u014dron, literally meaning \"thing high up.\" In 15th c. English, \"meteor\" could refer to any atmospheric phenomena, which were differentiated by various classifications of meteors. Hence \"meteorology\" as the study of atmospheric conditions, rather than just meteors. Classifications included:\n\n- aerial meteors \u2013 notable winds and tornadoes and such\n\n- aqueous meteors \u2013 water-based atmospheric phenomena such as rain, snow, hail, dew, frost, and clouds\n\n- luminous meteors \u2013 auroras, rainbows, and other light-based phenomena\n\n- igneous meteors \u2013 fiery-looking phenomena such as lightning and shooting stars\n\nAround 1590, the English word began to take on the more specific, fiery extraterrestrial meaning we use today.\n\n**\"Ambivalence\"** was first a psychological term, literally meaning \"strength on both sides.\" Paul Eugen Bleuler, the psychologist who coined it in 1910, also coined the terms schizophrenia (\"a splitting of the mind\") and autism (from Greek autos, \"self\"). [More info here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/8p1x8q/ambivalence_was_first_a_psychological_term/)\n\n\n**\"Feisty\"** (\"spirited, lively\") arose in 1896. Before, feist meant \"small dog,\" a shortening of \"fysting curre\" (\"stinking cur\"), wherein fyst meant \"to break wind,\" supposedly conflated because ladies would blame their gas on their lapdogs. In sum, \"feisty\" = \"farty dog.\" \n\n**\"Alchemy\"** is from the Greek khemeioa, which was either from Khemia, a name for Egypt meaning \"land of black earth,\" or the Greek khymatos \"that which is poured out.\" It was often used as a scientific term until the 1600s when \"chemistry\" arose from it, leaving \"alchemy\" with its more mystical sense.\n\nThe word **\"tabby\"** came to refer to cats in the 1690s due to their fur pattern, which resembles a striped silk taffeta also called tabby, originally (via French) from the name of the Baghdad neighborhood Attabiy, where rich silks were made. The area was named after the Umayyad prince Attab.\n\n**\"Clone\"** as a term for the production of genetically identical individuals was coined in 1963 by J.B.S. Haldane. It was predated by the horticultural sense of \"clon\" or \"clone,\" the process whereby a new plant is created using cuttings from another. Both are from the Ancient Greek kl\u014dn, \"twig.\"\n\n**\"Jargon,\"** adopted from French in the 14th century, originally meant \"unintelligible talk, gibberish; chattering, jabbering.\" It wryly took on its current meaning, \"phraseology peculiar to a sect or profession,\" in the 1650s due to the fact that such speech was unintelligible to outsiders.\n\n**\"Moxie,\"** (general use from the 1930s) comes from the brand name of a bitter syrup first marketed as the medicine \"Moxie Nerve Food\" in 1876, then sold as a soft drink starting in 1884. The brand may be from a Native American Abenaki word for \"dark water,\" from Maine lake and river names.\n\n\n**And, finally, an entomological etymology!**\n\nThe praying mantis (Mantis religiosa) and other insects in the order Mantodea get their name from the Greek mantis, literally \"one who divines, a seer, prophet,\" which in turn is from mainesthai, \"be inspired.\"",
            "**Orange**\n\nThe word for the fruit came long before the word for the colour. We just called things which were the colour *orange*, yellow-red.\n\nAdditionally, William of Orange (William III of England) has nothing to do with either the colour or the fruit.",

            "The word oxymoron: the word oxymoron itself, appropriately enough, is an oxymoron. The oxy\u2013 part (the same as in words like oxygen, paroxysm and peroxide) comes from the Greek word for \u201csharp\u201d or \u201cacrid\u201d, oxys. The \u2013moron part (the same as in\u2014well, moron) comes from the Greek word for \u201cdull\u201d, moros. So an oxymoron is literally a \u201csharp-dull\u201d turn of phrase.",
            "The word *cue* (meaning a long stick used in billiards) comes from the French word *queue*, meaning 'tail'. The English word *queue* also comes from the French word. The Latin word *cauda*, from which *queue* ultimately derives, also brought us English *coda*, but that comes via Italian instead of French.\n\nThe word *cue* (meaning an indication that it's time for something to happen, or as a verb, to give such an indication) comes from the letter Q. It was written as an abbreviation for *quando* (Latin, 'when') on actors' partial copies of play scripts. To save on paper, your copy of the script wouldn't include every line\u2014just the ones right before your lines, marked with Q.

            "3yrd year Entomology Undergrad here, there are actually plenty of interesting bug facts! My favorite are parasitoid wasps and mind control, some parasitoid wasps can actually inject a toxin into a caterpillar to get it to defend its eggs from aphids (the wasps predator). The caterpillar previously wouldn\u2019t care if an aphid crawled on it, and now will flick them off. Another interesting parasitoid wasps fact is that some of them (Ichneumonid\u2019s especially) have such sensitive sensory structures on their feet (tarsus) that can detect a moving grub within a tree. And doctors are actually trying to figure out how to detect something so sensitive to apply it to internal human issues.\n\n\nHere is another interesting fact about flies: most insects have 4 wings, and in Diptera (flies) they have two reduced wings called halters instead of hind wings that help immensely with flight/balance/orientation. That\u2019s why flies are so hard to hit! Their halteres can detect the air movement and adjust to it quicker than you can hit it.\n\n\nWhat is really interesting is that not much about insects is known, they are such a prevalent species, even the most important evolutionary process in insects (flight) is not fully studied, there are 2 prominent theories about how insect wings developed! \n\n\nI can go on all day! \n",

From that, the Persian word *May* comes, meaning wine. \n\nIf we trace even further, the Proto-Indo-Iranian *Madu* comes frm the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European word *medu* or *medhu*, which means honey, intoxicating drink or sweet drink. \n\nFrom that PIE word *medu*, comes:\n\n\\- Greek: *methi* (drunkenness)\n\n\\- Germanic: *meduz*, from where the English word \"*mead*\": an alcoholic beverage that comes from fermentation of.....you guessed it....honey. In Dutch, it's still *medu*. In German its *met* meaning mead.\n\n\\- Celtic: in Cornish its *medh*, in Irish its mid, and Gaulish its *medu*, all meaning mead.\n\n\\- Balto-Slavic: *medus*, from where *medus* (Latvian) and *medus* (Lithuanian) in the Baltic branch, and miod (Polish), med (Czech, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian), and Mjod (Russian) in Slavic branch, all meaning Honey.\n\nnow here's the most interesting part:\n\n\\- Tocharian: *mit*, from where it got burrowed into Chinese.

Nowadays this term describes a person who is unpredictable and likely to do damage wherever they go.\n\nTerminology from old horse carriages is everywhere too:\n\n\"dashboard\" - There was literally a board in front of the carriage driver to protect him from mud and gravel that \"dashed\" up against it from the horses' hooves. Now we use the word to describe any surface covered in controls, including on computer screens.\n\n\"hold your horses\" - Self-explanatory, you hold the reins of the horses to slow them down.\n\nTerminology from old machines:\n\nto be \"keyed up\" or \"wound up\" - Referring to old clocks and clockwork machines that you sometimes had to wind up with a key.\n\n\"hanging up\" a phone - Old phones, you had to hang up the earpiece when you were done.\n\n\"fired up\" - Referring to steam engines, now people use it to refer to people being full of energy or starting up a piece of technology (whether it uses fire or not).\n\n\"upper case\" and \"lower case\" - The individual metal letters used in a printing press were kept in cases - smaller letters in the lower case so they were in easy reach, larger letters in the upper case because they weren't used as much.\n\n\"stereotype\" - This was a word used for identical copies of the same document, from the same printing press. Now we use it when we describe characteristics that we think are identical across whole social groups.\n\nThese facts are all from a previous comment I made in another etymology-related thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7hq4ua/what_terms_like_rewind_are_still_used_every_day/dqt79vi/",

He had such a knowledge of shitty memes he could even keep other loved memes from dying. The karma whore side of Reddit is a pathway many redditors consider to be.. unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his meme-ability.. which of course, he did.

I was thinking really hard and aware that I was being watched. \n\nI had this. Money on the counter, gum in your mouth. Money on the counter, gum in your mouth.

She said there's an amazing taco place down the road, we should go sometime. I misheard her, thinking she said \"you should go sometime\". I replied with \"I'll definitely check it out!\" I handed her a drink and she left very awkwardly. \n\nShe was back in the next day and, against all odds, I was able to clear up the misunderstanding and I wrote my number on her  Starbucks cup.\n\nWe went to that taco place for our first date and she was right, it was amazing.  \n\n3 years married and 2 kids later...

I apologized, she said it was ok and that the screen was already like that before.\n\nAlmost a year later she confessed that I actually broke her phone that day.

            "Not me, but my first door neighbors story. I didn't know their story untill one day another friend told me what happened, and she confirmed it. \n\nShe was at a party, and caught him looking at her every now and then, she kinda liked him so she decided to make the first move. She took a few shots for courage and went in. As time passed by she continued to drink while talking to him, and got pissed drunk, like not being able to walk drunk. He was a type of guy that didnt drink that much at all, and presumed she can drink a lot, but when she stood up from couch after few hours the alcohol swept her to the ground. So as a gentleman he offered to carry her home. Note that was when we were late teens, no car, no money. So he started pigy back her home, that was like 30-45mins walk, like normal sober walk. He managed to carry her on his back about 500meters from her home, and stoped to take a brake for a moment, his back hurt him AF, so he decided to carry her in his arms. A few steps away, and he notices very unpleasant smell, since he isnt from our \"parts\" and it was rural area, he asked barely conscious her what is that fucking stink.\n\nShe just mumbeled, I shat my pants, than proceeded to pass out in his arms. Only coming back to mumble, fuck sorry, and passing out again. So what guy does? He brings her home and lies her on floor, since he was afraid of messing up her bed or couch, and left home. BUT, few moments after he comes ,back, wakes her up and asks would she mind if he helped her shower, since she cant sleep 8h al shat up, mostly because its not hygenc, safe, and her whole house and everything would smell, she agreed, and after he bathe her she asked him to sleep in her bed, in case she needed him.\n\n\nSo one time I asked guy how the fuck did he got over that, he said they clicked at the first glance, and he just felt that he needs to take care of her because he took responsibility to bring her home all allright. And if she said no to bathing he would back off, but then wouldnt be with her, cuz shitting yourself while dead drunk is still understandable, but sleeping whole day like that would be too nasty. He laid besides her untill she fell asleep, and then watched TV untill she woke up. \n\n\nThey were inseparable since then. Since that first \"date\" I have never seen them apart. It's been almost 15yrs since then, and just recently they got beautifull little daughter.",
            "We drank a lot on our second date, Ubered home. Next day went back to get his car, and it wasn't there. He was so devastated. He just bought it recently and it was stolen. We filed a police report. Took forever and just generally sucked. We walked to his friend's house nearby, and there was his car, perfectly un-stolen. He drank so much he forgot he moved it before our date. Now, once in a while when we're trying to find our car in the grocery store parking lot or wherever, one of us will say \"It's stolen. Call the police.\"",

            "I didn\u2019t really do it but I thought he would be weirded out anyways. Very first time he stayed at my house (after about three hours of my two male roommates trying to make him uncomfortable), we went to bed and he put his contacts in two shot glasses of water because he had no case with him. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a dumb thing to do. I\u2019ve never worn them. Maybe we were drinking and that seemed like a good idea? Anyways... he had never had a pet and was kind of weirded out by my cat standing beside him and yell-meowing at him all night (\u201cIs that normal? Is he mad at me or something?\u201d). Woke up the next day to find out the cat drank all the water from the shot glasses, contacts included. I had to help him home because he is seriously blind without them. He still wanted to see me again even though the night was weird, and the cat became his best friend, despite some initial skepticism on both their parts.\n\nEdit: I just asked him why we put his contacts in water and he said it was contact solution from one of my roommates who had contacts but no spare case for him to borrow so we used the shot glasses. Makes so much more sense. And Chuki was fine after drinking the solution, though we did call the vet. Totally forgot that part. Well, it was 17 years ago...",

            "I can tell you for him. We were leaving his new apartment. Keep in mind we\u2019ve been dating for a short amount of time. We haven\u2019t been through a lot of firsts yet. His apartment was on the back of the building so we had to walk through a small passage to get to the other side in order to leave. Imagine this passage is slightly shadowed but the light shoots through it so it creates this romantic silhouette.  As we left his apartment and walked into this passage area he grabs my hand and pulls me towards himself  (I\u2019m thinking awe he is going to put my hand around his waist, how romantic!), locks my hand on his butt and loudly farts. It was a very brave move for a new couple. \n\nWe\u2019ve been married for 13 years now.",

            "I made myself a burger for dinner before heading over to her place to hang out. Unfortunately I'm not the best cook and left a little too much pink in that burger. While we were at her house I bet her I could fit through the doggy door and crawled right through. Then she immediately closed it behind me and we raced to the front door, she won and she locked it. Now at this exact moment my bowels decided they had enough of that burger from earlier and I felt my stomach cramp. Luckily I held it all in and ran back to the back door with my cheeks clenched and starting knocking desperately in the door. She was laughing at first but when she saw my face go suddenly serious and I said very calmly \"I need you to open the door.... Now please.\" She unlocked the door and asked if I was okay, I told her to stay downstairs and turn the TV up loud. She agreed but was very confused. So I ran upstairs and then had one of the most violent shits of my whole life. I thought the worst was behind me until I went to wipe.... And of course no TP. So she took my instructions really well and when I yelled to her, texted her, and called her I got no answer. After probably like 10 missed calls she finally answered and I asked her to bring me some TP and leave outside the door and try not to breathe on the way upstairs. She was great about it and immediately started making fun of me when I came back downstairs. Now quite a few years later a couple kids and cat, she's still making fun of me.",
            "We were taking a shower together and she was soaping up while I was under the hot water rinsing off and she slipped and instead of grabbing/helping her I pulled away, thinking for some reason that I\u2019d already rinsed off and didn\u2019t want to get soapy. Thank god she caught herself on the shower curtain and didn\u2019t get hurt. She was, uh, not happy. My explanation of my faulty thinking didn\u2019t help at all, either. We laugh about it now but it took some serious smoothing over at the time.",
            "I know what my husband would say, because I still tease him to this day.\n\nWe had been dating for two weeks and were spooning on his futon, watching a movie. Out of nowhere he says, \"I'm really sorry, I can't hold it in anymore.\" And rips a HUGE fart. \n\nMy husband was a very clean, tight knit, prudish kind of guy, so I couldn't help but let out the biggest laugh while he turned about as red as his beard.",
            "Little late to the party but here's my story: when we had only been dating a month or so my then boyfriend went to pick me up (I assume) and accidentally threw my head through the ceiling and gave me a concussion. He's 6'8\" and just really misjudged the distance.

            "It wasn't until after we were married that my wife told me that I almost didn't get a second date because I talked waaaaaaaaaaaay too much during the movie. I don't really remember it but apparently I was leaning over every 30 seconds or so to tell her what I was thinking. Also, \"Valkyrie\", with Tom Cruise probably wasn't that great of a date movie, but it all worked out in the end.\n\nETA: Please forgive me my movie-talking sins, everybody.

She also stopped me from pulling the rock out of my kneecap with my trusty leatherman which turned out to be the correct decision.

My boyfriend (now husband of 12 years) says he is going to go rent some movies from blockbuster and come back so we can just chill for the weekend while I'm resting.  Blockbuster was a 5 minute drive from our apartment.  An hour goes by and he's not back. I call his cell phone and he doesn't answer.  Another hour goes by and I call again, no answer.  Two more hours go by, I'm blowing up his cell phone and terrified that he got in an accident and I have no way of going out to look for him.  An hour later (5 hours after he left) he calls me and says he's on his way home.  He went to a friend's house to help him rebuild the engine in his car.  It took a long a long time for me to not be pissed at him. And I still get mad thinking about it.",

I went to a party at a coworker's friends house for 4th of July... I proceed to drink like it's the end of the world...

Obviously the next day it was gone and he spent hours driving around Grimsby trying to find the address and asked a guy in a house if there was a woman named ***** living there. He said yes, so my grandad said he was taking her out on a date but it turns out he got the wrong house and she was this guys wife - and this guy wasn't happy until my grandad explained he's got the wrong house (hopefully).

            "I used to write poems and share them with my girlfriend when we were dating. I would share them with her quite frequently, even though she didn\u2019t care much for poetry. (She always gave an honest opinion about the ones she liked, and critique on the ones she didn\u2019t.)\n\nI wrote a few about her, and ended up sharing them with her, which she enjoyed. Absent-minded me thought to memorize one of them in particular (a love poem, if you will) and use it as the lead-up to my secretly orchestrated proposal. \n\nThe day comes, and I convince her to take her siblings with us to a park that we would visit on certain weekends when the weather was nice. (If it was just us, she would have suspected something was up.) I walked her down the bridge that crossed over the train tracks and overlooked the water, recited the entirety of the poem with as much of a dramatic, lover-like tone as I could muster, and handed her a silver box that contained a heart-shaped key to a locket that the engagement ring was locked on, (it\u2019s one of those bridges with a fence where lovers put locks on) and finally..........*dramatic drumroll* carefully removed the ring (being sure not to drop it into the water 30 feet below) and popped the question, to which she said yes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after she regained the ability to breathe and stopped crying her eyes out that she reminded me that I had already shared that poem with her a few weeks earlier, but it was lovely anyway.\n\nIt may not have made that much of a difference to her since she was clearly blown away by the intricate planning and secrecy of the whole ordeal, but I died inside when the paramount moment of the plan was foiled by my loose lips. \n\nNot as much of a dumb moment as it was a slip up in sharing something too soon. We\u2019ve been married for over a year and are expecting our first child in March.",

            "Plain old depression. Our relationship had a few ups and downs before I finally got treatment recently, over a decade later. She was so good to me, and my first girlfriend. I thought that surely she\u2019d eventually see what a loser I was and dump me. So eventually once my self esteem got particularly low I tried to brace for it, got distant, and waited for it. It never came. Instead, she was worried about me, and did her best to comfort me. She gave me space but was always nearby. \n\nMoved off to college together, in a new town with no friends, and I hit another wall like that again. I couldn\u2019t even make a single friend there, and it was surely only a matter of time before she ditched me. Well, she didn\u2019t, and we bailed from that place shortly afterwards to be closer to our families while finishing up our schooling. \n\nI didn\u2019t deserve it, or at least I don\u2019t think so. Maybe most of you reading this don\u2019t either. Why would someone stick through that for someone without being forcefully tied down like in a marriage? Well, she thought I was worth caring for. That\u2019s the only way I can really put it. She saw something in me that I didn\u2019t for a long, long time. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the small things and the good moments that she saw, that I wasn\u2019t garbage all the way through. One of my top comments is about a time that I gave her the boots off my feet for a science lab (closed toe shoes required), because we lived off campus and she wouldn\u2019t make it back in time. I walked around in the rain with socks without a second thought. \n\nMore recently I held things together while she went through a rough pregnancy and emergency c section at 29 weeks, and over two months in the NICU. I have my moments at being a rock, I guess. I want to be like that all the time. With treatment now, I think I almost can be. She makes me feel like we\u2019re unstoppable together.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a house in a safe area now, I\u2019m almost done with my bachelor\u2019s, and we have a beautiful baby girl. Somehow my wife saw the potential, and I\u2019ll be forever grateful for it.",

I was glad I stayed calm but hotel staff was running out of the building the lobby was a shit show for about twenty minutes. From my point of view the locals seemed scared it was there home and livelihood... I was on an island 2,395 miles away from home so if I was gonna die at least there was nice weather. My friend who goes to college on the island said campus was an absolute shit show. ",

            "Well, I don't live in Hawaii, but as someone who's planned for some of this stuff, I'd caution against just resigning yourself to die. Depending on a lot of different factors, you could easily survive. A woman survived Hiroshima *300 meters* from the hypocenter of the blast because she was in a sturdy building. The man sitting on the steps outside became a shadow on the pavement.\n\nThe typical yield you can expect to hit a countervalue target like a city is below 1 megaton. Probably closer to the range of 150 to 300 kilotons. If you don't live downtown (the likely center of target), and are at least 2 miles from the hypocenter, then you stand at least a 50% chance of surviving, which goes up exponentially if you take even basic steps to survive, like hiding in a windowless room.\n\nThere are so many different factors to consider. Is the weapon set for ground detonation or airburst? If airburst, what altitude? What direction is the wind blowing? Fission vs Fusion ratio, local geography, and proximity, and so many others. \n\nPoint is, don't give up, you can make it. ",

            "I was in the living room changing my 2 month old sons diaper. My wife was in the bedroom sleeping in. I hear the alarm go off on my phone a couple feet away and just think \"oh it's just one of those amber alerts\" and go back to changing his diaper. A second later my wife comes running out of the bedroom screaming that we were going to die. I kind of froze up, all I could think was how helpless I felt and how I couldn't do anything to save my newborn son. My wife was running around the house grabbing diapers and formula for the baby and I was just slowly finishing changing his diaper because I just couldn't imagine that something like this could happen.\n\nAfter about 2-3 minutes I sort of snapped back to reality and focused only on getting my son and wife to some sort of safety. I live in a relatively small beach house with very thin walls so I knew it wouldn't do anything but I told my wife we would be safest in the bathroom in the middle of our house. It really wasn't an impulse decision but throughout the whole thing I didn't think to even call or text any of my family on the mainland. If you had asked me what I would do if put in this situation I would say I would call my parents and tell them I love them but I didn't even think of that. I just thought about how much I love my wife and son and how sad I was that I wouldn't be able to see who he would become when he grows up. This has really given me a completely different perspective on life and makes me sad that I didn't even think to say goodbye to my family back home.\n\nTL;DR: I didn't think to call anyone back home and could only think about my wife and newborn son.",
            "In the chaos of figuring out where to seek shelter, we ended up deciding to go to the hospital that my wife works at (she's a nurse), figuring we could maybe help out with the flood of people that would be coming to the hospital with injuries.  We have about 20 minutes from the time an alert is received until the missile hits.  We were up against that limit when I pulled into a parking spot I found on the street.  My wife grabbed my son and ran for the hospital.  I grabbed some change and started paying the parking meter.  My wife turned back and yelled \"What are you doing?!?!\".  I yelled back \"We have to pay the meter - even if the world is going to end, we're not savages!!\".  We didn't get a parking ticket, so no regrets.",

Once we got there, we decided that we really didn't want to die in concrete cave surrounded by people we really didn't like, so we just kept driving to the other side of the property and hung out in the back of a big-ass valley for a few hours.\n\nSo, I guess the impulsive thing I did was purposely avoid shelter and instead go somewhere beautiful?",

After digesting the stories of my friends and family, I realized that if my children had been at school, or away with their mom, or if we had been driving in the middle of Maui somewhere, I'm pretty sure I would have absolutely lost my shit.\n\nI woke my two young girls and told them we were making a fort in my walk-in closet (the only room with no windows).  From there it was a surreal 10 minutes where I grabbed everything I could think of that would be helpful, water, juice, granola bars, blankets, shoes (broken glass), tablets for the kids (entertainment).  At one point I mentally decided I needed to stop gathering items from rooms with glass windows, and retreat into the closet.  At that point I just put on my game face with the girls, and furiously tried to find out what I could with my phone.  I exchanged a few texts with loved ones and took a call from my ex (making sure I had heard).  \n\nI realize now that I was spared a lot of mental trauma because I had my family with me, I was doing the best I could for them, and basically, I didn\u2019t have to make a lot of hard decisions.  I read a lot about the anguish of separated family, about those at soccer games, shopping at farmers markets, and those who had no idea what to do with those who they needed to protect, and those who they wanted to but couldn\u2019t contact.  I\u2019m glad my girls and I were spared the visuals of the panic.\n\nLater I went to a sunset party which had a newfound vigor as friends embraced each other a bit harder and half-joked, \u201cI\u2019m glad you are alive\u201d.\n",

The sirens started going off and I sat there holding my two month old baby crying thinking we were going to die and I had no way to protect him. \n\nGot the false alarm message and husband took the baby back out to the living room while I cried for a little while longer in the bathroom. \n\nSo no major impulse decision, just a what the fuck do I do and COOL the best option I can think of in this moment is to sit in the fucking bathroom. \n\nEdit: I live near Pearl Harbor, i think the sirens I heard were coming from there.

We had the whole duty chain of command in the reactor control room and they told us they were gonna evacuate all unnecessary personnel. We emergency closed the shielded volume of the reactor compartment so that we could get everyone off of the sub and into a floating support vessel docked near the ship. In hindsight, we should've just got all of the sailors into the reactor compartment and dogged the hatch. We'd have a pretty strong pressure barrier and it has probably the best shield for a nuclear blast in the closest vicinity. It's sufficient to keep the crew from getting exposed to excessive amounts of radiation while the reactor is critical. Shields work both ways so probably best to hug the shutdown reactor as opposed to getting vaporized topside. ",

So I sat up in bed, took a huge rip off my dab pen and hopped in the car to make my way down the mountain into town on the Big Island.\n\nAbout a mile down the road my podcast stopped playing and my phone started blaring. I picked it up and read the message on the screen \"Incoming missile. Take shelter immeaditly. This is not a drill\". I rubbed my eyes and I couldn't believe the words that I was reading. I read them again and again before I pulled over and as I was making a u-turn I noticed everyone in their cars looking up from their phones with looks of horror on their faces. I'll probably never forget that. When I got in the door I called my ex girlfriend who was working at the Four Seasons where she said people were losing their shit. I told her I loved her and how sorry I was for everything. She asked if her roomates could come to my house if they needed and I said of course.

Didn't sleep all night long because I missed that feeling so much. I didn't want to waste it by closing my eyes and passing out. I know we arn't gonna get back together.

He landed us back at the airport, where it seemed like no one else had any more information. We missed the waterfall, but at least we have a good story to tell!\n\n",

I called my Dad next and he answered and I read him the message and told him I was scared and that I loved him. He said he'd research what was happening. I said ok I love you I have to call Shosh (my girlfriend who lives down the street). She answered immediately and was like I'll be there in two minutes.  \n\nWhen she got here, there was a moment where we were standing in our parking lot, I'm holding her hand and our friends are standing next to us. We were all bewildered, confused and scared. All I can see in my one friend pressing a kiss into his girlfriend's hair and head and us joking laughing well if this is it you guys are the best.   We lived in the middle of a small town, there was no where to go. Then we found out we weren't going to die and moved on with our day. But for those few minutes, it was like a level of calm panic that I can't really describe. Not exciting but that's my story. ",

            "I Got injured in a car accident (rear ended). Lost my business and my wife of 19 years eventually left for another man, leaving behind a 17 year old daughter and 2 year old son.\n\nNo job, No car, No money. 2 kids and $2k a month in rent coming due.\n\nTwo days after she left I took my real estate license test.  I PASSED!  I had planned to surprise her but had hid that I was studying in case I failed.  Either way it wasn't enough and I ended up taking a job at Amazon.  I worked a graveyard shift while my daughter stayed home with my son.  I also did open houses on the weekend in hopes someone would walk in unrepresented...\n\nIt still wasn't enough so I signed up to drive Uber and lift.  I had been able to pick up a decent vehicle from a family member for cheap and I was in business.  I switched my graveyard shift to a day shift and started driving through the nights.  The money was alright but I realized I could make a little more if I switched from Amazon to another large company in the area, so I did.  I did that for about a year\n\nThings we're ok, I was making good money and then Coldwell Banker fired me.  I didn't think Coldwell fired anyone as long as they were paying their dues.  I had never sold a house so all it meant was I needed to switch to another broker.  Turns out that was a blessing in disguise. \n\nA friend called on my way to sign with Keller Williams and convinced me to sign with a temp agency.  I was skeptical but what did I have to lose?  The first and second day I was placed with Toll Brothers.  It was alright and I could see myself doing that.  On the third day I was sent to a local developer and my world was changed.  \n\nThe broker of record and the local developer took me under their wing.  After a few months they hired me away from my temp broker, gave me a salary and commissions and provided me with an opportunity to change my kids lives forever.  I was able to go from working 4 jobs to just one and I have learned more about myself than I could have ever imagined possible.\n\nIt's been three and a half long years but I wouldn't change a thing if I could.",
            "When I was a teenager I was homeless. A lot of places wouldn't hire me because I had no experience or interview clothes. I went to the board of education and begged the HR lady to give me a chance at any job. I told her I'd scrub the school with a toothbrush if they paid me. \n\nThey made me a general sub for clerical. I took a call for one of the \"bad neighborhood\" schools that some others turned down. Walked across town to get there every day do I had to start walking at 4:30 am to be on time. I wore dress clothes from a church mission that were way too big but I did my best. \n\nAfter four months they gave me a long-term position. Then a permanent one with benefits. I saved up enough for an apartment (finding a landlord okay with renting to an 18 year old homeless girl was hard) and started college. \n\nI haven't been homeless a day since in the last 15 years.

Never been to Denver, didn't know anyone there but weed was starting to be legal and I didn't want to miss out. I detoxed on the bus going from Florida to Colorado. Do not recommend. I got lucky and ended up sitting next to a guy that was a grower and needed help in his garden. I didn't know it at the time but on the Greyhound he said I had an 8 hour job interview. Got to Denver and he really helped me get established. Within 2 months I was sleeping on his couch and learning how to grow.

So what did I do?  Found an unbelievably dirty crappy crawl-space basement apartment.  Applied for Welfare.  Stopped, drinking and smoking, and anything else unhealthy.  Got a gym membership and went 4 hours a day.  Jogged 5 miles every morning (weather permitting).  Enrolled in an adult high school.  Ignored everyone and everything that would be a distraction.  Got my High School diploma with honours in 2 years.  Applied for university.  Got in.  Moved to a different city and spent 4 years getting my BA Hon in Philosophy (because I like to think and solve problems).  Applied to a graduate program, and spent the next 10 years getting my MA and my PhD.  Then spent the next several years as a professor making good money and having lots of fun.  Won\u2019t say how things are going now because I got cursed with poor health etc., and so am no longer working.

            "Had to move around a lot as a child, went to 4 different primary schools (UK) due to my dads job. Was always a hard-working and competitive student. Landed into my final primary school in year 5 (around 9/10 years old) and being the new kid alongside wanting to do well in studies led to me getting bullied. It was awful, people had always been so supportive of my good grades and ability in the past, why were these people different? I tried to keep to myself but they always knew how to find you, and people who I thought were my friends were actually instigating things to harm me. Went to high school with a couple of guys who I thought were my friends, decided to re-invent myself and became a little shit in a hope that I wouldn't get bullied anymore. Stopped caring about grades and paying attention in class. Eventually led to me bunking off school in the middle of the school day to go and play games in the town centre. Got caught by the police on the way in and they rang my mum who didn't believe them (as had always been so good before) and went ape shit at me. She made me move school (again) and then I walked this line of doing the minimum I needed to pass to go to college and goofing off to impress my friends and not get bullied (which did work).\n\nEventually I went to uni and graduated from graphic design in 2009, during the recession, managed to do a few odds and ends here and there and eventually landed a full-time design job in 2011 which paid peanuts (because they could). In-house job, not much scope for promotion, very small team. Had dreams of working for a gaming developer like Valve or Rockstar, but never did anything in my free time to pursue this. \n\nRealised at about age 24/25 that it wasn't right for me to lack any passion about my work. I had my hobbies which I enjoyed, but I felt very unfulfilled day-to-day. Decided to go back to the drawing board and figure out what I wanted to do (work with people, something people facing, something more science based, something more mentally stimulating). Eventually clicked into medicine, always been interested watching TV shows and docu-series on it. I knew I was smart enough to do medicine, but was worried my past (no A-levels, a 2.2 degree) would hold me back (which it did-ish). \n\nFound out there was a couple of places I could apply. A hard entrance exam (for someone from a non-science background) was an obstacle (the GAMSAT) and I applied the first time without success whilst staying at my design job. At the same time I had started volunteering at my local hospital and picked up a part-time job as a support worker for an adult with learning disabilities. Unfortunately I wasn't successful, but I knew this was something I wanted to do. I had become passionate about wanting to get in. So I left my design job to become a full-time Healthcare Assistant at my local hospital. It was a baptism of fire and I nearly walked away early on, but I'm glad I stuck it out as I learnt an incredible amount from just doing that job, we do a lot more than wash patients and wipe bums!\n\nMy second application, whilst better on the entrance exam, also fell short. Unfortunately my 2.2 degree was really limiting my options and making it more difficult to get into med school. I decided to do a Masters degree to open up some extra options and hopefully make it easier. So I did a full-time Masters degree, alongside working practically full-time as a HCA, alongside my part-time support worker job. My work were really supportive and gave me fixed hours so I could do uni stuff Mon-Thurs and work Fri-Sun (14.5hr shifts, do not miss them!). Fortunately the Masters was pretty straight forward and varied enough to keep me interested and I managed to write my dissertation on one of my other passions which is Esports.\n\nOnce I finished my masters I applied again. I managed to just scrape in on the entrance exam score for the GAMSAT and did alright at the UKCAT and managed to land 4/4 interviews. I was over the moon and felt pretty confident at least one of the unis would give me an offer. Eventually after 1 rejection and 3 waiting list places (and eventually another rejection) I received an offer to study medicine. 3-4 years of hard work and experience had paid off and I was on my way to becoming a Doctor. I cried with happiness in the toilets at work when I received my offer.\n\nI'm in my final year of med school now. I've managed to pass all my exams first time and whilst I'm not going to graduate with honors or anything like that, I'm pleased that I've managed to find something I'm passionate about and that I am fulfilling my academic potential. I was lucky to have supportive friends and family and to not be tied down to a mortgage or kids as I would have found it even more difficult. Sorry for the long post!\n\nTL:DR - got bullied as a kid, disregarded my schooling as a result, landed in a career I didn't enjoy, decided to apply and managed to get into med school",

            "I won't say I \"turned my life around\" but this is my story:\n\nI had a rather eventful childhood which ultimately led to me living on my own at 17.  I worked 60 hours/week including an overnight shift at a grocery store stocking shelves while I got an associates degree and then only 40 hours/week while I got my bachelors.  I got a job straight after college and a year after that, I was pretty burnt out and depressed and angry and basically an overall mess.  I was smoking weed and drinking a lot.\n\nI had a degree in accounting and was going to take the CPA exam.  The thing is that I didn't want to study.  I would come home after work, not study and then be angry with myself that I wasn't studying.  I felt stuck because I wasn't making any progress but wasn't doing anything to make progress.  This went on for about a year:  Not study--->Not enjoy my time because I felt like I should be studying--->Not make progress either--->Be unhappy.\n\nFinally, I realized I had 2 options:\n\n- I could study.  It would really suck because it was take me a year of studying daily and I was still exhausted from my college experience.  But, then I could accomplish this, make more money, earn more respect, get more promotions and move onto something else.\n\n- I could not study.  I wouldn't have to spend a year of my life studying for something I didn't know if I could accomplish.  I would make an acceptable amount of money but I couldn't complain when I lost out on promotions.  I couldn't complain if I didn't earn the respect.  Life would be fine, it's not like I would be a piece of shit for not becoming a CPA... I just couldn't complain when I didn't receive certain things.  Life would be fine though.\n\n**Whatever I choose is fine but I have to live with the outcome.**\n\nI do this now every time I make a choice.  If I don't want to go to the gym, that's fine.  I just can't complain when my body doesn't look the way I want it to look.  I can't complain when a fit guy gets more attention from women.  I can't complain when I'm not healthier and I'm more likely to deal with health issues.  Again, it's 100% okay not to be at the gym, I just can't complain.  Sometimes, I don't go but I don't feel guilty anymore because I made the choice not to good - I don't beat myself up because I made the choice after considering the consequence.   Usually, this thought process leads to me to go.\n\nIf you don't want to go to college or learn a skill, that's fine.  Plenty of high quality people are uneducated or earning a low wage.  Not going doesn't make you bad person.  But don't complain when you're less likely to earn a higher wage.\n\nIf you don't want to stop smoking weed, that's fine.  Plenty of nice people smoke weed.  But don't complain when you get nothing accomplished because you're stoned all the time.\n\nAs long as you're not hurting someone else, WHATEVER YOU WANT IS FINE as long as you can live with the outcome.  I don't know what bad choices you're making but if you keep making them, don't complain when you hate your life enough to have to post \"How did you turn your life around?\"\n\nPeople always criticize this advice because it's basically just decide who you're going to be but I'm living proof that it's possible.  I was going to do something bad to myself until I figured out how to do this.  \n\nNobody is saying you need to have a certain relationship, live a certain lifestyle, eat a certain way, drink a certain way, have a certain job... Whatever choice you make is fine.  As long as you're okay with the outcome.\n\nAction X leads to outcome Y.  You know what will happen if you continue to take action X so live with Y.",

            "Quit my job.  In 2010 my job moved to a different city, and I had to follow because the money was good (or so I thought).  12-hr swing shifts with 90 minute ride each way.  Town was a total shit hole, rents were crazy expensive if you didn't want to live in the 'hood.  Ended up working for net-zero after bills and expenses, child support, living in an apartment with no furniture.  After two years I had enough.  Learned to day trade, put my savings into it, doubled it (in a bull market everyone's a genius).  Now that my kids are out of college, my bills are absurdly low.  Learned to live cheap.  Inherited a house, sold it.  Now my investments are under professional management, drove a fork lift for a while, cool gig.  \n\nI know people don't like to hear this, but money is important.  If your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is 100%, it doesn't matter if you're earning $500k or working in the food court, you're still broke.  People would say \"I wish I had those problems\", but you really don't.  But if you're earning $5k a month ($60k/yr before tax) and your bills are only $1k a month, you're doing better than the $500k guy who is struggling to afford his lavish house and unnecessary cars.  He looks like a baller, but trust me, he's losing sleep.  If that job goes ka-flooey, he's fucked.  \n\nPresently, I could throw a dart at the map and go live there, provided it's a second-tier city with low taxes.  Learn to cook, don't buy extravagant cars, I haven't gone on vacation in five years (because I'm on permanent vacation).  All that shit adds up, and if I spend like a fool I'll have to go back to working somewhere to earn money to pay on shit I don't care to own, more importantly being chained to a clock and selling my remaining hours, which are finite.  Or, one morning I can just get up and call the realtor and put my place on the market and drive to Idaho, or Salt Lake, or Santa Fe, and look for something else.  Thats the best happiness I ever found,, being unchained from any responsibilities and having realistic expectations for basic comforts.  \n\nMy ex-wife and her current husband spend way over $100k a year trying to afford a (admittedly nice) house, and they're fucking miserable, always cash broke but trying to afford more shit, like expensive vacations, bird baths and little windmills for the yard, so they can brag to their co-workers how well they're doing.  Then collapse on the couch and wait for the next workday, and do it all over again in jobs they hate, 270 days a year.   He's still gonna be paying on that house til he's 80.  Fuck that.  One of the best things that ever happened to me was when my life turned to shit.  \n\n*The only true freedom that you find is when you realize and come to terms with the fact that you are completely and unapologetically fucked.

I couldn\u2019t find a job my car insurance ran out. I couldn\u2019t drive the car so I rode my bike from my dads house to the pizza place looking for help down the road. Humiliating.  Had to ride the bike home in the dark in winter. When the bar attached to the shop was raided by drug enforcement they came in through the pizza place (pizza and bar were the same owner) agents told me they knew who I was I could go. As the bartender was arrested I started bartending  that night. Winter on cape cod so only locals. Tips in coins. I brought in a PlayStation hooked it up to large screen projection tv. Made mix tapes to get music in. It got popular. Nights with fights i would clean blood up off the walls. I started going to the library to use the computer they had. Bought computer magazines and read them on my shifts highlighting words I didn\u2019t understand to look up later. Owner would tease me. Asking me if I was gonna be some kind of computer superhero. I drove my uninsured car to Boston at night on my days off to use my friends computers at their design company they started. I\u2019d practice photoshop and desktop publishing software until I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open and sleep under the desk. Left when they came in. A Boston friend told me they needed help in her art dept. coached and encouraged me to apply. Told me the salary to ask for. In the interview I wore old Sunday clothes to pass for business.

Moved in with friends in the back bay and slept on their sofa. I got a call from a good friend in NYC looking for photoshop help. He told me the company could use me and kept the name a secret. I took the bus to Manhattan and got the job. It was Nickelodeon. I stayed with my friend in Brooklyn and found I didn\u2019t like the stress of the show. I liked the IT guy they had and loved working on my Mac. He told me he had a friend looking for Mac support entry level people. I interviewed and got the job. Ad agency. Worked hard.

            "Might be too late, but guys really enjoy *side by side* time. \n\nA lot of people have already brought this up, so I'm really just putting a name on it. It took awhile for my wife to figure it out, but side by side time is when you are engaged in an activity with someone else, but not necessarily talking to them. You bond through the shared experience of the activity, not by talking to each other. \n\nThis is why so many guys reminisce about shared experiences and tell stories about things they did together. I also happen to think that side by side time is why guys like games so much. I game online with my good friends frequently, and we rarely get past \"how are you\" in terms of personal chat, but we all love it. Same goes for watching sports, playing boardgames, other hobbies and stuff. \n\n**So, if you really want to impress your husband/boyfriend**, intentionally have side by side time with him. Pick an activity or hobby that he enjoys and just do it with him. Don't ask him if he's enjoying himself, or what he's thinking, if you have to, literally just sit next to him on the couch and watch the game with him. If he's comfortable with it, quietly watch him build his computer, or ask him how it works. Keep the conversation about the activity. Avoid asking him how he's doing unless he brings it up. Literally just be there with him. Sit and be there while he cleans his gun, or just read a book in the same room he's reading in. \n\n(**total side note: especially for women who are married to an introvert:** If you really want to have a conversation, ask your husband/boyfriend about something they're interested in or enjoy. Point being, guys, and introverts in general, find it 10x easier to talk about something rather than themselves. Ask a guy how his day is: \"Fine.\" Ask a guy to explain something about his favorite hobby: You will be there for hours.)\n\nThis is a generalization, but I think there's some truth in it, I think women tend to bond through verbal communication, and they get worried/nervous to just *be* there with their partner, side by side, because they aren't actually *doing anything*. But guys see that as bonding and caring. \n\nEDIT: Thank you for the gold, kind person. I'm glad some of you found it useful :)",

Is an ice cream sandwich a sandwich?\n\nEveryone has a different sandwich opinion and so far everyone I\u2019ve asked gets super defensive once you cross their sandwich line. Good icebreaker.\n\n**EDIT:** I want to clarify: I don't necessarily believe the three sandwich options above to be true. I think I have a logical/practical split on this: you can justify almost anything as being a sandwich logically, but if a friend says \"come on over I'm gonna make sandwiches so come hungry\" and I show up and it's a bunch of tacos I'd be... confused, maybe. I think we all develop our sandwich rules by experience, but questions like these make us question why. Generally I think there aren't any rules to it, but breaking down our perceived rules can be a fun thought exercise/conversation.\n\nAs for me, if I'm thinking logically: it's yes/no/yes. Hot dog follows the rule of subs, pizza's bread isn't baked yet at time of assembly, and ice cream sandwiches have sandwich in the name. \n\nIf i'm going by instinct/experience, it's no/no/no. If you're getting a hot dog, we have a word for that. It's \"hot dog\". Same with pizza, also apply baking rules above. If I showed up somewhere and ordered a sandwich and got an ice cream sandwich I'd be 1.) surprised and 2.) probably hungry/upset later. The surprise means I'm lying to myself if I call it a valid sandwich option.\n\nAlso, cereal/soup people: I don't eat (drink?) cereal because I'm a monster I guess, but I'd say it's cereal until soggy, then it's soup. I'd describe the mixture at the end as \"soupy\" anyway.",

It is absolutely not a trivial injury. This one annoys me a lot, because it carries over into real life. Ever hear someone in the aftermath of a police shooting asking, \"Why couldn't they have just 'winged' him and aimed for the arms or the legs?\" which demonstrates both an extreme overestimation of how accurate guns are, especially during a tense confrontation, and a complete misunderstanding of how dangerous those injuries are.\n\nOn a more mundane note, the fact that when people brush their teeth in movies and TV, they always spit *and never fucking rinse afterwards*.

            "When my daughter was 3 and starting to talk clearer was talking to someone and concerned I walked into the bedroom and no one was there. Initially I thought it was her playing with her toys. Days later the same scenario but this time I asked who she was talking yo and she replied \u201cyour grandma\u201d, I thought she meant my mom who had recently passed so I showed a pic of her and asked is this her? \u201cNo your grandma\u201d was the reply. I found a picture of my grandma and she with a big smile said \u201cyes, her\u201d. I was shocked since I don't have pictures of my grandma displayed and she died 1991 and my daughter born 2015.\n\nEdit: fixed a word",

There was two of them but the're dead now\"\n\nIt so happened that when I was 13 or 14 my girlfriend at the time got pregnant. There was an abortion.

There was something sacred about this pool. It has always been a lasting memory for me. I met someone when I was 16, and we stayed friends and when we were 18 we talked about reincarnation, and he told me the exact same story only from the brothers perspective. I had never told him about my memory. Still freaks me out to this day.",
            "When my daughter was about 3 years old she would say the word \"Specs\" all the time...like constantly. I'm thinking this is so bizarre why would a child randomly start saying this.

My cousins's son who was about 5 and who I never met prior to this visit comes over.  He gives me the fangs and smiles.

There was no train, it was a clothing store. The woman working there asked my parents what I was doing as I was just running around frantically. I finally yelled \u201cthe train!\u201d. I had found, in the back of the store, a framed newspaper clipping from the 1940s of the front window of this shop when it was a toy store and there was a big model train scene set up.",

We went to view this house in a rural village that was right by an airfield that had been very important during WW2, and there were still disused Anderson shelters in the garden and fields behind. Apparently the minute I saw them I ran to my mum, clung to her arm and asked \u201cAre there going to be more bombs?\u201d, and got really agitated. Nobody ever spoke about the war, this was in the 90s, and we didn\u2019t even have a tv. My mum was really spooked by the whole thing.",
            "Not a parent but apparently i look like the male version of my mom\u2019s grandmother. But creepier is apparently I act just like her and talk like her...and think just like her. She died 10 years before I was born I think. Maybe even before that. And lived far far away. \n\nThe creepy part is none of this feedback comes from family members. It comes from random old people who knew her. The creepiest example is: As a teenager we went to Disney in florida and was chatting with an older couple with their grandkids. After a bit the woman said I look and act just like her neighbor when she was growing up. Immediately, For no reason what so ever I blurted out \u201csoy yo, Marisol\u201d. At that point the woman never said her name was Marisol, I had no idea she spoke spanish (nor did she know I spoke Spanish). She responded dead pan \u201cDora (last name)? De Calle ___ en Buenos Aires?\u201d I snapped back to myself and stammered I was her great grandson meanwhile my mom had shivers down her spine and started to tear up. \n\nI\u2019ve also had several people with Dementia who knew her call me by her name and try to play the \u201cremember when...\u201d game. And some of those things they would bring up give me strong senses of deja vu. At my grandfathers funeral this happened dozens of times from people I\u2019ve never met. \n\nOne day I plan to go back to her home town to visit if that\u2019s ever possible. She grew up outside of what was then Grudno, Poland (now Hrodna, Belarus) before moving to Buenos Aires during the Holocaust. I know traveling to Belarus isn\u2019t very common and sometimes not easy, but I wonder if I\u2019ll have some weird past life vibes being there",

            "Not a mum but I was a nanny for many years.\n\nThis is going to be long and I apologize in advance.\n\nOne of my little ones, 2 yrs old & incredibly smart child, way ahead developmentally in almost every way. He used to like to tell me things while we got him ready for bed. It was almost always these weird storied which would always start with \"When I was an old lady...\" and they were always very specific little \"day in the life of\" type things which I quickly realized went beyond the life experience & typical vocabulary of a 2 yr old.\n\nOver a few months he kept adding very consistently to this story. He would also sometimes play as this old lady, with a cloth over his head and walking slowly as if his back pained him. Grocery shopping or playing with his sisters dolls as if they were his grandchildren was his favourite when he did this.\n\nHe added some specific details like:\n\nHow many children she had, (4 daughters and a son)and how many grandchildren.\n\nHer husband had died in his 50's (same age as one of his uncles) from a lung disease.\n\nOne of her daughters had died in their 30's in a car accident leaving 2 children who she took in with the help of another daughter.\n\nShe had a bad back and pain in her feet. One of her daughters would rub her feet to help with the pain.\n\nAll but one of her children was married, the unmarried daughter lived with her and she worried she would never marry.\n\nShe remembered dying. She had been crossing a street and hit by a car, she described how people stood around her, where it hurt, how someone eventually lifted her into a car (no ambulances) and took her to hospital where she died.\n\nI was not his only nanny, and he was consistent with these stories. Us nannies would get together and swap stories and I would write them down because I had been fascinated with phenomena like past lives before this and wanted to see where it all went.\n\nHe also described the house & neighborhood they lived in. This is especially interesting as this kid came from a SUPER wealthy family and had never even seen the kind of housing or poverty he was describing. He also talked about living by the seaside.\n\nMonths into this unfolding, we visited a seaside city on the other side of the country. One day a family member there was having a birthday party so we piled in the van to drive over, and our driver got lost (this is pre google maps & smartphone times). We ended up driving through this extremely poor neighborhood and suddenly my little boy started shouting and screaming and insisted we turn down a couple of specific streets.\n\nHe started pointing out the window and telling us things he was recognizing \"from when I was an old lady\". It matched to what he'd previously described in general and we were all so interested we let him direct us where to go as we were already going to be late for the party anyway.\n\nHe accurately described what we would see round the next turn several times but got extremely confused and upset when he got to where \"her\" house was because it was now a store. The driver leaned out the window and asked a nearby old person what had been there before the store and was told \"houses\".\n\nWe never went back there or were able to get any additional verification. Totally understandably his parents were concerned about this story telling and how vivid and strange it was, so after this dramatic incident we made an active effort to redirect him to other stories and play types.\n\nAs he approached three he started telling less & less of these stories, and they got less & less specific. By about 3 1/2 he couldn't even remember telling us stories about being an old lady. He thought we were joking with him.\n\nTo this day, over 25 yrs later, I can't explain it really.\n\nEdit: Thank you kindly for the updoots & awards. I'm so moved! Really. I didn't think anyone would read this because I was late to this topic and I type too much lol\n\nI remembered some additional stuff replying to someone in the comments so I thought I'd copy it here and add a little more:\n\nI wish I still had the notebook I was writing things down in so I could give more specific details. It's a long time ago so I only remember the bigger highlights of it. I should mention that this did not happen in a Western country and he was a SUPER protected and privileged kid. He didn't even meet a child outside of his direct family till he was 3 (when he started a VERY exclusive kindergarten after I spent several months begging his parents).\n\nHe rarely watched TV and when he did it was highly curated - pretty much just Barney. Not even Disney movies. So there wasn't really a lot of exposure to background media he could have picked this stuff up from. And us nannies didn't talk about most of the stuff he would come out with and none of us were originally from that country either. So the super specific cultural details he would come out with would baffle us (one of them was when he would play, he'd put a cloth over his head and dance in an extremely specific way, his auntie was visiting one day and saw him do it and fell about laughing. She said he was dancing like an old woman at a wedding.... like, specifically a cultural dance traditionally done by mothers & grandmothers at weddings). There were more specific odd little validations that happened as well.\n\nAlso we were specifically instructed NOT to encourage this \"play\", in that culture any non conforming behavior is not well received so there was fear this was indication of him being other than \"normal\" (I say that in quotes because personally I believe there is no fixed \"normal\" - everyone is valid just the way they are). So we were not leading him on and playing into this scenario he was telling us about. We would actually try and redirect him away from it.",
            "Obligatory not the parent but the kid here. \n\nApparently used to have rather frequent bouts of nightmares back when I was 4. And it always began with me screaming the name Sarah, then calling for help loudly (which would wake pretty much everyone in the house up), and ending with me just blubbering out \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry\" over and over and over again, all the while crying and sobbing. When I would wake up in the morning, I'd have no recollection about any of this. My parents had no idea what caused it, given that they knew no one named Sarah that I had interacted with, we had no TV or anything of the sort, I hadn't begun going to preschool yet, and didn't know how to read beyond a few simple words. Nothing they did seemed able to stop it either. \n\nThe whole thing went on for a good long while (almost a year) until one day, it just sort of stopped. Mom apparently tried asking me once about it, and kid me said something to the effect of, \"Sarah doesn't want to see me crying anymore. So I won't.\" \n\nDidn't actually know any of this happened until some years back when I got to talking to my parents about how I always found the name Sarah to be beautiful.",
            "Not me but a friends little sister. The whole family was out for dinner at a restaurant in a skiing village which they recently bought a cottage near. My friends little sister as soon as they walked in said \u201cI know this place. My mother and I used to paint here.\u201d To which her mother replied \u201cWe\u2019ve never been here before, what do you mean?\u201d she replied with \u201cNo. My mother from before. We used to paint here all the time.\u201d \nThe family was obviously a little freaked out but didn\u2019t think much of it as she was pretty young and they figured just messing around. Later on though, when talking to the waitress, the little girl again adamantly mentioned how she used to paint there and the waitress revealed that it in fact was an art studio for many years in the 1900s but had been converted sometime in the early 2000s into a restaurant. \nNeedless to say the entire table, waitress included, got goosebumps and were at a loss for words.",

            "When he was 3 my husband decided to treat our son to a flight over our city in a Cessna. When it was time to get on the plane, our boy climbed into the pilot\u2019s seat and was extremely upset when he was told he had to move. He began crying and saying he was sorry. He didn\u2019t mean to crash that plane last time and he said he\u2019d be good this time. My husband managed to calm him by pointing out that his legs were too short for his feet to reach the pedals. Once he got settled in the back seat, he started fussing about not being able to use the radio, so the pilot got him a headset, just didn\u2019t plug it in all the way. Our son then started trying to raise the tower so he could to his radio check and get clearance. At that point the pilot needed to take a break. He went for a smoke while my husband talked to our son, who told him that he crashed the last plane he flew and a lot of people died. When the pilot got back, they were able to do the flight with no further issues. About a year later, we went to an aeronautics museum when an old Mosquito was being restored. Our son told the curator that he used to fly one of those, so he offered us a tour of the plane. When we got in, our son pointed out several things that were \u2018wrong\u2019 with the plane, which turned out to be correct - things like the joy stick being the wrong sort etc. The curator told us the plane had previously been modernized and was now being restored to original condition. He also confirmed that the items our son had pointed out were in fact slated to be replaced. Our kid is grown mow and doesn\u2019t remember ever being a pilot before and has absolute zero interest in planes, but he does remember just \u2018knowing\u2019 things about airplanes and piloting them.",
            "My daughter talks about her \u201cgrandson\u201d *all the time*. I thought it was just an imaginary friend, but then a couple nights ago she came out of her room at bed time absolutely sobbing and said \u201cI\u2019m sad because I miss my grandson.

To answer some questions- we have asked her about him, but it\u2019s pretty hit or miss on whether she\u2019ll actually answer or just think it\u2019s a fun game. The other night after some questions she told us that he sleeps in a crib and has a white tongue (????), but when I asked her his name a few hours ago she said \u201cgooga\u201d and laughed and laughed.

He said he didn't know and then became almost embarrassed and shy because of our collective reactions. There was no way he would have known about war or weapons as this was the early 90s and we didn't watch TV much at all.\nI'm a complete skeptic but this creeps me out to this day.",

            "My younger sister, when she was 3, started talking to my mom about \"When I was a big girl, and you were a little girl\". She said she went to my parent's wedding. She described her old self physically, and my mom says that sounded like my mom's grandmother Grace. \n\nMy sister also talked about the \"green\" house she used to live in at the end of a dirt road and the fact that her mother (my mom's great grandmother Matilda), died from a snake bite, while they lived there. She described the snake as \"pretty\" and with the full description my mom thinks she was describing a copperhead. Now we lived in northern Nebraska (no copperheads), and Matilda died in southeast Oklahoma (copperhead region.) My sister said she killed the snake with a hoe.\n\nThese discussions always took place at bedtime. One day, we were putting in the garden and my dad was sitting down and sharpening the hoe with a file and my sister told him he was doing it wrong. He told her to show him how to do it. She put her hands on his and placed them in the correct position, and later he said that she was right, he was doing it wrong.\n\nFor those of you interested in timelines. This would be in 1980, my mother's grandmother Grace died in 1968, and her great-grandmother Matilda died in 1902. Also, we don't know if snake bite was the cause of death for her great grandmother Matilda. I was 15 at the time these little nightly discussions were going on so I remember them fairly well. She probably told these things on and off for about 6 months and by 4 she would say \"I'm tired of talking about it\".\n\nI am not a great writer, so I hope this is not too confusing.",

Needless to say my parents ignored it and put it down to me just messing around. \n\nThere was a few things about this that were very disturbing. \n1. I was 4 years old and living in Aberdeen, Scotland at the time. There was no way I could have known about Scampton, Lincolnshire, furthermore the RAF base that was there that happened to have Lancaster bombers based there during the second World War. \n\n2.

As I said my family didn't know anyone named Ron and there was nobody in my class at school named Ron either, so where could I have possibly got that name from and then roped it into a completely random sentence? \n\n3.

Part of the visit was to go to the cemetery where the war graves are to pay our respects, and to my absolute surprise I was shocked to see that there was a grave of a man named 'Ron Evans' who died in a Lancaster raid over Germany in 1945. Like I said it sent absolute chills down my spine and my hair stood on end when I saw this, like it had judt struck a nerve I didn't even know I had. \n\nIt may be a coincidence or maybe not, I don't know but I just thought it would be an interesting story to share!",

She is sitting in the rocking chair, holding a small dog, and looking right at me.\n\nI immediately go under the blankets. I\u2019m scared and I turn to the other side of the bed. My eyes are slammed shut.\n\nI stay like this for what feels like an eternity until, still under the blankets, I open my eyes. A new color is outside of the blankets; a warm orange replaces the light blue.\n\nLike a fool, I begin the peek out of the blankets and, at the other side of the bed, there are men on fire.

His mother would stand over him and calm him as he relived his days as a soldier manning a flamethrower. While he slept, she would sit in the rocking chair and make sure he rested.\n\nTo this day, I have no explanation for it. I don\u2019t know why I saw his memory.

I had this dream so often that I had almost convinced myself I had actually lived there, and repeatedly asked my parents about it\u2014even though my family had always lived in the same (very different) house my entire life. This dream always ended the same way, with a balding man sneaking in the house and pushing me out an upstairs window, at which point I would always wake up.

On a pretty empty heavily-forested back road, I saw the exact house from my dream. I demanded that my boyfriend turn around and he obliged.

I had also told them he had he had a purple ribbon in his hand.

And that her big sister was always her mum and I am usually her baby and I was a good baby. Her brother has always been her brother and she\u2019s incredibly possessive about him. It\u2019s weird and hard to hear some things she says but I thank her for telling us about it. She also says her other daddy was a bad person and hurt us all. He\u2019s apparently not the daddy she has now. The daddy she has not is good but not very old! It\u2019s odd but it\u2019s repeated a lot and she\u2019s incredibly factual.

This is the reason I am firmly against anyone riding in the back of trucks, freak accidents happen. \n\nAnyway, my little brother just turned 7. Recently he has been saying things such as \"I want to skip being 7\" and \"being 7 makes me feel sick.\" It started out just like that but now recenetly he has been saying things like \"Oh, just thinking about the accident,\" after we asked him what he's thinking about. \n\nI don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, kids say shit. He knows his brother died years ago. He knows he was 7 and how he died. But on another hand that one part of  my brain is like fuck man, that's crazy.

I died so many times in that dream over so many nights. When I told my mom, she was surprised because she had had a vision of escaping Nazis with her child only to be shot at the brink of escape.

            "Personal story from when I was a child:\n\n*From when I was 2 until I was 4, I would talk in my sleep to my Great-Grandma (GG) LaVonne, who died when my mother was 3 in 1976.  \n\n*My mother thought it was odd because she had never mentioned GG by name.   Which is odder, because she went by Lavonne, her middle name; her first name was Mary.  I knew both of these names.  \n\n*My mother was going through photos she had received from other family members when I was 4 and I pulled a photo out and pointed her out in a family group reunion photo right away and began to cry because I missed her.   Mom said later that week while picking me up from daycare, the Staff gave their condolences for her loss, as I'd been crying all day for GG Lavonne.  My mother was convinced that's when GG stopped visiting me.\n\n*In 1977 my Grandparents and my Mother and Uncle moved into a new house, (My Mom was 4).  There was a little red bird that kept landing on their boxes, sitting super close to them, and they always said it was their little friend.  The bird even tried to get into the house with them.   When I was 3 years old, my Grandpa was talking about the day they moved into the previous house, and I apparently said \"I had fun that day.\"  My Grandpa told me there was no way, as my mother was only 4 and I wasn't even a thought then.   I then shook everyone in the room when I said \"I was there, don't you remember me?  I was the little red bird.\"  There's no way anyone had mentioned the bird to me, as I am still reminded by family at 27 years old.  \n\n*I had a medium tell me that my GG is always with me and she could see her.  I took this with a grain of salt, but she then told me I was a bird in the past life, and my GG and I's souls are connected, as we died at the same time and traveled to the spirit world together. The moved into the house and the bird was there in 1977, the same year GG died.\n\n*I also have vivid memories of being a nurse during WW2.  I used to tell my mother details and she always said I reminded her of Clara Barton with my \"stories\".  Whatever, weird coincidence \ud83d\ude02\n\nTL;DR:  \n-I guess my Great-Grandma and I are connected souls.\n-Im a reincarnated bird nurse Y'all.",

My dad disappeared, and a very violent thunderstorm came. We ran and hid under a pavilion until the storm subsided. In my dream there were lightning strikes everywhere, and fires were starting. Some people were even hit by lightning. I remember being really worried that my dad got hit by lightning and wasn't coming back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out this wasn't just a dream, but a memory. We really did go to the beach with my moms brother and his wife, and there was a storm. My dad had left to go to the car, but the storm came so he waited it out in the car since it was pretty far. It was a very very violent storm and it came out of nowhere. A nearby shop was hit and caught fire, so fire trucks came, \n\nNobody was actually struck by lightning though, that was my imagination at play.

He was a lot more motivated than I was, even though we both got good grades.\n\nAnyway, the summer before our senior year, we have AP French homework. This isn't like a few pages of worksheets though. No, this is like full research projects and essays. One day I wake up and there's 2 weeks left of summer, and I haven't done any French yet. So I start putting in crazy hours working on French and only French. It's 8 hours a day of studying and working, and it's a struggle since I'm not the best student. \n\nBut a few days before school starts, something different happens. I wake up ready for another exhausting day of French. Only it's not another day, it's *un autre jour, quelle douler*. I'm thinking in French. I've been working in it so much that my brain's been wired for French now.\n\nThat kind of changed how I think about things now. I wouldn't consider myself fluent in French.

But, I'm also pretty fluent in English, and this is where the impasse begins. My readings, as of lately, have been solely in the English language - for many reasons. I love American authors (especially poets, like Whitman, Ginsberg...), and since I could read English pretty well, I went to the originals, not translated versions. \n\nThus, in my head, most of my literary inspirations are coded in the English language. While my perception of the world, and everyday thoughts and dialogs, are in Portuguese. \n\nSo, as I write, my ideas will often conflict. And this can be frustating, when, let's say, I want to write something in Portuguese, but the words I have in my mind are English ones - and as soon as I translate it, the idea loses it's magic. In Portuguese, the words happen to feel entirely different, even though the phrase still has the ''same'' meaning.

It does take a lot more conscious effort though, and feels weird/tiring.\n\nIt might be due to me using English most of the time in my life, my school education, and it being my default language for everything I view on the internet; whether it being videos or articles, etc... Even though I don't feel much of a struggle when using the other languages to speak to others."

            "Fried chicken and fondue. \n\nSo damn good I force myself to only have it twice a year, otherwise I slip down that ol\u2019 fried chicken and fondue slope.\n\nEdit: cheese fondue you heathens.\n\nEdit 2: habanero fondue works perfectly as does a hefty splash of Guinness in early cooking. If you\u2019re doing a pretzel crust fried chicken, extra Guinness.\n\nEdit 3: Holy hell I didn\u2019t know so many people wanted fried chicken and fondue. Alright, effectively you combine these two recipes (gimme a minute I\u2019m on mobile \n\n-https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/pretzel-crusted-chicken-fingers-with-curry-ketchup-2716999\n\nMake DAMN SURE you get soft pretzels on this. If you\u2019re really a pro make them from scratch and undercook them, softer is better. Obviously don\u2019t use the curry ketchup on this. \n\nWhat I like to do is brine with limes and salt first, and use peanut oil for a flash fry. Walnut if you want an earthier taste, but fuck is it expensive. Before you coat the chicken, start on the fondue. \n\nI use Alton Browns Welsh Rarebit.\nhttps://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/welsh-rarebit-recipe-1914850\n\nThe substitutions I make when putting it on pretzel fried chicken depends on the crowd. For a lighter fun taste, I bring the 1/2 cup porter down to a 1/4 cup of Guinness, and make the cream a full cup. For more traditional, I\u2019ll up the Guinness just a tad, bit if it\u2019s your first time having it or cooking it I\u2019d recommend less beer and more cream as it\u2019s a bit of an offer taste. Frankly the beer aspect is where I\u2019m still experimenting the most so I\u2019ll update after my next fried chicken and fondue binge.\n\nInstead of the 2 drops hotsauce I throw in an absurd amount of finely chopped habaneros, but that\u2019s entirely optional. Not sure if jalape\u00f1os would work too but they tend to work with cheddar. Enjoy!\n\nEdit 4: please keep in mind pretzel fried chicken is not incredibly easy to cook, and if you get the wrong pretzel bread or overcook it can lead to a scorched crust. Fondue is incredibly fun and easy, so for first timers I\u2019d recommend regular fried (heavily breaded) chicken with the fondue. La Preferida is a light, not hot, but exceptionally tasty alternative to habaneros for those who like taste but not heat. ",

Edited a few errors as I wrote this quickly before bed.  I realise that some of you might not like the BBQ Sauce side of it so approach with caution.  That was me getting experimental with it over the years.  It also goes well with some chutney spreads on it.  Cheese goes alright with it as well but I find that it can sometimes be too overpowering and take away from the egg mixture flavour.  Lettuce however can complement the flavours but is not needed.",

            "iPads for toddlers and young kids. \n\nWhile it's true that there are \"educational\" apps, time spent playing with the tablet is time spent away from learning through real world interaction. There are some studies that suggest that television is best left out until age 2 because the brain needs time to develop. There aren't any long term tablet/iPad studies that I am aware of, but I doubt it is beneficial. It's a quick way to entertain a toddler, which is part of the problem. Kids need to learn how to be bored. The alphabet, counting, and reading can wait. \n\nEdit: Wow. I didn't expect this comment to blow up. I think it's important to note that I am not judging parents who use an iPad to entertain their kids. If that works for you and you think it helps your kid, go ahead and do that. No one is stopping you. My older kids actually do use my wife's iPad on occasion. My 8 year old has taught himself new songs on the piano, how to ride a unicycle, how to solve a Rubix Cube, and creates his own Rube Goldberg machines thanks to the internet. He also swims, golfs, bike rides, plays baseball, etc. It's not all or nothing and I agree with that. I just think toddlers/preschoolers are better served interacting with their environment. At best, it makes no difference. At worst, it harms your child. Maybe it won't make a difference, but I am not making my toddler a guinea pig for this experiment. ",

This is the boots theory of socioeconomic unfairness ( https://moneywise.com/a/boots-theory-of-socioeconomic-unfairness ).\n\nThe summary is based on boots (as you might expect from the name) where the laborer only makes enough to pay for cheap boots (let's say $50-ish) meanwhile the foreman (or person in charge) can afford \"expensive\" boots (let's say $100-ish). The catch is that the $50 boots only last one season, where the $100 boots last many seasons.  The \"poor\" laborer can never afford the \"expensive\" boots. But over any length of time beyond a single season, ends up paying more for boots than anyone that can afford a better, higher quality pair, because they're buying boots every season.\n\nI always see everything in a dollar store by this metric, sure it's cheap and if you only ever intend to use it once or a few times, then that's fine. Anything you need to use more than once, go somewhere else.\n\nA good modern example would be pots and pans, bakeware and similar. At a dollar store, even if you get a reusable baking tin, it's likely going to fail or rust or otherwise become unusable long before something that's 10x the cost at Wal-Mart; even the Wal-Mart tin will likely last hundreds of times longer than the dollar store tin.\n\nIf you're poor, the best thing you can do for these types of items is to buy them from thrift shops, anywhere they sell used goods. Buying a nice, but used item will last longer and cost less in the long run than something you buy at the dollar store.\n\nBut dollar stores are immensely successful, because people are penny wise but pound foolish.\n\nEDIT: special thanks to /u/laurie-g in the comments for this correction:\n> This is the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

He made the comment \u201cshame they won\u2019t be worth that much when you go to sell them.\u201d \n\nThat comment stuck with me and a few days later I started selling my cards at school. \n\nI made a list of everything I had with prices next to them. I\u2019d pass the list around during class and kids would meet up with me between classes to buy what they wanted. I was making crazy amounts of money for a middle schooler and before long parents were complaining that their kids were skipping lunch because they were spending their lunch money on Pok\u00e9mon cards. \n\nSo the school banned them. But I still had a good bit of inventory to move. I did all kinds of things to avoid getting caught. I hid cards in a box of crayons, I put a few sheets of sleeves in the middle of a binder full of legit notes, I even hollowed out an old text book to hide all my cards. \n\nDespite getting searched 3-5 times over the next few weeks, My cards were never found and I was able to sell all of them before Christmas break. I ended up making close to 800 dollars and was able to buy my entire immediate and extended family Christmas gifts with my own money for the first time.\n\nOnce all the other kids learned how much money I had made, they were blown away and suddenly everyone was selling their cards. Problem was, no one was buying them anymore. \n\nTL;DR: I started a one kid Pok\u00e9mon card black market, smuggling them into school, and got out of the game right before the bubble burst.",
            "During elementary School in the 80s many candies weren't individually wrapped for resale in stores, think warheads etc.  I bought bulk packs of candy, didn't matter what kind, although atomic fireballs were my cash cow. \n\n I individually packed them, or maybe a couple to a pack depending on the candy.  I used those tiny ziplocs you see people use for drugs.  Being around adults a little devoid of scruples, I was able to get those in bulk from a local head shop called \"High on the Hill\" It was a surreal time looking back. \n\nI was the only supplier for a year solid in 4th grade, I made so much bank for a 10 year old it was insane.  I would make $100 a week just off of atomic fireballs.  The bulk jugs were about 5 or 6 bucks each wholesale, and at a quarter each it worked out to about $60 a jug profit if I recall.\n\nLuckily school came easy to me because it was a full time job keeping stock, packaging product, counting piles of change, budgeting, keeping a bank register (mom got a separate account that I used for my money) dodging the man etc.  It was turbulent as I never really had a group of friends as a kid, but in the 4th grade I was the fucking man.  \n\nGoing from having no real \"good friends\" and having my time divided by either being picked on or ignored, to becoming the belle of the ball was surreal.  Even at that time I was able to realize what was going on.  Their smiles were all fake their interest was not in me, but rather what was in my bag any given day.  Girls were not saying hello because they were being polite, or even the least bit interested in talking to me, they were just waiting their turn for their fix!  That denim bag got more attention than I ever dreamed of, I was just along for the ride.  \n\nI had laid the groundwork and provided the blueprint. When the 5th grade started there was competition, but they were weak.  They would always sell out, or only buy enough to make a few bucks here and there, largely selling lollipops or prepacked stuff, Hershey's kisses, bit o' honey or Tootsie rolls, whatever they could grab at the store before school.  It was amateur hour. They had made a mockery of something I took seriously, as seriously as a 10/11 year old can take something.\n\nI closed up shop pretty quickly after the school year began.  The fast life and fast money was over. The excitement wasn't there, the smiles weren't as big.  Kids came to me as a last resort.  They bought the popular kids completely out before looking my way.  It was like flipping a switch.  My first day without the bag I had a few kids ask if I was holding, but once word got around that I was out of the game everything went back to normal.  No friends, no conversation, no one to sit with at lunch or on the bus.  No one interested, fake or otherwise.  It's the first time I had ever really witnessed the dynamic of being disingenuine, I had always been authentic, and after it was all over, I was happy to stay that way.\n\nI've never really recounted this time into words, as it turns out, I learned a lot of life lessons in the 4th grade!\n\ntl;dr  I peaked in 4th grade",

Now you could buy a big bag of cats eyes from the super market but they wouldn't get you far. To play the high stakes games, you needed a specked egg, a glitter bomb, a tidal wave or something exotic but those suckers were pricy. Us poor kids couldn't afford those things so we secretly gambled our marbles through the year so when marble season opened, we had amassed enough marbles to really be ahead of the game. Being caught with marbles outside of marble season was bad. Real bad. One kid got five strokes of the cane. This being so it was a big risk to hide in the shadows of the trees and sling those little glass balls about. Not only did it hone your skills for the season start but you got good at taking the shot and then acting nonchalant. Marbles were currency. You could trade lunches with them or buy time on playground equipment. There was a good reason they banned marbles at my school. We turned it into some sort of mafia shit.",

            "We created an entire black-market currency and economy based on rocks. Story below: \n\nI used to manage one of three \"mining\" operations that were running concurrently on the elementary school playground, back in the mid to late 90's. (This school was located in a small town in southeast Tennessee, rural and bordered by the Cherokee National Forest.) The shinier or smoother the rock, the more valuable it could be. Rocks were traded between kids and their peers for snacks, drinks, homework bribes, even \"protection\" from bullies. \n\nWhoever controlled the rocks, controlled the playground. \n\nMy operation had the largest kids, using the biggest boulders that were chipped into rounded points to break up the largest rocks down to manageable size for a bunch of little kids, and we had the most hands with sticks and straight-edged rocks, for digging and dirt displacement. At the end of a day of \"work\", we would place a huge rock on top of our mining hole - too big for most anyone to lift, besides a select few guys that all worked for me. (Of course, I'm sure any of the 4th, 5th or 6th graders could have, at the time, had they cared too.)\n\nTwo other operations existed. One that was made up of all girls, though their rock output was shabby at best. And another group that did their work inside of the dome-shaped jungle gym, providing the most protection from intruders and thieves, while also providing line-of-site obstruction to the teachers and others. \n\nAs a manager, I would walk the edge of the playground looking for strong sticks and perfect digging rocks, because the durability of sticks and pieces of chipped rock required a pretty steady supply of unbroken tools to work with.\n\nOn the occasion that the classes had recess at different times, alot of thievery and sabotage would happen. Rocks would get stolen and mining holes would get filled with trash and debris.\n\nI recently visited the old school, which was closed in the mid-2000's and is now abandoned and has fallen into disrepair. The hole though? It's still there. All this time still hasn't fixed the impact my class and others had on that old playground. \n\nThat's about all I can remember from the experience, but I do still have my own personal collection of rocks from that playground that I took home bit by bit over many years in elementary school. \n\n*A box full of stupidity.

            "Potatoes, butter, soy sauce.\n\nPotatoes, butter, bacon - use potatoes from a can, or once-cooked starchy potatoes, and fry the bacon and potatoes together. \n\nCook bacon, and onion with dried mixed herbs. Add a splash of tamarind sauce if you can get it, or Paprika and cumin if not. Cook for a little longer. Add chopped tomatoes, and 2tbsp tomato puree, 1tbsp garlic puree. Let this cook out for a while, then throw rice into the mixture. Back in the UK, I used to be able to make 10 portions of this for \u00a31.20 a portion. It works on its own, but it's much better as a base recipe to add other things to. If you can afford it, add more shit (especially meat). \n\nCheese on toast. Toast one side of your bread under the grill on a medium-high heat, flip the bread, put your cheese on it, whack under the grill until melted. Tastes better than a cheese toastie, but it's less cheese per slice.\n\nSandwiches - ham, cheese, and salami is filling as fuck on the right bread, but costs next to nothing.\n\nDried noodles cooked in stock - predicated on you already having the stock cubes. Following the instructions on the stock cubes, cool the noodles in water with the appropriate amount of stock for the volume. Chicken works best, as beef can be too rich. Chicken also tends to be compatible with a wide range of extra ingredients you may have available.\n\nCelery soup. 1.5oz (45g) butter in a pan, melt it. Cook 3-4 sticks of chopped celery in the butter until softened. 1.5oz plain flour, add to the pan and stir through quickly. Take it off the heat if you need a little time. Gradually add 450ml chicken stock - only a little at a time, stir through until fully incorporated, then add the next bit. Then gradually add 200ml milk, same process. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Allow to thicken to your preferred consistency. Salt and pepper to taste. You can add chicken, but it needs to be cooked separately and the oil needs to be removed. Best added when the soup comes back to the boil. Base recipe makes 2 portions.\n\nChicken, leek, and sweetcorn pasta. Modified from a filo pastry recipe intended to finish in the oven. Cook chicken and bacon together in a pan, then remove. In a saucepan, cook leek in 2oz(60g) of butter. Add 60g of plain flour, mix to incorporate and gradually add 450ml chicken stock, then 200ml single cream. Can add more cream if desired. Bring to a boil then reduce to simmer. Add the chicken and bacon into this mixture, as well as one tin of sweetcorn. No more than one tin unless making a double portion of the recipe, as the sweetness WILL throw off the flavour balance - I've been burned on this before. Cook pasta, drain, and add to the pan. Stir through a few times, and the dish is finished. You can put it in a casserole dish, top with cheese, and bake for 20-30 minutes, or you can substitute the pasta for potatoes and do the same, or you can empty the mixture into the casserole, top with lightly crushed potatoes and cheese, and bake. Personally, I prefer this as a pasta dish.\n\nSausage pilaf. This recipe is cheap as dirt, and I recommend a few different things for it, but let's see what you think. Get cheap sausages, the kind you can oven cook. Cook these, then slice into small pieces and leave off to the side. Cook onion and peppers together in a pan until softened. Add the sausages and cook and stir until the sausages are warm again. Add rice to the pot, and stir through until everything is mixed evenly. I usually make this recipe with soy and Worcester sauce added to the sausages, onion, and peppers, and I add bacon. I also egg fry my rice, but because I don't have rice often, this is usually fresh rice. Get 5 eggs and whisk. Add them to a hot frying pan with as little oil as possible. Wait for the base to *just* start to solidify, then take your spatula/spoon/whatever, and 'slice' the egg in a grid pattern. The top should still be completely liquid. Add hot rice to the pan immediately, and stir through the egg and the rice until the egg appears cooked, and no rice is untouched by the egg. Immediately add to the other elements, and serve. Normally I make enough rice that I need to repeat this process. Base recipe used to make 6-8 portions at about \u00a31 per portion.\n\nLappskaus - a Norwegian stew. Get carrots, swede, lots of floury potatoes, and whatever cheap yet flavourful meats you can find. Smoked sausages, heavily salted bacon, gammon offcuts, frankfurter sausages, the works. Brown your meat in a pan, deglaze it, whatever you like to do, but in your main pan boil your potatoes, carrots and swede. Once your meat is browned, add it to this pan. You are looking for the potatoes to completely disintegrate, the carrot and swede to still be in chunks, and for the mixture to take on the flavours of your meat. The recipe uses a Norwegian spice called \"Alt i ett krydder\" and a liquid called \"Sukker kul\u00f8r\" for colour. I'm not sure what suitable substitutes are for these, so I would recommend whatever savoury powder spice you enjoy that works with these flavours, and apply liberally. For the colour, you could maybe add Worcester, but don't quote me on that. You're not meant to add much sukker kul\u00f8r, because Even a little changes the colour dramatically. Once the mixture has thickened and the potatoes are gone, you can serve. It's a cheap-ass stew for utilising scrap meat.\n\nScotch broth majerl. This is my own variant on a scotch broth, which is modified to use a Norwegian technique in a meal called majerl. To be honest, it's probably the same as a regular scotch broth, but the way I make that is very different to this, and most Norwegians have never heard of a scotch broth, so it's easier to tell them that it's sort of like majerl. The night before, soak broth mix in a lot of water. You can make your own scotch broth with 55g pearl barley, 10g dried green split peas, 10g dried yellow split peas, and 25g red lentils, times however many hundreds of grams you want to use. I normally soak about 300g. It can serve you well to keep the peas separate if you can, then boil those the following day before cooking them in the broth, to make them softer. In a slow cooker, or a large stock pot, add your broth mix, some carrot, some leek, some celery, and a good hunk of heavily salted meat. Here we get something called \"lettsaltet svinekj\u00f8tt\", which is insanely salty. If you can find an equivalent, you're good to go. Chop it small, like 1cmx1cmx3cm, and add to your pot. If you still have space, you can add more meat, but a higher fat content is best so it goes soft in the pan instead of tough. Cover everything with water, and cook on a high heat for 2 hours, then a low heat for six. Stir occasionally, more if you're using a stock pot, and add more water if necessary. The dish is ready to serve at the end of the cooking time. I say this is different to a regular scotch broth, because for that I normally make a stock from chicken bones, I make the dish with chicken thigh, and scotch broth is traditionally served unsalted, and you season to taste, whereas this dish comes to you ready seasoned. Do not, under any circumstances, add salt to the water unless you can't find a good salted meat. You *will* wind up with a dish that's too salty.\n\nHope this helps, OP.",

Surrounded by mountains of uni assignments the fear in her eyes is visible and quite real.    \n\n\n\nEDIT:  \n> Delighted by a strangers graciousness to award the subject with Silver she appears to feel a special kind of thankfulness that is hard to describe in words. Such raw display of emotion is one of many natural wonders.   \n\n...\n> Later on we can witness the subject in a midlife crisis at the tender age of 20. The feeling of thankfulness over an insignificant gesture makes the subject question life and everything she ever worked for. She seems to be confused as to why Silver, Gold, or one of the oner many Awards on one of the hundreds of millions websites is valued so highly by her and many of her peers.   \nAt the same time she questions her own value in society. She doesn't seem to be able to comprehend the fact that she is only worth 40 cents of reddit coins. Destroyed by this realization she starts looking into psychologists in her city to overcome this life changing discovery. \n\nEDIT 2&3 in one go as you bastards couldn't be bothered to wait a couple of minutes in-between awarding me gold and platinum:\n> The subjects self-doubt and insecurities seem to have disappeared in thin air as a notification pops up. \nHer young age and child-like behavior are clearly displayed in this moment as she struggles and argues with herself whether or not she should view yet another criticism of her actions.   \nAs with many of her ancestors and the human species as a whole, braveness appears to be embedded in her genetic makeup. And with that she decides to stand up to yet another comment.   \n...   \nWe are all in awe as we observe a single tear rolling down her cheeks. It is hard to make out the specific contents of the notifications, but we can all agree that they are meaningful to our subject. Distinct features, unique to caucasian female humans aged 12-47, are now presented to us: the subject emits an extremely high-pitched squeal. This phenomenon is well known under scientists and can often be observed at concerts, bars filled with bachelorette partys and other unique instances. Though it has been viewed many times, it is still a mysterium to us.      \nAs we slowly calm down from the surprising noise and continue observing the subject, we notice a strange resemblance to her reaction to being awarded silver: tears rolling down her face and a slight look of disbelieve and confusion in her eyes. The reason for this similar reaction becomes apparent within the next couple of minutes. \nAfter the single loud squeal and a slight display of emotions the subject of our observation puts away her phone, leaves the room she was once in and starts a journey in search of food.    \nLuckily for her she finds the treasured meal in a metal boxed that seems to keep the needed nutrition at an adequate temperature.\nThis behavior lets us believe, that the subject in fact doesn't give a shit about awards. Whether it may be silver, gold, or even platinum.   \nOur former believes seem to be disproven: what was once believed to be a young woman, depended on her peers acceptance and approval, is now most certainly an independent subject with not a single shit to give. What a magnificent transformation we have witnessed. \n\n\nEdit x&y:  \n\n> By her upstairs neighbors decision to do some work around the apartment the subject is finally awoken at the glorious time of 1PM.   \n\n> Just like most of the species' younger generation our subject of interest is immediately drawn to her phone and laptop. We watch with surprise as she decides to first watch yet another episode of a tv show while suppressing the urge to look for her peers accomplishments and approval on social media.   \n\n> Two and a half uneventful hours later the end of the season leaves her wondering how she should waste the rest of her day.    \nAs we watch her contemplating from afar we can't but hope for her to open reddit and observe yet another wonderful reaction.     \n\n> ....      \n\n> Our waiting is - after three more episodes from another show - finally awarded when her hand glides over the screen, stops above the reddit icon, and taps it. This movement seems unintentional and mechanical - it is most likely already strongly embedded in her muscle memory.     \n\n> Her reaction has drastically changed from the last two encounters with awards from online strangers.\nIt can best be described by \"meh\" as she notices multiple new silver and gold awards.  \nAnd while the subject of observation seems to be uninterested in the awards, we do notice her facial expression changing as she keeps scrolling.    \n\n> It becomes quite clear that she is fighting with herself as to whether she should care about her peers approval or not. Her former strong self seems to be gone as she stumbles upon [the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ax7qnh/a_ghost_will_haunt_you_forever_you_can_choose_who/eht99vt/) of the fabulous /u/thatannouncerguy    \n\n> While we have expected her to show some kind of reaction to his comment, we certainly haven't expected to become witness to such a character-forming moment.   \nThe struggle within is even from this distance quite obvious. The complicity of the matching inner-dialog can only be imagined.     \n\n> Our young subject has to face a life-altering decision at such a young age: Should she spent her (not so) hard-earned reddit-coins on awarding this gentleman gold and therefore comply with the societies rules and expectations or should she finally end this awful cycle of giving out \"you did a good job Buddy!\"-awards that leave unnecessary high expectations and a class-system within the reddit community?   \n\n> As we watch her struggle, we can't but be fascinated with the species' self-awareness.   \n...    \n> Our former pride is gone as we watch her crumble to societies expectations and award /u/thatannouncerguy for his hard work.\n\n  ",

I was putting together a video with pictures from her life and a few songs she loved. It was about midnight and I had just started rendering the video when all of a sudden, my power went out. The neighbors across the street had power, it was just the houses on my side of the street that lost power (which has NEVER happened before or since). I thought to myself \"No big deal....the laptop should have enough battery to finish this.\" 2 hours later and my video is still rendering, my battery has dwindled down to almost nothing, and the power is still off. I exclaim out of frustration \"Damn it Mom, I guess you don't want me to finish this -\" and at that exact moment *woosh* all the lights came back on and I was able to finish the video. \n\n\nTL/DR - I asked my Mom to haunt me when she died, and she did.",

            "If you want to get a little more outraged - Sir Frederick Banting (Canadian) gave away the patent for insulin so that it wouldn't be expensive.   \n\n\nHe is quoted as saying:  \n\n### \u201cInsulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world.\u201d\n\n  \n[https://www.cdnmedhall.org/inductees/frederickbanting](https://www.cdnmedhall.org/inductees/frederickbanting)",
            "As a type 1 diabetic this is very close to my own personal experience. I was diagnosed when I was a baby; just 1.5 years old. So I've lived with the condition for my entire lifetime, essentially.   \n\n\nMany people are unaware of what type 1 diabetes actually is, so I'll give a basic rundown just FYI. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system targets and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin (beta cells in the islets of langerhans). Insulin is a critical hormone that allows the body to metabolize glucose for energy. An untreated type 1 diabetic will die within a couple of days, without insulin.   \n\n\nContemporary insulins (humalog, novolog, and lantus, etc) have been around for decades with only minor tweaks to the production of those insulins. The price for a 10ml vial of humalog or novolog was around $20, over the counter, without insurance. Those same insulins are now priced at \\~ $300 over the counter, without insurance. That's an astronomical price increase without any major change to the formula or production method used.   \n\n\nI may be off the mark here in just talking about the price of insulin and not talking about billionaires, but you don't need billionaires to understand just how ethically bankrupt our systems are when a product like insulin which is necessary for survival is priced at a point of such staggering profit. It costs something like $6 to produce a 10mL vial of life sustaining insulin, which is then priced at \\~ $300. People die because they can't afford to pay that. It's just wrong.",
            "I\u2019ve never had to depend on insulin but I do have to take anti-rejection medicine every 12 hours for the rest of my life or else I will die, and it is expensive as hell and it used to be worse before there was generic tacrolimus. I remember losing my job and it was a devastating blow, I was desperate to get my medicine and it cost over 3 thousand dollars for a one month supply. It\u2019s no way to go through life. If everyone had experienced what I\u2019ve gone through in my life there wouldn\u2019t be a question in their mind whether healthcare is a right or privilege. We need to pool our money and take care of everyone regardless of their financial status.",
            "The current system is short-sighted and doesn't take into account the obvious, natural tendencies of human beings. For example, once you get rich you are naturally going to start spending a certain amount of money trying to influence how your business is regulated and how you personally are taxed. The system should be immune to the lure of that money, either because it's illegal to take, or because it is ruthlessly tracked and voters are made aware.\n\nWhat we have now is a system where the rich did exactly this: they paid for some influence. With that influence they got the rules changed so they could make more money to donate. Once it became crazy expensive to win office, it was in the interests of both the rich and the politicians to change how it was possible to donate, and how donations were tracked. So the rich have started to capture our democracy. It hasn't worked completely yet, but the trend is there and it's getting worse every election cycle, whether we realize it or not.",
            "The problem with accumulating wealth at any cost is that it\u2019s an extremely short-sighted view. Corporations think in quarters rather than decades or centuries. I\u2019m not advocating for the Soviet brand of communism or whatever China is doing this week, but we need some long-term thinking that includes the good of the world and humanity in general, while also understanding that people are individuals, not cogs in a machine.\n\nAlso, monopolies need to be broken up and dealt with harshly. No business wants to compete with anyone else, every business wants to become a monopoly and corner the market. That\u2019s why there need to be safeguards. Companies need to be made wary of becoming a monopoly. That might force them to engage in some fair practices and care about consumers for a change",
            "Notice how insulin prices are only an issue in the US and not in most European countries. That is because European politicians are usually not in beds (sometimes literally) with pharma companies and strong regulation is a thing. But in the US regulation and taxes are dirty words, except for all the taxes and regulations you have.",
            "I generally don't like AOC. A lot of times she is spot on recognizing a problem but her solutions are awful. She likes to pin issues like this on free market capitalism but that assumes we have a free market. As government has grown so has inequality. Government writing laws in favor of corporations and billionaires is the main problem and worse than the corporations themselves.",
            "Capitalism, or whatever you want to call our current economic system, does not prohibit free insulin. Source: UK diabetic right here. \n\nI think this is a US problem, not a fundamental issue with the Western economic system.",
            "You know, I have no problem with the existence of billionaires. I don't give a shit about the \"haves\". The issue is the \"have nots\". As long as everyone has \"enough\", I don't care if some people have \"too much\", but many of the ones who have \"too much\" got that much by not contributing to the welfare of society as a whole - lobbying for tax breaks, hiding their money, underpaying employees, etc. And that is an immoral system.\n\nTo give an example, in the fictional Star Trek universe there are clearly those who have more than others. Picard may say that \"they don't use money\", but Starfleet Admirals sure do seem to have better stuff than frontier tradesmen. But in this hypothetical universe with interstellar travel and matter replicators, everyone has \"enough\" - they always have food, advanced medical treatment, vacations or shore leave, time in VR, etc. It doesn't matter that some people live better lives as long as everyone's life is good, but if some are thriving on the backs of others suffering, there is still a great deal of progress to be made in society. And real life isn't Star Trek...\n\nAlso, I have not accounted for the effect of billionaires on the political system, because I can't think of any way to prevent them from having an outsized effect. But repealing Citizen's United would be a good start.",
            "People think about the poor in different ways. Some think poverty is the individual's fault; if they just worked harder, stopped spending lots on cigarettes, drugs and alcohol, stopped having too many kids, and stopped having teenage pregnancies, they could lift themselves out of poverty. Others think poverty is due to factors outside of one's control: if you can't afford an education and can only find minimum wage jobs, if you can't afford birth control (hospital births are expensive btw, and complications from delivery have killed millions of women throughout history), if you've got medical debt, if you can only afford a cheap car and have to spend hundreds or thousands on repairs all the time, and if your life sucks so bad only cigarettes, drugs and alcohol can numb the pain.\n\nObviously both kinds of poor people exist, the lazy and the ones working 2-3 jobs and barely getting by. They've existed throughout history and will always exist. That doesn't mean we can't try to make things better. Charities, nonprofits and government aid/regulations all do that.\n\nIf you wanna be a social Darwinist who says let the poor and sick die out because that's how natural selection works, that's certainly an opinion, but it's also fucked up and plain evil. Price gouging on lifesaving medicine is just evil. Something being legal doesn't mean it's not morally depraved  -- slavery was legal and justified by certain religious groups. \n\nGovernments are supposed to protect the people and make life better for the majority; yes, they're full of corrupt, greedy, self-interested goons, but at least most countries haven't gone full dictatorship yet, and dictatorships have been toppled for all of human history. A government's interest in nurturing the taxpayers provides services like transportation, infrastructure, minimum wages and better working conditions (compared to stuffing children in tight spaces to fix deadly machinery, at least). Why not keep goddamn insulin and epipens affordable for the masses? \n\nBillionaires who get rich off others' misery are legal but morally repugnant. Laws can govern what we deem morally repugnant, like child labor laws. Reactions to laws can be unpredictable and contradictory to the intent (like British rewards for dead cobras in India leading to people breeding cobras, and when the reward was cancelled, they released all the cobras into the wild). Putting price controls on medicines can lead to unintended consequences, like letting the insulin itself be cheap but charging a fortune for the bottle it came in. That doesn't mean we can just give up, though.",

            "As a type 1, insulin dependent diabetic this frustrates me. These pharmaceutical companies make their billions by exploiting a patent which the creator of doesn't want profited from. \n\nRight now I live in the UK and would dearly love to move to the states to study at an ivy League but the cost of insulin is outright rediculous, I guess we'll just have to see what happens in the future.",
            "No one thinks affordable insulin is impossible.\n\nInsulin prices are high because of government granted monopolies and public financing to help pay for medicine.\n\nMonopolies allow for higher prices than with competition, but they cant make people pay more than they can afford. This is only possible with public financial aid. The availabilty of more money means monopolies can charge more and them charging more edges out more people who seek financial aid and starts the price rise again.\n\nYou see the same game with college prices, and any other place where public dollars are spent. Education, military, all entitlements.",
            "I don't know how to feel about that. As far as I know a billionaire's wealth is mostly tied to the value of the stock of their company that they own.  Bezos's net worth is the combined value of the stock he owns in Amazon combined with other assets.\n\nThe problem is that in order to be in control of the company, Bezos needs to own the most stock. So I'm not sure if Bezos can just give away billions in the form of stock without losing control over his company. And then taxes... how do you tax someone on the value of stock they own and how do they pay it? Do they pay in stock? I don't know.\n\nHe doesn't have a huge vault with billions of dollars in cash in it like Scrooge mcDuck. So perhaps someone can enlighten me, would it be possible to make billionaires give away billions without it costing them stock and control in their company?\n\nI am honestly interested in being educated on how this works.",

            "Capitalism has raised more out of poverty than any other system in history and it\u2019s not even close. The fact that there are billionaires doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s taking from someone else. Wealth is not a pie. Wealth under capitalism is always growing. And in almost every case a billionaires \u201cwealth\u201d isn\u2019t in cash but investments in their companies. Like when Elon \u201clost\u201d billions when Tesla\u2019s stock went down last week.\n\nI don\u2019t think AOC understands how wealth generation works and she (like many politicians) use wealth as a wedge to try and get their points across but it\u2019s misguided and wrong. She should be focusing on ways to help others generate wealth instead of making scapegoats out of the few who do have great wealth.\n\nAn immoral system would be politicians deciding how our money gets taken and spent based on how they feel. The ascent of billionaires and millionaires is a good thing. More and more are gaining wealth and we are all unquestionably better of than we were 100 years ago. By far.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame politicians resort to this type of rhetoric for political gain.",
            "I don't think it's very true. We have many issues, but billionaires aren't a major issue, they are just an easy target.\n\nBillionaires are a popular target because they are visible and the idea of someone having 100 billion dollars evokes visceral disgust in anyone that's struggling for money, But there is nothing inherently wrong with people being rich. Anything with a huge impact on the world will have positives and negatives, but I don't see Amazon, Tesla or Microsoft as being inherently immoral - and those ultra-billionaires exist because they created and grew those companies and have not had those companies taken away from them.\n\nCapitalism must always be balanced by a government that is capable and willing to impose and enforce rules when what is in the best interests of the companies no longer matches what is in the best interest of the people. In that regard she is right that we are living in a broken system. You can point to corporate money as a huge issue, but companies will always act in their best interests and if our government is unable to make decisions without being influenced by companies, that is a failing of our government and those leading it. \n\nHowever, the core issues that are hurting people are due to the industrial revolution we are in the middle of. With globalization, computers and ever more sophisticated technology, the world has changed dramatically over the past few decades, leaving many out in the cold. This isn't the first time humanity has experienced such a revolution and life will have likely improved in many amazing ways by the time it is over, but when the fabric of society shifts so dramatically, there will be pain. And that means there will be hurting people who are looking for someone to hand them a solution - historically that has meant politicians finding a group to blame, whether it is billionaires or immigrants or that other political party. \n\nIt is so much easier to point to the billionaires as the problem than it is to find a solution to the fact that the American minimum wage makes unskilled labor uncompetitive in the global market while at the same time not providing minimum wage workers an acceptable standard of living. That is a hard and maybe even unsolvable problem right now. So we blame billionaires (or maybe immigrants, depending on your leanings).\n\nDon't blame billionaires, blame the government that isn't creating regulation to make life-saving medication affordable. The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act proposed allowing the government to produce medications like insulin to bring the price down. \n\nYou can have billionaires AND affordable insulin - anyone who tells you differently has an agenda or has lost hope.",

            "I was at the grand opening of a sports bar the night that Manny Pacquiao fought Chris Algieri. The bar and was jam packed beyond belief - so packed that you couldn't get back to your table without shimmying through the other patrons, trying not to put your butt on the back of their necks.\n\nAnyway, a guy who had paid, entered and had some drinks went outside to take a smoke break (no smoking allowed in the bar). There was still an incredibly long line to get inside, so he tried to come back in the exit door. The bouncer told him he couldn't and that he would have to wait in line and come back in the main entrance (though he didn't have to pay again). The guy was pissed and tried to push past the bouncer. The bouncer eventually pushed him out the door and locked it.\n\nThe guy then apparently went back home, grabbed his girlfriend's gun and came back to the bar (I learned this after the fact talking to the owner and via news coverage). He waited until someone left out the exit door, snuck inside and shot the bouncer in the back of the head several times.\n\nThe bar was so packed that chaos ensued. Almost everyone hit the floor immediately. There were tables, food, drinks, keys, phones and people all laying on the floor. Other people ran outside. \n\nMy buddies and I waited for a few minutes until we knew the coast was clear and then got the hell out of there. At the time, we didn't know all of what had happened.

At the other end of the corridor there was another stairwell, and at the bottom of that there was an old beater car just idling with the headlights on and a few of the doors just hanging open. Something was definitely fishy about it; I definitely had the \"what if those were gunshots?\" thought, but there was no gunpowder smell or blood or anything besides that one little hole. \n\nTo play it safe, I called the cops who said they were sending someone over. The station is very close to the housing complex and they were there in less than a minute. I gave them a quick summary of what I saw, and they split up to go in the directions I told them that the people had headed. \n\nWas less than 30 seconds later that they found the lone guy that had gone off to the south-west. Turns out he had been shot multiple times, and had managed to walk across the parking area and turn behind a building before collapsing on the grass. They tried CPR but when they ambulance arrived the paramedics pronounced him dead on the scene. \n\nThe other cops who had gone east did find the other guy and arrested them. I ended up having to go testify in court during the trial of the guy that was supposedly the shooter. I told them basically what I wrote up here, but didn't know any of the people involved and never saw faces or anything of any real help to the police. I think I was basically there to establish timeline or something like that. \n\nAnyhow, I heard that it was basically a drug deal gone wrong. Two different gangs from two different counties thought the residence apartments would be empty over the holidays and set up a deal. One party tried to rip off the other party and someone got shot. As I understand it the shooter guy got sent to prison.",

There were probably 6 or 7 of us kids in the car and we were stopped at a traffic light across from a homeless shelter, about to get onto the interstate. This guy is walking down the street with an armful of chewing tobacco and drops a pack. A homeless guy leaning up against the wall picked it up. There was an angry exchange in which the guy refused to give back the tobacco so the other guy kicked him and stomped him to death on the sidewalk.",

            "A drunk man was pushed down some stairs by the bouncer. Unfortunately, the drunk man was unable to catch himself and instead spun around and landed on the pavement with the back of his head making first contact. He was aluve for a little while but quickly succumbed to his wound and arrested on there on the pavement. He was declared dead 15 minutes later in ED after being transported by ambulance. There was no CCTV or clear evidence of malicious intent that would hold up in court, and the man was known as a drunk and a had no friends or family. It was ruled and accidental death. I had to walk past that spot most days going to work and will never forget his face, the look of mystified horror followed by the glassy eyed slack jawed expression that come with death.

Along comes another bus. This is early in the morning, both buses are full, I was going to school (2nd grade). The driver of the other bus stops my bus, both drivers get off to yell at each other, the second driver has a gun but he is older/more feeble, so my driver grabs the gun and shoots him once.

            "Happened while hanging out at my bestie's house. For context I'd like to explain that: 1)her house faced the side of a popular bar in our town, 2)that particular night her husband was pretty buzzed and had the fire pit out front blazing, and 3)they had taken in my guinea pigs in addition to theirs when I moved to a place that wouldn't allow them. \n\nSo my bf at the time and I at one point go to the basement to give out treats to the piggies. Through the open side door we could hear some commotion going on outside. Didn't think much of it at first, until I realize that my inebriated could possibly be involved. Bf and I run out the side door to find the husband nowhere in sight, and the commotion is coming from two guys across the street from the bar and one guy in the parking lot arguing. We go back into the basement where we found the husband (he had went inside to grab a beer and then came down the basement steps to gather more cardboard to burn while the fire pit was going) and the three of us begin to chat.\n\nFast forward a few minutes and we all hear 'pop pop pop pop pop'. For a split second we all just look at each other wide-eyed knowing those pops were unquestionably gunshots. The three of us run out the side door again just in time to see one of the guys from across the street is now in the bar parking lot, and the other guy involved in the argument shoots him five more times. The victim goes down and the shooter stood over him and shot him three more times before taking off running up my bestie's street.\n\nProbably the worst part was that the victim's mom was inside the bar. Her cries were so heartbreaking to hear. Later learned that the victim lived across the street from the bar and his two young children ended up seeing their dad bleed out through the window. The killer was found within the hour and stated the argument was over $20 and a woman they were both trying to date. He was charged with first degree murder and 13 counts of wanton endangerment.",

To add, I was 13yoF. \n\nMy then-18 yo brother and his then-18 yo wife lived next door to a family with a teenage son. She started an affair with that 17yo son.\n\nOne day, the son barged into my brother's place and started attacking him. I don\u2019t know exactly why, but the wife didn\u2019t seem to want to move away with my brother to the army, or some dumb shit. My brother was packing and moving bc he was leaving for the army. He had pulled down a metal pole in a closet to make room for boxes. My brother grabbed that pole and used it to fight off the teen. The kid ran out bleeding. My brother called my dad (we lived a few blocks down the street) and my dad jumped into action. He grabbed one of his hunting shot guns and some bird ammo. He ran out the door to the car screaming for us to call 911.\n\nMy mom and I ran after him, bc we were clueless and wanted to see where he was headed. My mom was on the phone with the cop and they were dispatching the ONE cop that we had in our town.\n\nWe start running down the road to my brother's place bc we saw dad pull in. As we get near, we hear a gunshot and see my dad and brother taking cover behind the car doors they'd opened to climb in and leave. Another shot goes off and we can see it isn't my dad firing.\n\nThe teen had run home next door and was bleeding and told his dad my brother was trying to kill him. His dad grabbed his hand gun and saw my dad and brother leaving and started shooting. That's the gunfire mom and I heard.\n\nDumb us kept running towards my dad's car. I saw my dad position his shotgun in the car window and fire one round. Then, he and my brother climbed in the car and started driving back at us/home. We all finally get together and dad says he shot the man in the stomach.\n\nChaos breaks out on our street. Ambulance, cops, and people. They take the other dad away to the hospital and my dad into custody.\n\nWithin hours, we find out that the man has died. The birdshot hit his liver and he bled out. Turns out he was an alcoholic and his liver was not going to survive the trauma. My dad was charged with murder and we started receiving death threats.\n\nIn the cover of night, we are moved. We hid for days until my dad was bonded out. Ended up moving far away.\n\nGrand jury was convened and I had to testify to what I saw. After all the evidence and testimony was presented, my father wasn't charged bc the grand jury decided it was self defense.\n\nWe never talk about what happened or anything. Things carry on as normal. That day is forever burned into my memory.\n\nI want to add this: my dad never recovered from taking a man\u2019s life, even though it wasn\u2019t intentional. He ended up hooked on heroin after the church couldn\u2019t save him. We lost him to his demons in 2008. My brother has done well for himself, but he had his own battles that he fights daily. I am not pro or anti gun. I just wish this had never happened bc so many lives were changed.\n\nMy brother divorced her after he left for the army. She is gone from our lives.

Her abusive boyfriend who chased her out of a bar into oncoming traffic came back and sat with her and kept putting his hands in the blood screaming and crying. The car who hit her kept driving. I guess technically not a murder but she was scared and running from abuse and was killed by a hit and run.  I remember looking for her story in the news. Her name was Melody and she had very young children",

            "It\u2019s not exactly murder, maybe, I guess you can decide. I\u2019ll try to make it a fast one. \n\nI was a medic in Afghanistan. A few people got injured in an IED blast, one of which was a kid, around 14-15 years old. We had limited resources, so sometimes you can only save a certain number of people, those who are most likely to be saved, the immediate casualties come first, and sometimes you have to let the others who are too far gone just kinda... sit there, I guess. You make them comfortable and talk to them but, there\u2019s not much you can do. \n\nAnywho, the reason I equate it to murder is, when we saw what we had in numbers, we realized we could save one, a guy that had lost quite a bit in the blast, and there wasn\u2019t much we could do for the kid. So I gave him some pain meds, to help him relax, and help him sleep. And he did, he went to sleep and never got to wake up. It was a murder in the grand scheme depending on your viewpoint, but I truly felt like I was the one dealing the final blow, even if it was for mercy. He was a local, I never got to learn his name, or anything about him apart from the short time I spent with him before working on the other casualties.",

Suddenly, two gunshots ring out. Unlike elsewhere in Europe, guns are not that unusual in Corsica, so people take cover and dive under tables, music stops and such but there is no huge drama. People are kind of used to this kind of stuff. I look at the barman, he shrugs. I head for the door to see what is going on and step out into the alley. In front of my lies a guy, no more than 20 yrs old. He is in fetal position, very peaceful looking, but he is clearly dead. His brains are all over the wall. All tables are empty, also in the restaurant across the alley. More and more people come out of the bar. We all look at the dead guy. There is a clear sense of let\u2019s get out of here. I find my girlfriend and we leave. Later we hear that the dead guy was a waiter. He intervened in an argument a customer had with his girlfriend. Told him to keep it down. Customer got up, pulled out a gun and shot the waiter in the head. I still sometimes think about how he lay there so still and peaceful. And it me realise how quick it can all end for you.

I stayed and aided the police for 7 hours. \n\nThat event caused severe PTSD that influenced and altered my life. I have sought treatment and am much better now. I will do a live broadcast of the entire event and post it to my page because the whole story truly takes an hour to explain. To really go through everything I saw that night. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions.",

            "The bank I work at is across the street from a pawn shop. One day, there was an argument in there and a man came out with the owner and shot him in the back of the head. My boss shut and locked all the doors and closed the metal shutters. Our armed guards had their weapons ready until the cops showed up, a gunfight ensued, and the man was shot dead, Can't say my first week at work was boring. at dinner that night, my husband asked how work went that day, I told him and started shaking. He then said that made the mouse that ran across the floor in his office seem minor. I think he was disappointed because he had a funny story about a mouse at work to tell and I ruined it by saying I saw a man shot and a police gunfight on the street at work.",
            "My friend comes to visit from Florida for 1 night. We're at an after hours club and I have a fake id but he's of age. Were outside smoking. Some dude pulls up in a white car and walks over screaming with a gun to the bouncer. The bouncer pulls out his own gun and shot him 6 times. Turns out, bouncer was sleeping with the guys wife. Guy fell on the hood of his white car, covering it in blood, and died. Cops showed up. Girl we were talking to outside has a big mouth and is telling the cops that her and I saw everything, and the bouncer wasn't the shooter, it was a drive by. She was drunk and wrong. Cops grabbed me, her, and my Florida friend as witnesses to an alleged, but false, driveby and brought us downtown. I filled out all the paperwork under my fake ID. Eventually came clean and admitted I was underage and that the id was fake once he started questioning its validity. Cop was pissed but let it ride. We had to stay downtown for 11 hours throughout this whole process of basically saying no, this girls wasted, it was the bouncer, as they already knew. They gave us cheese sandwiches and let us smoke cigarettes in the station but overall it was an absolutely drunken, terrible, and sleepless night. The friend I was with visiting from Florida never came back to visit.",
            "I was 6-7 years old playing with my sister in our back yard. We heard something and thought it was just a fire cracker since fire crackers are normal in our country. Then we heard screaming and out of nowhere, a man was running in our back yard. He stopped for a moment, looked at us then jumped off the fence. We went to the front yard to see what was going on and saw our neighbor being carried to a car ( to be taken to the hospital). We couldn\u2019t understand what was happening until my mother ushered as inside and said our neighbor was shot. After a few days some witnesses said the guy who shot him ran into our yard and that\u2019s the only time we realized the guy we saw was the murderer. Police never asked us about anything. Tbh, I couldn\u2019t remember his face. It happened so fast. All I could remember was the screams I heard.",
            "not much to say, but I was walking from school and I lived in a bad neighborhood at the time, so I would pass this street called pleasant (ironic isnt it?) , and there was a gang there who always had shit going on with other ppl so one day I walked by and heard faint shouting, then 3 shots fired. I said fuck all that and ran home lmao. the next day I found out the kid who was shot went to my school.",

They brought out biohazard crew to clean up the grey matter from the floor. I had to wait with the corpse the rest of my shift in our receiving and discharge area.

One of the guys pulled out a small pocket knife and stabbed him in the chest. Hit the corner of his heart. He died on scene. I watched him die. I\u2019ll never forget the look in his face when he was on the ground. Eyes rolled back. The small trickle of blood coming from his chest. I watched him die.

            "When I was in highschool and first years of college, in my country started a horrible wave of violence retlated to narcotrafic and organized crime, my city was particullary affected by this, so, I happened to witness two murders related to this, both on my way to college.\n\nFirst, I was on a bus heading to the subway, and I saw a lot of soldiers out of a convenience store, it was super common to see soldiers on the streets back then, so it didn't bother me. However there was a militar truck in the parking lot and I saw, underneath the truck, the legs of a man lying on the floor, in my 17 years old mind I thought he was just a homeless asleep on the parking lot of the store, but a soldier approached to him, pointed his gun to this man and shooted him. Thankfully I didn't see the whole scene but I saw when the soldier shot and how the legs of the man moved a bit while a blood rush was growing on the soil and then he didn't move anymore. Hours later I saw in the news he was an extortionist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second one was WAY worst. I was again heading to the college, and I had to pass under a big vehicular bridge, nothing remarcable. But that day a man was hanging from the neck, with a chain, on the highest point of that bridge; next to him was a huge blanket with a menacing text from some narcotraficcant against whoever enemy he had. I don't know if this man was already dead and it was the wind what was moving him, but it was so shocking. I had to take therapy for a long time to get over it.",
            "I commented about this on a thread yesterday (about people who were nearly murdered), and I didn't actually witness the murder, but I had a friend who was murdered by her boyfriend following an argument.   The boyfriend stabbed my friend twenty-something times and then called 911 claiming that he had \"hurt\" his girlfriend. When authorities got to their apartment, my friend was long dead.  The boyfriend ended up being sentenced to 50 years in jail.\n\nThe kind of scary thing is that this morning I found a comment from another Redditor who knew about the murder I was writing about.",

The guy pulled out a gun and shot him 3 times in the chest. \n\nMy we were in the pool area and my godbrother was on the sidewalk nearby, within view. After he was shot my godfather tackled the guy with the gun and held him there until the police showed up and arrested the guy. \n\nThe aftermath is blurry, I was young and terrified and I remember being physically sick for a while after that, even not returning to school until after the funeral.",
            "I was a freshman at my current high school (im a senior now) it was valentines day but the whole day something felt kinda odd. The fire alarm went off during my 2nd period english class but it was just a drill. Later in the day roughly 45 mins(ish) left before i could go home the fire alarm went off again. We were all confused but followed procedure. I was on the 3rd floor so we had to go down a bunch of stairs but on the way down everyone turned around and was running back. Thats when i heard the gunshots. I turned around and headed back to my classroom running. The teacher was trying to unlock the door (they lock themselves when they close) and i look behind me and see the shooter firing in my direction. I looked back and my teacher got the door open so i ran inside and hid. The shooter was still firing shots and i could hear screaming outside the door. Everything smelled like gunpowder and iron from the amount of blood. We were waiting for police for what felt like hours but was probably only about 30 mins until we were rescued. The whole time waiting i could hear someone outside screaming for help but there was nothing we could do. We just waited. Once they rescued us they had us line up with our hands on out heads and took us out of the building. There was blood all over the floor and walls. Bodies on the staircase and in the hallways. 17 people died that day. Ill never forget any of it.",
            "I was on a bus in Tijuana, maybe 2-3 years ago, at a red light in heavy traffic. There was a woman driving a small van next to us. I happened to look up from my phone just in time to see a guy walk up, dome her, and jog away. Just blood and chunks everywhere. I have seen some pretty gruesome shit on the internet, but seeing it in real life was still a little gut wrenching. It was could have been gang or narco related, but I don\u2019t want give baseless speculations. \n\nAnd thank god the window was closed, because the sound was insanely loud and  painful.",
            "I didn\u2019t directly witnessed it but i spoke to the guy after he found his mom murdered by it\u2019s own father with a hammer. He crushed the woman\u2019s skull. \n\nReason was that she wanted to live freely and divorce him (they were iraqis so islam is a thing there), she also started her drivers license.",
            "Not sure if this ended up being a murder, but it definitely was an attempt to murder or a mugging gone wrong. \n\nWhen I was 8 I heard a loud BANG while I was on a school van going to school. Then the van came to a roundabout where there was a old woman bleeding from her stomach while being grabbed by another woman, repeatedly saying \"I'm going to die\". I have no idea what ended up happening, but I only saw it for less than 30 seconds. I remember hearing sirens nearby, so it might have been an ambulance.",
            "Was riding a bus home from work when I was 18. A car drove past the bus and I thought it backfired a couple times. Glanced outside the bus and saw a man laying on the sidewalk with blood pouring out of his head and three guys running down an alley. Bus driver took off and got pulled over by a pair of cops several stops later looking for witnesses. Some of the other passengers saw the guys' faces and stuck around to answer more questions.",
            "I was 15 and went with my dad to a motorcycle part swap meet at the Orange County fairgrounds. A local lawyer who advertised as \"The Motorcycle Attorney\" had a couple Hell's Angels passing out his business cards at a booth. All of a sudden, a large group of Vagos show up and start closing in on the HA guys. Things go belly-up quickly. A few Mongols who were in attendance get involved. People start using motorcycle parts as clubs. I see a guy get hit in the head and he dropped to the ground. When police showed up, one of the gang members tried to roust the downed man, let out an \"aw, shit,\" and dragged him out by his legs.

That next morning I saw all the police cars and saw a body bag coming out the front door of my building. When I went into the hall it was filled with police and other neighbors in my building. \n\nIt was somehow ruled a suicide and a few days later the fianc\u00e9 was back in the building acting like nothing had happened. He had a black eye and bruises all up and down his arms, obviously from some kind of struggle. \n\nRIP Deb, I loved drinking wine out of thermoses with you at the laundromat",
            "I know I am super late to the party but I have so many stories to tell. \n\n1.The first murder I witnessed was as a child. I was walking home from the drug abuse program the I hung out at. On a side note, I didn't use drugs but they had a super nintendo and let us hang out. Walking home I saw a guy shoot another guy with a hunting rifle. I ran straight home, police were there in minutes. My grandmother told me they caught the guy. I really dont know. \n\n2.The second murder I watched was a few years later. I was about 13 or 14. I was in the front yard with my cousin when the neighborhood crack dealer got into an argument directly in front of the house. The guy he was arguing with started riding off on a bike and he pulled a sawed off shotgun and shot him in the back of the head. Skin and chunks of stuff was still on the pavement for a few weeks, it smelled pretty bad. \n\n3. The third was when I was 18. My roomate shot a guy in the throat with a sawed off shotgun (once again with the sawed off) at point blank range. That shit was brutal. I was waaaaaay to close for that. He recently got out of prison and contacted me via facebook. I was astounded he thought I wanted to talk to him. \n\n4. The next instance could be counted as the 4th, but it could also be counted as the 5th,6th, 7th, and 8th. I was in Iraq, it was my very first mission \"outside the wire\". It was technically training from the outgoing unit. We were heading to the MK 19 range. The MK 19 is a 40mm automatic grenade launcher. We were told about a family that came to pick up brass from spent ammo. Apparently they didnt give that breifing to the other unit or they just didnt care. As the family approached the unit that was training us unleased hell on the chevy caprice. I was a brand new private and unsure what to do. I tried running it up the chain of command. I asked about it a few weeks later and was essentially told to mind my business. It was more professional sounding. Something to the tune of we cant discuss an ongoing investigation, but the thing is I was a willing eye witness and not once was I questioned. \n\nI know this wont get read by many but for those that took the time to read this, thank you. This stuff eats at my soul and I dont have many places I can talk about it. I think about these people often and now someone else is too. That gives me some comfort.",

            "When I was 13 me and a friend stayed up all night practicing our best Britney Spears choreography when we heard some noise outside. We peaked out the window and saw a man beating up his pregnant girlfriend in their front yard. Then a group of men jumping another off to the side. One pulled out a gun and unloaded in to the one guy they were beating up. They then stuffed him in a car and drove away. Police tried to get us to identify suspects in the case but I could never really be sure on the potential suspects they showed us.\n\nThey second murder happened on that street just about a year later. We were unloading groceries from our car one evening when these two white males who were loitering on the corner close to our house ran out in to the street in front of a moving vehicle and unloaded the gun in to the windshield. My mom ran in the house when she heard the gunfire but I froze like a deer in the headlights. It happened so quickly. When I finally snapped out of it I ran inside and my mom was calling 911. When police arrived I saw the shooter speaking to police and called and office over to let him know what I had saw. Turns out the men were undercover officer in a drug sting. They murdered this man, they never identified themselves as officers to the suspect or anyone.",
            "Witnessed my friend get hit by a drunk driver while we were skating, he was killed on impact. I was 13 years old, it had a profound effect on me.

Nephew got fired for failing a drug test not even 6 months into the gig. Pretty sure he ended up getting kicked out of their house too shortly thereafter.",

Dan and Alan shared the same mom, while Alan and Sara shared the same dad.

            "The outcome was dramatic and incredibly tragic. \n\nI had a colleague once who drunkenly confessed to sleeping with her step brother. Eventually it developed into a serious relationship. Her parents got to know and desperately tried to get them to breakup. Colleague ended up dating her step bro in secret.\n\nIt's an open secret in the office at this point. Awkward, because the stepdad was also in upper management. Anyway, her parents find out again and try to get them to break up a second time. It's all gets rather public and ugly and quite embarrassing for her Mom and stepdad who are now senior figures in the industry running their own company.\n\nColleague tells us that she's been given ultimatums from her Mum. Doesn't describe what they are. Suddenly, she stops showing up to work and emails her resignation. She tells HR that she's moving to the US to find some peace. Colleague also texts some folk at work to tell then that she's had enough of the drama and moving away.\n\nA few weeks pass and there's no news from her until her step bro/ boyfriend starts contacting all her work friends. I wasn't contacted but some of my teammates were. Stepbro is desperately trying to get in touch with her she's broken up with him via text. He wants to know if anyone's heard from her. He doesn't believe that she now lives in the US and that she'd go without telling him. Everyone writes him off as a guy who couldn't handle the rejection, until he goes to the police and files a missing persons case. \n\nPolice actually made a few inquiries to everyone's suprise. It doesn't happen often because they usually dgaf. This is still a developing country after all. In the end the cops write the stepbro off as a lovesick loon and everything settles down. For a while at least.\n\nStepbro has gone crazy, now claiming that he thinks something bad happened to her. Says he's fallen out with his parents over it. No one at work wants to get involved in this family drama, especially since the parents are important people. Things die down again, until they don't.\n\nFast forward two years and no one's heard from our colleague, until the cops come calling. They've arrested her mom's chauffeur on an unrelated charge and he confesses to murdering our colleague. Even leads them to the body. He doesn't however reveal a motive. He must have been stalking her think the police until they investigate further. Our colleague never went to the US. Turns out the emails she sent weren't from her either. They were sent after her death.\n\nThe texts, the emails and the breakup were all from her Mom. She covered her tracks after she orchestrated the murder of her own daughter. All because she wouldn't stop dating her step brother and was going to marry him.\n\nSorry for the bad grammar. English isn't my first language. I'd forgotten some details. The colleague's Mum always had a strained relationship with her daughter. At social events she often claimed to be her sister, through everyone knew it wasn't true. I think bio dad was also involved in the murder somehow. The whole thing was one giant clusterfuck.",

I think my grandparents were married for 6-10 years or something like that before they divorced. When my mom was about 20, dad was 26 and he asked her out. They've been married for like 35 years.\n\nThe complicated bit is that I have an Aunt that was born from the marriage of my maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather. So my parents share a half-sibling. But they're no longer step siblings.\n\nEdit: Re-phrased a sentence for clarity.\n\nAlso, guys, there are plenty of other southern hillbilly ass states aside from Alabama, unless I'm missing a reference to something. That being said, every generation beneath my great grandparents on both sides has been born and raised in CA. Although funnily enough, my aunt did move to a southern state when she got married.

Basically, turn the lights out and start beating the shit out of each other with pillows or anything we could find. I know it sounds like a sick game.

Then, her parents both died in a car accident, and his parents had agreed to adopt her if such an incident were ever to occur. \n\nHis mom was kinda weird and made him start calling her sister, and none of his family knew he was head over heels in love with this girl, or if they suspected a crush they pretended not to.

We only hung out for a few years, and it was because my mom and his mom were work friends who hung out outside of work a lot during that time. I don't know what school he went to or what church they went to. I don't remember his school friends' names. I'm only about 70% sure I'm even remembering the girl's name correctly. The only avenue I could think of exploring is asking my mom what her former coworker's name is or if she remembers where they moved to, but that's a really weird question to bring up 15 years later so I don't really plan on going that route. I just gave his name another search, but it's a fairly common name and without more to go off of it's sort of impossible to find a match on social media. Sorry to disappoint.",

She was his step sister and younger brother's ex wife. My cousins became my step siblings. Uncle lived around the corner. Her kids did not like being told what to do by their uncle. My dad always felt like she treated me and my sister poorly. My Grandma threatened to disown my dad several times for marrying her. They were together for about a year before step mom couldn't handle Dad's drinking anymore and he said he was sick of her kids disrespecting him and her not treating my sister and me good enough. We moved out but they stayed married for over ten years. Cousin/step siblings weren't as close with us after that and my sister and I were kinda considered black sheep of the family. \n\nToo bad.

We were hanging out one night (at home, my dad and her mo asleep) and she basically decided she wanted to get laid. So we fucked. It was far from her first time but it was mine.

That was awkward, but it was easier to deal with once my step-sister and her mom had a falling out and stopped talking.

            "I'll take \"Things that caused my dads divorce and destroyed by baby sisters life\" for $100 Alex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little backstory: When I was 5 years old, my parents divorced  and my dad moved out. For the first couple years I was still pretty close to him, he lived around the corner from us and I was at his house every weekend. Sadly, our relationship pretty much ended when his job transferred him from California to Texas. After his move, I only saw him on holidays. A few years later he married a woman with two daughters around my age. They ended up having a third daughter shortly afterward, and being a resentful 12-year-old living with a rather spiteful mom, I pretty much wrote him off. A couple of holiday visits, and then nothing....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few years. I'm 16, my mom has married a total asshole, I have a brand new baby brother and my home life is miserable. A few days after a violent fight between me and my stepdad, I came home from school, walked into my house...and there sat my dad. I hadn't seen him in years, but he'd apparently moved back to California with his family and was there to take me to his new house. My mom had called him. She was done with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't a sex story or a porno, so I'm not going into all of the lurid details, but here's the gist: I was 16, a decent looking guitar player, and was angry at the world. My oldest stepsister was 15, pretty hot (to a 16 year old) and was no virgin. We hadn't seen each other for years, and before that had only seen each other on a handful of holidays when I was flown out to visit. There was no sibling vibe between us. We were hooking up within a week, and it became a pretty regular, almost daily, thing for about a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then, one day, her mom came home from work early.  Caught in flagrante delicto.  Her mom literally walked into my bedroom and caught us mid-thrust. To say she had an instant melt-down would be the understatement of the century. Items were thrown. Words were said. My stepsister curled into a  little ball and tried to wish herself to death. Not that it mattered...my stepmom was clearly convinced that I'd corrupted and probably raped her innocent daughter. It was clearly, obviously, all my fault. Shortly after that, my dad came home. That's when my stepmom decided that I needed to go to jail. She wanted to call the police and have me prosecuted for rape. No Romeo and Juliet laws in those days kiddos!  My dad, to his credit, jumped to my defense and got me the hell out of there. The next day I was living with my mom again. That situation still sucked, but at least I wasn't being threatened with prosecution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then the other shoe dropped. My stepsister was pregnant, and neither she or her mom believed in abortion. So...I was having a baby. My stepmom flipped out all over again, actually called the DA's office, and made a more serious push to get me prosecuted. My dad was completely opposed to it. Between the stress of the pregnant teen in the house and that fight, their marriage basically disintegrated. The baby was adopted out at birth, and we mostly went our separate ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still see my now-former stepsister occasionally (we still share a common half-sister), and we both agree that it was a dumb thing to do, but that our parents (mostly her mom) made the whole thing so much worse than it had to be. We laugh about the stupidity of the whole thing, but there's definitely one thing that we both feel extremely guilty about. Our little sister watched her entire family disintegrate over it. She's 26 years old and doesn't seem to resent us for it, but thinking about that still makes me feel like crap...she was the only one of us that had a shot at growing up in  a normal 2-parent household, and we took that away from her because we were a couple of horny teenagers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd before anyone asks, we do not know what happened to the baby. She went to a very good family, but we all agreed that a closed adoption was best for everyone.",

            "The story of champ the goat. Originally told by u/stoicsmile about a goat who his company would rent out to eat shrubs and do landscaping. \n\nI used to work for on a forestry and conservation crew. We tried to offer this service with the goat that for some reason hung out in the field next to our shop, which I guess we owned...maybe?\n\nAnyway, the goat's name was Champ, and I wouldn't be surprised if we accidentally stole Champ at one point, because Champ hated to be alone, and if you left him alone, he would find a way through or over any enclosure you left him in and wander around until he found a companion.\n\nTo Champ, a companion could be a person, a dog, a chicken, a bicycle, a basketball, anything that his little goat mind imagined was a living creature. He especially like things that seemed to have some kind of life or that made noise. Like generators and sump pumps.\n\nSo when we rented Champ out to people, we warned them that he needed some kind of company, or he would escape. We often recommended something like a blow-up pool toy or even just an open umbrella. Just something nearby that Champ could imagine was his friend.\n\nInevitably people would underestimate Champ's squirreliness, and assume that their fence/tether/stone wall was sufficient to keep him where they wanted to be, and they would leave him alone.\nThen we'd have to go find Champ.\n\nOne time I found him in a scrapyard munching on weeds between rows of crushed cars. One time I found him curled up in the shade in a neighbor's yard with a Golden Retriever.\n\nBut I think the best was when he made his way onto an elementary school playground. We of course had a tag on his collar with a phone number to call if he was found since he went missing so much. And one day, we got a call from a school principal informing us that he had our goat. For those of you who don't know much about goats, they delight in climbing on things. So for Champ, there was no place more attractive than the very top of the metal play structure at this playground. The kids were absolutely smitten with him, and he was absolutely thrilled to have so many friends. And he was ecstatic to be at the top of the play structure too.\n\nIt wasn't until all the kids went inside after recess that we could get him down. I think it was the best day of his life.\n\nEdit: [here is the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/36209d/til_of_rent_a_goat_landscaping_services_whereby/cra4qwx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\nAlso I added paragraphs because it did have them originally.

            "\nThere were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\nJust moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\nSomewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\nFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\nFor just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.",

            "Betty White as Rose Nylund and Rue McClanahan as Blanche Devereaux.\n\nIn fact, Bea Arthur wasn't even interested in doing Golden Girls at first, because she though Betty would be playing Blanche, and Rue would be playing Rose, and figured it just wouldn't be interesting to have them reprise the types of roles they'd played before. \n\nBut when she was told that Betty would be playing the sweet, ditzy woman and Rue would be playing the man-hungry diva/vixen, she thought it was a great idea and came on-board.\n\nAlso, I'll admit that Eva Longoria didn't impress me at first on Desperate Housewives as Gaby Solis. But once she got comfortable with the role, she really became my favorite of the main cast (if we don't count Edie), and was the funniest one on there. And she could nail the dramatic scenes, too.\n\nRicardo Antonio Chivara should also get credit for making Carlos go from an insufferable, abusive prick to a loveable, sympathetic, funny husband. It almost seems like season 1 Carlos was just a fever dream. Plus, he and Eva had perfect chemistry once the writing for them started to improve.",

            "My initial reaction is yes because I'd never get a chance like this ever again, but really it's dependent on so many factors about the trip and the company I'd be keeping.\n\nWho is the alien? Are we talking some kind of super-hot space babe with slightly different coloured skin and kinky shapeshifting powers? or some kind of amorphous horror out of a Lovecraft novel? Are they a respected member of their race, a crazed kook outsider, or are they each a god unto themselves and therefore aren't even a coherent civilisation as we recognise them?\n\nWhat \"experiences\" are we talking as well? Visiting asteroids and dead planets would be cool, but I can imagine it gets old after a while especially if all I'm doing is sightseeing and not collecting knowledge for later use. Will there be lots of first contacts with other races to share technology and culture? Does this \"trip\" have an end, or it continues until we decide to stop?\n\nDo I get to see the society the Alien comes from and start a new life along with discarding my old one? am I stuck within the confines of the vessel for all time, never speaking with another sentient being beside my alien partner?\n\nHow likely am I to die or be seriously injured? Will the Alien use their technology to resurrect and heal my mind and body every time without permanent negative effects? If they have the technology to do that, is it even possible for me to die at all?\n\nAlso, the big loophole here is that whilst I personally won't be coming back to earth, there is nothing saying that the Alien can't come back, or that knowledge and technology transfer cant happen that will catapult mankind into an interstellar species. Sure, I might be stuck on the ship, but people can still be brought up to me during visits or an extra-solar colony is established that allows me to retire/spend time amongst my own kind every now and then.\n\nIf I am going to consign myself to a life of adventure and travel across space and time, I'd like to have a means of sending information on what I've learned and samples of anything I can back home to give Mankind a leg up in development.",

It was an open secret that one of the other senior devs, a guy who had been there since the beginning, would sometimes spend time looking at plastic surgery photos--before/after shots, photos of active procedures, etc. He did it enough that people would poke fun at him about it, but he didn't seem embarrassed about it, and it wasn't harming anyone.\n\nWell, one day a project manager said something to the CEO about this guy's ongoing plastic surgery obsession, and the CEO flipped. He said that, going forward, no one was allowed to use their work computers to access external websites AT ALL.\n\nAnyone who's ever been a developer knows that half the job is googling stuff, so this policy pretty much halted productivity in its tracks. It only lasted a day before the CEO retracted the rule, but let everyone know that their browser history would be monitored going forward. After that, no one really changed their behavior, they just started remotely accessing their home computers to browse instead.",
            "I worked on this company that had mandatory 1 hour lunch breaks. Since we ate on the premises, our lunch break was often 15 minutes or so. We tried negotiating having shorter lunch breaks so we could leave earlier and beat traffic. Next day an e-mail was sent from the own stating the fixed work and break hours for the whole team, and they were to be followed no exceptions.\n\nCool! Next week, a big client called about half way through our lunch, and nobody moved. It rang and rang until said owner took the call, talked to them, and immediately came to scold us. \"Sorry, boss, as per your rules, we are off until 1PM, no exceptions\".\n\nA couple of weeks later, we did some work on site for the same client. They were, to be honest, one of the coolest clients I ever had in my life. They took us out to lunch, and while talking we ended up relaying the owner's rule. They had a big chuckle over it, and while the project lasted, they made a point to always call while we were at lunch break just to annoy owner.",

We made a great arrangement: I would crash at his place and spend the evenings drinking beer, watching movies and play videogames. In return, I used the gift allowance to order dinner for the two of us.\n\nAfter submitting my first expense report, I was told by some HR drone that the gift allowance was supposed to be used seldomly and not for food for myself. \n\nSo I booked a room in a five star hotel, was upgraded to a junior suite because of my rewards status and invited my friend to evenings of beer, video games and room service.\n\nAfter my second expense report, the project manager asked me about the tripling of the expenses compared to the first report. After explaining the situation and pointing out what sum of money it would mean over the 6 months, he got in contact with HR...\n\nTwo days later, the rule was recinded. The project even got my friend (the then newly released) PS3 as a thank you for letting me stay with him.",

(I can access the building cameras from home. The most common alarm was the cleaning crew who were always messing up the disarming.)\n\nThen a sister site ignored an alarm that turned out to be an actual break-in, and the facilities director decided that no matter what, if there was an alarm we should have the alarm company summon the police, then go to the building, get the police all clear, and re-set the alarm. This was a pain in the ass but rare enough and I lived literally 2 minutes away.\n\nThen we contracted for the alarm company to come in and replace all of our panels and sensors. It was a nightmare process that ultimately ended up taking months, and the whole time there were phantom alarms, sometimes multiple times a  night. \n\nEach time I had to go out in the middle of the night, I'd prepare the required report, send it to the facilities director, and request to go back to the old process. Each time he said no, we couldn't afford to miss a potential real break-in. \n\nAfter about three weeks of this nonsense, I was due for some time off. I was going out of town, and the protocol for that was for me to ignore calls from the alarm company so they moved to the next person on the list... which happened to be the facilities director. \n\nIn the five days I was off, I must have ignored at least four overnight calls that all would have gone to him next. Then suddenly, nothing.

            "Worked for a global communications company that internally rolled out 'Kaizan'. A supposed Japanese work ethic thing. Started off that all meetings were never to commence on the hour or half hour, they all had to be quirky like 11.38am or 15.27.\nThe forced 'be happy and if you don't like it leave' conversations began.\nIt then progressed into weekly, sometimes daily Kaizan sessions where any negativity was recorded, printed off in BIG font and hung above our desks on card cut into cloud shapes.\nThis evolved into literal bin bags full of shredded paper having to be kept on our desks (they were massive desks so there was still space to work).\nBy this point the 'smile whilst you dial' motto that had been introduced  was not working, so a giant bloody paper train was stuck on the windows. Seriously a bloody train segment per window with the Kaizan buzz words written on them. From the outside it looked like our office floor was a nursery., from the inside it looked like a shitty place to work. \nNow moral was low and people start wondering if redundancies are coming. A company would rather have you quit than pay redundancies.\nWell indeed there were on the horizon but at the time it was only staff speculation. \nFiguring they want people to quit and we would prefer redundancy pay, we play along. We put up with being treated like toddlers and were openly asked 'to fake it whilst you make it'  and so we faked smiled when addressing the 'leaders' as they were now known. We faked dumb. Work suffered. We dragged the hell out of those meetings with our commitment to rid ourselves of negativity. We ran out of space for bin bags on desks. We commented on how others really loved that our company opened a creche (as indicated by the running along the windows). We asked for another train for the remaining windows. It was stupid. Everyone knew everyone was being insincere.\nOne day the leaders broke. We could address them as Managers again and all rubbish could be cleared away.  \nIn hindsight the cleaning contractors probably played a large part as all that crap stopped them from doing their jobs properly. \nWe all went back to being adults.\n\nEpilogue: Company tries other bullshit a year later to drive people out right before announcing mass redundancies and site closures.\n\nTLDR: Company treated us like toddlers. We acted like toddlers. Clients unhappy.",

It's honestly pretty nice and our buffet runner keeps anyone from doing ungodly things to the buffet.\n\nBut the one incident that will always stand out to me was when this family of five came in. From the moment they came in to the moment they left, they ate as many crab legs as they possibly could. Their server and I were clearing plates off as fast as we could. But every time we would return it seemed like another mountain of crab leg shells would appear in front of each member of that family. I know not how they ate so much and I honestly can't recall if they are anything besides the crab. Piles upon piles of shells were left upon the table after they left. It was truly a sight to behold.\n\nWhat's more is after I wiped down the table and came back with settings, I had to get another rag to wipe down the table *again* because something in the crab leg juice combined with our sanitizer and left a nice milky residue upon the table. Delicious.\n\nWhen I leave this job I'll never be able to look at crab legs the same way.",

Like, right in front of the buffet line, hiding his face behind his takeout container. And then he took the chicken bone and *put it back in the buffet tray*. \n \nI walked over to my mom and told her what he was doing, and at first she thought I was joking. So she walked over towards him and now he was standing there eating a slice of watermelon right off the buffet, and then *putting the rind back in the tray.* \n \nSo my mom is like \"What the fuck are you doing!?\" and he's like \"Don't worry, I do this all the time! They never notice!\".  \n \nSo of course both me and mom are panicking, worried that they're gonna call the cops or something because of this disphit. We basically pretended to not know him and continued to fill up our containers *the right way*. \n \nAfter a couple minutes, one of the employees walks up to my mom and tells her that they noticed what the guy was doing, and they noticed that we were also uncomfortable about it and didn't intend to blame us. But they warned her that if she doesn't get him to pay for the food in his container and leave immediately, they'll be calling the police.  \n \nSo of course mom tells him that we need to go. Now. And he just brushes it off like \"I don't care. They're not gonna do anything!\" \n \nWell, me and mom walked up to the front, paid for our containers, apologized, and walked out and left him in there. A minute later, you can see and hear him shouting with the staff. He throws his container on the ground and food splatters everywhere. He storms out, shouting insults as he leaves, and of course gives them a \"I'm never coming back!\", to which they reply \"You're not allowed in here no more! We'll call the cops!\" \n \nSo we're standing out by the car, waiting for him. Of course, we yell at him for being a piece of shit.

They would come out a few minutes later with empty glasses, ask for the check and leave. I finally put it together that they were bulimic after I walked in the women's bathroom and it smelled like vomit. Very polite folks and tipped well though.",

Glasses, plates and a whole lot more of junk. My sister asked the lady if she needed any assistance, to which the lady replied 'You assume because I'm fat, I need help?' My sister didn't react.

Depending on what they left behind. \n\nWe have seen people try the weirdest stuff if it comes to not paying extra; people dumping food in their handbags, to people shoving it in their mouths then go to the toilet and flush it, to putting hair on it and blaming us for it (we see them pull this stuff), etc.\n\nAnd when we actually catch them doing it, they blame us for it and refuse to pay.

By the time his weirdness devolved to aggression and we had to 86 him, he was coming in for two things: pickles and ranch dressing.

Essentially I was the de facto janitor of the place.\n\nThis one time I had to clean the bathrooms after the place closed. No problems in the female bathroom, but when I went into the male restroom the image was burned into my retina instantly. An old man was lying on the floor, face down in a puddle of muck. Not just any sewage muck, but opaque, black muck. It had the color of motor oil. Smelled awful too, like a mix of fecal matter and rotting durian. Certainly didn't help that the liquid wasn't just smeared all over the floor, but spread across the walls too. There were fucking hand prints across the wall, presumably when the geezer was trying to stand himself up.\n\nI peered into the toilet, more of that brown liquid, along with chunks of corny poop. There's also this fluid in your digestion called chyme. It's basically the thing right before food turns into poop, the pulpy acidic liquid with partially digested food in it. I could see scraps of chicken breast and sauce mixed in there with the pulpy chyme.\n\nAs for the old guy? Well, turns out, he didn't merely faint. He actually *died*, I was in a room with a fresh, decomposing corpse in the stages of Algor mortis. He had his pants off, presumably he shit himself to death but I don't know. Fucker emptied himself like one of those cement mixers you'd see in a cartoon. Except you just replace the cement with a liquid that embodies death itself.\n\nNeedless to say, I, like him, emptied my digestive contents, just from the opposite end that he did. After that I quit.

            "I worked at a pizza buffet for 2 years during collage.  I have a number of stories, but the one that i will always remember is the guy who got super upset that we wouldn't make more dessert pizza, when we were half an hour past closing time.  \n\nThis guy comes in with his presumed wife and 2 children around 8:30.  We close at 9.  Nothing out of the ordinary happens until 9 rolls around, where it was still commonplace for people to be finishing up and eating what pizza was still left.  I was doing the dishes and taking the empty dishes back from the buffet and i see this guy, arms crossed and staring at me as i take the empty dessert pizza dish.  He says something to the effect of \"whens the next one coming out, i never got any\" I let him know that we close at 9 and we cant really make anything past then because the oven gets shut off.  Luckily the manager overheard this and stepped in to back me up and I quickly scamper off to the back to continue the dishes.  He seamed pissed, but it wasn't unheard of, as being a cheep pizza buffet, you don't exactly bring in the most affluent of folks. About 5 min later, as I'm finishing up the plates, the same manager comes barreling through the back door, out of breath.  He grabs 2 of the long wooden pizza pushers, and says come with me.  I have no idea whats going on, but i grab the pusher and follow him out the door.  I learned later on, that he started flipping out, throwing the register and  a fishbowl.  He grabbed a broom and swung that around, hitting the girl behind the counter. [this bit we caught on camera](https://youtu.be/kQVyRZQZ9xc?t=26) As I exit from the back this guy is screaming and ranting unintelligibly.  He was just asking for a fight. He walked up to the manager got all up in his face and kinda choke pushed him back.  He came at me next and i was really really close to taking a swing at his knees or something but the other manager had quickly gotten back up and he resumed harassing him.  After about 2 min of tip-toeing around a brawl, and his wife presumably screaming for him to get back in the car, he eventually gets in and they drive off.

The restaurant in question I won't say the name of, but rhymed with Meat'n Bark. \n\nMost of the customers that we got at the restaurant in general would be old people, however, a lot of the old people were very entitled and would come straight from church to the restaurant for their breakfast buffet.

I said, many times, my real age (17 at the time) and she kept saying \"I bet they're just making you say that, you know it's illegal that they're making you do this!\" and I'm just at a loss and don't know what else to tell this lady who is 100% confident that I must be under-age or working for free or something. I don't know what her goal was.\n2.

What am I looking for?\" and he said \"Tell me what's wrong with that!\" and I say \"Um, I don't know, is it not clean or something?\" and he says \"THERE's NO BACON LEFT! Aren't you going to re-fill it!?\" and I'm like \"Well that's weird it was just filled a couple minutes ago, someone must have took it all!\" (knowing it was him) and he couldn't put 2 and 2 together, and just said \"I don't know but there's no bacon there so what are we going to do about it?\" \n3. Some lady looking at bacon in disgust and saying \"Wow.. It's 2013, who even eats meat anymore? Really?\"\n4. Some lady shows up to the buffet 15 minutes after it closes, while we're taking it down, and says \"Woh woh what are you doing!? I haven't even gotten my food yet!\" and we tell her politely that the buffet had closed 15 minutes ago, and the servers even give a \"last call\" on the buffet 15 minutes before it closes. Her response \"That's okay I'll just go complain to your manager\" I just said okay sounds good. In my head I'm like, what, you're going to tell my manager that the buffet closed 15 minutes ago? He knows. Lmao\n5. Nothing huge but the same lady would come to the restaurant at least twice a week and complain about how shitty her service is each time and how the food is terrible. Finally one of the hostesses said \"if the service is so bad and the food is so bad then why do you come here multiple times a week?\" which shut her up. Lmao.",

            "When I was 16 I was a busboy at one. This  morbidly obese family (4 people - 2 parents, 2 teenagers - all gigantic)  came in after the noon-hour when it was slow and were taking FULL advantage of the all you can eat buffet. On my way to busing tables I walk by the bathrooms and see the teen-aged son walk out of the men's room with a HUGE shit-eating grin on his round, pre-pubescent face. I immediately thought this can't be good and went to go check on the restroom, as one of our responsibilities was to make sure that the restrooms were generally clean.\n\nThis guy had explosive diarrhea and had not even managed to  hit the toilet. There was shit allover the toilet tank, the walls and the floor. No lie - It looked like a hand-grenade of shit went off in the stall. Bar-none the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in a bathroom.\n\nI thought about cleaning it up, but instead I went to tell my manager. He was a pretty hard-driving guy, but he took one look at it, locked the stall and told me, \"Yeah, you don't get paid enough to clean this up. We'll get the janitor to take of this tonight.\"",
            "Not a \"Horror\" story, just funny.\n\nI worked at Wendy's when they had salad bars. You could get a single-serving bowl (They used to serve eat-in chili in Styrofoam bowls, and the Large doubled as a chili bowl), or \"All you can eat\" platters. (The Taco Salad bottom plate.)\n\nOn a slow afternoon, this guy came in and got a single serving bowl. After a few minutes, our manager motioned to me and the sandwich guy to discreetly take a look at the salad he was making.\n\nThe guy had filled the bowl with salad, then made a ring of overlapping cucumber slices to extend the lip of the bowl upwards. He filled that with salad, then added another ring. It took several minutes to build this thing, but by the time he'd finished, he had a tower of salad well over a foot tall, wth multiple rings of cucumber slices containing it. \n\nThat salad was an engineering marvel. He carefully carried it back to his table, sat down, then looked up guiltily as our manager walked out to him.\n\nThe manager handed him a \"free item\" coupon, and said, \"That is the most impressive salad I have ever seen. Your next one is on me.\"",
            " I served at Golden Corral for 6 months and it was a God-awful place. You'd think it would be easy because you don't take orders, right? Wrong. Cleaning up the messes, bussing tables, getting drinks and clean plates, singing for birthdays plus side work definitely kept you busy. Most of the customers weren't the greatest--they made an appalling mess, let their kids run wild, didn't tip (we were paid $2.13/hr and needed tips) no matter how much you bent over backward for them. I saw so many unaccompanied kids reaching into the buffet serving dishes; I saw one kid dip his marshmallow into the chocolate fountain, lick the chocolate off, and put the same marshmallow back in over and over. The customers weren't normally very easy to deal with; rudeness was the norm there...for example people got into a physical fight over a table on Easter Sunday.\n\nThe managers were dicks. They abused everyone, both seemed to hate women, and took advantage of the fact that a lot of the staff was foreign. When we got a negative mystery shop report, we all were gathered into a meeting to be screamed at. When the next shop report was excellent, nothing at all was said, the report was just posted to the bulletin board. My one boss told me to be sure to report all my tips to the IRS, since he was \"sure I'd be a waitress all my life\" he wanted to \"make sure I'd get something from social security when I was old\" (Spoiler: I'm no longer a waitress, I have a great job with an excellent retirement plan. Not that serving isn't a good job, but it made me so mad that I was 22 at the time and this was his assumption). The managers carried the tea bags in their pockets--if your customer wanted a cup of tea, you had to track a boss down and they would snarlingly, begrudgingly hand one over. Servers were also expected to catch and confront people stealing from the buffet (putting leftovers in their bag for example).\n\nWe weren't allowed to eat. Most cheaper restaurants will give you a meal per shift, but not GC. It was hard when you saw how much was wasted to not think you deserved a piece of bread or broken cookie maybe. To eat you had to clock out, get in line, pay half price, get your plate, and then sit down. After 5 minutes a manager would almost always come over and say \"we're busy, break's over\" so you had to get back to work and throw your food away. I'm hypoglycemic so my solution was to eat right before work and carry a granola bar in my pocket. I could eat the bar and get away with it in the women's bathroom because the managers were both men. One time, I was so stressed out and trying to scarf down my bar while in the next stall, a very large woman took a very large and smelly dump. I realized that it was one of the worst moments in my life. I quit shortly thereafter, got a much better job and called up GC's corporate office to tell them everything.",

We were constantly dealing with gross things - people sticking gum to tables, walking in wearing swimsuits, dripping wet, with no shoes on (this one we finally told the people they had to stop doing it) and even just some of the practices were disgusting (there's a reason I will never eat grape tomatoes at a restaurant ever again) but the worst was this family that would come in at least once a week. They were all very obese except for the husband who was super scrawny and looked perpetually exhausted, the woman was missing a bunch of teeth, wore 1970s style glasses, and they all smelled slightly like urine. She would ride in on her scooter and pay for her dinner with vouchers and then make request after request. They NEVER ate off of the buffet, which means that every pizza they ordered was sent to their table directly (I don't know if they still do this or not) and every one was wrong. I legitimately have no idea whether the son was developmentally delayed or just....socially award but it felt like he and the mom worked as a team. One pizza would come out, they'd eat about 3/4 of it and then realized something was wrong - no problem, we'll make another. No, they wanted something different - a zesty pepperoni with mushrooms. Oh, these mushrooms are canned, I wanted fresh (also after eating 3/4) so in goes another order only to be wrong. The whole time the woman starts berating whoever is tasked with delivering the pizza or whoever she can wave over to their table because none of them get up - they even do this to get people to refill their drinks. As this is all going on the son is getting more and more upset because his pizzas, THAT HE STILL ATE MOST OF, are wrong and starts getting loud, gets up and starts pacing back and forth, etc. It eventually escalates to a point where we offer to remake (after 2-3 pizzas) and the woman is yelling about how we keep messing it up why would she want to come back here to eat, we just can't seem to get it right, maybe it's that Mex-E-CAN we have in the back making the pizzas, if he knew English maybe he'd know how to do it right, blah blah blah until the manager rushes out and gives them vouchers for a free meal on us and they \"ok, well maybe we'll be back but I just don't know\" and then a week - maybe two weeks later here they come rolling back in.

I say yes and he says \"You wanna go here?\" while motioning to some Golden Corral type place that's built into the mall. I say \"OK!\" because I'm a teenaged bottomless pit. We walk around the stations, get our plates full, and sit down to eat. We are eating for maybe 5 minutes when we both hear a loud commotion. Not sure what the sound is, we look up at each other and then around the dining area, both confused as to what we are hearing/where it is coming from. And then we both see it.\n\nAcross the dining room, a morbidly obese man is sitting at a long table by himself. The alarming sound we were hearing was his loud, guttural wretching. That's when I see the most violent spray of vomit I've ever witnessed. There was soooo much, it must have been a solid six or seven heaves. And he wasn't even slumped over! He was such a big person that as the vomit was spraying out of his mouth, only his head was jerking back and forth. He was trying to cover his mouth with his hand, but it looked like it had the same affect as when you hold your thumb over the end of a water hose. The spray easily covered his table, covered his plates, and then was spilling over the edges onto the floor. Near the end of the heaves, there was less pressure so it was just oozing out of his mouth and onto his chin, chest, belly, and thighs.\n\nHe doesn't move. He sits in it. Some employees who didn't look like they were much older than me run over and take inventory of the damage. They are asking him if he is ok. They are apologizing. They are taking his vomit covered plates away. They are wiping the table off with wet rags. One of them brings a bucket and mop over. He uses some of the rags to clean himself up. The people who were sitting near him have already gotten up and left in obvious disgust. My uncle and I cannot look away. The employees leave. He's doesn't move. He sits there. I go back to eating my food because I'm a hungry teenager. A few minutes later, while I'm eating, my uncle gets my attention and motions for me to look back at the man's table. We both watch him stand up, grab his walker, walk back over to a station, and start to serve himself more food. He went back to his table, sat down, and continued to eat.

I can't even keep track of the number of times we had to close down the chocolate fountain to replace the chocolate that had been contaminated because some idiot thought it would be funny to stick their hand or face into it.\n\nThis place was also the only establishment that I have ever had to work where the carpets were professionally deep cleaned almost weekly because people would gorge themselves and then vomit on the floors.

I thought I had struck a chord with him and he learned a lesson. Fucking nope, he dumps his whole ass cup of coffee in the fresh off the grill pan of scrambled eggs. Somehow he convinced the store manager that it \u201cwas just an accident\u201d  \n\nAbout a week goes by before he makes his return, I see him grab a 12 oz cup and start squeezing honey into it like it was cool. I walked right over and grabbed that cup out of his hand and walked it into my managers office and told him to see who done it. He was subsequently banned from the store, trespassed by the police, and had his co op ownership fees returned. \n\nHe ran into me and my girlfriend at a local restaurant on the 4th of July. As he was walking in I look up and we make eye contact and I kind of loudly said \u201cYo that\u2019s the fucking dickhead with the coffee!\u201d He turned around, got in his car, and left. \n\nFuck that guy, and fuck that job.",
            "My first job was at a Southern buffet which had fried chicken livers as a specialty item on rotation on Tuesdays. Worked there for a couple years and never cared enough to truly notice which foods came when, I just wrote out the names on the sneeze guards with some horrid neon marker I hated scrubbing off come closing. I had started as a cashier, but I was good enough and bored enough that I asked for more. Eventually, turnover was high enough that I got to know the district manager and he made me an \"hourly manager.\" I could switch positions as needed throughout the restaurant and it kept things interesting. \n\nOn this one specific Tuesday, I was back on the register. Most of the customers were regulars. I rang up a trio of sheriff's deputies, a family with twin boys that would scream and eventually throw bread rolls but always cleaned up after themselves, a family with only one kid but this girl was a *spoiled **brat*** who all servers hoped didn't sit in their section, half a grey-haired quartet because, wait, the other Mr. Whatshisface *died*? Man, they'd been coming here for years! And then there's this one big guy who came in a couple times a week. He was quiet and polite, always alone. He sometimes got a takeout box and then went on his way. \n\nThis one particular day, he came in and asked for a to-go box. I provided it, he thanked me, and went to go fill it. Customers paid by the pound, so it was something like $5/lb for mixed buffet food, whatever you stuff into it, and $4/lb for only salad.  This big guy walked over to the food bars and I went back to cashiering.  There restaurant was decorated in such a way that I could watch most of the floor via mirrors and no one was coming in right then, so I kept an eye on things, called for the hot fried chicken to be replaced. \n\nBig guy circled the hot bars a few times, then came back to me and said, \"there's no chicken livers out. You guys usually have chicken livers today.\"  Using my best customer service voice, I apologized and went to investigate. Came back out to say they could drop some in the fryer for him, but it's going to be X amount of minutes. He said that was fine and went off to the side to wait. He was getting a little agitated.\n\nMy general manager came out a few minutes later to say, \"I'm sorry, but the chicken livers are frozen. We thought we were out and found some in the back, but they won't be ready to fry until they're fully thawed. We can make sure to put some out for you tomorrow, if you'd like.\"\n\n\"That's not good enough! You're supposed to have them today!\" Angry big man barked and threw the empty to-go container at an unoccupied counter.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir, but--\" said my manager. He was a bit of an aloof ass, but could be polite and professional enough to keep the place from burning down.\n\n\"Where's your number for corporate!? I want to talk to your boss!\"\n\n\"Yes sir, I'll go get that for you.\" Manager walked off and left me tending the register maybe three or four yards from this guy. Comes back with the restaurant's own cordless already dialed in to corporate. \"Here you go, sir, all you have to do is press the green button and it'll call corporate.\"\n\nAngry Guy spit out that insulting, \"Thank you\" I'm sure many of us have heard before, and walked off into our side banquet room to call. After a few minutes, he was eventually yelling into the phone enough that servers in the rest of the restaurant were coming over to ask me what was going on, all their tables could hear the commotion.  \n\nSoon enough, I heard there phone conversation winding down with no results Angry Guy was looking for, so I called Manager back to the front. I sure as shit didn't want to get head bitten off.\n\nManager showed up just as now-red-faced Angry Guy hung up and he shoved the phone at Manager.  \"Here.\"\n\nManager, being almost a foot shorter than this big angry white customer, probably a foot less round the middle, and black, backed up.  \"Thank you, sir, you can put it on the counter.\"\n\n\"Take the phone! I'm done!\" He stepped closer to Manager and waved the phone again. I'm not certain Angry Guy was processing English anymore.\n\n\"Sir, please step back,\" Manager calmly requested and backed up again. He might have been an ass, but he kept his cool in a way that I still find impressive.\n\n\"Take the goddamned phone!\" Angry man shouted and shoved the phone into Manager, pushing Manager into the counter behind him.\n\nThe three deputies materialized from behind me and tackled the big angry guy to the ground in an amazingly efficient dogpile, and quickly hauled him off to step outside. Two watched Angry Guy and called for an on-duty car while the third one came back in to check on Manager. On duty guy arrived soon, they placed Angry Guy under arrest, took statements (I had to write it all out, that's why I remember it so well!) and left. \n\nSo now there's a guy somewhere around my hometown who's got a record for assault over chicken livers.",

Several years ago, my Parents were visiting, and they really wanted to go to a buffet that they had heard about.  Since it was only about 20 minutes away, I figured it was worth a chance. \n\nWe go through a few rounds, and I feel it. The gurgling. The rumbling. \nEveryone at the table can see my discomfort. They know what\u2019s going on. They ask if we need to leave. I tell them I\u2019ll be fine. This was bad.

            "It's not *what* I say, but *how* I say it. Do the energy vampire thing from What We Do In The Shadows. In a monotone, unequaled manner, describe a very mundane thing and it's history. Or literally just say obvious things about it. Try to stretch this for as long as possible. If this becomes difficult, segue into other boring and obvious things. The trick is to sound like you're very interested in only talking about these things and nothing else, barely acknowledging that the other person exists, while also assuming they do or do not share knowledge or enthusiasm, yet maintaining a very steady monotone voice. However you also want to do this in a way that shows that a written version would have no paragraph breaks. It's just nonstop droning that should put people to sleep but just doesn't let them somehow. If they do it's a micronap where they can't even be sure they did sleep. This will be aided by the monotone voice that will.make it very difficult to tell if they missed anything. You just keep droning on and on and on, and they either leave or they continue to listen out of some sense of obligation. Never quite offput to get aggravated but too nice to just stop what's happening. With just the right amount of attention to allow them to feel engaged yet also little enough consideration that they never quite find a natural point to turn the conversation or interject. If they do manage to get a word in edgewise you can simply continue off what they said and steer it right back to the monotone. This is a sneaky way to let them feel like some kind of progress is being made but keeps them from actually engaging. They'll continually wonder if they are actually conversing or if they've just been listening to you talk. They'll be present enough to remember that they've conversed but too bored to understand that the conversation hasn't really been a conversation and has been going on for far too long. This will go especially well if you can find a way to keep them from checking the time, but if they do check the time you can pretend to politely remark on it in a way that seems like you're are genuinely curious but mildly guilts them for checking the time when all you've done is try to talk to them. You can also return to old topics and make lame jokes about coming full circle. Bonus points can be had if you seem to return to things they've talked about because they'll feel even more obligated to give you a fair chance because you've been listening to them, so walking out on you would been and rude. Once this has been going on long enough they'll be caught in an endless circle of trying to find a way out without seeming rude and reminding themselves that it would be cruel to simply walk out on you when you're simply engaging them in conversation. You can even get a waiter involved briefly to add on more guilt by seeming somewhat interesting to them, but because the interaction will be brief they won't feel as bored. So the other person will start questioning if maybe they're a bad person to have these thoughts and will double down on not being rude by trying to engage more. But of course you simply absorb the new comments and go off on yet another tangent inspired by them interacting with you and this way you can add a fresh layer of entrapment on them. It'll become like a coat of paint that you apply over and over again as they continue to squirm underneath this monotone torture that never ends.\n\nSo anyway that's how I won a million dollars.",

America has to react, so American and Japanese troops are sent there, despite massive protests against the war by the population.\n\nDecember 2020: South Korea wins, but Seoul is mostly destroyed by nuclear and chemical weapons. China also doesn't want a US ally in its borders so it strikes back, and we have WW3.\n\nA slightly far fetched scenario, I know",
            "A plague of locusts-\n\nOh wait, that already happened\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/world/asia/india-locusts-jaipur.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/world/asia/india-locusts-jaipur.html)",
            "Being serious, there are a couple of things that are highly probable to happen this year.\n\n1. Brazil impeaches its president for corruption and human rights violations (not the actual charges but it\u2019s possible). And since that guy has the military by his side, it will get bloody. \n2. Hong Kong goes into a full civil war against the CCP. This mainly because it appears that the situation there is escalating.\n3. Bush fire season is about to start, so that is going to add more CO2 to the planet. It is highly possible that in summer 2021 we will pass the 2C line, fucking up the planet with more natural disasters, disruption of food supplies, global recession, and full scale panic.\n4. The US will have a problem this election year because it is almost sure Donald Trump is going to question the result if he doesn't win. If by some miracle he is removed from office, Joe Biden can either go for the heads of all the Trump enablers or just let them go. 50/50\n5. In Mexico, it looks like the war against drug cartels is going to start again (by this I referred to the drug war from 2012) because the president has tried to fight cartels with \u201dkisses and hugs\u201d but overall the situation has been worse because cartels see the government weak and they have been taking advantage to move against other cartels and the people, so violence has been up since summer 2019.\n6. It is also possible to have one or two migration crisis again. One in Europe and the other one from South America to the North.\n7. North Korea. Let's see how that one goes with the sister taking over.\n8. China and India can go to war, but maybe not this year. Situations are tense because there a lot of problems right now with China. HK, COVID-19 investigations, trade wars, human rights violations... It appears that governments from around the world are watching China getting stronger because everyone gave them money to produce their shit, so China has become a major player in the production sector. Now with China moving its influence across Asia, the West is taking precautions for this. We\u2019ll see what happens. \n9. 2nd and 3rd wave of COVID-19 is for sure to happen because people \u201dinterests in the economy\u201d.\n10. With countries in Europe denying money to corporations with tax havens or because they avoid taxes, it is possible to see a major shift on global legislation about this (maybe not the US)\n\n\nAll of this is obviously just guessing, but the current state of the world is very fragile right now. There is a lot of uncertainty and when that happens, people start to throw their morals out of the window. All of this is the worse case scenario, but it's not like our luck is good right now.",
            "Israel and iran going to war and Syria joining in and USA joins and Russia joins and.... yeah we got ww3.\nNahhhh that\u2019s not going to happen. Both Russia and USA doesn\u2019t want war with each other. Especially not nuke war.\n\nWorst thing that could happen (and is happening right now actually) is the big dick contest between USA and China."

            "What the hell happened to make my dog terrified of the bed for 3 days last year.\n\nEdit: The 'story' for those who were asking..\n\nEdit 2: All the demon, ghosts, etc. comments. Kinda freaked me out, lol, glad I don't live there anymore.\n\nI have a huge dog, (130lbs), named Monkey, who's favorite pastime is lounging on the bed and watching TV. I came home from work one night and received my normal, \"OMG you've been gone for so long I thought I was gonna die, and I can't find the remote so come change the channel.\" Welcome home greeting. I was in a studio apt, so the bed basically doubled as a couch, kitchen table, and anything else because its a King Size bed in a studio apt.\n\n (Side note, I used to have a smaller bed but I kept waking up just before hitting the floor as Monkey pushed me over and out so he could stretch out. Moved up one size at a time, now there isn't any bigger, so I sleep against the wall so he can't push me out, although I have woke up with feet in the floor).\n\nI digress, so, Monkey, King of the bed, Lord of the loungers, has his own size permanent divit in the mattress, is all jumpy happy when I get home, we do our normal routine, nothing out of the ordinary, I'm kicking back on the bed watching TV and I realized Monkey's not up here.. humm what's he up to. I call him, he's like 4 foot from the foot of the bed and will not come any closer. He's whimpering and pacing, and looking distressed. I immediately jump off the bed to where he is because obviously there's a death serpent or some equivalent on or under the bed. I'm freaked out, he's freaked out, I ask him where it is, ready to do battle. But he's acting just the same, he'd normally be on whatever demon possessed nightmare that dared to enter his domain. But nothing, he will not get closer than 4 feet to the bed. I grab my steel toed boots, my welding gloves, my leather apron, and welding helmet (hey I've heard there are snakes that spit, fuck that noise) I'm armed with the aptly named dead blow hammer, and I start carefully, meticulously disassembling the bed, and I mean all the way down to the frame. I check with a black light for hidden monsters. Nothing, not a damn thing. So I check again piece by piece, put new sheets and pillows on just in case. Nothing. Check all around the frame, the area, the whole damn apt. Nothing. I remove my battle armor, and call him an asshole because he was just fucking with me right? Nope, he still wont come near the bed. I tried bribing him with treats, then lunch meat, steak, pizza, ice cream (this dog would moon walk backwards over hot coals for some ice cream) Nope, nothing doing, he's not coming near the bed. For three days, I couldn't bribe him, entice him, or force him onto that bed. Then just like that, on day four he carefully approached the bed, laid down, and wanted me to give him all that bribe food I'd been showing him. Never could figure out what the hell happened, and I'm dying to know.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/tqHIBRD",

Bit of an update. Wife had been taking prescription sleep aids on our doctor's recommendation which knocked her our for an hour or 2 at most. This was pre-panic attacks so they changed to anti anxiety/anti depression meds for 5 days. She had another 2 panic attacks early in the week but I had arranged some emergency leave and was there for the worst bits. On day 4 and 5 she managed to relax enough to  sleep for a good 5-6 hours each time. Followed up with the doctor for blood samples and medical reviews and she's dropped down to half the dosage for another week. Has slept fairly well since and her job have been very understanding so all being well she's back to work for a half day tomorrow. Our son is back at school no worse for wear and has been spoiled rotten by all concerned.

He was my first and only childhood dog, a Siberian husky and I feel like we grew up in that house together. He had some cancerous tumor in his stomach that was spreading rather quick, and the attempt at removing didn't go so well as they couldn't get it all. We decided as a family to let him go peacefully so he didn't have to suffer as they promised us it would continue to grow and possibly cause him severe pain in the near future. I'll never forget holding him in my arms in that room as the vet asked me if I was ready for the moment. When she injected him I felt his entire body sink into my arms, he was lifeless in an instant. I was so happy he went peacefully without pain, my best friend growing up. I've never expressed my emotions from that moment to anyone besides my parents and my current girlfriend. Whenever I think back to that moment I get teary eyed but I'm happy I was there for him in his final moments, I wouldn't change a thing if I could go back in time.

Last night we were just listening to some music, she was sitting on the bed pressed against the wall, eyes closed, I was laying on my stomach and then Georgia by Vance Joy started playing. I teared up and covered my face with my arm. That moment I realized our relationship peaked sometime before, it was only downhill ahead... I cried without any sound and she felt the bed shaking from me sobbing. Asked me what's wrong and then I opened up about how I feel that I'm 100% into this relationship but not getting the same back.

When I dropped everybody home and was finally by myself in the truck, I had to pull over at the next corner to just let it all out. I cried so hard driving became impossible, and must have remained parked there for 10 minutes easily.\n\nA month after that, at my work place I adopted this stray dog who wandered into our site, named him Bruno. He was super playful and the cutest mutt ever. Anytime work got too stressful or my anxiety got the better of me, I'd leave the office and walk out to the car park where he 100% was always there to get my mind off of things. I have spent 30 minutes almost every day just sitting down and rubbing his tummy. Just the sound of my truck coming down the hill to the office he'd know it was me and prepare his assault on my clean work pants with his dirty paws.\n\nThe last time we spent together, I was outside giving him his usual tumy rub and love up, and I was called out to make a couple of runs in my truck. There was a bad thunderstorm that day, and I must have been gone for only 15 minutes when returning to my office site I saw the reddish mane of my buddy Bruno all wet and sodden just laying in the middle of the road life less. I told myself it could not be him, no way. I parked my truck in the office and a few of my employees knowing the relationship me and this dog had, told me the bad news. They saw a car hit him. Being their employer, like the scene with the Bull Mastiffs, I played it cool and had them go and pick up his body for me, which we buried on site here. Like before, as soon as I was left alone, I collapsed in anguish. I have never cried so hard in my life, and this time I cried for days after as well. Anytime I would pull up to work and begin parking, the fact there was no excited mutt to navigate around just broke me up.\n\nI have lost family members, team mates and very close friends alike, never cried for them like I did in these two cases.\n\nEDIT- Thank you all for the kind messages. Sadly I have not met a new stray mutt wandering about to adopt on my jobsite, but at home me and my wife have adopted 5 cats (not even allowed pets where we live!) and She has rescued 2 race horses that were going to be put down since they can no longer race. They now live on 4 acres of fruit-filled land she owns. We just fill the voids in our hearts when we lose these beloved animals by showing more love to others that never had it.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6rffzUL-4M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6rffzUL-4M)  This is a video my wife made for Bruno, I'm happy we have so many pics together to remember him by.",

            "Last night, unexpected. \n\nWork night shift in the ER an an RN. Last night of the work week (I work 7 on with 7 off, accumulating 80 hours in that 7 days on). Go to bed at 8am, wife wakes me to at 430 pm to shower and be ready for family dinner at 5 with my 3yo and 1yo daughters. As usual, wife wakes me up with my two daughters. They're all really excited to see me. My wife is talking with me, the 3yo is playfully yelling at me about her toy, and the 1yo is also loudly babbling. I got overwhelmed and yelled \"STOP\" pretty abruptly and abrasively. Wife realised I was a grump, and quietly took the kids out, leaving me to myself to finish waking up. While I work very hard to not be an asshat, I was still disconnected and overall too exhausted to invest in my family the rest of the night before I left at 630pm for my 12 hour shift. \n\nFast forward to work, and the last night was very much like every other night this week. A whole lot of misery and bullshit just swimming in acute psychosis (read: crazies screaming and unsafe to themselves and to staff), sprinkled with a few really sick patients, and a ridiculously busy department. I love my job, I love what I do, and I love going to work. Just not this week. \n\nCoworker and fellow nurse who I was with asked me what's up because she could see something was on my mind. Now, I spend nearly the entire 80 hours working with her. She's a wonderful friend, and next to my wife and daughters, I spend a very considerable amount of my time and life with her at work. I told her how I was upset with myself for exploding at my wife and kids who were just so excited to see me because they haven't had much of me all week. I broke down and got teary and had to excuse myself to collect myself so I could get back to work keeping my patients safe and alive. \n\nThere were other small factors that led me to be irritable such as lack of sleep and stress and the damn neighbor dog barking constantly while sleeping, but I felt like a monster. \n\nPSA: High-stress/high-risk jobs eventually eat up the good parts of you and it eventually seeps into private life. Remember to manage stress and take care of yourself so you can be replenished. To those supporting people in those jobs, remember that irritability isn't directed towards you. Sometimes, we just get overwhelmed.",

            "Saturday while trying to create a Windows 10 install usb... kinda, but not really.  I'm not a cryer; I'm a bottler. At most I get a little glassy-eyed and get a lump in my throat. Saturday got me.\n\nI lost my son to cancer a few years ago just a few weeks after his 13th birthday. He was the toughest kid, super smart, way more happy and positive than a kid fighting the battles he was fighting had a right to be. He was kind to the other kids at his treatment center, always put them first, and a \"favorite patient\" of the staff too. He was just... special. Every Dad thinks that of their kids, but it's true in his case. He really was rare.\n\nOn Saturday, my youngest decided to swap keyboards and broke something in Windows 10, I couldn't get a keyboard driver to work for the life of me on the home PC and hours of trying to restore and repair startup functions hadn't worked either. Through a lot of frustration and misplaced anger, I decided to wipe the drive and reinstall the OS. Wiping drives makes me nervous because I can't get over the idea of losing something, a video, picture, homework assignment, all that stuff no matter how seemingly insignificant is all irreplaceable.\n\nAfter getting upset with my kid and blaming him for something that probably wasn't his fault, setting things down a little too aggressively, pouring myself too much to drink, and hunting for way too long for a suitable USB key, I finally located an unmarked one way in the back of the drawer. I put it in my laptop and it's full. Perfect. So I open the first file to figure out if I can format it...  and there he is... full screen as a first-grader, the way I remember him from well before cancer was ever a nightmare, back when everything was seemingly perfect in my life, with that kind smile on his face and mouthful of missing teeth. That USB key was a physical backup of all of the images we used at his visitation.\n\nI was simply overcome with emotion. In a heartbeat, I was confronted with how I'd mistreated my youngest, got angry over something stupid, am using alcohol to mask my pain too regularly, and all of the emotion that was bottled up inside just boiled over. I crumpled right there at the desk and silently sobbed so as not to alarm my family in the other room.\n\nI didn't need those missing teeth to remind me of how badly I miss my kid. I miss him every moment of every day. Time doesn't heal wounds when the lost time IS the wound.\n\nNearly 18k comments thus far, so mine, which is too long for most to read will likely be safely buried here. I won't go back to correct the first line. It wasn't Saturday... it's now. \n\nThe last time I cried is now.",

How are you feeling, go beyond the simplicity of saying \u201dI\u2019m angry\u201d push further as to how are the actors and aspects of the anger manifesting in you. Are you feeling a primary emotion or a secondary emotion? \n\nThe most common primary emotions are fear, happiness, sadness, and anger. These may also be secondary emotions given different situations, but when we first react, it\u2019s usually with one of the above. Primary emotions are fairly simple to understand. They are your reactions to external events. ... A secondary emotion is when you feel something about the feeling itself.

            "Not exactly terrible, in fact it might actually have been the best thing I saw while in prison. This was in Oregon by the way, reputable for being some of the least \"hard\" yards in the country. Still saw plenty of shit, but this is the only one I like to talk about.\n\nComing back from chow, you walk down this super long (football field length), 30' wide hall to get back to your cell block. Walking back I've got my eye on two elderly lifers, both with canes, having a pretty animated discussion over who knows what at the end of the hall. As I continue walking towards them apparently one of them says something the other doesn't like because he picks up that fucking cane and just beams the other dude on the head. I think \"aw fuck here we go, lock down\" and expect the other old timer to go down but NOPE, homie must be made of sterner stuff because he picks up his cane and BOOM, full on geriatric sword fight in the middle of mainline ala cliffside Inigo Montoya fight scene in the princess bride.\n\nLike, these dudes are really going at it, CLACK CLACK CLACK, occasionally getting each other, couple of pretty gnarly lumps and gashes on each others heads and they are just going back and forth all over the hall, both of them 80 years old plus, doing it dark ages style. Shit was wild.\n\nEventually the guards managed to sprint down the hall, huffin and puffin and hosed the two of them down with OC spray and dragged them off to seg, but I'll never forget my first old man stick fight.\n\nFun fact: one of the dudes was a cannibal who killed and ate three people. The other was a pedophile who couldn't walk the yard or he'd get killed on sight.",
            "I worked in the medical department of a large prison in Florida. \n\nWe had an inmate bite a bigger inmate\u2019s nose off, the tip. The bigger guy kept asking the kid for sex and the kid had enough. \n\nWe saw several stabbings, several were life flighted out, but those weren\u2019t the most interesting.  We had an inmate smoke some bad spice, made out of god knows what. He came to medical out of his mind and later died because it caused brain hemorrhaging. \n\nOne guy got a dislocated patella and was just sitting patiently as I got his info. I asked if it hurt and he said yeah. I asked how he was so chill and he replied, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not a bitch.\u201d",

Guy comes in with a fairly dirty cast on his arm, otherwise he seems fairly normal. He\u2019s there to have his cast removed, so I ask him when they put the cast on- he\u2019s says December. It\u2019s late January, so yeah, it\u2019s been enough time for the bone to heal. I figured his living conditions were the reason for the cast looking like that, so I got the ok and started removing the cast. \n\nThe smell. \n\nHis skin underneath looked terrible, and there were little pieces of wood and other crap imbedded in the skin. Complete atrophy of the casted forearm. After further questioning, it turns out the cast had been on his arm for over a year, and it was just getting removed. \n\nI was glad to be getting out of that rotation.",
            "I watched a guy come into federal prison camp had a year and a day.  They gave him a job driving a mower to mow grass. On his first day of mowing he ran the mower off the edge of the pond, mower flipped, the role bar wasn't installed, they landed in about a foot of water, the back of the  mower seat ended up on his neck, mower on top of him and he Drowned.  The 1 Co at the camp wouldn't let us help but couldn't lift it, he called for help but they had to come from the max across the street and it was like 10-15 mins.  Finally we as inmates said fuck it and ran to the water, it took  6 guys to lift the mower off his neck, the co and another inmate drug him out of the water, by then the max prison Co's /medical had made it over, the started cpr, (already dead) they carried him on board, slid him in the back of pickup truck bed, drove him to the front, life flight landed took him away.  Official report says he died on the way to the hospital in the helicopter and his family believes that.  I was one of the first to see to him, I was the one that went screaming to get inmates to come help that man was dead when he came out of the water, I saw it in first person.  The prison lied, covered it up because they didn't want to be sued.  He was LEGALLY BLIND remember that, they let him on a mower, our commissary sheets was 1 page front and back,his was 3 pages so that he could see it. After it was over a day or two later, the camp director came and talked to the whole camp, saying he died on the way to hospital, that they tried to save him. Ok whatever, then a few hours goes by and the POS Co is waking around talking to the shift change CO and says they give him cpr because noone can die on prison property at a camp to our negligence so we had to give him cpr to keep him \"alive\" till they got him off the property. He was dead, way dead coming out of the water.",
            "Was in the tv room during late night in a dorm unit pretty early on in my 10 year bid. There were only a few guys in there since it was about to close, and I was towards the back of the room.\n\nA guy walked in with a coffee cup, sets it down at a chair a couple rows in front of me, then leaves the room again. There was an older white guy sitting in the seat directly in front of the coffee chair.\n\nCouple minutes later, the man who left the coffee comes back in through the back door of the tv room, walks right past me with a huge piece of metal, it looks like a giant tin can top. He walked right to the chair behind the older white guy and brought the metal around to the front of his neck and started fucking **sawing** this dude's head off a few feet away from me. \n\nI was stunned and watched for a while but I eventually got up and walked out the back door, being careful not to make furtive movements to tip off the C.O. at the desk. \n\nThe next morning, I learned that the older guy was a child molester and had been nearly decapitated. The giant piece of metal was the entire top of a toilet/sink console that had been removed, flattened, and sharpened. \n\nWas definitely among the craziest incidents of violence I saw in there.",

            "Spent 5 years in NJDOC. Honestly the worst part of the whole bid was county jail while I waited for the plea process to work out before being sent to state prison. I spent about 6 months in Camden County. I was unfortunately placed in maximum security because the nature of my crime (1st degree armed robbery). At the time I was a 140 pound white kid from the suburbs, and Camden was experiencing a massive shortage of space in the jail. Not a great combination for me. Slept on a mat on the ground near the toilet in a cell with 3 other guys (cell had one bunk bed, so was designed for 2 occupants).\nFirst meal on the tier a guy was walking down the steps to get his food and just as he approached the bottom he gets absolutely blindsided under the chin by another inmate wielding his meal tray as a weapon. The walloped guy goes to the ground and the assailant proceeds to stab him in every possible place with what looked like a pen. (I'd later learn that many of the tier's stabbing tools had pen handles.) It turns out the victim was a Crip, but the whole jail was pretty much run by Bloods. Apparently he was supposed to \"check-in\" (opt for protective custody) upon coming to county, but I guess he didn't want to. So they essentially forced the issue. The altercation didn't last long. Guards called a code, alarm went off, we all locked in our cells, and the officers then rolled into the tier about 10 deep and, based on the sounds (couldn't see the action after lock down), pummelled the stabber. \nA month later I was moved to a smaller tier which was reserved for inmates facing larger sentences (I was indicted on 3 counts of 1st degree armed robbery as well as 9 different other peripheral crimes). It was much quieter and the COs treated us much better. I was told this was because a lot of the guys on this tier had nothing to lose, and when things got bad on this tier (they never did in the 6ish months I was there) it generally went straight to nightmare mode.\nI saw some other objectionably worse stuff while in state prison, but I guess I was desensitized at that point because when I think back the first thing I see is the guy getting decked with a hard plastic food tray.",
            "I spent 6 years in prison. One month in I watched a Crip on Crip gang stabbing.

I think about it every day.",
            "I did a year spread out over a few \"2 yards\" in AZ. (Low level yards)\n\nI didnt see much that really shocked me - I'd been on the street prior to being locked up so anything I saw happen in prison was more of the same really. There were fights, and people catching heat from their own people for fucking up and breaking rules, but for the most part is was fairly tame.\n\nI think the part that sticks with me the most is the amount of very clearly mentally ill people who were locked up with me, but were getting no help whatsoever. I mean, none of us were really getting any help, but some of these guys were clearly going to have no option when they left except to go back to what they were doing. To me, that was the worst thing I saw - the absolute apathy of the system as a whole.\n\nI was incarcerated with 1200 other inmates on one yard in tuscon, in a complex that had I believe 7 or 8 other yards on it. This is of course one of many complexes in AZ. This also came as a shock to me when I really thought about it - just the incredible amount of people being locked up. Most of the people I did time with were in for non violent, drug related offenses.",

            "I made a friend early on who was sentenced to life for killing a man that had touched his niece. He'd been locked up for about 5 or six years when I'd first met him. Talked to him every day for three years and one day he comes up to me and  says he needs to talk to me about something. We do a lap on the back 40 and he tells me his old lady is leaving him, and isn't bringing his daughter up to come see him anymore. He's actually crying. I didn't know what I could do to help him, so I let him cry and told him to not let it bother him, maybe she'll come around. We go on about our day, and everything seems normal. That night he woke me up (he bunked across the hall) crying. I got up to talk to him and he says he wants to die, and that he's glad I'm up because he doesn't want to be alone. I start hitting the panic button for my cell and screaming for a guard, but no one comes, and I have to watch while he prys his mirror off of his wall. He put on his linens and blanket like a big robe and he cuts his stomach with his mirror. It was hard to see much because of the blankets and the dark, but I could smell his blood. Then he lit his blankets on fire. The co's got there when the smoke alarm went off, but they were too late. I still have nightmares about it, screaming for him to stop, to just talk it out, but he never does. I've seen a lot of fucked up shit man, but this was probably the worst. Or, at least, it stuck with me the longest.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the hugs and support everyone. Makes how I feel after sharing hurt a little less. I appreciate it.",

            "I've never been to prison but my uncle has. And his story was really interesting and kind of disturbing.\n\nWe live in Mexico, Guadalajara. My uncle has diabetes and at that time his health was really bad, he had a divorce 12 years ago and her ex wife and him lost all contact so she didn't know about his condition. She didn't receive her pension so she sued him and by the end of that week he was taken to a prison called Puente Grande.\n\nHe was there only for 3 days, it was easy to proof that it was impossible to work in that state, but he saw a lot of terryfing stuff there. First of all, prisoners have a hierarchy there. When new prisoners come, there are prisoners with power to judge them and punish them accoding to their stories on how they got there. (Guards know this, but there's a lot of people with power inside the cells).\n\nAccording to my uncle they were taken to a large room by the guards, when they left, other prisoners came and started questioning them. One of the new prisoners admitted to raping a girl, getting caught by the police and ending up in prison, the other prisoners got so disgusted that they beat him up and then violated him with a stick.

            "I did 3 years inside HMP Belmarsh, when I was 18, having just transfered out of YOI Cookham Wood. I was in for a non-violent but serious offence, so I was put on HB1 with all the lifers. I saw a lot of shit go sideways quickly there, dudes having heads cracked in with pool balls out of nowhere in the lunch queue, but that all became pretty commonplace. \n\nWhat I will never forget is the feeling of surprise as three guys push past me on the stairs, and wonder what the hurry was. Then watching them all barrel into a single cell, still not sure what was going on. The screams that came from that room were horrific. It turns out they held down the guy - a big dude too - on his bed, threw boiling water on him and repeatedly stabbed him. \n\nWe all heard the screams but no one would alert a guard. It isnt done. Then, from my spot on the stairs next to the cell, I watched a guard walk over. His name was Mr Geebad. He saw what was going on through the window in the door. And turned around and walked off. \n\nCunt doesnt describe him well enough.\n\n\nEDIT - Because some people seem to be defending him, let me tell you what happened after. The guys ran off upstairs and flushed or chucked their razors and blood stained clothes. Because Mr Geebad didnt get close enough to ID anyone, they got nothing other than being put on basic. \n\nIf he had opened the door they could have been positively ID'd. If the CCTV worked on the wing, they could have been ID'd. Mr Geebad was one person in a string of safeguarding failures. Doesnt mean he isnt at fault too.",
            "I told this story last year when this exact questioned was asked here, so here is the retelling: \n\nI spent a couple weeks in county jail. On the first day, when we were all being processed into the facility (strip, bend over, spread your cheeks, and cough) we were told very succinctly to never ever even joke about suicide while in the facility. Kinda like how you just don't say \"bomb\" on an airplane anymore. By day three, I had a good understanding of the other guys I was locked up with. I was physically the biggest of the white guys in our \"pod\" so all the white kids huddled around my table at meals to keep away from the hispanic folks and the black folks (yes, there are three teams in correctional facilities whether you like it or not). There was one kid in the group that seemed underdeveloped mentally, he probably had a learning disability among other things, but he essentially acted like a 12 year old. I knew early on he was going to get himself in trouble because he never stopped talking or moving, and he was rubbing everyone the wrong way. I tried to tell him to chill out and be invisible, but he was not understanding what I was telling him.\n\nI had been there a week, when the \"12 year old\" finally lost his cool completely. He was in the shower, singing and joking around, putting on a performance that went too far, and he pooped on the floor as a joke. After the other guys in the shower grabbed their towels and ran, he proceeded to kick the poop all over the walls and into the other shower stalls (I didn't shower for the rest of my stay, truth be told). It turned into a big scene, and then when the \"trustees\" came in to clean up the poop all over the walls it turned into an even bigger scene. The whole time, the \"12 year old\" was locked in a cell near the showers, laughing and joking as other inmates had to clean up his poop and make the shower area sanitary again. State run facilities have standards after all!\n\nThe next day, everyone was looking at the \"12 year old\" with hate in their eyes. Kinda like \"Gomer Pyle\" in Full Metal Jacket. Everyone missed their showers the day prior due to the poopcident, and then the kid was still up to his antics at breakfast the next day. Everyone got really cold toward him, even openly mean. I'll admit, I started ignoring him completely after the poop. It took him a day or two to realize he was hated by all, and then his personality changed dramatically. He became sad, despondent, and started talking to the COs because the other inmates wouldn't talk to him anymore. He fucked up, and told the COs that he should just harm himself and make everyone happy, and that was all it took... they dragged out the Blue Burrito.\n\nThis is the scariest thing I had seen in jail. The Blue Burrito was a 10 foot long blue foam mat, like you would use in gym class with two 12 foot long red belts attached. They laid it out on the floor, forced the \"12 year old\" to lay on the mat, and then they rolled him up with his arms at his sides into the blue burrito. The two long red belts clipped together at the top and bottom of the burrito keeping it all nice and tight. This was the suicide protocol at the jail. No counseling, no medical ward. You lose the ability to move. They put that poor bastard in the burrito around 8:00pm, dragged him into his cell and left him laying on the floor, wrapped up tight, until breakfast the next morning, around 8:00am (the child molesters and gang members in protective custody get to eat breakfast first). Imagine being unable to move, barely able to breath, with no end in sight for 12 hours on the floor of your 8 by 8 cell. My cell was up above his, and I heard him weeping and moaning in agony all night. He didn't say a word to anyone, or look anyone in the eye for that matter for the rest of the time I was there. One night in the blue burrito broke him.",

I mean, you made friends and all, but you had it hanging over you that you were a bad guy, and some people took to being assholes and provoked others seemingly out of boredom. It was an unpleasant situation to be on the other side, because you wanted to stay out of trouble too, but at the same time had to stand up for yourself. Maybe not the absolute worst I saw, but something I remember.",
            "I was only in jail for a two months waiting for my court case (it was dismissed). The first night I was in GPOP (general population) I heard someone in the pod getting raped. It was loud and violent. I felt really helpless. A few prisoners were banging on their doors and yelling \"YO!\" seemingly to get the CO's (correction officers) attention. The CO got on the loud speaker and said \"shut the hell up.\" I came to find out people would bang on those metal doors all the damn time. \n\nEventually a CO began doing rounds and walking around the POD--they made rounds every 20 mintues--and came across the incident still going on. I couldn't see what was going on but I heard \"COME IN MY CELL. I FUCKING DARE YOU\" and it sounded like the guy who was raped was then being beat to death. \n\nIn what seemed like forever (maybe only 2 or 3 mintues) a bunch of men in \"turtle suits\" (riot gear) and a dog came running in. The team opened up the cell and seemed to unleash the dog. The dog really fucked that guy up because his white jumper was bloody as hell and they had to pry the doggo off the man's arm. He was screaming like crazy. \n\nI'll never get any of those sounds out of my head, especially the man crying for help when he was being raped and the incredibly viscous sounds of that dog tearing apart that man's arm. It was the very first night I was actually in the jail and I was freaking terrified.\n\nEdit: the man suspected of raping was bitten by a dog, not the man who was raped. The dog was attached to the man's arm and they were trying to pry the dog off.",

Second night Asian guy knocks again and asks if we have any heroin. \nWhich is a big leap in anyones book, weed one day heroin the next. Something was up.\n\nIt seems my pad wasnt the only one who thought this guy was up to something. On the 3rd day of him being there and arousing all of the loonys suspicions on the wing, after some comotion at his cell door I walk up and take a look inside. \n\nHe was naked, surrounded by the lads off the wing with a tablespoon lodged up his ass and crying. The cell stunk of shit. The lads had decided he was trying to sell stuff not buy it. So they looked if he had hidden any, in his ass.",
            "Mild to most comments here, but I had to turn myself in for a 90 day sentence at a small county jail about 15 years ago.\n\nIn booking, watched a drunk guy that had just killed someone driving punch a guard and beat another inmate with the payphone receiver before he was subdued.\n\nAn 18 year old kid looking at some prison time swan dove off the top of the catwalk around the upper cells and broke his neck.\n\nThis happy-go-lucky guy drank an entire gallon of floor cleaner to get fucked up and laid in the corner puking and shitting himself. The guards didn't care until he stopped breathing.\n\nThe one that shook me the most: this mexican guy probably 20 years old was being deported for selling heroin for like the 4th time. This skinhead asked him why he kept doing it. The kid started crying and said the cartel would kill his family in Mexico if he didn't return and keep selling. He was already planning his return to start selling again.",

            "When I was in Orange County Jail (ca) I saw a whole bunch of wild shit. So when people \"roll\" into a cell or a dorm (cell = 8 man or less, dorm is 128 men in one open room divided into two inaccessible floors, so 64 on top and 64 on bottom) they usually roll in super late at night, like around midnight cuz i guess it has something to do with funding. So anyways a guy rolls in at the like 12 am, and I am on the top floor of this dorm. Now, when you look out of the dorm main exit there is a few hundred feet of reflective glass with a catwalk behind it. The cops walk back and forth on this catwalk but most inmates use this glass to communicate with the other floor since its basically a giant mirror that spans the whole giant room. So its late and I watch this guy come in the bottom dorm and immediately start talking shit to the white guy leader of the downstairs. Now I only talked to this guy one time to borrow cards but he was a nazi named \"Cyclone\" that literally nobody fucked with. So new guy is spouting off at Cyclone about how he will be the new head of the woods (white people), and it just goes back and forth to the point where everyone on both floors are watching. There are 3 words you DO NOT say to someone in OCJ, even in jest it will get you fucked up. Calling someone a \"punk\", \"bitch\" or \"lame\" are IMMEDIATE fight words and if someone calls you any of those and you dont fight them, well thats how you get picked on. I was told that even if you're 100% sure you will lose the fight its better to jump and get your ass beat than be known as someone who doesn't react. So new guy called Cyclone one of those 3 names and in like the same breath Cyclone braces his body between two beds like he's doing dips and lifts himself up and heel kicks the dude straight in the mouth. Well new guy is just lights out. He falls backwards limp and smacks his head on the bars. Cyclone only hit him once, and the guy was done. One minute later everyone downstairs is screaming about something and it turns out new guy shit himself like a LOOOT, and if you know anything about heroin addicts that first week in jail after a bender is typically spent exclusively on the toilet and in the showers because obvious reasons. Everyone's gagging downstairs to the point where they hit the emergency button and TOLD ON THEMSELVES. Not exactly, nobody said it was Cyclone but someone told the cops \"he was mouthing off and then he shit himself, we need a mop.\" So cops come with medics, check the dude and stretcher him out and check everyones knuckles through the bars and of course nobody had any knuckle marks. The guy was covered in blood and shit and i remember watching all of this from the upstairs reflection saying to myself \"holy fuck\" the whole time. I have so many other wild stories from in there this one is just the freshest in my head.\n\nEdit: words",

            "I was in a prison that was split.  One side was a level 4 facility (just under max) and the other was for mentally ill inmates.  One day they decided to move some of their more stable mentally ill patients to our side, the level 4 side.  There was this really huge dude who, as soon as he got to our prison, just started screaming that he wanted to go back.  He turned and found the person closest to him (I was down the hallway from him) and he proceeds to beat the hell out of this random dude.  Dude went into a coma and died two days later.  It was horrifying to watch this blatant display of random violence that ended with someone dead. I won't ever forget it.",
            "Saw this in a similar post. Some guy was doing a 2 year stretch for something. Anyway he was laying awake his first night when he heard the microwave. He didn\u2019t think much of it and ignored it. Then a few minutes later he hears this bloodcurdling scream. Apparently the guy using the microwave heated up a tub of vaseline To boiling point then he pores it on some guys face. I think it was revenge for the guy talking smack about him.",

            "I had to watch someone I knew suffocate. It took hours.\n\nHe had cancer, and he'd had a reaction to his chemo where his lungs would fill with fluid. It had happened several times before. He'd been rushed to the hospital, and they'd done whatever it is hospital ER's do, and he'd lived and been sent back to prison.\n\nThat day he told the nurse that he couldn't breathe. He begged them to call an ambulance. This nurse hovered over him on and off and kept fiddling with the pulse ox machine (the thing they put on your finger) to try to make it hit, because he had no detectable vital signs. He kept heaving for breath and asking when the ambulance was going to get there, because he couldn't imagine that they weren't calling one.\n\nMaybe he figured out that help wasn't coming, maybe not. I don't know. It was really hard for him to talk, so he wasn't wasting words. Eventually she gave up on trying to get vitals from him and left. When he finally died his chest heaved one last time and he twitched, and then he just laid there on his back with his head facing me. I wasn't sure he was dead for a minute, and when I tried to get the nurse to look at him again they kept refusing.\n\nFive minutes later they walked in, said his name, and made a point of being seen doing CPR when he didn't respond. I quit the hospice program after that. I told everyone that this happened, and nothing was done.",

            "Saw a lot of bad things, like the usual fights, couple people dying and such. One of the most fucked up things I saw was what the guards did to this one inmate. I was in maximum security, and then there is a supermax segment of that which is all tiny single cells to hold the murderers, high profile cases, and complete nut jobs that are too dangerous for general population. So I was a trustee doing my rounds handing out lunch to the single cells. This one guy demands an extra sandwich from me...I tell him it\u2019s not happening bc I don\u2019t have extra, and he starts throwing stuff including who knows what liquid on me. Well the guard sees this, and I was cool with them bc I never acted up or anything. \n\nThen he gets on his radio, and calls for their \u201cspecial response team\u201d. Maybe 1-2 minutes max, 12 dudes in full riot gear coming walked down the hall marching and banging their clubs on their shields like something out of a movie. They let me stand there for some reason, all 12 of them somehow fit into the 6x10 cell, and just beat the living shit out of this guy. The guard tells me he will handle the rest of handing out lunch. \n\nI get back to my cell near the indoor guard office, and about 5 minutes later they bring this battered dude down. They have what\u2019s called a restraining chair, which straps your ankles, legs, waist, wrists, head and neck all down. The guy gets promptly put into it, and then rolled outside to the yard about 50 feet away. Promptly gets maced. It was 36 degrees that night, but they apparently have a rule that they can keep you out there as long as it doesn\u2019t hit freezing. They left this guy out there for a solid 12 hours with no food/water and barely any clothes. \n\nI saw him again 4-5 days later after he got out of the hospital/medical, one eye swollen shut, the other barely opened, and beaten beyond recognition. He called me over to his cell and apologized. Appreciate the guards looking out for me, but I felt a bit bad for what they did to him.",

            "Not me but my brother. He always had substance abuse problems and depression. It was obvious he needed professional help and what he got instead was over 7 years of his life lost to jail and prison. Stabbings? He's seen it. Rape? Seen it. Overdoses? Assaults? Lack of medical treatment? Guards beat a guy almost to death for \"talking back\"? Inmates forced to rub hot sauce on their dicks by COs? Made to fight each other?Seen it all but the worst part is how my brother almost died from an infection in his lungs and when he asked for help, struggling to breathe and stand upright, the nurse and officers called him a liar and charged him 50 bucks for a false medical visit. He collapsed and almost died before he was taken to a hospital and nobody was punished, nobody lost their job, and when he did get out he had to pay court costs, fines, bills, maintenance for house arrest device, and a million other things, and he did it all and is now a law abiding citizen with most of his rights restored but try telling that to anyone hiring for a job.

            "I turned 6 months into 3 years of juvie time. While not really bad, this one kid supposedly fell in the shower and hit his head. Not sure if it was a planned ruse, but after he came back from the hospital he suddenly forgot how to talk and lost his memory. He'd communicate with whimpers. This went on for a few weeks. Every month you'd go in for evaluation and your remaining time and your progress would be reviewed. I'm assuming he thought this act would get him sent home. The staff eventually grew tired of it and in his review, told him since he didn't remember anything than he'd have to do all off his time again because he obviously hadn't learned anything to be rehabilitated. His memory miraculously returned that day.\n\nEdit: Holy shit. Thanks for the arrows and awards.\n\nSecond edit of how 6 months turned into 3 years.\n\nI went in for burglary at 16. The sentence was a 6 month program. Kinda like a boys summer camp in the middle of the woods. They had a point system where you'd start with 650 points at the beginning of the week. You'd earn or lose points based on your behavior. You'd gain points for doing chores and behaving or lose them by fighting and other stupid stuff. Above 650 points was a \"positive\" week and you'd get candy and extra privileges like movie night and field trips. Less than 650 was negative. So throughout your sentence they kept track. If you didn't have enough positive weeks when you went to your review, you'd get more time. My home life sucked and I wound up having fun hanging out with other boys and finally being able to be a kid. The food was good. I was smart and maxed out the placement tests so didn't really have to do school work. Ended up doing enough stupid shit to wind up at the first program a year. After a year you go back to the juvenile detention center and they reassess your needs and send you to another program as they can keep you until 18 if they want as I didn't catch another charge. Just didn't think I was \"rehabilitated\". I spent another year at another program. Same kinda shit, but pushed a staff member, caught a charge, and got sent to adult jail because I'd just turned 18. Spent a year in the county and was free after.",

So, I watched them purposely leave this new guy\u2019s cell open a crack so he tried stepping out, and six officers mobbed him and beat the piss out of him. Next, he was being brought into the powder room to be thoroughly checked (in his ass) for weapons, dressed and sent back to his tank. They sent no other than tex in to help powder his ass. Five of the other officers waited outside, knowing what would happen, and it can only be assumed that Tex took advantage of being crammed alone in a small space with this person and started beating on him. Once again, the other five joined in and beat the piss out of the guy. He was bleeding all over. It was a pretty wild experience to see how blatantly obvious it was that they just wanted to beat someone\u2019s ass.",

            "I don't know how to classify 'worst'. As others have written, depending when you were in and where it literally could have been anarchy.\n\nI was in from day after my 17th birthday until 34 (45 now) in Massachusetts. The first 10 years or so the inmates were running the asylums. They had control over almost everything except the ability to get out, and even then they could manage that often.\n\nIn no particular order here are a few I remember, and holy f*** I wish I could forget:\n\n- If rape is seen as one of the worst crimes, then every night just about depending on which prison you'd here that happening. The other prisons it still happened you just couldn't hear it.\n\n- Kid got caught stealing from his own people (Referring to race, as the entire system is self segregated.) They beat him down in his cell, broke all of his bones. Snapped his arms and legs backwards. Each finger one at a time snapping. Kicked the rest of him with boots. Once his bones were all smashed they held his arms up and 'shook them out' until he went into shock and died from the internal damage.\n\n- Numerous times the female guards would be having consensual relationships with inmates for years on end, then when they were found in a compromising position claim rape/threats and people ended up with life sentences who would have been going home.\n\n- When I first began time it was the end of the craziest era. But for the first 3 years I didn't go to the bathroom or take a shower without 2 friends standing guard. We would take magazines, thread bedsheets through holes in them and put two stacks back to back. You'd put it on over your head like a bulletproof vest. This was to protect you when someone tried to shank you in the heart/ribs/back. You'd gear up, go to a shower stall, 2 stand guard while one showers, each taking turns while the other got cleaned up. Using the toilet you'd have 2 stand outside the cell door while you did your business.\n\n- In the 90's Massachusetts made a deal with Texas to house prisoners for them. The DOC in Massachusetts was paid over $50,000 per inmate per year to house them. Texas charged the DOC $32,000 per year. So the tax payers gave Massachusetts over $50,000, and the department of corrections kept the difference between that and the $32,000 they paid Texas.\n\nThey would go in in the middle of the night with the riot gear on and all the local sheriffs and state police as backup, hogtied people in their cells, put them in buses that took them to a plane  where they were flown to Texas without any notification.\n\nThe Texas prison was the Dallas county jail. For those who came from Massachusetts It consisted of being brought to a pod with 32 or 64 beds in it, given a blanket, a mattress, a jumpsuit, two pairs of underwear, and a pair of flip-flops.

'He got 20 years, that's the sentence'. But really peoples are sent to prison FOR punishment. The number of years is just to let you know when you've got a shot of the torture being over if you're a prisoner. The best you could absolutely hope for is not to get involved in any of it...

            "I got super lucky and served a couple months straight on the work release block at George hill county prison. I was (at the time) the only \u201cpermanent\u201d inmate on the block that didn\u2019t leave everyday to go to work, the only other people who came were only there for a day or so until they got classified/xfered out, and a few guys who were finishing up state bids and just came back from graterford getting ready to go home. It was the most laid back jail experience ever, we had virtually zero supervision and basically self governed the block. Nobody fucked with anybody, we all had our own hustles going on nobody tolerated shit that attracted attention of the CO\u2019s (who didn\u2019t give a shit regardless, one of the CO\u2019s bought coke off of me before I went in, and even asked me to facilitate a hand to hand with my girlfriend for him while I was locked up) \n\nAnyway, with inmates coming and going to work everyday this block was filled to the brim with contraband. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to say the vast majority of ALL the drugs and other contraband in the prison came from us. Almost everybody brought in at least a pack of smokes.. or whatever else you can imagine roughly the size of a roll of quarters (a pack of smokes wrapped up for transport is about that size after you compact them) anyway, this one guy, I\u2019ll call him Donald, could bring in 2-3 packs of cigarettes, a bundle of dope, and usually any other party favors you could think of- was known for being the guy if you needed something brought in for cheap. He could fit a lot more than anyone else, so he charged less since he had more supply (duh)\n\nAnyway, one day I was particularly depressed about my situation (ain\u2019t much to do but get high or think about your situation at home that you can\u2019t control) so Donald offers to let me call my girl. I figured he was offering his phone account, but no- tells me to sit tight while he unpacks... comes out of the bathroom with an iPhone, charging brick, and cord. \n\nAn iPhone. \n\n\nFrom his ass.",
            "Not as bad as people getting stabbed but...\n\nAt a juvenile facility, when I was 14, the guards would encourage and instigate fights between us (\"I heard john said you was a bitch\", etc.) whilst betting among each other who would win.\n\nWhen they didn't get their way with you or you disrespected them in any way, they'd pay/ bribe (with food, and/or vodka in sprite bottles) a few others or so to jump you in the showers. The female guards would fuck male inmates, and the male guards would fuck female inmates. They knew where the blind spots in the cameras were and did all this without being caught the whole time I was there. There were about 200 male inmates and 50 female inmates.\n\nNeedless to say, I kept my head down, did my 6 months, and straightened my life out after being a part of that. However, I didn't get out unscathed; I have a 2-inch long scar on the back of my head where it was split open with a wooden broomstick. I refused to fall for their shit and would try to de-escalate when they tried to get me involved in their fighting ring... they didn't like that, not sure what/ who got paid for doing it.\n\nThe official report says I fell out of a chair and hit my head on the concrete. I went along with it because I knew it was my word against theirs (and their doom squads) and my life would've been much harder had I made a big fuss about it.\n\nEDIT: also, when things got out of their control, they would lock us down for 3-4 days and take away our books and stuff, in our 5'x10' cells without lettings us out for anything (we had toilets and a sink in there) and certain inmates would clog their toilets and flood the dorm with shit water; they'd turn off the air conditioners; flash the lights in our cells on and off all night; wait till our food got cold and then bring it to our cells, etc..

It was baddd. This girl was known for fighting, and boy was she quick with it. The guard was on the ground, bleeding from her head and face before she knew what happened. The girl was out of lockdown before the guard was out of the hospital. We found out months later that the guard had big knots in her head,lacerations from her ribs up, a deep cut in her neck, a pretty deep hole in her face, a broken wrist, had other injuries but had permanent damaged vision in one eye. The worst part was no one helped that lady, there were 3 other guards close by and they did nothing. I heard of much worse things happening while I was there but I saw this happen.

One day she kept pestering the other guy there with me over and over again for stuff she knew we couldn't give her. Smokes, a cellphone, extra soap or whatever. She'd do that to try to get under people's skin because riling up staff is a passtime for some inmates and we all kinda knew if you ignored her shed get bored and cut it out. This guy was new and he got mad and told her to stop pestering him. She puffed up kinda comically and began sassily mimicking him while she did the talking hand thing. He snapped and screamed \"LADY, THIS IS MY HOUSE, IM IN CHARGE, YOU AIN'T GETTIN SHIT! YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?!\" The look of pure, childish spite she gave him before returning to her cell was absolutley blistering but it shut her up.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later on rounds we were walking towards her cell on the second level she walked out, tied the other end of a sheet noose around her neck to the rail, flipped us the bird and jumped the hand rail, all in about 10 seconds as we ran towards her. It didn't break her neck, but as we were frantically trying to get her down she was swinging back and forth, strangling and somehow cackling evilly like a witch every time she managed to suck in a breath. I remember we tore the sheet free and she fell down onto the 1st floor and in between raw throated laughter laying on the floor spread eagle she shrieked \"IS IT STILL YOUR HOUSE?! DO YOU FEEL IN CHARGE NOW!?\" as the entire block of women erupted into chaos and started running around in random directions screaming bloody murder.\n\nShe suffered no serious injuries beyond a neck sprain and heavy bruising on her neck/throat. If it had been a real rope it probably would have killed her. I think that psycho legitimatley tried to commit suicide out of pure spite for being yelled at.

I was in a class 4 barracks (a trouble maker barracks) and 3 was officially called the \"dungeon\" since there were fights and stabbings quite often, at least 2 or 3 a week. There was a big man in there with the GDs selling meth in there and one day he had about an ounce go missing. Everyone was looking around for three days when they noticed one dude in particular wasn't sleeping. It was a white man in his mid 30s. Just a hint, if you find drugs in prison, go to the person you know is selling and just give it to him. This man decided to keep it and do it. They went to him in the middle of the night and started tearing up his things, looking for the dope. They found it. The drug dealer pulled this man into a closet we pried open in the barracks, and proceeded to basically gut him open with a prison shank the size of my leg, so more like a lawn mower blade. They were in there for not even 30 seconds before the sound stopped. Next thing you know, they changed this man into some new clothes and sat him on a toilet with his pants around his ankles. He was dead. This body sat on the toilet for five days, and the Correctional Officers didn't even know he was dead until he began decomposing so bad that the smell was literally rotted flesh. So for five days, I had to walk by a dead body with his eyes and mouth gaped open every time I had to take a piss.

Co's are supposed to help and protect you from yourself and/or other inmates and etc. Sometimes if you watch your surroundings closely you can see the bigger picture for what it really is. For everyone their experiences are different in prison. One night in the cell block i woke up to the sound of screams and crying of a man being raped and killed in his cell. When you hear the cries and plea's of a dying man you can't help because everyone is locked in a cell in the middle of the night, it does something to you inside. In a way something breaks in you, but your glad. Glad that it wasn't you that the Co's let people into your cell when everyone was asleep to do as they please with you.

After 2 years, his mental and physical health is far better than it has been in years, though he could do with losing some weight. He's still having regular nightmares,  probably as the result of the childhood beatings and other abuse prevalent within our family, and his sleepwalking (basically trying to climb invisible ladders or open invisible doors)and groaning resulted in his eventually getting a single cell so as not to disturb whoever had to share with him. He has regular visits with psychiatric nurses and also gets his dental and sight checkups scheduled for him regularly. He is studying a couple of languages and reads a lot as they have a good library.  They have TVs in their cells and he also listens to a lot of classical and other music CDs. He earns money from his prison job and family members are allowed to send in money too. He gets on well with the screws and most of the other guys locked up. They do regular therapy sessions- group and individual - aimed at addressing the offending behaviour. When I've visited him,  it has been in the family room. It looks and feels like a cafe, with children running around playing, and a counter where  you get snacks and coffee/tea coke etc. I don't know whether he will reoffend or not: I have no expectations.

            "My cousin was murdered in prison.\n\nHe had been convicted of burglary and some drug offense, which apparently was committed by his girlfriend, not him. She had a kid and he was a good guy, so he took the blame for her. While in prison, there was an altercation with another inmate and and my cousin ended up stabbing him in the leg with a pencil in self defense\u2014 got his sentence increased to nine years for assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nHe was 7 months shy of his release date when he was transferred to a new cell. Half an hour after he was moved, the guard came back to find him dead on the ground with stab wounds all over his face and neck; the inmate who killed him was just chilling in the cell like it was nothing. Apparently this guy was convicted of first-degree murder, a life sentence, and had additionally murdered another inmate previously. So why did they put him in a cell with my cousin?\n\nMy aunt and uncle are still fighting for this in court. The prison claimed there was a clerical error and the murderer was accidentally placed with my cousin, but it is believed that the whole thing was gang related, and the guard was in on it. It\u2019s especially sad because my cousin really was a great guy\u2014 funny, caring, thoughtful, polite\u2014 but he made some mistakes and lost his life for it.\n\nThis was in 2018; and he was only 28 years old. His was the most devastating funeral I\u2019ve ever been to. And his murderer is already in for life, so it doesn't feel like there is any justice. I still wonder what his last thoughts were before he died.\n\nEdit: article [here.](https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article239718383.html) Updated a few of the details that I was misremembering.",
            "I was in county jail, and I saw a bunch of fucked up stuff.   But the worst was, when I got over to work release, I made friends with a number of inmates there who were chill, and generally not super-selfish fuckwads.   \n\nOne dude was a gigantic black guy who EVERYBODY loved, he was super nice and chill and if you had his back he had yours.   Him and I got close fast, because I would always hook him up with cigs or snacks to add to the egg salad sandwiches he would make every weekend, and he looked out for me and gave me sandwiches without throwing in towards the end.  \n\nHe introduced me to a small white kid - they both cleaned our pod together.   The kid at first was waiting for money, so I helped him out a bunch.  We also got close.   At that time, I was working, so most of the time I was gone.   I would get back at 11-12 at night, stay awake until 4 or 5 am, get some sleep, and be gone again by noon.\n\nOne morning I had JUST fallen asleep, right before most of the inmates wake up to go to work.  (There were two pods with people who actually worked - the day shift pod and the night shift pod.   Since I worked in a restaurants , my schedule was more of a mix of the two, but I was in the day shift pod.)\n\nI woke up to hearing an inmate yelling - not an unheard of thing - but something about this was different.   Dude was freaking out.  A few cranky inmates were telling him to shut up, but he wasn\u2019t listening.\n\nThen a guard came running in, then another, and though they were across the room, I could tell they were like deer frozen in headlights.  The inmate yelling was shouting orders, but no one was reacting.   I heard him tell GO GET THE NARCAN!!!!\n\nThe guards run off.  Don\u2019t come back for awhile.\n\nWhen they do, they don\u2019t have narcan.   I got to talk to the kid who was trying to save my friends life.   When he found my buddy, his lips were blue but he wasn\u2019t dead yet.  He was trying desperately to revive him, but nothing was happening.   The guards were absolutely useless, and they came back without the NARCAN - either cuz they couldn\u2019t find it, or there was none.   \n\nThey moved us all out of the pod for the morning while the coroner came and did his thing.   It was really really sad.   He had just gotten his first furlough, a few hours out of the facility.  Apparently his mother had taken him to go pick up some drugs, and he brought them back in with him before using them.   I don\u2019t know if he snorted it or had snuck in a needle, but either way, however much he brought in was enough to kill him.\n\nNot much even changed after that, procedure wise.  I heard for New Years they breathalyzed a ton of people, but that seems standard.  I worked that day, came back, and they let me through without even a search.\n\nMy other buddy, the big black guy, wasn\u2019t the same after that.   He wasn\u2019t jolly like normal.  He quit his cleaning job.   I\u2019d hang out with him, but he wasn\u2019t talkative like before.   It really sucked, all around.   \n\nDude was a good kid.  Sure, he chose to get fentanyl or heroin...but, he didn\u2019t have to die.   I know the guards were scared, not thinking clearly, and who knows how long ago their training was on that situation.  I just really wish they had listened to the inmate who obviously knew his shit.   They could\u2019ve saved my friend\u2019s life that day.",
            "Somebody killed themselves in another block when I was there. Jumped off the top stairs right onto his head. He\u2019d only been in for like 3 days.",
            "Not a prisoner but worked in a legal clinic for exonerees for a few years. Guys used to tell me stories all the time. \n\nHad one guy who did 20 years in Angola. Used to tell me about the inmate rodeo show (yes a real rodeo show with a bull and everything) he used to participate in while inside.  Apparently the prison held an annual rodeo show fundraiser where they would take a few prisoners and put one or a few of them in a ring with a bull. It's their biggest fundraiser, the prison sold tickets to the public and everything.\n\nWell, my client one year was put in an event with like 5 other inmates or something where the guards released like 6 bulls, and the last man standing wins the event. The client got drilled by one of the bulls horns and broke his leg. Still has trouble walking to this day. \n\nEasily the most insane story I've ever heard.",
            "A guy dove head first off the second tier and told us the night before he was going to do it because he was tired of working the kitchen and would rather die then wash anymore trays. Nobody beleived him but he was good on his word.",
            "So there's a lot of answers here describing the violence that takes place in prison. For me, the violence was shocking and traumatizing but I don't think that was the worst thing I saw. For me that would be all the wasted potential sitting behind those walls. Talking to guys who had their reality oriented around the idea that prison is the best they could do. And there is no sort of rehabilitation back there to change that mindset."

So I have the trolls shipped to friends that live around the country, and road trip it to every friend, slowly depositing the roughly 240,000 troll dolls in all the cities, landmarks, and other tourist attractions along the way. Basically... if I have to spend $1m impractically and the desired result is to make the giver laugh... I. WILL. LITERALLY. TROLL. THE. WHOLE. DAMN. COUNTRY.",

            "The Voyager spacecraft. One of them is the only object that's left the solar system. They're still sending back data. And they're each carrying a gold record encoded with information, our planet's greeting card to the cosmos.\n\nIt's hard to overstate how much that project changed humanity's knowledge of the solar system. The Voyager probes were crucial to discovering volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io, the first volcanic activity confirmed outside of earth. Before the Voyager mission earth based telescopes thought there were only a handful of rings around Saturn. Voyager found thousands of rings there, found thin ring systems around two other outer planets, found dozens of moons, and more other information than one comment can do justice to. NASA is still planning future missions based on information the Voyager spacecraft discovered. If alien life gets discovered on Europa or Titan, you can thank the Voyager engineers and scientists. Most of them could have earned far more money in the private sector. Being part of this effort was their dream job. \n\nAnd they won't see this work through to the end. They can't. Voyager began the planning stages fifty years ago. Human lives just aren't long enough. And they knew it.\n\n----\n\n*edit*\n\nThere's a fully functional third Voyager craft that was never launched. NASA built it and kept it on earth for engineers to use in troubleshooting if the two Voyager probes in outer space ever ran into unexpected problems. That third Voyager craft spends most of the time on display at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory facility in California, in the von Karman Auditorium.\n\nEvery year in the month of June, JPL conducts tours open to the public.

            "Precipitation when it is cold outside.  \n\nI got caught in a snowstorm in Shenandoah National Park in March, 2019.  It was 50 in the valley, but I got 2 feet of snow on the top of the ridge.  The forecast did not call for any precipitation that day.  I was hiking on the Appalachian Trail and thought that a few flurries were nothing to worry about.  I left a lean-to shelter that would have kept me dry and protected from the wind.  I hiked less than 6 miles and was struggling to move forward because the snow was so deep.  I was soaked to the bone, freezing cold, and beginning to lose fine muscle control in my fingers.  The trail followed the side of a ridge and was not providing me any flat spaces to set up a tent.  I eventually found a clearing where some power lines crossed the trail and struggled to get my tent erected despite the loss of feeling in my fingers.  Once my tent was set up, I got my sleeping pad and sleeping bag deployed, got out of my wet clothes and crawled into the bag for an hour to warm up.  \n\nI didn't even have a cell signal where I could let someone know my exact location and that I was ok.  I had been in contact the previous evening, so my girlfriend knew my location to within a couple of miles.\n\nThe snowstorm lasted all night and I had to spend a full 24 hours in the tent before the snow stopped.  The next day after the snow stopped, I packed up my camp and kept hiking through the 2 feet of snow.  The trail crossed Skyline Drive after a short distance and I followed that road for \\~9 miles to the nearest park entrance.  I called a shuttle and spent the night in Waynesboro, VA at a hiker hostel.  The warm shower, boot dryer, and warm food were exquisite.\n\nWhen you make an error in judgement in the wilderness, the goal is to survive long enough to learn from your mistake.  I learned my lesson.  I will not screw around when dealing with precipitation and cold weather.  If there is any doubt, I will just hunker down and wait for the wet weather to pass.",

All I remember is I was driving, then I was waking up in a hospital 4 hours away from home. No clue where I was or what happened. I had suffered a major TBI and have been mentally different ever since. Had a pretty major concussion following the accident.\n\n It happened in the backroads of southern Idaho, and I was lucky to have come out of it with 0 broken bones. Everyone at the hospital was saying I was lucky to have survived. There were witnesses who saw the whole wreck, a couple high schoolers on their lunch. I read the police report and witness statements, and according to them, my car rolled 6.5 times, ended wheels up and I was partially ejected (laying half in and half out of the car through the window) my seatbelt buckle had broken as the car was coming to rest.",

            "Chickens while there are chicks present. \n\nMy brother is a cruel little shit who liked being mean to animals while we were kids. He liked hurting them for the feeling of power it gave him. So he hurt a lot of small wildlife, like frogs and garter snakes and mice. When that stopped being enough he decided to go after livestock.\n\nWe had chickens. There was a great big rooster and his ladies and all of them had chicks. My job was to take care of the chickens, feed, water them, collect eggs, ect.\n\nMy brother was bigger and stronger than me so one day he decided to have 'fun' and grabbed up one of the little chicks in the coop and squeezed it until it started to scream for help. My attempts to stop him did nothing.\n\nNow the chickens were used to me picking up the chicks and petting them. So they weren't alarmed when my brother picked up the chick. When it screamed however, all hell broke loose.\n\nAll the chickens went after him, going for his face and eyes. The rooster had spurs on his legs over an inch long and he cut big grooves on my brother's face, missing his eyes by millimeters. They swarmed him and bullied him until he dropped the chick and ran out of the coop crying with blood on his face. \n\nHe was 10 at the time and should have known better. Did he stop being mean to animals? No. Did they punish him for it when they could? The animals sure did. \n\nChickens are very much like the cuccos in the Zelda games. If you hurt one they will all swarm you.\n\nEDIT: I got several questions and I will detail them here so people doing have to go digging through comments. \n\nYes, my brother and I were both abused by our father. Our mother was a kindly women who did her best to nurture and discipline my brother. She died when I was 7 years old and my brother at 9 years old from cancer. My father went off the deep end and took out his rage on us both. He worked two shifts at a factory daily and did not want to be disturbed when home or he would beat us. So no, there was no adult supervision and we were left to our own devices except for a weekend here and there when our maternal grandmother would have us. She also did her best, but our father excused and enabled my brother's behavior because he was more valuable in his eyes compared to me, a sickly girl. We did go to school. Yes CPS was called a couple times and my father told everyone that I was pathological liar so nothing came of it. \n\nMy brother most likely had a genetic flaw or some inherited mental health disorder that kept my brother from feeling empathy. However, our father did not believe in mental health services so my brother never got therapy or help. I fully believe he would have turned out to be a different person if he had these services. Instead he was isolated, abused, and enabled. It made him entitled and gave him the need to exert his will over everyone. If he wanted something he simply took it, including my innocence. \n\nHe grew up into a terrible adult. No he didnt kill anyone. I dont believe he would kill anyone because he likes to manipulate people and you cant manipulate a dead person. He instead became a thief, a rapist, and fell hard into drug use. The last time I spoke to him was in 2013. I have fully cut him off from my life and have not spoken to him since. Maybe he has changed in these ten years, but i have no way of knowing. Once in a while I scan obituaries looking for his name, but otherwise I have nothing to do with him.\n\nI acknowledge that he had a messed up beginning like I did. However, he willfully chose to hurt me and has never apologized or acknowledged what he did to me, even as adults. I may have forgiven him if he had at least acknowledged what he did was wrong, but he believes he did nothing wrong. So for my health and safety, I chose to cut him out. \n\nI have diagnosed C-PTSD that I will have for the rest of my life. However, I spent the last decade in therapy learning how to cope and live with what happened to me. Some days are better than others, but I am genuinely happy and am in a safe place, several states away and surrounded by my friends who have become my new loving family. \n\nSo yes I'm okay now. I dont fear him or my father coming after me because they are lazy cowards and I'm too strong now to allow them to hurt me. If any of them contact me about giving up a kidney or a liver lobe I will laugh in thier faces and then get a restraining order.",

            "Not so much what I saw but what I experienced. I was once underway in the Gulf of Alaska during a November gale. Waves were up to 35 feet with some rollers hitting 45. An uncommon occurrence on the diesel electric ship I was on was a cyclo-converter tripping. When this happened the ship would temporarily completely lose power and propulsion until some electricians could reset everything. This happened during that gale. I simply can\u2019t explain how strange it is for the boat you\u2019re on to all of a sudden go so quiet, that you can clearly hear waves slapping the ship and metal bending and flexing. Knowing you\u2019re completely at the mercy of the sea. Knowing that if the ship lost its bearing and went beam to there was a real possibility of capsizing. It\u2019s easy to forget when you\u2019re at sea that the only thing keeping you alive is a bunch of steel welded together. At that moment I was fully aware and it humbled me. Thankfully we trained frequently for this and had everything fired back up relatively quickly.\n\nAnother time I recall was when the ship took a rogue wave. They are absolutely real and I believe they account for a massive number of shipwrecks. It was late at night and I was on the bridge. We were passing through a storm and we\u2019re taking the waves off the bow with no visibility. As the ship moves there\u2019s normally a pretty standard pattern. You ride up a wave for a bit and then you fall down the wave for a bit. Well we started riding up a wave and got to the point where we should have been starting or ride down\u2026but we just kept climbing and climbing. And then it happened. We started our ride down the back of this massive wave. All of us braced ourselves and tried to find something to hold on to but we all fell to the deck any way. Anything that wasn\u2019t secured for sea fell down all around us. Manuals, tables, computers, printers, you name it. Our captain who was sleeping called up to the bridge asking if we hit something. It woke the entire crew up. Rogue waves are real, and they\u2019re terrifying. I can\u2019t imagine being in a smaller boat or taking one of them broadside.",
            "I was in the US Navy for about 10 years, and have 10s of thousands of miles at sea in an aircraft carrier. Countless nights on the flight deck in the middle of the night and middle of the ocean... \n\nCreepiest: A HUGE patch of the ocean glowing. Like nuclear waste in the Simpsons glowing. I've seen bioluminescent algae of a few kinds and this was nothing like it. I've never seen anything like it before or since. \n\nWeirdest thing: hundreds of mile out to sea from land and there was a MASSIVE fire on the water. It was like the top of a gas refinery, but on the water with nothing under it but water. Flame going a few stories into the air.\n\nSaddest: a fellow sailor trying to jump overboard. He apparently got a 'Dear John' email and pictures from his cheating wife and decided to end it. We were on the smoke deck, he bummed a cigarette, then asked the time, we said 2300... he replied \"sounds like a good time to die\" and in one motion tried to launch over the chest high wall (with an opening to the water below). Luckily we were faster than him. We grabbed his legs and wrestled him down and laid on him and basically hog tied him till the MAs (Navy cops) got there. Broke my heart because he was a good dude. I never saw him again. He got transferred off the ship shortly after. Not sure what happened to him but I hope he's doing better.\n\nFunniest: 2 flying fish collide mid-air. I was smoking when we were in the Persian Gulf and saw the fish fly from a pretty far distance towards each other. I remember thinking 'there's no fuckin way they're going to hit' them SPLAT SPLASH! I was in tears laughing but no one saw it. Everyone just thought I was a weirdo, but I got to see a miracle of nature lol",
            "The furthest I've ever been out to sea was bay fishing, so I'm not qualified to say based on my personal experience haha\n\nBut one story that scares the shit out of me is of a Chinese submarine that got caught in an eddy. Ocean eddies are kind of like enormous whirlpools. They can be at or below the water surface. Some are large enough to be seen from orbit. \n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/picture-of-the-day-giant-eddy-visible-from-orbit/253415/\n\nAnyway, this sub was caught in an eddy and was beginning to drift downwards towards crush depth. Obviously that's pretty scary, but what drives it over the edge to me is that the eddy was *pulling them downwards in the direction of a trench*. Since they're in a sub, they can't just see outside. It's almost like there was something *in* the trench that grabbed them and started pulling them down into the abyss. They jettisoned and eventually were able to break free before their sub was crushed and lost to the dark void forever.  But the idea of your sub suddenly stopping, going in reverse against your will, and then realizing that you're headed towards an oceanic trench is just.... next level for me. \n\nI'm pretty grounded, but... the ocean gets my imagination going. This powerful sub got caught by something and started getting dragged down towards a trench. Yeah, it was an eddy doing it, but.... Yeesh! The imagination comes up with disturbing questions.",
            "Some 20 years ago...\n\nOn the MV Explorer (since sunk) down near the Antarctic circle, sailing around the 'bergs and occasionally making landfall...\n\nWe rounded into a small bay area, and there, amongst the ice and coast was an unmarked sailing yacht. Which is odd as generally yachts have some identifying markings on them.\n\nTo add to it, they didn't respond to any radio contact, and whilst I wasn't privy to the conversation (and it was a long time ago), some crew went across via Zodiac and were refused boarding. \n\nSo basically a yacht, not a particularly large one, that was unmarked was hanging around in the inhospitable waters of the Antarctic and didn't want any help or contact.\n\nProper weird.",
            "Not creepy, but totally weird. \n2 Chinese boats, like small, old, fishing vessels, meeting up in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean like half a mile behind us.\n\nThis was so random, within international waters but so freaking far away from China, I still wonder what the hell they were doing there. They had no AIS. The first one to arrive close by, passed next to us as if to check who we were and if we were keeping course  (sailing vessel) and then went straight towards the other ship and mated. \n\nMaybe drug trafficking or maybe just fishing. But yeah, still pretty far away from their most likely official harbor and kind of weird. It was litteraly in the middle of the pond, around 10 degrees North of the equator, so not your typical fishing route.",
            "I used to be an oilfield diver in the Gulf of Mexico. I'd say about 80% of the dives I logged were at night. Mostly 500 ft and under DSV's. \n\nIt's very eerie feeling sitting on the downline doing in water decompression in the middle of night. I'd always ask topside to turn off my headlight. \n\nLike a worm on a hook. Just bobbing in the darkness.",
            "Somewhere in the Atlantic, nice cold as fuck night, decided to step out and look at stars. About ten minutes on and a boats mast pops up, sits there a few minutes and then back under. No alarms, nothing. Just some sub boys getting a bit of late night o2 in the middle of nowhere next to some friends.",

            "This sort of qualifies. Former navy here. Somewhere off the coast of Italy saw a very, very small boat, not much bigger than a rowboat, about 9 or 10miles offshore. This was sometime around midnight. There was no light from land, and no other ships around. It had a light. Our ship captain said it was a fisherman, and the fish would be attracted to the light at that time. \n\nImagine being in a rowboat about 10 miles off shore in the middle of a pitch black night, waiting to see what finds you",
            "In 20 years the weirdest shit I\u2019ve seen is other people that work out here\u2026. \n\n\nThere\u2019s about 40% of the sailors like what they do and are good at it. Another 40% that are good at it, but would do something better if the money was right. But there\u2019s another 20%\u2026. If they lived ashore for more than 6 months a year they\u2019d end up dead or incarcerated. There\u2019s no more \u201cwest\u201d for them to go to so they went offshore and became our problem.",
            "A dead human body. It was the tropics and it wasn't in good shape. We turned it over to the authorities at nearest land. There were enough teeth left to identify it by dental records. Here's hoping the man's family got closure.\n\n*edit*\n\nu/Altril2010 is correct: the body was double bagged and stored in the walk-in freezer until our next port visit. There was quite a bit of cleaning and decontamination involved, but that's the gist of it.",
            "Not so much creepy, as eerie, but being out in the blue at night in a lightning storm in a slack wind.\n\nThe ocean was very flat - no big rolling swells - just tiny little ripples. The whole world would be black, and then there would be a flurry of bolts, and the whole world would be silver. The ocean looked like nothing so much as aluminium foil that had been scrunched up, and flattened out - the water looked like mercury, and all the little ripples made these very dramatic black shadows.",
            "What I'm learning from these comments is that the ocean makes people poets.",
            "Creepiest thing I\u2019ve seen has definitely been seeing myself and other crewmates lose our minds. \n\nOn one particularly awful voyage, everything that could go wrong went wrong and we found ourselves without food, water, and sleep for a very unhealthy amount of time. It started off with auditory hallucinations. Ships are noisy, and when you\u2019re going crazy, you begin to think those noises are talking to you. I heard children laughing, a choir singing, and creepiest of all, a particular splash sounded like it was calling my name from the sea. Combine that with visual hallucinations and then things get really terrifying. I was convinced we were in the desert at one point with sand all around us and mountains in the distance. Another crew member freaked out and told us we were about to run into an apartment building. The creepiest thing I saw was an all-black flying pig with red eyes on the bow. I think the scariest though was when someone was convinced we lost part of our crew overboard. It turned into a massive, delirious argument over where everyone was even though we were all accounted for. That trip was brutal, and the captain put us all in a terrible situation due to sheer incompetence.\n\nOther than that, there was this one time I saw three gigantic ships in the distance with no lights and they did not show up on AIS. Suddenly they were gone. It was extremely creepy.",
            "I was drinking in an airport bar and met a woman who worked as a commercial fisherman, on her way to SE Asia for R&R with her family. Real salt-of-the-earth lady. She regaled me with stories about her work, all the good stuff about working in her world, all the reasons she kept doing it for decades.\n\nI asked her what the scariest thing she saw out on the open ocean was and, without any hesitation, she said \"Oh, an underwater UFO. I saw one rise up out of the ocean next to my boat and fly off into the sky.\" The matter-of-fact-ness of her answer bothers me to this day.",
            "Years ago my friends and I visited Thailand, and went on several excursions on a boat with a captain. On one of the evenings we were out at night and it was pitch black except for the green lights that were coming from the large commercial fishing boats way out in the distance. We had stopped for a while to take in the view and eat, when it started to rain. The captain thought it was best to head back, and then   quickly realized that the boat propeller wasn\u2019t working and something was caught on it. \n\nHe grabbed his head mounted flashlight and a knife and jumped in the water. He was gone for a good minute which felt like eternity as we were huddled around trying to figure out what was happening. Fear started kicking in as we waited \n\nThen he suddenly re-emerged panting and told us that shortly after he jumped in, he lost his flashlight and had to literally feel his way underwater towards the propeller, reaching and cutting a plastic tarp that had wound itself around the propeller, cut it loose, and made his way back to the surface in the dark\n\nIt was a strange set of emotions as we were completely impressed with the badass display we just witnessed, relieved he made it back but also freaked out imagining what would\u2019ve happened if he hadn\u2019t",
            "I was in a glass bottom boat in the 1970\u2019s off the coast of Oahu. We were going out to see a pod of whales. The boat Captain was a grizzled old Hawaiian sun baked to the color of Mahogany. It was an older boat, retrofit with a glass bottom and bench seating. He was narrating over a PA as we left the dock.\n\nWe motored out for about 30 minutes and the view out of the bottom of the boat was disappointing, just long streams of bubbles obscuring the view. Finally he stopped the boat, and the view was simply amazing. The Captain pointed out a pod of whales about 1/4 of a mile away. They were cavorting about, diving and jumping. The Captain was explaining their behaviours, but keeping his distance. It was pretty cool.\n\nAll the whales suddenly dived and disappeared, emerging moments later, right next to our boat. They were swimming all around us, diving and jumping and splashing us with water, children were laughing, everyone thought it was part of the show. They were right there, almost so close that you could touch them. The Captain told us how lucky we were, to see them up close.\n\nSuddenly, the mood changed when they started bumping up against the hull of the small boat. People were sliding all over the place, some fell onto the floor, children were crying. Most telling, the Captain had stopped narrating and had a look of abject terror on his face. I remember thinking what it must take to make this guy scared, and as he looked terrified we should probably be too.\n\nSuddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the whales disappeared. They were just gone. People picked themselves up and sat back down, mothers consoled children, we started back to the dock. The Captain got back on the PA and tried to downplay the seriousness of the what just happened, but there was a definite quiver in his voice as we headed back to shore.",

            "Right. Long time lurker, first time poster here.. I\u2019m no longer at sea but used to as a younger chap with romantic ideas spend months on end on cargo ships. Mostly tankers, crude oil VLCC and refined product tankers but with a little time in oil and gas and towing, I came ashore in 2017 with a Master unlimited ticket, sailing as chief officer. My last ship was a self discharging bulk carrier. \n\nAnyway I digress.. it wasn\u2019t so much about what I saw which was creepy I saw plenty of interesting things I wouldn\u2019t have seen anywhere else. However, I was second mate on a tanker distributing refined oil products around the coast of New Zealand. A yacht had sailed from a port on the east coast, bound for another port just down the coast abit but it had disappeared. Solo sailor on board - aside from his dog. None the less, the search proved fruitless and it was suspended. However, for weeks afterwards at about 0130 in the morning the rescue coordination center would broadcast a plea at the end of the weather and navigation warning broadcast asking for the yacht to make contact if it could hear the message and was able to do so. \n\nI\u2019d sit in the dark, chain smoking and working on my 7th cup of coffee looking out into the black imagining the guy who\u2019s had a stroke or heart attack on board with the same broad cast playing out on his radio while his dog ate his face to keep from starving.. or imagining him having fallen over the side imagining what it\u2019d be like watching your yacht sailing indifferently off into the distance with your dog in the cockpit pacing and agitated unable to do anything about it. Knowing you were fucked and had a matter of hours - if that left to live before the cold got you or exhaustion. Or, imagining the dog starving and dying on a yacht by itself weeks later listening to the same broadcast in the dark. \n\nThe places your mind goes in the dark by yourself\u2026 \n\nThey found the yacht in the end. \n\nThe dog was still alive. \n\nhttps://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/about-us/what-we-do/safety-and-response/rescue-coordination-centre-rccnz/tafadzwa/",
            "One night on the 00-04 watch in the Persian gulf on a Military transport, the whole sky went from pitch black of 0200 to fully lit in a second. This went on for about 30 seconds then back to pitch black. We called up the neighboring ships and HQ no one knew what happened. Our best guess was a meteor. \n\nSecond story was a couple years before the first, cruising around the Philippines and see nothing at all visual and on radar, All of a sudden we see a faint white light about 100 yards off our port bow. Typically we don't let anything get within a mile of our ship. Grab the binos and head to the bridge wing and there is just a little banca boat with his outboard motor and a flashlight. Even with Radar, NVG's and an infrared camera we couldn't see this guys little 20 foot boat in a 6 foot sea without lights on.\n\nObviously more crazy stuff than creepy in my career so far. \n\nThe people are the craziest thing you will experience at sea, had one guy who wouldn't go outside the skin of the ship at night because the aliens would abduct him... again!",
            "Empty boat far out at sea",
            "Nothing too extensive like some of the stories here, but I worked as a tuna fisherman for a tiny bit, where I\u2019d spend 3-4 weeks out at a time, taking around 3 days of 24 hour travel to get where we (me and one other person - the captain who was a 5th generation fisherman) were fishing.\n\nSo many stories of insane things that I could be here all night - but one was near the end of the season, and we pushed out farther than we should have (over 100 nautical miles) where we had NO business being as a 37 foot trawler. And then we\u2019re caught in a bad storm.\n\nI had barely enough time to, very carefully, board up all of the windows before the boat started \u201cscooping\u201d when coming down one of the 12ft waves, the first third of the boat dives underwater before popping back up, only to travel up another wave and do it again\u2026and again\u2026as waves got larger and things got worse.\n\nBasically, the captain and I stayed the cabin, bracing ourselves with each wave, staring at the radar in hopes we could stay in the position of taking the waves head-on and avoid being capsized. After a few minutes, and the fear that this 5th generation fisherman was exuding, I just accepted that I was going to die there - and the experience of that acceptance, and the event itself, had a profound effect on my perception and the way I\u2019ve lived life afterward.\n\nWe eventually made it out, and didn\u2019t say a lot to each other afterward. Lots of stories from that time, but this was the \u201ccreepiest\u201d, I\u2019d say!",
            "i have a friend who works on ships. he said the single scariest thing he had ever seen was looking out a window and seeing a wave that he said looked like it was 100 meters high pass right by their boat and suddenly disappear. he knew about rogue waves but he said seeing one that big, and that close, and watching it suddenly just vanish was so creepy and shocking that he was literally stunned for a minute.",
            "I worked on the sailboat one summer in the Bahamas and something that you see a lot when you\u2019re in the ocean is kayaks and life jackets floating around and you always radio them in but they always just fell off a yacht or something and it\u2019s never a big deal. \nOnce we found a kayak floating and it had a fishing rod in the rod holder which basically meant someone was using it\n\nEDIT: didn't see how viral this went overnight - some people were asking questions, the coast guard doesn't really even look into this stuff unless there is a confounding report so we never received an update (not that I would have expected one unless there was a full scale search), we went up close to it and it had the removable seat cushion still in which further convinced us that someone had been using it, there was nothing else to see, the line was in the water, but we never really revisited it, we tried not talk about it because the kids on the boat got creeped out after the adults kinda freaked out and didn't control their emotions.",
            "I was on a 32ft speedboat and got caught by nightfall in between islands. No night lights on the boat, navigating using gps and depth finder. Captain knew the way like the back of his hand since he\u2019d sailed those waters since he was a kid but for me it was my first time in the middle of the ocean at night. Pitch black but for the stars. As above so below, it seemed as if the boat was floating in the blackest void of the universe. Years later I saw the movie Life of Pi and the scene where Pi is in his lifeboat floating in the dark among the stars no above no below : it was exactly like that. I still have dreams about that night. . The engulfing dark and the silence that was not silent. Surreal.\n\nWe made it safely to port. Captain fitted the nightlights on that boat the day after.",
            "I was underway from the Port of Houston to Cartagena, Columbia. The vessel cuts all lights off on the outside of the boat, so it's pretty dark outside. I would always go and sit out on the deck and listen to my headphones, and look at the stars. Well one night, somewhere in the middle of the Caribbean sea, I noticed a swarm of lightning bugs cross the boat. Totally blew my mind to see light out or nowhere. At least I think it was lightning bugs. \n\nOn the same trip heading back to Houston from Columbia, I witnessed a satellite crashing. At least, that's what I think it was. It steadily strobed and lit up the night sky and water for about 15 min till I couldn't see it anymore. \n\nAnd on a different trip, I was in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. No moon, no clouds, no light pollution, the amount of stars that I saw made me cry. Never thought starlight alone could cast a shadow. Definitely mesmerizing I still remember it like it was yesterday.",
            "I sailed on the American aircraft carrier USS George Washington in 2000 and 2002.  A couple of things I remember are:\n\n-Pulling into Lisbon, Portugal for a port visit.  Carriers can\u2019t pull pier side in Lisbon so we had to take boats back and forth.  I was looking down at the water and there wasn\u2019t a square inch that didn\u2019t have a jellyfish in it.  We were sailing through a giant bloom of them and all I could think of is if someone could survive if they fell in.  \n\n-The USS Cole was part of our battle group.  We left her behind in the Red Sea while we went through the Suez Canal.  Once we entered the Mediterranean Sea the Admiral went on the 1MC (ship speaker system) and told us that a rib boat had hit her and blown a hole in the side.  \n\nAbout a month later we were pulling into Palma, Spain when a rib boat came barreling towards us.  The security detail was called on deck and they were ready to blow them out of the water.  The Commanding Officer quickly told them to not shoot.  It turned out to be Greenpeace.  For the next five hours Greenpeace and hundreds of their friends circled the ship in their boats and jet skis.  Those guys probably had no idea how close they came to getting killed that day.  \n\n-Sailing across the Atlantic, especially in the winter, can get intense.  Carriers have advanced stabilization capabilities because the flight deck needs to be safe for landing.  Even with that, there are times where the ship bobbed around like a cork.\n\nEDIT: 3 Doors Down held a concert on our ship during that visit and made this video.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pFq1eT9tMJ4?si=vWqvn8xM_oKiLmWG",
            "A few things come to mind, but i have to say, \"Deadheads.\" In my younger days, I was captain of a dragger out of Kodiak AK. She was a 130' Gidddings marine trawler. I will never forget my first week in the wheelhouse with the owner who was retiring and showing me the operation before I took over. After a night busting ice off the rails in freezing rain and 2 meter seas, he went to bunk and left me to wheel watch. It was clearing up with a medium haze and flat calm waters. Most of the crew was sleeping or hanging out in the galley, so I was alone and the only eyes forward. \n\nI'm drinking some nasty folgers and sucking down a Marlboro red when I see what looked like an old pier piling, straight ahead. I kept looking at that spot, and, nope, nothing there. A few seconds later I swear I saw that thing again but only closer. Nope, gone again. I thought, shit I've been up waaay too long and I'm fucking hallucinating. Then out of nowhere this tree trunk shoots directly up into the sky, this thing had to be 60' tall and was about 30'off the bow, dead center. I damn near shit myself. I pushed to port and rubbed the \"tree\" with the right side of the bow. We were at a good 14knot clip which is fast as hell for an almost fully loaded trawler. Then it shot town and disappeared about midship. \n\nI later learned that these are pretty uncommon in the Aleutians, where we were fishing. They're called \"deadheads\" and only 2 of the guys on the boat had seen them before. They float vertically, and Bob straight up and down. These things were known to destroy older wood boats and kill crews. I'm just glad I wasn't dragging the net, and it would have cost us in the ballpark of 100k.\n\nI've seen what most people would consider worse, but the fear that a huge bobbing tree in the middle of Alaskan waters come out of fucking nowhere tops my list.",
            "I was once deployed to a Taiwanese high-seas driftnet vessel as a fisheries observer. The vessel I was placed on would deploy their net and the crew would then seek a few hours sleep (they usually got no more than 5 or so hours when actively fishing). Often, though, the captain would stay up and hand jig for squid, which he dried and packed away. One night, however, I got up to take a leak and no one was awake. We were 1500 miles from the nearest land, about equidistant between Midway and the Aleutians. The waters were calm and the moon lit the sea under a partly cloudy sky. I went out to the rail and began pissing over board. The ship began to rock. It was moments before I realized that a monstrous fucking container ship was passing to our stern by less than a hundred yards. The ship was so large it covered my whole field of view. To this day I wonder if someone aboard that vessel had been paying attention, because I guarantee you we were not.",

Well I can't explain why, but the ocean water was luring me, but at the same time you are terrified, since nobody will find you if you fall overboard. So sometimes I was just staring at the water in the dark, and inside me was some struggle, like some part of me wanted to jump in, while the other was terrified that it would be a one way ticket. Can't still find the explanation for this. This hypnotic, mesmerising feeling I get, and at the same time the chills running down my spine, that if I would fall in the water. It's game over for sure.",

The vessle it was wrapped around is about 15m long, and its tentacles were wrapped up over the gunnels 2/3 of the way down the sides. \n\nWithin seconds it had detached and fell back into the ocean. \nI can still picture its eyeball, the size of a football, staring right at me before it dropped into the ocean.

            "I'm not a sailor at all. But I did a few boat trips with a friend who moved boats around for a living. He was usually carrying boats from the French Riviera (Monaco, Nice, Antibes, Cannes) to Corsica.\n\nMy very first trip with him, we left from Monaco on our way to (I think?) Calvi. We left in the evening, and the trip started very well, with dolphins following us around...nice moment.\n\nAround 2am, in the middle of a pitch black night, very far from any coast, we saw a tiny light in the distance, pretty much on our way. And as we got closer, we saw it was a tiny fishing boat. The kind that usually doesn't go very far from the coast...except we were more than 100km from the coast.\n\nWe slowed down as we got close to it, and yelled to check if someone was on it. No answer. So we decided to get close to it. And soon it became obvious it was empty. There were just a few bottles of water, some snacks, some fishing gear, even some dead fish in a bucket, and an old Nokia phone (still on!). But nobody on.\n\nMy friend called on the radio, explaining the situation. Italian coastguards told us to wait around till they arrived. We did, and when they arrived they told us they would investigate the situation. They took our ID, wrote down our explanation of the situation, and let us leave to finish our trip.\n\nThe whole thing was creepy to me, as it seemed obvious the owner had fallen from his boat, couldn't get back in, and drowned. I had this in mind for weeks, thinking we could maybe have rescued the guy if we had passed there slightly earlier.\n\nAfter a while, this story faded in my mind, and I went on with my life. Till someday my friend called me to explain that he got a call from an Italian guy, who thanked him because he could get his boat back thanks to us. He was the owner of the tiny boat, who explained he was out fishing not too far from the shore, when he had a big chest pain. He made an emergency call and was soon rescued, but his boat was left to drift. Till we found it.\n\nLearning that the guy was still alive, erased the creepy side of this story from my head, and I was happy about it.",

I assume everyone else had gone to sleep but I was not very sleepy after a pretty stressed day. The top crew helming the ship on the night shift was at an angel and so could not see me. I went on the deck and just looked at the ocean. \n\nDo you know that very strange feeling when you sense that somebody is looking at you? I could swear that there was something just below the surface moving in pace with us. I don't remember how much time passed. It felt like a long, long time. I was just staring just at the edge of my eyesight, thinking that I would see something. I guess it could've been fish or some sea mammal, but it felt wrong. I wish I had a more interesting conclusion than that. I actually don't even remember going back to my cabin that I shared with two other stews. The next morning I didn't talk about it, but then a few days later, I brought it up. No one thought much of it except one of the deckhands that had been working at sea for a long time.

When I walked out the skin of ship, I silently gasped because I was really scared. The calmness of it all and the lack of distinction of the horizon was terrifying. I went back in the skin of the ship out of fear then came back out about ten minutes later and just breathed.

You'll literally see massive storm clouds developing a water spout (although they seldom fully develop), and lightning light up the horizon. It's especially powerful at night to the point where all you see is white light. \n\nOther than that, it's just occasional Marine life. My job is mundane but it has its moments.",
            "Not a job but I've been scuba diving in the dark before. There was a moment where I strayed a little too far from the lights and lost where the surface was- the dimly lit void all around me, nothing but tiny bubbles and particles drifting through beam of my little torch. It almost felt as if I was asleep, or like nothing existed but me and the nothingness. There was a definite dreamlike quality to the experience (probably because I was floating).\n\nIt was beautiful, of course- I imagine it was a little like being in space- but also the terror of being somewhere you did not belong, a medium that your body was not made to exist in, is a very sharp feeling. The realisation that if I kept swimming in the wrong direction my life could actually be in danger probably wouldn't have occurred to me if I hadn't been trained on what to do in this exact scenario. It's pretty easy to panic in that position.\n\nI eventually managed to orient myself with the bubbles from my mask, and it turned out I wasn't that far from the surface lol. When I got back up I realised I was a lot further from the boat than I thought, though. Swam the whole way back less than a metre down. \n\nThe time between me realising I was lost to me reaching open air was probably less than a minute, but it felt like eternity. I think anyone who has been in the ocean at night would agree- it's a different world out there.",

Much longer and twice as massive as the \"biggest shark ever seen\" on the youtube videos I've seen. It didn't move a single inch... it just floated, mouth open, inbetween as everyone on the bridgewing exclaimed \"Holy fucking SHIT!\" It's teeth were as big as a man's head.

It's a very surreal experience, and other than having the vessel for reference, visually, it's hard to determine your orientation.

If you were to walk the weather decks at night with the conditions just right, you would be instantly swallowed by the ink of the night as soon as you exit the hatch.\n\nHaving served in the Coast Guard, we did a bit of just about everything you could imagine: sub escorts, body recovery, search and rescue, fisheries patrol, Coast guarding, etc. The only time that I was ever genuinely scared was steaming towards Amaknak Island from the Berring Sea during a winter storm. Waves were big enough to where you'd hear the screws (propellers for you landlubbers) coming out of the water occasionally.

People were crying, taking their curious kids elsewhere, others were frantically trying to find staff to go rescue her.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out a woman had left her sun dress and wig out to dry on her balcony the night before and the wind that morning had blown it into the water. \n\nAn announcement was made and everyone was so relieved and there was a lot of laughter. It was surreal to see everyone going from such worried, sad expressions (some were outright bawling their eyes out) to completely in hysterics laughing and hugging one another.\n\nI think we were all reminded of how precious life was that day, and it really was a HUGE relief. It was terrible in the moments where we thought it was an actual person. What made it believable is that  you're up so high on this ship it's hard to see details down below because of the distance along with the waves and water obscuring finer details.\n\n\nMy friends and I, who were on the cruise together, drank and laughed a lot that night.

            "Avid sailor and adventure hound here, I was sailing my small 30 ft sailboat from the SF bay area to Vancouver Canada with a couple of my buddies, one of my first coastal adventures north. We had run put of propane for a little gimbaled one burner stove which is what we were cooking with an we put into    a small bay in coastal Oregon to see if we could get a couple of the small propane bottles it used. I anchored a bit offshore as there was a bunch of kelp but some clear area, inflated the tender and my two crew went to shore to reconnoiter and hopefully get some gas while I kept an anchor watch. After a time I saw them cast off from shore and head to the boat in the inflatable which was powered by a small two horse outboard. As the got closer a huge Humpback whale spouted and then breached not a meter behind the boat, it dwarfed them and my eyes got so big and that coupled with the look on my face sent them scurrying as fast as they could to get to the boat. They were both shaking when they got back but it was awesome in retrospect for all of us.",

That particular night there were no other ships in the area, no stars, no moon, just that extreme brand of darkness you can only find in the middle of the ocean with zero light pollution.\n\nAbout halfway through the watch we started to hear this deep, low frequency humming noise that we couldn't identify. After looking around the wheelhouse for the source, I stepped out onto the bridge wing to see if it was coming from outside. I couldn't see my hand in front of my face, it was so dark, but the sound was definitely louder outside. I saw a faint light out of the corner of my eye, and I looked up at the mast where our antennas and radar were mounted and was surprised to find the whole thing was shrouded in a glowing blue haze. \n\nI'm sure I'm not the only person in this thread who has encountered the meteorological phenomenon known as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" at sea, but I'll certainly never forget that eerie blue glow and deep hum on that dark night in the middle of the Pacific!",

            "I so rarely get to tell the story of Oskar. It's one of my favorites, and all true.\n\nI was working as a dive instructor on a tiny island in the gulf of Thailand. Long time ago...\n\nWe had a lot of backpackers who stuck around to train as recreational divemasters. one guy who was part of a group of friends training with us was a Swede named Oskar. I liked him. Sweet kid, very nice- highly athletic and fun to be around, good to work with. Very short and good looking with long, blonde hair. A tiny little viking friend.\n\nWhen divemasters finish the program we usually have a party with lots of silly games, stupid rites of passage (including drinking a bucket of thai whiskey and red bull through a snorkel, etc). Just a stupid reason for really excessive drinking. We had several of these per month.\n\nIn the middle of Oskar 's party and feats of ceremonial consumption, he had to leave with a friend to catch an overnight ferry across the gulf for a dive trip.\n\nNo problem. He made the ferry.\n\nBut his friend woke up a little before daybreak and couldn't find him anywhere on the boat. Anywhere. Oskar had disappeared at some point during the 7 hour night trip. No one saw him fall. But, apparently, he had.\n\nAround the same time, back home on our tiny island, Oskars roommate was confused to find him dripping wet at the door, but with a rather lengthy explanation--\n\nAlcohol, Xanax and weed sent Oskar above deck for a cigarette in the middle of the night. He didnt remember falling, but he remembered seeing the boat leave him struggling, treading the cold, 4-6 foot November surge in the Gulf of Thailand. Alone.\n\nSoon, there was no light in the distance at all. None. Not even in the moonless, clouded sky. No light in any direction on the water, no indication of which way led to shore, possibly a hundred kilometers away, and which way led to sea. No idea which way the current was taking him.\n\nAlone. comprehending. Then panicking. Swimming, Struggling to think. Struggling to stay afloat. Trying to think through the alcohol and drugs, through the cold and the fear, the constant rise and fall and beating of the water. The aching, heavy limbs and burning lungs aspirating salt water. For hours-- he didn't know how many.\n\nEnough time to understand thoroughly that he was going to die. any minute. Maybe this one. No salvation. No hope of rescue. Time to say goodbyes and prayers. He would die cold, suffering, alone and he would never be found.\n\nThen, exhausted and numb there was another pain-- the sudden, disorienting pain of being thrown against a solid object, though he could not see it. He had touched nothing solid in hours. His body had forgotten as it was dying. It was terrifying.\n\nIt was a tiny fishing boat, possibly the only one within countless square miles of remote water.. the handful of crew was asleep for the night on deck, thank god, or they likely wouldn't have heard him calling for help. He road home in silence-- Burmese boat boys don't tend to speak English.\n\nThat's the story as he told it while he was gathering fresh clothes.

So taking the precaution that it could be a dead ship that might need assistance, I brought our ship closer and turned on the spotlights to try and find it in the water. At one point I had the Captain, Chief Mate, and two lookouts on the bridge wing trying to find this object that was showing up very clearly on the radar, but nothing.

It's completely pitch black in the middle of the night in the middle of the Baltic Sea, so dark the milky way was being reflected in the water.\n\nA practice torpedo runs a little deeper than usual so as to not accidentally hit anything (though modern torpedo's also explode below a ships keel to use a bubble effect) and it has a very powerful floodlight so you can easily follow its path for evaluation. A bright light under the water in the Baltic Sea gives off a green hazy light.\n\nSo from our point of view, in the pitch black looking at the Milky Way and just hearing our engine and the waves we would all of a sudden see this huge green light appear under the water, make a series of turns and then head directly for us at like 50 knots. As it gets closer you hear a whining noise from the blades and it goes straight under your ship. And then it does it over and over again to finally just disappear.\n\nLogically you know it's basically just a remote controlled little submarine with a flashlight, but actually seeing it play out was creepy and cool as hell.

            "I was struggling with my alcoholism & we were discussing how I had been cutting back. She asked what I would consider success, with regard to my drinking. I said I wanted to get to a point where it wasn't interfering with my daily life.  I wanted to just be able to have a glass of wine at holiday dinners or family gatherings. \n\nShe simply asked me why. Why was it important for me to drink at those times? \n\nIt was as if she'd turned on a light.  Alcohol had always been a key ingredient in every family function, for my entire life. When I smell bourbon, I think of my uncle. When I smell vermouth, I think of my dad. Alcohol ran through almost every happy childhood memory. \n\nBut, even more than that, I was very afraid of the explanation I'd have to give when family and friends asked why I wasn't having a drink. I had tried to quit before, but failed. What if I admitted my problem, only to fall off the wagon? \n\nWhen she asked why I didn't want to *completely* quit, it was the first time I saw that last part of big picture. I'd be willing to drink myself to death in order to avoid being scrutinized, or judged for possible future failures. \n\nThat was the day I quit.  I've been sober since May 6th, 2017.  2,407 days.",

But eventually I started to realize I was trying to change myself in order to stay with this person rather than just being who I am. It took me 3 more months to finally break up with her but from that day on, I vowed to never again abandon myself just to be with someone I had convinced myself was better than me.",

She told me most people only go through one to three traumatic events of that magnitude in their whole life time and I cried. \n\nI didn't look at it and think \"wow life sucks for me\", I looked at it and was amazed at my strength. Life kept throwing horrors at me, and yet there I was sitting in therapy still fighting. \n\nI still doubt my strengths but whenever I remember that moment, I realise I am made of steel.",

            "I've never really had friends. I've had colleagues and classmates and housemates and people who have hung out with me, but I never really felt close to any of them. And I did that thing you see on here sometimes - I stopped reaching out to see if I would be reached out to, and I wasn't, which I took as confirmation that they didn't really want me around, or at the very least, that they wouldn't mind my absence. \n\nI was talking to my therapist about people I'd been close to in college, and she told me to pick one and talk about him. So I did. And after I shared some basic stuff like his name and his major etc., and a couple anecdotes, she asked me what else I knew about him. And I couldn't answer. It wasn't really a broadly-applicable bombshell, but she said \"what else\" and I started crying because I realized that for as simple as the question was, my inability to answer spoke volumes.\n\nI've never had good friends because I've never been a good friend. I'm withdrawn and reserved and I always made others do the work to drag me out, without ever extending my own friendship in a meaningful way in return. If I wanted to have meaningful relationships with other people, I would have to build them.\n\nI'm still working on this, but I'm trying to make more offers and extend more friendliness to others in my daily life.\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I know this is late and the thread has probably died already, but I fell asleep shortly after writing this. I'm in Japan, and the time zone is very mismatched.\n\nSeveral comments have asked me what specifically I've changed, and I have two answers. One is to put myself in a position to find people with shared interests. A look at my profile will confirm that I love One Piece, and manga in general. While I'm here, I booked a tour to visit the statues of the characters erected in the artist's home prefecture of Kumamoto. The tour was public, and it ended up being six people total. We bonded over our shared love of the material, and at the end of the tour, two people (a couple) invited me to join them for dinner afterward. It was the first time I felt like I'd been invited to something because the inviter genuinely wanted to spend more time with me. I was elated. We talked for three hours about theories, favorite moments, real-world meanings and effects, and all sorts of things.\n\nThe second is that I'm making an effort to ask more questions. I tend to talk without stopping when I get on a topic I'm passionate about. So when I catch myself doing that, I try to stop myself naturally, and ask the other person for their input, or segue into a more personal topic. I want to learn more about these people so that I can be a better friend to them. I learned about them outside of their favorite arc or quote, and I'm glad I did.",

Those times were actually the most peaceful times and something I looked forward to (minus the aftermath). I tried my best to shield my siblings from knowing the full extent of the abuse/neglect. I used to redirect the physical/verbal abuse onto myself to protect them. I never let them see how overwhelmed I was trying to keep us safe. There were a lot of times I couldn't afford to feed all of us. I would tell them I wasn't hungry. There were a lot of times I would breakdown after they went to bed. I didn't want them to see me sobbing from pure exhaustion and stress. I tried to give them semi normal childhoods. I would pick up extra odd jobs so they could go on school trips. I would take them to the park sometimes. I would try to give them little treats when I could swing it. I tried my best to show them unconditional love. \n\nI never felt like it was enough. I messed up a LOT. I didn't know how to cope with my own trauma at the time. I would get so angry sometimes. I never once hit any of them, I came close to it though. I would lose my temper and scream at them sometimes over small things. I always felt extreme guilt over it. At one point, I chose to run away. I told myself at the time that if I didn't I was going to end up dead and then who in this world would care enough to try to get my siblings out? I haven't seen them since. CPS *finally* did their job a week later after years of being shown evidence of abuse. I really struggled with the separation. I still question what exactly happened that was so bad that CPS finally did what they should've years ago.

After being told that, I stared paying attention to the patterns and he was right - my depression came on after periods of bad anxiety. Since then, if I notice my anxiety getting bad, I take steps to try and control it (e.g. removing myself from the situation, taking time off, crying to relive the emotions etc). I still have major anxiety, but I've not had many depressive episodes since then",

            "In conversation with my therapist, we spoke of my uncle - who is endlessly kind, generous, and caring, who I admire greatly. He is ultra dedicated as a doctor and scientist and constantly berates himself as not doing or being good enough. My uncle\u2019s therapist asked my uncle to describe himself and then people he admired. During the peer descriptions, his therapist held up a mirror to force my uncle to speak of himself instead of his peers. This sparked a monumental change in him (and me when i heard that story).\n\nLater on with my discussion and therapy about self doubt, insecurity, and depression, my therapist asked me - quite abruptly - how A.) my uncle would describe me and B.) my uncle would feel to hear me describe myself so negatively.\n\nSometimes you can\u2019t see the forest through the trees.",

So, my surgeon recommended a psychiatrist that was in network for my insurance and who specializes in eating disorders and doing these evaluations.  I make an appointment, they send me a thick packet of paperwork and say that it is required to have it fully completed, without fail and bring it to the appointment.\n\nOk, no biggie right?  Some 15 pages of disclosures and boilerplate garbage, sign and date every page and then the hard part.  The questionnaire about me and my life was another 12 pages front and back.  Remember, they require completion when you arrive, they make it clear that if anything is not done, they will cancel the appointment and may or may not reschedule you, cancelation fee and all.  It's a good thing I had plenty of time to work on it cause they were not easy questions.\n\nDay of appointment I double checked everything, they even provided a summary check off sheet so that was nice and headed in.  Nice office in the hospital medical office wing, pretty small, receptionist greets me by name, has me sign in and goes over all the paperwork checking for completeness they hands me back my questionnaire sheets and says it will be a moment.\n\nThey call me back, Dr greets me by name, asks for my questionnaire and explains the structure of the meeting.  I have a seat, agree to wait as he reads over my answers, clarify an answer or two because my penmanship is not master class.  He makes a few notes then sets my paperwork aside, looks me in the eye and casually says:\n\n\"Well, Mr._____ your family didn't want you around very much as a kid, did they?\n\nAfter the shock of being hit between the eye with a hammer passed, I swallowed, considered a bit and agreed.
