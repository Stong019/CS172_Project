            "In North America archaeologists have to be extremely careful with any kind of Native American burial. Nowadays its more and more common that archaeologists might get a chance to look at a burial but they put it back in place as best as they can when they're done. So they study the burial but take nothing from it. This is because the living ancestors of these ancient people still like to honour their dead.",
            "There's also a methodology component to it.\n\nRegardless of the age of the remains, if I womble up with a metal detector, dig a hole and yoink out anything of value - that's grave robbing. If I fight for months for planning approval, record every detail of the site in obsessive detail, then refill any holes carefully when the funding has run out even though there's still more to discover - that's archaeology.\n\nPlus archeology's not just graves!",

As others have said, it's not a matter of time as much as it is intent. Grave robbing is an unsanctioned, for-profit endeavour. Archaeology is a legally permitted, scientific examination for the purpose of understanding the past. Generally speaking exhumation of recently interred remains for those purposes is forensic, rather than archaeological, despite similar methodology as it's usually conducted in the course of a criminal investigation. Contrary to the popular imagination, burial archaeology is probably only about 10% of the science, if that. Most of it is mundane shit like analysing fish bone assemblages.",

This includes ones that are 2 years in the ground to 10000 years. Native American burials are further protected by federal laws.\n\nIf you\u2019re an archaeologist and you come across a burial on a site, you need to notify the county coroner, the local police, your state\u2019s historic preservation office, and potentially the local Native American tribe. They will make determinations as to its approximate age and if an investigation is needed, what happens to the remains, or if there is a possibility/need for notification of next of kin. Then you dig it up. \n\nMost of the time, it\u2019s pretty straightforward and it is dug up. \n\nGenerally speaking, as an archaeologist in the US  you don\u2019t go looking for burials to purposely dig them up unless there is a good reason since it triggers all sorts of laws and questions of ethics.",

            "It's a bit of a grey area really. Most archaeology is 'developer led' these days. The only reason the site gets excavated is because it's going to be developed for housing, industry, quarrying etc.\n\nIn these cases the site is going to be trashed and full excavation is only done as a last resort to ensure features and finds are properly recorded, removed and stored before they are destroyed by heavy machinery.\n\nMost reputable archaeologists would recommend that things are best left in the ground and undisturbed if at all possible, regardless of age.\n\nSo, on development sites, the age of the grave really doesn't matter, but speaking from experience, if its wrapped in carpet, found in the topsoil or has better trainers than me... as an archaeologist I'm still calling the cops! Anything else gets excavated to the highest professional standards and treated with respect. \n\nAlso, if it's been done for archaeology you need a licence to handle human remains.

            "I actually worked on an archaeological excavation a few years ago where we dug up 3000 year old Mycenaean tombs in Greece. The biggest issue we encountered was that at night and during the off season (winter months), grave robbers would come to dig up the tombs to steal the artifacts in them. Once we discovered tombs we actually had to hire a night guard to watch over them while we weren\u2019t there. These robbers had actually stolen most of the artifacts discovered at the site from the late 20th century to now and although most were lost, some gold seal rings were found and recovered at a metropolitan auction when a professor recognized them.\n\nArchaeology is the art of destruction. Every time you remove a stone or move dirt, you are destroying something that someone made. Archaeologists acknowledge this and dedicate their lives to noting every detail and cataloguing everything that they find. All of this is done for the pursuit of knowledge-their work is the foundation of our understanding of the ancient world. They usually have no money and their careers ahead of them are not easy. Looters are just in it to profit off it (and they can make a lot of money). Every time they remove an artifact, the artifact itself disappears forever just to end up in someone\u2019s private collection that they can\u2019t even show to their friends, and all the information vanishes with it because without context it\u2019s just another mysterious old thing.",

            "As an anthropology student, tbh, I must say that it's a question that has no real answer. In my own opinion, funerary archaeology will always be grave digging, regarding of the time that passed. When egyptologists find a new tomb in the Valley of Kings/Queens, they'll remove the belongings of the dead and even his bodies to expose them in a museum. Even if the person has been dead for 3000 years, I think it can still be messed up to steal one's offerings and body to expose them to the masses.\n\nBecause the removal of the artifacts and people from their tomb, the best archaeologists can do is record the context (stratum, disposition of artifacts, precise area on the site where it was found) in order that the grave itself is remembered as it was before it was disturbed.",

Archaeology is mostly paperworks, and to sort through ancient people's trash sites (where they would toss animal bones and broken claypots after having a meal. And then woopsie doopsie doo here comes some archaeologists about 6000 years later and roaming through the trash piles of half burnt animal bones/burnt woodbits and claybits!)\nHowever; as people here have already mentioned...excavation needs approval of the state/city before anyone can start digging. Either that or the city is going to build some new road or new apartment and therefore need aechaeologists to examine the place before they can do any actual building on the spot. And even though archaeologists asks for approval they may not even get it. And that means that some ancient burial site or some ancient living space/community might be build over. However I don't think that happens that often, but there sadly are exceptions. My teachers has told me stories and it must be devastating when you get a rejection from the state/city.",

This professor saw Indiana Jones, for example, as a grave robber, since his focus was the gold/treasure/etc. An archeologist usually focuses on what the \u201cstuff\u201d means than what it\u2019s worth (in the modern day theories of archeology, of course. Throughout history there are \u2018archeologists\u2019 who have not done so and archeological theories that valued stuff over knowledge)\n\nSo, it is not time as much as intent. Also, cultural pressures too. As others have said, in the US, found graves are strictly regulated, and archeologists who find a body must consult the local tribe(s) before doing anything with/to the body.\n\nEdit: As mentioned below - yes, DO NOT DIG UP GRAVES FOR \u201cEDUCATIONAL PURPOSES\u201d UNLESS YOU ARE PROPERLY TRAINED AND HAVE FULL PERMISSIONS OF THE LAW/LANDOWNERS/LOCAL INDIGENOUS PEOPLES/ ETC AND UNDERSTAND LOCAL LAWS ON SUCH ACTIONS",

So maybe I can shed some light.  \n\n1) Grave robbing is NEVER archeology.   The two are very different  Grave robbing is about sgtealing for the purpose of making money  Archeology is about learning who we are by discoving who our ancestors were.  \n\n2) Currently operating cemeteries will hire archeologists to research both records and the grounds of the cemetery looking for lost graves or when records were incomplete.   You would be surprised how often that happens;   Ground penetrating radar for example, to see where unmarked graves in a cemetery are so they are not dug up by accident.\n\n3) Any archeologist I have ever met goes to extreme lenghts to show respect to old bones and remains, regardless of whom they were;\n\n4) It is not common, but sometimes  the remains of first nations people (at least here in Canada) that have been accidently dug up will be reburied in a new grave, new location, in full cerimony.  Ironically one such burial that happened in my city like this is withing walking distance of a burial mound that predates European contact.  \n\n5) Archeologists are often called in when human remains (bones) are discovered , usually by construction, to see if they are recent or \"older\".  There was one case years ago in my city that caused a sensation.   Long story short, the bones showed signs of obivous trauma, all the hallmarks of a murder.  The police were called in.  However the bones proved to be around 500 years old.  So the line between archeology and police investigation is not always clear as people migh think, at least at the initial discovery of  human remains.\n\n6) If you have not heard of it before, google \"Body Farm\".   Reseaerch from Body Farms has shown that in extreme but natural circumstances, a human body can become nothing more than a skeleton in as short as six weeks.   So again, if human bones are discovered, until through examination  is made, the lines between a grave, archeology and police investigation are all very hard to tell apart.\n\nSo I hope that helps a bit.",

They dig and examine unidentified graves/graveyards in order to identify them. \n\nSo the question itself is dumb and illogical, not a funny one.

We have no jurisdiction to study those, but I\u2019m not sure who is required to move them. \n\nThe real line between grave robbing and archeology is in the reasoning for this. If you\u2019re digging holes with no jurisdiction and keeping the stuff you find, it\u2019s stealing. Period. Unless you\u2019re on your own land. Archeologists operate under a code of ethics.

When we build dams, we don't worry about whether or not a dam will cause an ant hill to be flooded out.

            "\\#1, there is absolutely nothing on planet Earth that the aliens can't find in more abundance elsewhere. Precious metals, gasses for fuel (assuming they don't have zero point energy or some shit that lets them get power from vacuum), and even water are all available in space and you can get this resources with zero resistance. So I don't think they would come here for any resources, unless they want our biosphere (which, for all we know, could be abundant in the galaxy).\n\n\\#2, if aliens do show up one day but turn out to be hostile, there is absolutely nothing we can do to stop them. If they have been coming here (if you believe in that sort of thing), they have been doing so for a VERY long time. They know everything about us, including our weaknesses and how to exploit them. Meanwhile, they are a species capable of FTL travel. Wiping us out would be as simple for them as flipping on a light switch. No jet-to-ship dog fights, no magical weak point to hit, no third-act secret weapon to save us. Just one press of that button and everything turns white--and then black.\n\nSo if they do come to Earth, they would need a damn good reason to.

But the only reason we think that is because that's the only thing we are familiar with. Aliens might have completely different emotions or thought processes than us but we won't know because we never encountered them before. It's like the 4th dimension.

It's one thing if we come into their territory, but if they stumble upon us we're most likely safe. Them finding us would mean they are incredibly advanced. Anything they could get by attacking earth they could get far easier by harvesting it from a different planet in our solar system. Unless they feed specifically on brainwaves, it isn't worth the hassle to attack a planet teeming with life they may have some weapons, however primitive, that might be used against you.   \n\n\nIt's far more frightening to believe that aliens have/will one day discover us and won't be interested, They won't want us on their intergalactic counsels, they won't want to give us medicine, they won't want to form any bond.

            "They might not have orifices for eating or pooping.\n\nHear me out.  Almost all life on earth is topologically equivalent to a donut.  Meaning we have an outside wall and an inside wall (digestive and respiratory track) that runs like a hole through us, and our important bits are sandwiched between these walls.\n\nOne of the only examples of life that isn't like that would be for example single-celled organisms, amoebas and such, which just kind of ooze over whatever they acquire sustenance from and osmos it into themselves. Currently on earth only micro organisms are like that (edit: also some weird ocean creatures).\n\nBut there are fossils dating from before the Cambrian explosion from millions of years ago which hint that a completely different type of large and complex organisms might have evolved to walk the earth before that evolutionary lineage was wiped out by an asteroid or the like.  One of the oldest of these rare fossils is of a zero-orificed creature that was about a meter long!  We don't have a lot of info from life during that age but it indicates there may have been an entire evolutionary track of complex life forms favoring life that is topologically equivalent to ball instead of donut. And that's on EARTH.\n\nSo, yeah. We could very well find an entire planet of giant, oozy amoebas of assorted species and intelligence, who neither eat, speak, or shit like we do.  Just try figuring out how to beach THAT cultural and language barrier.\n\nEdit: For those asking for more info on the ancient Earth giant amoeba fossil -- I read about it in \"The Science of the Discworld\" (co-authored by Pratchett and 2 others) which is a very cool take on a popular science book.  About our world, yes don't worry, not about the discworld, although alternating chapters use a fun discworld frame story as an excuse to look at the cool science in the science chapters.  I'll see if I can pinpoint where in the books they talked about this fossil and update if I find it!  Would highly recommend this as a popular science read btw.  Very entertaining and educational.\n\nEdit 2:  Found it!  The class of fossils are called Ediacarans.  An excerpt from chapter 23 of [The Science of the Discworld](https://ia600900.us.archive.org/33/items/TheNewDiscworldCompanion/The%20Science%20of%20Discworld%20I.pdf) :\n\n\"These creatures are known as Ediacarans, after a place in Australia where the first fossils were found.\\* They could grow to half a metre or more, but as far as can be told from the fossil record, seem not to have had any internal organs or external orifices like a mouth or an anus (they may have survived by digesting symbiotic bacteria in their selves, or by some other process we can only guess at). Some were flattened, and clustered together in quilts. We have no idea whether the Ediacarans were our distant ancestors, or whether they were a dead end, a lifestyle doomed to failure. No matter: they were around then, and as far as anyone knew, not much else was. There are hints of fossil wormcasts, though, and some very recent fossils look like ... but we're getting ahead of the story. The point is that nearly all Ediacaran life was apparently unrelated to what came later.\"",

            "No one's going to see this after 2800 comments, but here goes. Just to add onto the concept that aliens would be, at least, millennia ahead of us and the kind technology we'd except them to have...\n\nWormholes and the Alcubierre drive are the best ideas humanity have for realistic FTL. Not every species is going to need FTL, but humans would rather not spend decades getting from star to star. Exactly what form an FTL drive might take is beyond me, but both work by exploiting loopholes in space itself to avoid breaking the speed of light and causality. A wormhole would be a hopefully permanent folding of space so that they're connected by a throat of energy connecting two \"mouths\" large enough that a ship could pass through without touching the sides. The Alcubierre drive is basically a Star Trek warp, sorta; space contracts in front and expands behind, thereby moving a bubble of motionless space at FTL speeds. They both have their positives and negatives. \n\nBoth of these things require control of a hypothetical substance called Exotic Matter, which has negative mass / negative energy. That means it would be repelled by gravity. It would also be nice if it was stable and non-reactive with most regular matter, but who knows? For the purposes of FTL, we'd need to be able to make a lot of it; many tonnes at least, a small planetoid's anti-mass at most.\n\nWe'd also need to have fine control over exotic matter and its properties. It would need to be built into some sort of a shape or matrix that would let a controller focus or manipulate space itself. Whatever was doing the controlling would also need to be practically infallible because mistakes could wipe out human life in a star-system.\n\nSo what do we need to do to get there? Humans have only just started being able to produce anti-matter, possibly the most destructive substance we know about. \n\n* So, first we need to work out an experiment to test if exotic matter is even possible. Then experimenting to find a stable variety that will work for our purposes.\n* This requires even larger, more energetic particle accelerator labs. I've read ideas in science-fiction for exploiting the magnetic fields of Jupiter or the Sun to conduct experiments. \n* If it requires anti-matter, we'd absolutely want to do those experiments far away from Earth's surface.\n* Second, we'd need to find out a way of reliably synthesizing more of it. Imagine industrial-sized particle accelerators or networks of auto-mated space-stations built in orbit of Jupiter, manipulating intense magnetic fields. \n* Third, we'd need to have as much fine control over exotic matter and gravity as we currently do for magnetism, fission, and fusion power (and then some). Essentially, masters of matter on both a micro- and macroscopic scale. Or nearly so. \n* We'd need the technology to be able to turn on/off gravity/anti-gravity, focus it, adjust the intensity, the shape and gradient of the field. \n\nSpace industry, construction, and habitation would have to be an everyday reality for tens of millions of people and robots to support the large-scale production of Exotic matter, space-craft fabrication, space-mining, and other related industries. It will take generations of people living and dying in space or other bodies in the solar system. Longer, considering how well we get along with one another.\n\nSo if they showed up here to say hello, their ships would probably appear to defy physics as we commonly understand it. Nearly shape would be possible, barely aerodynamic but able to turn on a dime without loss of momentum, movement and hovering with no exhaust (if not that, then using materials with unbreakable tensile strengths), perfect radiation protection (against anything we'd have anyway), gravity wave weapons that could rip apart molecules with no way to block it, near-perfection medical technology or biotechnology. The list goes on. \n\nSo, the real question is why don't be find any evidence of either sort of FTL method being used? Not even experimentally. Astronomers have seen some very energetic events out there, but nothing that wasn't explainable naturalisticly. Then again, perhaps we aren't looking in the right place at the right time. \n\nIf they used wormholes, they'd need to use conventional drives through normal space to send the other end of the wormhole there. It would take a long time, sure, but it's easier to stay at home making more stargates than having to be the one travelling the whole way there.\n\nIf they used the Alcubierre drive, surely there would be spikes of gamma radiation without a conventional source. From what I've read, the radiation is released as a result of shutting down the drive. Ideally, the blast of deadly radiation would be pointed out into empty space where it can spread out naturally. Even if the Alc. drive wasn't clean, humans might have trouble picking it out from the light of the star. So my thinking is that we might pick up a signal from a civ experimenting with the Alc. drive before they find a way to prevent a radiation spike. Or they could simply arrive before we saw them leave because they literally beat the light of the event.\n\nAs for communication, that's a whole other kettle of fish...",

She constantly called him and accused him of cheating (he never actually left the room except to go to class). \n\nI assumed she was cheating on him (because why else would she constantly assume he was cheating when she had no evidence and he had never done it before?) but I never paid attention to the details of the conversations. In fact I only knew about the cheating accusations because she constantly logged into his Facebook and messaged me pretending to be him trying to get me to say he cheated. \n\nAnyway she visited . They went out on a date night, I went out drinking.\n\nI had a fight with the girl I had been dating, so I went home and went to bed early.  I was almost asleep when they came in. Making out and all that. \n\nI was annoyed but tried to sleep. They were getting busy and then it got weird. \n\n\"You can put in my ass\" she said\n\nOh god. \n\nHe was like \"are you sure?\"\n\nShe goes \"yea, John did it so it's only fair. Plus you're smaller so it will be easy. \"\n\n\"`wait what!\" He says\n\n\"Yeah, c'mon!\" She says\n\n\"No that's super fucked up why would you say that? What the fuck I thought we were past that?\"\n\nHer \"well mostly but like it felt unfair to not let you.\"\n\nHim: \"I don't want to. I don't even want to have sex. Just go to sleep.\n\nHer: (now in a high pitched pleading voice) \"please...fuck my ass! Come on! It's no big deal.\"\n\nHim: I don't want to\n\nIt continud back and forth until finally he relented. \n\nThen she goes \"it's...it's not even hard! Why isn't it hard?\"\n\nThen they both cried. I finally fell asleep. \n\nThey dated another 6 months.\n\nEdit to add:\n\n1) I never talked to him about this, nor did I tell friends. Just reddit.\n\n2) it's worth noting that he did want anal sex. He had mentioned before that he wanted it with her but she wasn't a fan. \n\n3) I don't know when it happened, but I do know they had anal sex at some point because the next year doing never have I ever he said he had. And I remember this because another guy at the party insisted that anal sex - regardless if the sex's of the people having sex - was gay and it became a whole thing. \n\nYes that guy ended up coming out of the closet, though not till senior year. \n\n4) My roommate is doing very well and is in a happy, healthy marriage (as best I can tell). No, not with this girl.\n\n5) regarding \"why didn't he dump her\" - he knew she was toxic but she has been such a great gf in HS and he loved her. He thought it could be fixed. He finally gave it up over summer break.",

            "Four years ago after a night out in NYC with a friend, we decided to crash at her parents' Manhattan apartment (they lived full time outside of the city) instead of trekking back to our respective places. Her and her siblings basically used the apartment as a crash pad for whenever they were in that part of the city, and we were aware that one of her older brothers might show up there to sleep that night. When we got home he wasn't there, and I opted to sleep on this really cool enormous window seat in the living room instead of sharing a bed with my friend.\nI must have drifted off for a while, but I woke up to him coming into the apartment and talking on the phone. I decided to pretend to be asleep, since I had only met him once and didn't want to make sleepy small talk. I then heard him say to the other person on the phone \"oh I forgot, [friend] has this girl over...yeah she's cute....I'm pretty sure she's asleep - yeah definitely asleep...I could just go over there and get on top of her for sure...I mean yeah it's been a long time...\" He continued to vocally consider assaulting me and took a step or two closer to the window while I laid there frozen until he finally said something along the lines of \"nah I probably shouldn't, anyway [friend] is here,\" and walked away. I forced myself to stay awake for as long as I could, slept for maybe an hour or two, and left as soon as I could in the morning. I told my friend what her brother had said and her response was essentially \"well, he's lonely.\"",

After organizing a raid for 40 people, dealing with all the scheduling issues and personality conflicts...managing a small team of people in a workplace is a joke.  Just social skills in general. \n\n3. FPS games greatly improved my hand eye coordination and split second decision making.

Just general knowledge of technology and computers in general. You can\u2019t be a gamer without absorbing SOME knowledge of computers, networks and how they work.

Ultimately, they offered me a gift card as a Take It or Leave It solution to the entire issue. I left it, and went on a crusade to slam them on Twitter. I did it for a long time but got bored.\n\nThe Issue - their website let someone use my email address to buy plane tickets. The person didn't need my PW, and I believe they just made a typo that resulted in them using my email address in a Required Field. When I got an email confirmation about \"my\" airline tickets, I called to say it was wrong. Expedia canceled the tickets (?!?) and called it settled.\n\nWhen the actual customer arrived at the airport and their tickets were canceled, they called Expedia. The rep from Expedia told them I canceled their ticket, and then gave this angry person **my full name** and **my cell phone #** so that he and I could sort it out between the two of us.\n\nThe guy was pissed and made vague threats, so I contacted Expedia Customer Service to get this addressed.

They never arrived, and on the tracking, wrote that I wasn't home to receive the package. \n\nI was furious, so I spent the next two days working from home, and even did my work in the kitchen, so that I could physically see if any delivery driver actually walks up to my door. 3 straight fucking days in a row, not a single person comes up.

            "I used to live in an apartment next door to a pizza place.  Pizza was decent so I went there at least once a week.  There was a woman who worked there who usually wasn't the most friendly, but I never really had any issue.  I wasn't the chatty type, but I was a regular so I'm pretty sure all the employees recognized me.\n\nOne time though I walk in and it's her and another employee working there.  The woman is in back so I order my usual two slices with the other employee who puts them in the oven, and stand by the counter watching TV to wait.  A minute later the woman comes in on the phone and asks me \"did you order?\" and I said \"yeah I just got the two slices\".  For some reason she assumed the other employee hadn't done anything so she puts two more slices in the oven.  I wasn't really paying attention so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nA minute later the other employee walks back in, takes the two slices she put in for me and boxes them up.  That's when the woman realizes what happened (I still didn't realize) and completely loses her shit at _me_.  She starts screaming \"Why didn't you say your slices were already in?!?  Now I just wasted these!\" and dramatically dumps them in the trash, \"what's wrong with you?!?\".  The whole place just goes dead silent and everyone is staring at me.  I'm just standing there bewildered and trying to make sense of what just happened, so I just blurt out \"sorry\" and walk out.\n\nAs the shock wore off and I replayed the events in my head, realizing I didn't really do anything wrong or at worst was just an honest misunderstanding, I got pretty upset that I got yelled at like a child, especially after being a regular for years.  At that moment I decided I'm never stepping foot in that pizza place again...and I didn't.  I lived next to it for another 3 years and not once went in or even ordered from it.",

            "Lifetime Fitness.  It really pains me to write this, because I really love their gyms.  I had a membership at Lifetime on and off through college.  I went to a very large university with great amenities, so I didn\u2019t need the membership during the school year.  I tried to cancel at the end of one summer.  I was at the gym one day and I asked about cancellation.  I was told to come back at a certain time frame the following Wednesday to cancel.  I complied.  When I showed up the \u201cperson doing the cancellations wasn\u2019t there.\u201d  I was told to return the following Wednesday.  Surprise, surprise, the person wasn\u2019t there again.  I told them I was going to stop the payment through the credit card company.  They responded by telling me that they\u2019d take me to collections then.  I ended up escalating through their corporate offices to get the membership cancelled.  They managed to get 2 extra months of fees out of me.  After that year of college, I shifted over to LA Fitness, and maintained that membership for about 10 years.  When I moved away from LA Fitness, I joined the YMCA, where I\u2019ve been for the last 5-6 years.  I will always have a gym membership, but I am committed to not joining a Lifetime Fitness again until am reimbursed.  It\u2019s really a loss for both of us.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards everybody!  I can\u2019t believe the attention this has received.  It seems that many of you have found yourselves in similar situations.  I encourage you to check out your local YMCA.  YMCAs are unique in that their membership cost structure is designed to subsidize memberships for individuals and families that otherwise could not afford one.

I started with whole blood because, well, that's what \"donating blood\" means to people. Fifteen minutes of time, eat a cookie, get a sticker.\n\nAfter I did that for a few gallons I was asked if I'd consider donating platelets. They have to be used within five days of collection so there's always a constant need, but it takes about two hours to do it. A single pint of blood doesn't have enough for a platelet transfusion, so the donor ends up hooked to an apheresis machine that'll centrifuge the blood, remove the platelets, and return the rest of the blood back to the body. So I end up watching Netflix for 2 hours on Saturday while doing another triple donation, every other week, up to 24 times a year.\n\nIt's like Spider-Man's quote in Civil War: \"When you can do the things I can, but you don't, and then the bad things happen ... they happen because of you.\" Obviously donating like this isn't saving the world, but it's making the world a better place, and I'd feel ashamed if I just spend that time watching Netflix at home instead of doing some good at the same time.\n\n(I also donated bone marrow in 2008, so that was a little more of a \"if you can help and don't, and bad things happen, it's your fault\" situation, as I was the best available match in the entire world for my recipient.

Anytime she cut someone off in conversation, I would loop back around to them and ask \u201csorry, what were you saying about...?\u201d To give them a chance to speak. \n\nI know it\u2019s such a small thing, and teenage girl \u201cpolitics\u201d and power flexes are so stupid, but one thing I always carried with me was how poorly that girl treated me when she didn\u2019t view me as popular, so I made sure to include everyone in our friend group once she came to respect me more. \n\nI still do this today, if a softer spoken person gets cut off during conversation because I think it makes them feel like people actually care what they have to say. So fuck that girl from high school, but also thank you in a way. I was talking to another girl from that friend group recently, and she told me that she recently had to cut off ties and go to therapy for the way that girl treated her.",

I gave him a ride and he noticed my power steering pump was going out and told me to call him next week and he would look at it.

            "A few years back I was in Acadia National Park and we did the Beehive Trail hike. For those unfamiliar it\u2019s basically as close to rock climbing as you can get non harnessed as you are going straight up a cliff on iron rungs and stuff, so super fun and you are rewarded with an amazing view at the top. Most people take a quick snap there at the lip, as most do at the peak of their hike, and then move on to the more rocky area (but less a nice view) to rest. \n\nAnyway while we were there resting two Instagram girls got to the top, and promptly took over the best view of the lip to take various yoga poses. (Because that was totally a natural thing to do after scrambling up a cliff?) For at least ten minutes- families were coming up asking if they could take a picture, but they literally said \u201cwe were here first\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll be here awhile\u201d when asked if they were almost done. \n\nWe ended up leaving before they were done but it still boils my blood thinking about it.",

Paying artists in \"exposure\" is nothing new but the level of entitlement I'm seeing these days is off the charts. The only thing I can ever guarantee from these interactions is that they will throw a massive tantrum when I say no, complete with some classic r/nicegirls lines like \"Your shit isn't even that good, I was trying to do you a favour, etc.\n\nOne person contacted me saying that she gets paid X amount from companies per post, thus every post she makes using my photographs should count for X amount of dollars paid to me because \"like soooo many ppl will see it u will prty much be famos,\"\n\n\nEdit to answer some of the common responses:\n\nYes I do my best to explain how the process actually works, that exposure isn\u2019t a form of payment, etc. This has varying degrees of success but a lot of the time they end up paying my rates anyways and say something like \u201cNever know if you don\u2019t ask right!? Lol!\u201d\n\nNo I don\u2019t ever respond with sarcastic or snarky comments. You never know when someone will go off the rails and start badmouthing you on their platform. Screenshots are a thing and word of mouth is a huge part of getting new clients. Yes it would be immensely satisfying to lay into some of these people but an out of context screenshot with some victim story behind it can be extremely damaging so it\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution. \n\nI honestly appreciate all the suggestions for counter offers and ways of dealing with these people, there are some seriously smart answers here (bravo Reddit).

About a month ago Sara and I were meeting up for lunch at our University\u2019s Food Court and shes fiddling with her cameras  prepping them for a big shoot she has that night when this very attractive girl walks over and starts chatting us up. She makes a few minutes of casual conversation mostly inquiring about Saras cameras, and then finally asks if she\u2019d be interested in doing a shoot. She immediately throws her pitch which had to do with modeling some very risqu\u00e9 outfits up in the mountains just outside of the city and then a few photos directly in the center of downtown. Overall the whole pitch was something that bordered very close to being pornographic in nature. Sara tells the girl her typically rates and also states that because of the nature of the shoot she\u2019ll have to charge extra as its not something she typically does or is super comfortable with. The girls face when Sara mentioned the price went from enthusiastic to very \u201care you kidding me?\u201d She then buts in and says \u201cI have over 85k instagram followers, do you know the kind of exposure working with me would give you?

            "Not an influencer necessarily, but a band.\n\nI have a really close family friend from high school who plays in a local band, and he usually does a pretty good job at getting me on the guest list, whether or not I actually want to take pictures. However, I do bring my camera with every time, just in case. \n\nI usually use the opening band(s) to dial in my settings and see what angles look good for the stage setup, because they didn't even know I was going to be there in the first place, and I'm there because of my friend, so obviously I want anything I give to him to be some of my better work.\n\nSometimes if the other bands notice me walking around and snapping pictures during their set, they'll come find me after the show and ask for some of the pictures. If I managed to get any that look decent, I never have a problem sending them copies of the photos for their social media pages. Some bands even offer to give me a free t-shirt or hat or vinyl of their newest release, etc. Which is always appreciated.\n\nAs with any photo that hasn't been purchased, (done for exposure) I place my watermark on the lower right corner of the picture after I'm done editing. It's not obtrusive, it's pretty tasteful in my opinion, and it just ensures people know who took the photo. Sometimes bands can't remember my name or forget to tag me in a post, no big deal, humans make mistakes, I get it.\n\nSo after this one concert in early 2019, the lead singer of an opening band (one I had never heard of) comes up to me and says \"I saw you taking pictures during our set, would you mind sending those to us for our Instagram?\" I said no problem, give me a few days to import, edit, and upload the photos and I'll email you everything. She followed it up with \"We're on tour right now, so we're pretty hard pressed for money, but we'd be happy to give you a shout-out on our page and direct bands in the area to look into you for concert photography.\" I said \"yeah that's fine, I already got free admission to the concert through another band so I'm not super worried about the money, besides this is more of a hobby than a job.\" And we went out separate ways. \n\nFast forward about a week and I decide to go check their Instagram to see if they had posted anything from that show, and sure enough, they had. However, not only had they not tagged me in the post, they had completely cropped out the watermark I put on the picture. So much for the exposure I guess.\n\nI reached out to them on Instagram and also commented on the post using my photography profile, not my personal one, and just politely asked them if they'd add my tag to the photo as not only was it my actual photograph, but it was also my edit. Well, they blocked me. Only on my photography profile though. I checked their Instagram on my personal when I started reading this thread, and sure enough, that picture is still on their page, and they hadn't even deleted the comment I made on it saying \"I'm sure it's an honest mistake, but I'd appreciate you giving credit to the photographer who kindly sent you these photos with nothing promised but a shout out.\"\n\nSome people's kids, man.",

Took pics for about an hour, edited everything they wanted, and presented the final prints. They grabbed them and said thanks and tried leaving. I held onto the pics and asked what they are doing. Apparently it was a privilege for me to take photos of them and I should cherish the publicity I'll get soon. To which I wasnt having it.\n\n\n\n I refused to let them have the prints unless they pay up otherwise I'm going to sell them myself. They freaked out and said I can't sell them because they didn't give permission and its creepy and they are the owner of the pics. Furthermore they wanted me to remove my watermark as its distracting. I informed them that they signed an agreement paper that they would pay for the services, then the prints they wish to keep. All prints and photos are still my property for portfolio use. Any photos not purchased are subject to monetization. Any customer can check mark a box stating that any or all photos whether purchased or not cant be used for monetization. I explained there is no fine print, there is no trickery, its literally 2 paragraphs explaining everything, all you have to do is check mark a single box and sign the agreement, which they only signed and was done before the photoshoot even had an appointment date. Finally, I will not remove my watermark on my photos that I took with my camera for my business that shows my trademark.\n\n\nThey threatened a lawsuit for being a pedo and illegally selling pics of them without their permission. I just smiled and said for them to do as they please. All I need to do is present the agreement paper they signed. They grabbed the agreement paper and tore it up and started laughing. I continued to smile. Confused look on their face at this point, I calmly inform them, this is why I have an agreement signing date and the photoshoot on a future date. It gives me time to prepare the studio for setup, make copies of the agreement for personal documentation, and send a copy to my lawyer and manager, and make up any filters to use on the photos if needed. What you tore up was your copy, but dont worry as I can print you another copy. \n\n\n\nLastly, you can claim anything you wish, the security cameras in the building and my camera being hooked up directly to my computer will easily show the entire photoshoot was head shots of a 28 year old and the camera was on a tripod that was pre set up hours before the shoot. So it was impossible for any inappropriate pictures to have been taken without being caught, and honestly I'm just not stupid as this is a real threat to any photographer.\n\n\nCompletely puzzled and filled with anger, they handed me their debit card and paid for all the pictures they wanted. Being a nice person I asked if they wish to sign a written request for removal of monetization rights of their photos? They agreed and signed. Made copies, (in front of them with a big ol grin) handed them their copy and said to have a great day. They stormed out angrily. Never seen them again thankfully.",

            "A related story but exactly what OP is asking for, we were on a road trip and at the Toketee falls near southern Oregon. Now this falls is located at the end of a trail about a mile long. The trail leads to a vantage point that\u2019s about 40-50 feet above the fall. If you are a rock climber, then you can probably scramble to the base of the falls but it\u2019s quite a scary endeavor. \n\nThe day we were there, we saw two influencer couples at the parking lot. We noticed them because the girls stripped down to their skimpy bikinis at the parking lot and they had some snorkeling gear as well. Now this is a pretty popular spot on insta and so the parking lot was packed with quite a lot of kids and families around. \n\nThey started the hike the same time as us and were planning on various poses and shots the whole time. Finally we reached the end of the trail and they realized that all those cool shots on insta means scrambling 30 ft down a wet rock face to the bottom of the falls. The disappointment was palpable that day. The bickering while hiking back was even better. It still cracks me up to think about that day.",

We stopped about 3 or 4 times and every time their kayak guide would be going out of his way to fulfill their photo requests, stepping out precariously onto sharp ocean rocks with one foot in the kayak so they wouldn't float away so he could get the background and their full bodies in the frame. At the last destination, a secluded small beach, what really had me floored was that the girl was on the super rocky sharp sand by herself doing all these suggestive poses with the kayak guide playing photographer for her while her husband/ boyfriend just sat in the kayak looking through his phone.

            "I have a flagship DSLR that I bought because I didn't plan ahead. I've paid for it though by taking pics at pow wows and some light photography work but from that I learned I hated editing on other people's time line. But because I enjoy taking pics and am able to pump out 3-4 amazing pics out of the 500 I take, I get requests to take pics all the time. Most of the time I do it for free because it's for family or friends but for friends of friends I charge a little bit to motivate me.\n\n One third or something cousin asked me to take their senior pics. I hadn't really interacted with them much but I said I would take a few but they would have to pay for printing and I would just post them on my website to download or put on Facebook etc. They became really upset once they realized that I didn't have a full studio but just a backpack with 10k of gear and I expected them to have all the clothes and items they wanted for their shoot. After rescheduling we set out to take pics a few places around town that where iconic and annoying to get to while they changed into 4 outfits for each location wasting a ton of light. They wouldn't pose like I wanted saying it looked weird or that they where too far away from the background because they didn't understand how lenses work. After a long and terrible day I left my camera in my bag and forgot about it. \n\nThe next day I got 20 texts about where are their pictures. The day after 100 texts and calls, Facebook messages, calls from their parents about where the pictures where. I told them I haven't edited them yet but I will next weekend which wasn't good enough for them so they kept calling. After 4 days they just asked for the unedited photos so I sent them a link to the 40gb raw files. They then complained the photos where too big to download, were all the same, and looked flat etc. Against my better judgement I went ahead and got 8-12 pictures that were the best and I was happy with and another 20 that I didn't like but included because they were good but not my style. Right away I was told this was too few pictures because I originally sent over thousands. \n\nOne of the things I like is bokeh and I have a [Nikon dc 135 mm](https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/135mm-f2-dc.htm) that I like to use for portraits because it's amazing. I used it almost exclusively because the f2 stop combined with the d4s make anything look good especially at night. But apparently the pictures are ruined because a perfectly in focus bust shot with a soft stone arch bridge in the background ruined the location. Or how I lit them with reflected light so they looked blue and orange against a city street was gross. \n\n\nEither way, I'm selling my gear because I don't want to use it anymore.",

I said sure...always love meeting new people...and we made a plan to hang out one weekend. \n\nIn our chats I had made mention of us possibly shooting together sometime and she agreed...but I made sure to let her know when it comes to shooting models I am still a novice and I knew she was used to working with very talented people. As long as she didn\u2019t expect the world out of our shoot it would be a fun learning experience for me to have a chance to work with an very experienced model.\n\nAll is well so far...\n\nShe asks me if I know any really creepy places and that she\u2019s interested in seeing scary places. I mention I know of an abandoned state prison we could go to...or a hospital that is beyond creepy...but I had just recently shot in an abandoned church that was by far the weirdest place I had been. Crosses had been nailed up everywhere and it just had the darkest vibe. \n\nI sent her some photos of the place and she LOVED it. \n\nShe said \u201cPlease take me there! We should do a whole shoot there together!\u201d I was excited and I said sure! Then I asked her what kind of theme she had in mind...\n\nThis was a mistake. \n\nIn many of the photos there were these grubby ass mattresses left behind by...I don\u2019t know...squatters, crack heads, or demons who knows. The first thing out of her mouth was \u201cI want you to tie me down to one of those mattress and I want to do a whole hostage/serial killer theme!\u201d First off ewwww....second...could be cool...go on.\n\nShe says \u201cOh goodie you are open minded!\u201d\n\nThen she tells me she will bring a bunch of bondage gear and masks and I ask her what outfits she plans on wearing and she replies \u201coh honey...I\u2019m not going to be wearing anything...I\u2019m your prisoner.\u201d\n\nWait what? \n\nThen she tells me \u201cI really get into my shoots and get into character so I need to you really be aggressive with me. While we are together I completely trust you and I am your property. Mold me into what you want. I want to be filthy. As realistic as possible...\u201d\n\nThen she says...\n\n\u201cI want you to fuck me while I am tied down and then shoot me after we are done...I want you to use me. I want to be a mess.\u201d\n\nWe have never met in person. \n\nI tell her I don\u2019t know if I can do that seeing as how we had never met and that I like to think I am open minded but I am still very new to this and that might be a little extreme. I suggest maybe we meet first and get to know each other and see how things go. \n\nI begin to think it\u2019s someone pulling my leg. Someone who just wants to type up some kind of penthouse letters erotica to me. No way this is real. \n\nWe set up a time to meet and...drum roll....she actually shows up. We meet at a coffee shop and talk for an hour and she is absolutely lovely. She tells me about her family and her husband is a talented artist and how she just really gets into her work. \n\nWe have not worked together yet...but remain friends and keep in regular contact.

            "I guess she was trying to be an influencer? A few years ago I was asked if I was good with cameras at my son\u2019s daycare/early learning centre by the head lady who was also constantly on her Instagram rather than taking care of the kids. (Not with the kids, don\u2019t worry). She was dismissed because if this behaviour by the owners later so all good.  \n\nAnyway, like at schools they have class photos every year, nice portraits of the kids and one group photo. Apparently the professional photographer that did each year had quit on them, and me being a total amateur stupidly offered to do it for nothing as I\u2019ve done class photos before. I was just being a friendly dad trying to help out. I drew up the proper contracts for the policies they had etc.\nI was not prepared for the 3 days of hell that followed. The staff was super nice, the kids were very well behaved so portraits went well, yet the head lady who was running the place was a piece of work. \n\nI was supposed to be there for 2 hrs max for 1 day only. I specifically emailed the times I would be there. I arrive, and she wasn\u2019t there so we txt her and she txts us she\u2019s getting ready for the shoot. I txt I\u2019m already at the daycare, and she told us to absolutely not start without her. \nSo we wait for an hour. Still nothing. Upon that point I said, let\u2019s take the portrait photos first while we wait and the group photo when she arrives. Two hours later. Still nothing. Then she txts me she couldn\u2019t decide what to wear, makeup, etc. and it had to look good for Instagram etc. (I specifically stated in the contract these were not to be posted on social media by anyone including myself, and I wouldn\u2019t be liable if they did end up there, which she signed) . \n\nI offered stupidly to come back the week after to do the group photo. I come back a week later, already having edited the portraits. Group shot time, everyone is there, except her again. \nWe text, oh, she\u2019s getting ready again. By at that point I said you know what, let\u2019s just take the damn group photo and I can be done with it. \nThe kids were fed up, staff was fed up, I was fed up. (Remember all the kids got ready for those photo days too dressed up in their best clothes etc) \n\n5 mins before I left, she arrives all made up like she\u2019s going to do whatever Instagram shoot she wanted to do. I told her we already took the group photo, but I can stay behind to do one more with her in it. Wow, the amount of verbal abuse that followed I was not prepared for. She was making a complete spectacle of herself, swearing at me and shouting in front of the kids too. Swearing and shouting at her staff that they were all useless. I reminded her that I am doing this as a favour for free, upon which she just hammered into me that she\u2019s never been so insulted in her life. She stormed off in some weird tantrum. \n\nI edited the group photo, came back, and dealt with the friendly staff afterwards. I gave them the photos and told them good luck. At this point I already had taken my son out of that daycare because he was going to school. A lot of the staff were shaken up by the photo shoot and I think some of them even quit their jobs. All the while, \u2018monster lady\u2019 was nowhere to be found, she was still in service at the time. A week later I check her Instagram/facebook. All my pictures, but of her doing duckfaces with the kids with her photoshopped badly into them. I do believe she was dismissed shortly after."

            "I have written this out elsewhere, but since everything I want to say has stayed the same, I'll just copy it here. I had a couple major realizations.\n\nSelf-talk: I was intensely, harshly critical of myself. One day I realized that I would never talk to another person like that, so why should I talk to myself that way? I made the decision to treat myself as though I was a friend who had the same issues. I would treat myself kindly with compassion, and allow myself to be imperfect (even very imperfect.) This is very important: I decided to make a point of noticing what I did right, well, and good in the same way I'd focused exclusively on what I did wrong before. It's important especially for someone in or coming out of depression to see and admit to themselves that yes, they do things right, too. It doesn't matter how tiny or \"inconsequential\" the action is. Did you brush your teeth today? Nice, you brushed your teeth today. Fair warning: This change in behavior will likely feel fake as hell at first, and will continue feeling fake as hell for a long time. It's normal for a behavior pattern you aren't in the habit of to feel fake, but that doesn't mean it IS fake; it's just an unfamiliar pattern. As the pattern becomes familiar, the feeling of fakeness will fade.\n\nThe other thing was that I realized when you are depressed, you naturally tend to focus on what's bad and wrong in life. You don't even notice the good stuff, even though it's still there. If you go long enough noticing only bad things while being oblivious to the good, it can legitimately get to a point where it really, genuinely feels to you like only bad things exist for you and that good stuff doesn't even exist at all. Therefore, I made a deliberate point of noticing what's right and good in life. There's a roof over my head tonight and I have a warm, dry, comfortable bed to sleep in; I have my health; I can have pretty much anything I want for dinner; I am incredibly lucky to live in that incredibly tiny fraction of all of human history that the internet exists; it's a lovely day out today; I lost a couple more pounds; I really do have exceptionally awesome landlords; I was really kind to that person; I got the dishes done today, etc. Fair warning: This is another thing that's going to feel fake as hell for a long time until you get into the habit of it. Expect it, it's normal and fine. I pushed through the fake feeling and it made a life-changing difference for me that I did.\n\nOne more thing: Let it be genuinely OK for yourself to make mistakes. Old habits and thought patterns can have a lot of inertia to them. Depressed people are still people, and people are just human beings, which means they will make mistakes. If you can let it be -genuinely- OK to be a human being who makes mistakes just like anyone else does (don't beat up on yourself for making them! just shrug, let it roll off your back, and carry on) you will have a much easier time of all of this on those days you find old habits creeping back again.\n\nAlso, after you've gotten a bit out of depression, check out this excellent post about non-zero days. If you are deep in depression right now this might be too much just yet - and it's honestly OK if it is. One step at a time. Just focus on noticing the things you do right for now/on the positives around you. https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/",

            "Myself. \nIt sounds completely self centred, I know. But I spent almost my whole life sticking around because other people needed me. And don\u2019t get me wrong, that\u2019s also a very valid reason. But that\u2019s a lot of responsibility on them.\n\nAfter my suicide attempt almost 10 years ago, I swore I\u2019d never put my mum through that again. She was my whole world. She needed me and I needed her. And when she got sick, we needed each other more than ever. In her last few months me and my sister were her carers so she was completely dependent on us. My world stopped. I dropped out of college, I barely socialised. I had no life outside of looking after my terminally ill mother. Now if I had the chance, I\u2019d do it the exact same way all over again. I don\u2019t regret it. But once she died all I could think was \u2018What now?\u2019 \nI pushed it all on my sister. We only had each other. And when things got tough I told myself I couldn\u2019t leave her and she needed me. Again, all very valid and true. But I was miserable. Living felt like a chore, a responsibility I\u2019d been forced into. \n\nSo I got my ass into gear. Went to therapy, started going to the gym. Did some online courses. Got into a relationship with a wonderful person. Soon I\u2019m hoping to quit my job because I can\u2019t stand it, but I need the security of a new one first. In September I\u2019m finally going back to college and doing my last year. Gon\u2019 get that degree. \nI\u2019m living for myself now because I deserve to. There\u2019s so many places I want to go, and so much stuff I want to do. Sure, one day I plan on having kids and then they will become my world and my number one.

He likes me a lot and I wouldn't ever wanna hurt him by just up and dying for no reason, let alone doing it on purpose. Even at my most depressed, I would literally never imagine doing that to him, the concept of his pain is so enormously painful to think of that it's like an object too hot for me to touch. No. \n* My cats\n* My coworkers, who struggle with mental health as well. My industry took it hard when Anthony Bourdain killed himself. My coworkers are all speaking up about how shitty we all feel and we're actually supporting each other \n* My friends, who struggle with mental health as well. Same as above\n* People on the internet that I provide emotional support for: because if I kill myself, I can't be the voice of reason and understanding for everyone else that feels this way. Every person that kills themselves is eliminating an opportunity to increase understanding of mental illness and human neurodiversity. Every person that kills themselves is giving suicide an advantage in the fight against humanity\n* Because other people with ADHD and Autism need people to speak up for them, we are collectively really fucking shitty at articulating! \n* Because other people with ADHD and Autism that don't know they even are and that it's why they're fucking suicidal in the first goddamn place! Hey! Hi! I see you!! Help is coming goddamn it just hang in there\n* Because I'm not dying without fixing this crap and that is a goddamn THREAT",

            "I like to gather stories. Even the worst things that happen to me create stories and experience. I've been homeless, in jail, seen a lot of death, etc. I've been able to help others because of that. So even when I'm not feeling good about *my* life, I know that my worst moments have allowed me to help others through theirs. Being comfortable doesn't create stories. This is only a recent realization for me (33 years old).\n\nWhen I'm not happy with my life, I try to do something unfamiliar. I've recently discovered that I love the outdoors. All my life I've been the \"stay at home\" kind of person, perfectly happy to just play some video games or watch a movie. I started getting into a funk that I didn't know how to get out of, but I continued to do the same thing everyday. Working 7 days a week, play video games 2 hours a day, sleep and repeat. I took some time off work to try and get out of the gloomy feeling that I had, but I was still doing the same thing on vacation (minus the work) and it wasn't helping. So work wasn't the problem. Decided with my last few days of vacation to get a hotel room about an hour outside of a national park (4 hours from home). I canceled the reservation because it was *easier* to just say \"nevermind, I just want to relax\". The next day i woke up and said \"fuck it, lets just go\", made the hotel reservation again. The trip ended up changing my entire perspective. I want to do nothing but hike now. I want to get in better shape so I can do longer hikes. I want to buy a truck. I'm spending my free time looking for new places to explore. I'm looking into camping. Seeing the stars in the wilderness has me wanting to get a telescope and looking into astrophotography. All this new stuff, because **for once** I decided to listen to the little voice in my head telling me to try something new.\n\nI live for new experiences. The more new experiences that I have, the more I want to *live* (not just exist, but to do stuff). No matter how long I've done one thing, a new hobby or passion is just around the corner. You never know until you put yourself out of your comfort zone. I spent years (decades) doing what I thought made me happy, but I was never happy. A more enjoyable life was one last-minute decision away for me. One moment of following through with an idea that I had. I could have easily just slept in again instead of changing my mind to take the trip. If the trip ended up sucking, would that have really been worse than another year of continuing the same routine? It would be a story regardless. Even if I don't want to tell a story, *seeking* a story usually leads me somewhere interesting.\n\nIt doesn't have to be big life changes or trips. Always watch horror movies? Try some comedies. Looking at a giant library of games but feel you have nothing to play? You probably don't *really* want to play a game... grab a book, take a walk. Trying something different is what keeps life interesting enough to continue for me. Easy and comfortable isn't fun or interesting.",

Disaster averted, or so I thought.  \n\n\nAsks me to do a U-turn on a farm road (single lane each side, with a ditch on either side). Impossible to do based on turning circle of car. I attempted the largest angle possible, but due to ditch each side ends up being a 3-point turn. He asks me if I'm deaf and if I know what a U-turn is. Politely try to explain its not possible (which I'm sure he knew). Completed the test and passed everything else.

I pulled over in a parking lot, and we woke up the instructor to ask him which way to turn. It took a good 30 seconds for him to realize what had happened and where we were.

He then proceeded to put his finger in the officers face and yell at him. At this point the entire room went silent and watched. \"How dare you fail my son, he is a good driver! Turning left into a turn lane and merging into traffic is not illegal!\" (It is in that part of Ohio btw). \n\nThe officer smirked and looked around, knowing everyone was watching this now. He then said loudly enough for the whole room to hear \"Sir it is illegal and I can show you where in the book it states that\". He then pulled out the driving laws book and showed him. \"But sir, that is not the reason I failed your son. He failed because he was doing 45 in a school zone!\" The entire room began to snicker. The father quickly grabbed his son and ran out.",
            "I remember my driver's test very clearly.. First of all, I was a smart overly arrogant little prick. I procrastinated and never got my learner's permit until I was like 4 months away from turning 16.. This meant I could only get my license two months after turning 16 because you were required to have your permit for 6 months before you can get your license in my state.\n\nSo anyway.. finally waited out the 6 months and felt like I knew what I was doing. I had to take the test in my dad's Cadillac DeVille - an enormous boat of a car. Part of the test was a 3-point turn.. I aced it (or so I thought). Also, part of the test was 'slamming on the brakes.' I fucking aced that shit too (I thought). Then he asked me to stop at a stop sign.. boom.. simple.. Then the test was pretty much over and he asked me to park and I pulled right into the spot.\n\nThe tester spent what seemed like forever adding shit up on his sheet and he was like, 'Well, you passed. You can go in and get your license.' Being the little prick I was, I was like, \"Was there anything I did wrong\" fully expecting him to tell me how great a driver I was..\n\nHe was like.. \"Well, at the beginning of the test, you started backing out of the spot before looking. You eventually did look - but you would have run over someone if they were standing directly behind your car. Once you pulled out of the parking lot, you hit the accelerator hard and had to correct your steering to stay in the lane fast enough that you would have lost control of the car if it was raining. Your three-point turn was accomplished - but not done safely since you were not looking both ways. Also, you pulled too far forward and too far backward - much more so than you needed. Your hands were on the wheel - but I was not confident you had a good grip on the wheel when it mattered most. You stopped at the stop sign, and you were behind the white line, but you failed to approach slowly after moving forward after the stop. Your right turns were close to cutting the curb. Your left turns were much too early. When you tested fast braking, you let go of the brake pedal and hit it again which increased braking distance. You basically barely passed. I hope you become a better driver after this.\"\n\nI went from being a cocky little fuck to feeling like I was barely cutting it.. Seriously.. it made me put effort into driving. Total wake-up call.. I swear I'm a good driver today (age 37) partly because of him pointing out all the nuances I missed with my inexperience.",
            "Not a tester but I always like to share the story about my great-grandfather. He took the drivers test and got his license at 14 (legally it\u2019s 16 in KY) but lied and told the DMV, the Navy, and my great-grandmother he was 2 years older than he actually was. Fast forward 70ish years, he goes to renew his license and they finally realize he\u2019d lied about his birthdate for his original license. They still let him renew but had to change his birthdate on all kinds of paperwork.",
            "When I was waiting to take my driving test I got to hear this conversation between the instructor and the  mother of the kid before me\n\nInstructor: \"Mam do you know what the speed limit of Dunkirk is?\"\n\nMom: \"Uhmmm? 30?\"\n\nInstructor: \"You might wanna tell you son that have a nice day\"",
            "It was my great grandma\u2019s funeral the day I took my test. Since it takes months to get testing appointments where I live, my parents had me take the test as planned and then we would go straight to the funeral. I was a casket bearer so I wore a full suit to my driver\u2019s test in the middle of July.  I was hot, miserable, and thinking about a funeral. During the corner back, I was so distracted by hot hot and uncomfortable I was that I missed a cone. I tapped it with my bumper and it tipped over. I am still not sure why, but I proceeded to continue attempting to park by running over the cone. \n\nThe instructor asked me, \u201c what if that cone was a child?\u201d To which I responded, \u201cthey would be dead?\u201d\n\nI failed.",
            "Not the kid, but the examiner. I was taking the exam, but due to a mixup in the system there was no one assigned to be my tester. \n\nNo problem, there was a written exam going on, so the retired 80+ instructor who oversaw the written exam would do my exam, and my driving instructor did the written test. He anyway needed to be there since the test was performed in his specially equipped car (with pedals on the passenger side to intervene to avoid accidents). So I was expecting an easy exam, just drive  around for an hour long and hope he didn't die of old age.\n\nEverything went well for the first half an hour, but when we got to to a big road, the car kept speeding up after I took my foot off the gas pedal. **The gas pedal was stuck!**. I banged the clutch to the floor, and remembered the Corey Haim/Feldman instructional video \"License to Drive\", where they fixed this problem by kicking down the gas pedal repeatedly, while calmly telling my examiner that the pedal was stuck.\n\nHe quickly identified the problem, the stuff he had been using as a footrest were the instructor pedals. After he removed his foot from the gas pedal, the problem was solved, and we both lived.",
            "My driver's education teacher said that a student just drove straight into a ditch. When he asked why she did that she responded by saying that she thought the car would steer itself. She ended up getting her lisence soooooo. Watch out for that one",

            "I was in the DMV in a retiree town I lived in, and I watched a seriously old woman fail the vision test 100% and the tester felt bad for her and pushed her application through anyways.

            "I was a kid with a shitty tester. He wasn\u2019t even supposed to be a tester, but the normal person wasn\u2019t there for some reason. So I got stuck with him.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know the path we were supposed to take super well and was telling me to turn as we were passing the turn. So of course that lead to some sharp, sudden turns on my part.\n\nAt the end he said I didn\u2019t do bad enough to fail, but he didn\u2019t feel confident passing me. (Which is some bullshit. If I did everything right, I didn\u2019t fail).\n\nI came in like a week later and passed easily with the normal tester.\n\nBut I\u2019m still irritated about that shit to this day.",

            "A good friend of mine worked the DMV for almost 50 years and did a lot of the drivers tests. Two crazy stories he told me I remember.\n\n**Story time #1**\n\nThis Indian couple came in and the wife was testing to get her license. They were new American citizens so they weren't totally used to the culture and there was still a bit of language barrier going on. The DMV my friend worked at also happened to be near a busy train yard.\n\nSo they get out on the road and the lady is doing fine, nothing major wrong with her driving. My friend decides it's time time to turn around and end the test so he tells her to take a right up after the train crossing ahead. The lady pulls up to the train crossing, stops, looks both ways for a train, and then turns right... Onto the train tracks. \n\nMy friend frantically tells her to stop the car and get out immediately. She does and he jumps in the driver seat and slams reverse and right after he pulls the car away from the tracks, the train signal comes down to block the crossing and a train comes through. \n\nNeedless to say, she didn't pass.\n\n**Story Time #2**\n\nThis was the event that actually ended his career and forced him to retire. \n\nHe was testing a young girl who was just getting her license and she was very nervous and shaky the whole time. She was making little mistakes here and there, swerving, not checking mirrors, not fully stopping, things like that.\n\nAt this point he decided she wasn't going to pass so he asked her to go back to the office. On the way back there was an area of road under construction with a bridge and one lane closed, the kind where they put up cement barricades that narrow the road much more than normal. \n\nThe girl was shaking like crazy going through the tight space and some combination of nerves, inexperience, and bad luck came together and she ended up slamming the accelerator instead of braking, turning off into a work area downhill over the shoulder of the bridge and slamming into the back of a massive back-hoe. The bucket of the machine came through the windshield and smashed into my friends head.\n\nHe was in a coma for 2 days, broke his neck and shoulder, suffered mild permanent brain damage, and now has PTSD and won't be in a car when he isn't driving. The girl ended up unscathed thankfully, but my friend says he's never been the same, not as sharp, everything seems to take more effort now. He ended up winning a huge settlement and getting his pension early since be was close to retirement, and so he retired then and lives pretty comfortably now.",
            "Not a tester, but recently a buddy did this. \n\nI took a friend on the route that I had taken with that same dmv for my license, and the route that my SIL had taken at same dmv. In return my friend showed the buddy all three routes when he went for his license test. Because all three of ours went through the park and were VERY similar, with one side street difference, he figured he was going through the park. So without the license tester saying anything, buddy pulls into park and goes through it, no blinker and didn\u2019t drop his speed. Mind you when you got on the main road the speed limit is 35, then drops to 25. such a busy road and so many signs you barely notice the 25 but obviously when on way to dmv SIL stressed to me, I stressed to friend and friend (supposedly) stressed to buddy. Then when you enter park it\u2019s automatically 15, but it\u2019s a hill. Still 15, but much easier to go up it going faster. \n\nAll in all, buddy failed because of his reverse. License tester didn\u2019t write anything about park, just laughed and said we were funny for taking him the routes we went. Especially since, it was the same guy I did mine with.",
            "Happened to me during my drivers test. Pouring down rain and the lady gets out to check all my lights and turn signals etc.\n\nSo when she\u2019s done she finally gets in my truck and we are about to start. For some reason my car wouldn\u2019t shift into reverse and I started to panic and was confused as to how this happened when I just drove it perfectly fine to the DMV. \n\nShe then proceeded to say, \u201cDid you turn it on?\u201d \nMy dumbass only had it turned into accessory mode for the lights and never turned my truck on. \n\nOnly missed two points and got my license though at least",
            "Story from Pennsylvania:\n\nWe have lots of tractor trailers on the roads here. Lots! Arguably too many and they can often be terrifying to drive around. Anyways, we could take our license test through the high school and the teacher often let us ride along on each other's tests to see how it goes. \n\nI was in the back seat as the student testing pulls onto the interstate at 35mph. A tractor trailer comes barreling downhill on us and lays into his horn and the teacher starts telling at the kid to \"move with the flow of traffic\" aka speed up!! He starts going 45mph and is clearly super nervous.\n\nWe are going one exit on I83. It's only two lanes each way and no shoulder, as the highway is sandwiched between a large hill and a lake. I don't know how many tractor trailers went screaming by us in those 2-4 miles. But they kept honking and swerving to avoid us, the instructor is shouting and cursing at the kids to speed up. I thought we were gonna die. I'm surprised none of them jackknifed or tipped over to be honest.\n\nTL;DR - PA has lots of tractor trailers on the highways. Kid didn't drive fast enough and it caused chaos on the interstate.",
            "My friend just got her license and she drove me around that day. We were at a red and with out even thinking about it turned left on the red. I told her WTH and she said that she did not see a sign that said \u201cNo turn on red\u201d. I never rode with her after that.",
            "After taking my eye test (that I cheated on) I was walking out to the car park to get into the car with my examiner and another kid was getting ready to pull out.  He reversed instead and hit the car behind, more of a love tap really.  I just heard him shout and apologise that he wasn't ready and could they start over which his examiner for some reason seemed okay with.  However, when pulling out this time, he went forward out of the parking bay but turned far too early and scratched the car next to him.  He was told to stop and get out.  Kid failed in less than a minute and didn't fully understand why since both cars he hit had only minor damage.",

There was a stop light and a stop sign for whatever reason, and I only noticed the stop sign. I looked both ways and took a left turn onto the main road as instructed. As soon as I came fully into the lane the instructor failed me for turning on red, but complimented the fact I at least checked left and right first. \n\nStill embarrassing to this day",
            "I failed my restricted test because as I was turning into a street, a guy ran a red light and smashed into the back corner of my car.

            "There was a medical manufacturing lab in the UK that kept having reports of headaches and weird visions. People would see something at the edge of their vision, but couldn't figure out what it was. It wasn't just one person either, and was causing some serious panic. When they entered a room, they felt a \"presence,\" like someone else was in the room with them, and something would appear at the corner of their eye, then disappear when they tried to look. \n\nTurns out, it was caused by a newly installed fan that was vibrating, causing a sound that was too low-frequency for humans to hear it. Hilariously, the guy who discovered it found it using a fencing sword. He had brought it to work and put it in a vice to polish it, but then the sword started vibrating. Me, I would have nope'd out of there, considering the room was haunted, and now a sword is moving, but he was apparently much braver. \n\nThe frequency is known as the \"fear\" or \"ghost\" frequency. It's around 19hz. [Here](https://youtu.be/h-zM3qAzBaw) is a YouTube video of 18.98hz. Mileage may vary, for some people it causes just mild discomfort, others it causes total panic, and still others it does nothing. For me, it caused my eyes to feel weird, and after a good minute or so, I noticed weirdness at the edge of my vision, and was definitely creeped out. I shut it off then, definitely an unnerving experience. \n\nIt's not entirely known why it triggers such a response. The optical illusions and eye discomfort are likely due to the frequency resonating with your eyeballs, causing them to vibrate. But the actual fear response is unknown. Some theories are that our bodies are able to detect low frequencies, such as that of earthquakes or predator roars, but we just can't hear it. A bit like how deaf people can still \"feel\" certain sounds. So we become alert and nervous around these \"infrasounds,\" since they usually indicated danger. This, combined with the optical illusions, leads to some pretty uncomfortable experiences. \n\nOh, and don't worry, \"vibrate your eyeballs\" sounds way worse than it is. It's like super tiny vibrations, and your eyeballs are nice and squishy. It's not harmful in the slightest. At least, not mentally. Certainly feels like you are doing some eldritch ritual though.\n\n(Edited due to me being a doorknob and mixing up Hz with kHz)",

            "Everyone loves to comment about Prions and Mad Cow. So this is another Prion story, but much more unsettling. \n\nBasically, a company called Lyodura sold dura mater grafts. Dura mater is a layer of the meninges of the brain, and if you suffer traumatic brain injuries a dura mater graft is needed. Nowadays, a synthetic is available, in the 70s this was not the case. Instead the dura mater needed to be harvested from corpses who would willingly donate to Lyodura. However, to produce more dura mater, they began paying doctors to remove dura mater without consent, and because it was harvested illegally, this meant there was no record of the individuals it was collected from. Lyodura sterilised all dura mater together, and this lead to the perfect storm. All it took was one individual to die of Creuzfeldt Jakob disease and to have their dura mater harvested, before being collected and mass sterilised. Because Prions are quite indestructible, it is believed that nearly all Lyodura\u2019s dura mater became contaminated with the disease. It is unknown how many individuals developed Creuzfeldt Jakob disease because of this, but the number was certainly high.",

            "Two key words gentlemen: Fast, and Hard. Ladies love pure speed, so as soon as those panties come off you want to get in there as quickly as possible. Once youre in you need to *keep going*, maintain that energy until you're finished. Yall know what a jackhammer is right? Thats basically the only way to make them feel good. Girls say that they can cum but they really cant, its all imaginary so dont worry about it. If shes upset afterwards then that means you werent fast enough. Work up those core muscles. Also! Condoms are a scam. They advertise like they help avoid pregnancies but really it just makes those lil guys swim faster. So make sure not to use them. Ever\n\nLadies! We all know that once the underwear comes off then thats it, its over. So that means that you want to keep those on for as *long as possible*. The longer you get his little man to wait for it, the better it feels for him! But be careful, cause that wait time has to either stay the same or get longer. The second it gets shorter, he'll lose interest. A prime way of making him wait is to use all your teeth during his blowjob. Molars feel nice, but the scraping of your incisors on his dick will help him last longer! And if you break the skin a little bit then dont worry, because the blood will act as a semi lubricant when (read: if) you get to the point where your pants come off. At that point its all good! \n\nRemeber: have fun, stay safe, and if youre gonna do anal and vaginal penetration, make sure to do the anal first!

Then suddenly, they started teaching us slightly different geography at school. But apart from that and a few bitter remarks from some adults, that was all.\n\nWhat I do remember, though, is that almost all the textbooks we got in school were written in the time of Czechoslovakia and noone bothered to change them for up-to-date versions, so we were often asked to cross out \"Czechoslovakia\" from the text and write \"Czech Republic\" above it. Or draw a thick line between Czech and Slovak Republics in a map. That was during the first 9 years of school, at least.\n\nOtherwise, I think Czechs and Slovaks have still quite the brotherly relationship. For example, there is a huge amount of Slovak students in Czech universities, who later stay to work.",

My mother's educational degrees were not to be found/were not accepted in Austria, basically restricting her possible jobs to being a cleaning lady after being the manager of a Yuguslavian market chain.\nI remember the first time we visited the old house after the war in 1998 I think. I remember seeing the house full of bullet holes, one corner of the house blown away by tank grenades. I remember finding my brother's old toys trampled into the dirt in the front yard. I remember my mother finding an old dress of hers in their former bed room, hardened by the exposure to the elements. I vividly remember her sitting on the stairs in front of the main entrance, silently crying.\nMy point is, it is often not so much about seeing \"your country break apart\", but much rather about seeing the life, dreams and hopes you left behind rot like the old green velvet dress she loved so much.\n\nSorry for mobile upload.\n\nEdit: wow, I didn't expect this to gain so many upvotes. I guess a lot of people have had similar experiences in their own or their relatives' lives and/or can relate...\nThanks a lot for the awards.",
            "I was born at the end of the Bosnian war (1995), following the breakup of Yugoslavia (cca 1992), so i cant remember the breakup, but i remember the post-breakup/post-war years;\n\n- Having very little money.\n-The city (Sarajevo) was bombed to shit, and 95% percent of buildings either had bullet holes or were torn  down.\n-I remember watching German channels like Togo, and all the cool toys the German kids had, that you couldnt buy in my country at the time.\n-My dad drove a Yugo 55 (google it). The bodywork on that car was full of shrapnel holes (he replaced the engine). Later, my dad did the bodywork on the car himself, but he didnt have money for car paint, so he painted it with paint used for mailboxes.\n-No supermarkets, only small stores and markets.\n\nNow the country looks and feels like any other European country, but back then it was a whole different story.",

            "Well Czechoslovakia divided into Czech and Slovak republic and honestly its pretty much the same. The languages are almost identical and there is pretty much no difference between the 2 countries, except for the fact that Czechia is bigger and has a little bit better economy.\n\nSource: I am from Slovakia\n\nEdit: For everyone asking about the details of split, please read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_Czechoslovakia#Separation) article",
            "I lived in Moscow before the USSR got dissolved. One thing that was jarring in the aftermath was the emergence of a lot of Western chains we previously had no exposure to. I remember going to my first McDonald's in 1991. A funny anecdote I heard is that the service staff had to be trained to act more friendly, like they would in American restaurants. To be fair it was a stressful and uncertain period.",
            "I was born just around the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, but I have heard from many people who experienced it that it was very peaceful. Basically, Slovakia wanted their own state because they are a separate nation and their language is different though we understand each other, and they also were not thrilled that all the political decisions were being made in Prague, so Slovakia was a bit forgotten at times. Our two countries still have very good relationships and although we make fun of each other, we are buddies.",
            "We emigrated from the USSR about a year before it broke up, so technically I'm a Soviet. What makes everything more complicated is that we're from Crimea, which was recently annexed by Russia. I opened a new bank account  a while back and one of the details I had to fill is where I'm originally from, it was an electronic for with a menu. No option to select USSR and pick either Ukraine or Russia would be taking a political stand point. It was a very weird experience",
            "I was born in the USSR 2 months before it collapsed so i don't personally remember anything but my parents do. Everything was basically chaos. Most of the businesses that were previously funded by the government had no chance of competing with western businesses so many of them went bankrupt and that ment that lots of people including my father lost their jobs. And lots of unemployment then led to lots of crime. The 90's were a crazy time full of riots crimes and violence in many former Soviet countries.",

            "My husband was born in the GDR (east Germany), and although he is ambivalent about the positives and negatives of the system, he is still sad to effectively not be able to return to the country he grew up in. Nothing is the same there since the collapse of communism. There is a name for that feeling in Germany- Ostalgie. (Ost means east in German)",
            "I was born in Yugoslavia, mid 80s.  It was sad. I lived in a major city largely untouched by direct attack, but we had all three major ethnicities heavily represented and it was incredibly confusing as to why friends stopped being friends, families broke up, etc.  As kids we understood what was happening, but not why.  \n\nI remember hiding my next door Muslim neighbor when the military police came.  I remember being embarrassed of who I was  (even though my family lineage has mixed roots).  I remember weeks without electricity, without running water.  Doing homework by candlelight.  Military rations.  One bottle of oil to last months. \nFlour was scarce. The river would carry sounds of gunfire and explosions.  I saw my dad only a few times in 5 years.  Afterwards I remember thinking that was lucky, some didn't see their dads at all.\n\nI remember my dad spending what little time he had at home teaching me how to use various guns, \"just in case\".  Afterwards, some people lost their minds.  One of the soldiers was convinced the enemy was still there, ever present.  He would place small explosives that looked like canned food in the cupboards where his wife and kids were, in his mind to protect them.  A couple drank themselves to death, I always believed they died in the forest outside the town years ago.  Businesses closed, factories were empty.  There was still work for some, but no pay.  The currency was worthless.  You'd get paid sometimes, in the morning, and by the afternoon it wasn't even enough for a roll of toilet paper. Weird, scary times.  Air raid sirens would interrupt soccer games.\n\nI remember wondering why I couldn't see some of my friends.  Explanations back then didn't make sense.  They still don't.  For the people that lived, worked and played together, we never wanted that shit.  It was pushed on us, manipulated us, played to our fears and insecurities.  Maybe it would have happened eventually regardless.",

            "I was born and still live in one of the ex yugoslav republics (Slovenia). I was 3 months old when we declared independance, so I dont remember how the countries fragmented, but I do remember the Bosnian war and the influx of refugees, altough i didnt really understand it as a kid. The thing that personally affected me the most about the disolusion of Yugoslavia were the constantly shifting maps. Every year in school we had new maps and each one was different when you looked at the area of Serbia. \n\nThe reason Im writing this, is because the whole Yugoslav past still has far reaching consequences in our lives, mainly in the political spheres. Many politicians who were around at the time of the breakup are still active, and the people are harsly divided about the Yugoslav past of the country. Some suffered during the socialist era, and some prospered. Some see it as a great time and some view it as this horrible opressive regime. Its especially bad when the time imediately after ww2 is brought up, becuase that was the time of, well, changes and horrible actions from the new governments side. \n\nAnd naturally, the politicians try to apeal to one of those groups. Its come to the point, where these types of things eclipse every actual problem in the country. There are issues with our public healthcare? Well, who cares, the oposition to the reforms are COMMUNISTS, and suddenly thats what everyone talks about. There are issues with taxing the independant workers? Sure, but have you heard about a statue that was unveiled for victims of after war killings?! THATS WHAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT!\n\nEvery single issue is swept away by just shifting the focus to something that happened in the time of Yugoslavia, and who did what and who deserves to be punished, and people who actually lived trough those times just eat that shit up. Especially the boomers, cause they were directly impacted by the end of the war.",
            "Doesn't exactly answer the question, but the break up of the eastern block and USSR affected capitalist countries on the other side of iron curtain as well. \n\nWe had a massive recession in Finland during the early 90's, since USSR was an important business partner during cold war and now it was gone.",
            "So my story is like a breakup that didn't happen, but some 55 years later it's still bitter. So Maldives, small islands in the Indian Ocean no one knew about. Especially back then cause no tourism. \n\nWe are made up many atolls (an atoll is a group of islands, in our case it's about 200 small islands on average in an atoll. All the atolls are scattered. Interestingly atoll is from the Maldivian word; Atholhu) \n\nAnyways after the Brits left us, (because they are sooo good at protecting lol). There was tension between the  three Southern most and the rest of the country. South was economically prospering but they didn't want to pay taxes to the government. \n\nThe Brits armed the Southerners, but the South didn't want to take arms against their brothers.  They made a Republic of Suvadives. Government heard about it, and there was a lot of tension but no civil war. People were displaced, the main island which was the economic capital got ransacked. That's where my grandmother is from. \n\nRecently I went there for work, and told them I'm the grandson of her. So people welcomed me as their own.  It's like everyone has a lot to say against the people from the capital. There's still hostility in their minds, but the times have changed. A majority of the people live in Male' (capital) however they still really want independence. \n\nOn another note, documents from the British Foreign Ministry shows that their intention was to make a British military base in the South. Since they couldn't do it, they did it to our neighbors Diego Garcia. Pretty much a take over, sent the people to a different country on boats and they still live in poverty. On top of that, the island was sold to American army. \n\nSo it's good we didn't get split and they didn't get anexxed.",

            "I was born in USSR, 1982, in Ukraine. The breakup itself was not a big deal, actually. There were little patriotic feelings of the great country to mourn about. The change from planned \"communist\" mode was disastrous, true, but that is a separate thing from the breakup. I was small, but my parents were like \"nah, whatever\", about the breakup, having more concerns about the economics change. I think their reasoning was like federalization / less centralization of power was somewhat good thing, but not a big deal.",

            "I was born in Romania in 96 so way after the collapse of communism and even though Romania always was its own nation it was also just a soviet satellite state so the USSR always had influence over there. Anyhow, my mother told me many stories about her time growing up before the collapse and what happened during and after. When she reminisces she\u2019s always telling a positive story saying good things about her upbringing and way of life but of course after the collapse everything went to shit immediately. Comparing my childhood to the way things are now however things are much better. \n\nPeople flocked out of the country in search of a stable home since they were finally allowed to travel freely and you can imagine how that alone inhibited the rate at which the country could grow and prosper. But yeah shit was crazy, people became more bitter since everyone was fighting for scraps and politicians were trying to establish a new government for the first time in decades. \n\nCorruption never left because it was a \u201csoviet\u201d way of life and they\u2019ve accepted things to remain the same. Until now the damage still exists but luckily the country has improved significantly especially after our ascension into the EU. \n\nLast year when HBO released the limited series Chernobyl I decided to watch it with my mother and she became incredibly nostalgic and shed some tears because I believe for the first time - in a long time - she started to clearly see the faults of the way of life in communist Eastern Europe. Everything from the atmosphere to the way of life to the corruption to the behaviour; all touched a long lost part of her upbringing.",
            "I grew up in Yougoslavia. I remember the death of Tito, the JBTZ trial, the rise of Milo\u0161evi\u0107 culminating in the [infamous 14. congress of the CPJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfK3wjG5ShQ). Our delegation was outvoted by the Serbs and instead of taking it, they left and that was it. Our politicians showed some real balls and we were quite proud of them.\n\nThe year was crazy exciting. In december there was an independence referendum. The results were announced on the 26TH december from the town hall in Ljubljana. The small square was packed, and amongst the holiday decorations we were huddled together, thousands of us, waiting for the result. It was 95% for independence. Now the shit really hit the fan.\n\nPreparations began and june 25TH was the date we separated from the common state. There were threats from Belgrade but there was no stopping it. So we went to the large square in front of the parliament (Republic square) to see the official ceremony.\n\nI had my camcorder with me and I was filming the whole thing. To get a better shot I moved closer, and closer, stepped behind the guards and then did a walk on the red carpet pretending to be a journalist. So I got a real first hand look at the event. I heard the 'tomorrow is a new day' speach and filmed the PM as he was hustled away from the event.\n\nThe next day brought war which made commuting to work a bit of a hassle. The ring road was closed by barricades so we had to take the back roads to get to work. Then the air raid sirens started and we hid.\n\nWell, I say we. My sister was on Croatian coast with my grandmother, enjoying some pre season discont holiday. Thus was the lure of cut price vacation that they went even as war was looming. So the roads were closed the tanks started rolling and my parents decided to go grab my sister. It was only a three hour drive. So they haul ass and get down to the resort in under two hours. Nobody anywhere. They load the girls and head back to the capital. The highway took them past the Nanos hill which was being shelled by the Yugoslav air force. They watched the planes drop their bombs and kept hauling ass, pushing our Civic as hard as it would go. And it went.\n\nSafe and sound they arrived home in the late afternoon. The next day the washing machine broke. It was still under warranty but the repair techincian refused to come on accoun of war. My parents did the reasonable thing and loaded up the civic and they drove to the service center to have it repaired. Literally drove past burned out barricades. Danger is danger, but warranty is warranty and they were NOT going to pay for repairs if they were covered by warranty, war be damned. \n\nThey returned safely. The washing machine will be fixed the next day. So again the planes flew and they risked death to get that machine home. When they were gone, the air raid sirens started again and I went with some other kids into the air raid shelter. We hang out for a few hours and then made my way home. The machine was home but my parents were nowhere to be seen. I started looking for missing appliances. But they were just looking for me as I went to the wrong air raid shelter. All was good.\n\nSo with nothing to do I watched TV. The night fell and my parents went to sleep. It was late and in the distance I could hear shots. But whatever. We lived in a nice apartment block on the second floor, I was not really worried. Then all of the sudden, something creeps behind me. It was my mother, crawlong on all fours, panicked because those distant shots were not as distant as I thought. I guess this is where the war got real for her and I had to shut down the TV and crawl to bed. It was stupid but I was not going to argue. Not with the war on.\n\nSo with nothing to do, we went to check on the war. The news was reporting that a huge tank column was aproaching the ring road and we went to check it out. We lived nearby and so my father and I had a little lookise. There were truck barricades onevery onramp, piled up with gas tanks and frantic defence forces running crazy with all us idiots. I still remember an exasperated lieutenand shouting 'Go home people, this is war, don't you get that?!'. Everybody ignored him.\n\nThen a few dozen ambulances drove by and half an hour later they came back. After a few hours the tanks failed to show and we went home. We realised just how boring the war could be. Soon we all got bored with the war and we signed a peace treaty. We felt that ten days was enough war for one lifetime and we were pretty much over it. I lost a few friends because of the war. Their parents were high ranking Yugoslav army officials and it would have been weird if they stayed. So off to Belgrade they went.\n\nAfter the war the world went back to normal. The greatest tragedy was finding an affordable vacation destination as we usually summered in Croatia. But their war still went on and so we staycationed for a while. Geography lessons got easier I guess, not so many republics and captols to memorise. Sometimes we'd get a few refugees but nothing major.\n\nOur biggest pet peeve after the war was that the whole world thought Slovenia was unsafe because of the war. But there was no war. We had less than a fortnight of fighting and even that was mostly children (Yugoslav army), the police and LARPers. It sucked.\n\nSince then we went from one economic upheaval to another. At least our goverments are as stable as Italian, so we got that going for us.",
            "My mother grew up in east germany. In 1989 she was 21 years old and fled the country, when the austian-hungarian border was briefly open, and east germans could get that way to the west. she left everything behind, her friends, her family, her mother. she illegaly left the country in the belief, that she'd never see any of those people ever again. 4 weeks after the flight, the wall in Berlin fell. So looking back, all the effort to leave the country was pretty useless. She said it was weird. Many east germans couldn't handle the newly gained freedom of living in a western country (unified germany). But overall it was a great thing, that the wall fell and both parts reunited. she gets very emotional when talking about that time.",
            "I was 9 when the wall came down. At first this was absolutely great. We could now travel to the 'west', got all those shiny things we only knew from west german television. Then the fuckup started: A lot of people lost a big chunk of their savings due to the currency changeover and then lost their jobs. Profiteers streamed into eastern germany and screwed people over because they where way to trusting and naive.\n\nIt took a lot of years to unify east and west germany and after 30 years some people are still struggeling. For me it was the best that could have happened - a lot of things could have been handled better but the overall outcome is still one of germanies greatest achievements.",

I would get asked by other kids and parents about my family, their names and backgrounds. I had to go to church and take religion classes in some places to fit in.

It was a very chaotic time, everyone was scared of the communist reprisals that would come once the communists took over.\n\nOnce they took over, they rounded up everyone who worked for the old regime and sent them to \"[re-education camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-education_camp_(Vietnam\\))\", often for years at a time, so that they can learn the new \"socialist way of life\".

            "I was born in Croatia, at the time still a part of Yugoslavia.. I have nothing but good memories of the neighbors, friends, teachers, store folk... i can write all day long, we had things, not as colorful as other nations but we didn't starve, we had clean clothes and we had fun. Talk about trips, vacations, kicking the ball around, whatever a kid would do... like i said, good memories up to a point where suddenly you were told not to go there, not to do this, not to go out and the list goes on.. at the time i had no idea why.. i mean i understood what was happening but had no idea why it was happening. The teachers changed their grading scales, the folks were no longer interested in playing with me, the obvious rage and hatred was building up on a daily basis, class mates were harassed, beaten up after school/in school.. it became horrible very quickly.. Girlfriends? good luck with that \n\n\n\nYesterday i was helping neighbors build their garage, mixed concrete, carried bricks, but today i get spat on? for doing absolutely nothing but having a certain last name with a certain geographical background..\n\n\n\nMy dad served in the army, on the front lines, as a Serbian fighting on the Croatian side. I was there with him once, on a hill with a guided missile system called \"maljutka\". it was super easy to operate and i remember when we were on that hill, overlooking a forest, both sides knew if the move was made, no way anyone was crossing that valley alive, Forrest was covered, valley was open and covered by the missile system, it was a standstill.. and when i saw reflections of binoculars in the forrest my question was why dont you shoot at them, his response was : because we dont want to, those are people with kids and families who dont want this. There is a video on youtube about a very young guy, attacking Slovenia, he just woke up and was sent to go there, shoot at his neighbors and he broke down... folks were just caught in a wild rage storm and it was a massacre..\n\n\n\nwar is hell, people lost so much and some will never recover. The biggest problem is that for some the war never ended. Croatia got slaughtered and had nothing to defend itself for a very long time and now, with the war over, i bet there is a very limited amount of households without guns and ammo hidden away, just in case it happens again at least this time there is a fighting chance.\n\n\n\nWhat happened after the break is interpreted differently by different sides. I dont think people are giving the mine-defuse teams (my dad did this after the war) enough credit. The ways the mines were placed, where they were placed, how the village folks were grateful for folks to clear the field for them... i have nothing to say but mine laying people are human scum and the defuse teams are something to aspire to.\n\n\n\nReality is, people still hate each other, but only on the Balkans.. My job allowed me to travel a lot and anytime i see anyone outside the Balkans i am greeted with brother/neighbor, because that is how we were raised. All nationalities were brethren, all people were treated with respect and the same mentality is present with ex-yu folks outside the ex-yu states. \n\n\n\nWhat really hurts is that reading the comments here, i see that others share the same. \nStay safe folks, remember that wars are ran by old gray haired politicians in the warmth of the leather armchairs and the common folk get the blunt of it sleeping in basements, getting gray hair after bombardments and wake up with irrational fears even years on...\n\n\n\n        \nIf youre ever in Dublin, drop a message, id be happy to go for a drink and Cevapi",

            "My great great grandfather died in 2003 and I will represent him in this thread because of the year and era he was born in.\n\nHe was born under the last decade of the Spanish Empire and his bigger brother was born in the last two decades of it. He tells me how that he had high hopes during the last decade of the Spanish Empire as things where actually improving. More individual liberties, more rights to the colonies, massive industrialization, railway system, stronger economy, more education, and just a better life in general. Even though the Spanish Empire was not the same as its glorious past, its still was prideful and capable. However, everything changed when the Spanish-American war started. Many people are led to believe that Cuba and Puerto Rico and almost all of the last colonies of Spain in America became better after the war. That's such a lie. All of the hard work made into modernizing Puerto Rico and Cuba, and incorporating them as autonomous regions of Spain was in vain, especially for him as he and the rest of Puerto Rico to this very day we don't have the right to vote in the general election.\n\nHe told me that many family was divided and when he came back to Spain to visit the family, everything changed. The atmosphere was gloomy, politics was tense, literally it was the worst three decade for Spain for many years to come. Many people in Spain before the war, used to wear more colorful Victorian clothing, but after the war and for many years up until maybe when Franco became Dictator many people wear black clothing as a way to grieve their loss.  He told me that during the 1910's people mocked Spain because it lost the war and became something that it wasn't never before. In fact, he though the rumor of American racism to the extend of seeing Italian, Spaniards and even Irish as the same or almost as black people was not true, until he was discriminated when he visited for a business trip in NYC! (He is obviously white). Unlike does who lived in Yugoslavia and the USSR, the Spanish Empire lived over more than 400 years or so! So most of the Spanish identity back then came from their Imperial past and how they had almost all of the America's. It's like Britain today to say the least.\n\nIndustrialization growth slowed down and things got worse up until maybe Franco. He stayed in Puerto Rico due to his business there. However, his hates toward the US persisted even through my family to this day. He was ashamed about his island and how wronged he was to believe that way before the war he though the US was their traditional ally. (Because Spain helped the US gain independence too people, in fact more than France.)  He told me that most Puerto Rican and Cubans though as themselves first as Spaniards and then Cuban/Puerto Rican. And he was even more ashamed to see WW1 and WW2, and the Cold War. He told me that of all the periods that he felt the worse uncertainty was WW2 and the one filled with most emotion or provoked him the most was the Cold War. He had business in Germany or Prussia ( a small factory for sugar plantation machinery).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe supported Germany because he saw Germany as a big middle finger to the allies power, as he belief in the balance of power (just like many people of his generation and before). My great grandfather and my grandfather both supported and fought for Franco and Hitler in the Blue Division. My great grandfather, unlike my grandfather (because he was young and my great grandfather didn't wanted his son to die) send him back to Spain and eventually to Puerto Rico. My great grandfather stayed back fighting in Germany and eventually becoming a smuggler for many Germans, Jews, Poles into Spain (whoever had money, unless their kid or a family). However, when they heard and saw the Holocaust they where outraged. My great great grandfather told me that Jews where seen as the same as gypsy, albeit more educated and professional. And when he heard and saw the picture of the bodies, he thought that wasn't possible that was fake or that was just civilian casualty or a minor massacre at first. When he realize and my grandparent, they felt sick about this fact. However, they told me that they weren't impress with the bodies, the massacres, and the horror of war. But, rather the industrial effort made into extermination.\n\nThe The Cold War for him demonstrated the hypocrisy of the US to a all new level. How is it possible you mess people? Why you promise democracy to the world when your replacing democratically elected people with people who are cruel and not knowledgeable just because their pro-america? Because of the Cold War he hated even more the US, and some American that was born way before the Spanish American war also though about the same thing. It didn't bother for him if you conquer and are trying to find glory, but its wrong for him that the foundation of your country is based on freedom and not glory unlike that of Spain and Britain. He find it wrong, like many Americans from his generation, to literally ignore your own pride (the US constitution) into other people's rights. Many people from his generations viewed the US positively and as source of enlightenment. He saw the huge construction works made during the 50's and 60's in Puerto Rico and the re-industrialization of the Island. However, he was very wary of it because he question why make highway and destroy the railway that goes around the island? Why highway if we can improve on what we already have? He saw the Americanization and the consumer culture came to be, which he enjoyed a lot, but then find it odd something, in which he concluded is just a way to entertain the real problem of the world. The idea of cars being for the rich (something he had always) was long gone. Women have rights (something he actually liked). He tells me that quality of life improved compared to that of the 1910-1940's. Telephone for everybody (he is used to have it because again only the rich could afford it). and more stuff! And he saw war torn nations like Germany, Italy, and Japan rise up once again. FYI, he told me that things made in either Japan or Italy back then was considered like those things made in China in general. (made of bad quality). Even though he always had Mercedes-Benz, Rolls-Royce, Porsche, and some Ferrari. (he liked comfortable cars). But, he felt like he always was making a sin during all of this period, because he felt that it was like a certain type of gluttony the new culture.\n\nHe always asked himself how in the world he hasn't died at all yet when the 2000's came.  In the 90's, his view in the US became more positive than ever until Iraq and Afghanistan happen.  I had the privileged to spend a lot of time with him. He loved me more than any other person in this world ever had and even though I might look different he loved me a lot. Every single day I came to him and he took care of me at his age! He always said to me that I am the future and that I am the last hope of humanity. He also had an opinion about global warming and from what my dad told me, he said that its so true, that Puerto Rico used to be cooler and Spain too. I still miss him a lot, and I will always have his heart in my heart. He was a tough dude and lived a life full of pain and joy. As he saw the fall of his identity and nation to the rise of new nations and falls.",

Why wouldn't he take care of our kid??\n\nEdit: a lot of butthurt comments/PMs.  It sounds like they don't understand the question/response I gave or maybe they are one of the dads that aren't there for their kids. The question was what is considered a kindness but actually human decency.  Some people consider a dad being there for their kids as a kindness, that those dads are doing something more than they needed - as if their only part was contributing half the DNA and anything else is extra and absolutely unnecessary.  Really, it's them doing their part, which I consider a human decency. My husband and I are equals. We both have done the diapers, taking our kid to doc appointments, etc. Goodness, prepandemic days, we did most of our grocery shopping all together as a family. Even then, I'd get comments of what a good father my husband is for even coming to the store. As some replies stated, one of the reasons strangers are so wowed by this because they themselves have not had great fathers/husbands doing their part, which is unfortunate. Even worse, we'd get older men commenting saying they feel bad that my husband was \"dragged\" along. A dad being there for their child is not going above and beyond and deserving of some sort of Nobel Peace prize or something. A dad simply taking care of their child is the bare minimum. I'm sorry for those of you that don't/didn't have that. I recognize there are a lot of relationships that don't work out, sometimes because of the lack of effort from one side.  To the moms and dads that are out there trying their absolute best: keep up the great work. If you have a spouse that seems to be less than there for your kid, please communicate with each other with your needs. Both moms and dads need a break sometimes to do shopping on their own.",

It's a tribute to Terry Pratchett who wrote, \"A man is not dead while his name is still spoken.\"  So people came together to create GNU Terry Pratchett to keep his name alive.  It's based on the Clacks system in his Discworld novels which are basically semaphore towers they use to communicate.  GNU is a code sent by the Clacks telling the next tower to send the message along, don't log it, and turn it around at the end of the line.  That way the message is going forever.  The message in this case is Pratchett's name.  The addon lets you see which websites you visit have that hidden bit of code on the page somewhere, passing his name along and keeping him alive.  If you want to see it working, [my webpage](https://www.thelostfates.com/) has the code in the background.  But all it really does is light up the icon.  It's more fun to just run across them in the wild.",

Similar to Disconnect, that I've seen in other comments, but I've found that disconnect seems to have frequent conflicts with the above two adblockers, where Privacy Badger doesn't.\n\n**General website tools**\n\n[Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh) - Helpful for websites without darkmodes. Alters .css files to give any website a darker palette to be (hopefully) easier on the eyes.\n\n[Imagus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imagus/immpkjjlgappgfkkfieppnmlhakdmaab) - A substitute for HoverZoom, which got really sketchy over the past couple of years.

I'd played a little when I was a kid, so picked it back up quickly and started getting half decent.\n\nEventually, I started playing with one coworker fairly regularly. He was good, no doubt. At first he was clearly just volleying with me, not actually putting it away when he'd get the chance. This made it more fun for me to be sure, and offered me great practice.\n\nAnyway, after about a year, I'd gotten to the point where I could cream everybody I'd play with ease, except him. And our games had elevated drastically, to the point of all out smashing the ball back and forth standing 10 feet away from the table. And I actually started winning some games every now and then. I was ecstatic!\n\nWell one day, after losing a pretty heated game to me, and me being juts a little bit pompous about it, my table-tennis buddy/coworker pulls a total Inigo Montoya on me - flips the paddle from his left-hand (which he 100% consistently used when playing against me) into his right and says to me, \"You know I'm right-handed, right?\". I did not. Nor did I ever win another game against him.",

Well I was looking for something to do with my time and decided to try the local Scrabble club.\n\nI'll cut to the chase: I didn't win a single game. I didn't even present a challenge to a single player there. Several of them got annoyed at having to match up with someone as bad at Scrabble as me. I left that night deeply humiliated, but amazed. I never went back.\n\nWhat I learned that night is that championship Scrabble players do not bother hunting for 150-point mega-score words. No, they *kick your ass* by placing three tiles that cross connect to form five different words, three of which are two-letter words, and all of which somehow share the same Triple Word Score tile even though only two words can possibly use it. And they score like 226 points by laying down those three tiles. It's incredible. It's as much art as science.\n\nSo I learned a lot about humility from that one.",

Anyway about 10 years ago (I was still really good at that point) I go over to a couple's place for a BBQ at the beach. I walk into the main room and a 12 yr old kid is chilling with his dad and has a guitar in his lap, talking to someone. It's a really nice Martin so I comment on it. The dad says \"hey Junior, let this man play a bit, try to learn something.\" Now honestly I'm not a showoff, I really don't even people that well, but I figured hey I've been playing a while and this kid's father is being really cool about helping his son learn an instrument. I admire that, all kids should learn to play music. So I accept the offer, bust out a couple short tunes, some decent riffs and a couple of my \"flashy\" scales at full speed, but not too big a deal. I don't want to make the kid feel hopeless, I mean he's just a kid learning to play, right? WROOOOOONG. I hand it over to him and he begins to fucking shred this thing like I'm some kind of asshole who started playing 45 minutes ago. Don't get me wrong, the kid was not showboating at all. For those of you who play you'll understand. When someone can play you can tell, and when someone can shred you can definitely tell. Kid shreds.

I continue to grow and innovate, creating stronger carts, stronger cabbages, and stronger industrial relationships through out the lands. Eventually while the word changes, I watch as my cabbage empire grows. One day I find myself sitting at a desk, in a building surrounded by other tall buildings. \u201cI\u2019ve come a long way since Ba Sing Se\u201d I whisper. Regaling myself of tales of old. \u201cThose children, the little rascals. I\u2019d move my cabbage cart across the kingdoms and still, they\u2019d find their way to me.\u201d I begin to boil with lament, but the sound of a bustling metropolis below calls me from that dark abyss I once call home. \u201cAlas, without those meddling kids and that dumb flying monkey thing, I would have never been driven. I would have been stuck with that cabbage cart.\u201d I turn around; pictures pepper the the three walls before me, as if to paint the map of my life\u2019s work. \u201cBecause of those kids, I\u2019ve become an oligarch. Not only are my cabbages world renowned, but now I create automobiles that of which is only rivaled by that blasted Sato.\u201d Amidst all the chaos, I find love, and as a result, an heir to my thrown of iron and crunchy greenery is born. I regale him of my time as a lowly cabbage merchant, and of my arch nemesis, Arrow Head Kid. My time on this earth would come to an end, but through the magic of the spirit world, I watch as my son builds my company into something grand. Until one day, as I\u2019m strolling through the green pastures of the spirit world. I look up at the sky, watching the spirits dance and play, a voice comes hurling from the horizon. It\u2019s a familiar sort of urgency and disdain, one that I myself have expressed. The words were like a wave crashing over my ears. As I listened, three words rolled of the tongue of the wind...\u201dMY CABBAGE CORP\u201d. \n\nDamn kids at it again.",

Sure, I lost my job at the start of it all after only 2 days, but things worked out for the better in that subject when I got pushed into something with a livable wage. \n\nMy husband and I were on the brink of splitting up until 2020 and we were able to get our shit together to get the fuck out of the living hell that is California. For the first time we love where we live.\n\nWe adopted an amazing new cat and our expectations were far exceeded in him. He and our other cat formed an inseparable bond that we've been so thankful to see bloom. \n\nThen Christmas came. My mother in AZ and my aunt in TX both came down with COVID. My mom was one of those major conspiracy theorists calling people sheeple for wearing masks, thinking there's microchips in vaccines, etc. Not good for a 69yr old woman with major underlying respiratory conditions. 3 days with mild symptoms and I convinced her to go to the hospital anyway just to be sure. She was diagnosed with covid pneumonia. All her vitals were on point though and we really thought she'd make it through until all of a sudden she didn't. I'm 27 and have no parents left now. I just finished the 20h drive to her house from OR last night and found her cat was missing. She was born in my apartment 4 years ago and I still have her brother. The woman who was supposed to be taking care of her until I could get here did just about fucking nothing to help and couldn't even be bothered to open a window on my mom's house where she could've found shelter. \n\nNow? The first day of 2021 and my 4th wedding anniversary, I should be happy but I'm completely crushed. That cat felt like my last hope. I was there for her first breath, first steps, first sights.. fuck that woman who couldn't be bothered to open a window. The best thing that could happen to me in 2020 is for her to find her way home. \n\nI'm not sure how I'm going to handle everything I have to do this month. I don't know how to sell a house or deal with her financial assets, I feel lost. I'm thankful for the financial stability I've just gotten as a result of this, but I'm worried it's coming at the cost of my emotional and mental stability. I'm just trying so fucking hard to keep the best mindset I can here.\n\nEdit: Cairo, my mom's kitty has been found! But really she found us. I walked out of a room and there she was just sitting on the floor in the house. We'd been leaving all the doors open for her and put her litter box outdoors with some of my mom's clothes as suggested. Idk where she was but it worked! Thank you for your support everyone. And really, THANK YOU for your suggestions, they might just have saved that little fluff's life.",

            "9 years ago, buddy got jumped at a house party. I jumped in to pull the guy off of him. Attacker ended up pulling out a knife and shanking me in the stomach before fleeing to a getaway vehicle.\n\nPolice were called. Caught the guy. We were supposed to come into court to point at him and be like \"he did it\" but the day before he pleaded guilty. No idea what happened to the guy after that or what his punishment was but he probably didn't learn anything from the situation.\n\nMe? I feel completely fine. Sometimes I forget that I even got stabbed. I feel a little uneasy whenever someone has a knife in their hand and its not dinner time, but that's about it as far as trauma goes.",
            "A pregnant drunk lady called an ambulance. I was working with a junior colleague but a female one. The patient said she thought she was in labour and was sat on the floor legs open knees bent with a blanket over he lower part. There was a small table next to her, glass top wooden coffee table thing. My colleague asked to examine her and for some reason she got angry and insisted I examine her not my female colleague. After a bit of back and forth I knelt down and went to lift the blanket to have a look when there was a sudden crash. My colleague had put her foot through the glass table and was standing on the patients hand which had a huge knife in it. Turns out she wanted to stab a paramedic and when we turned up she chose me. My colleague saw it just in time and saved my life.\n\nPatient had already had several children who were in care and had foetal alcohol syndrome. I was asked for a statement when the next one was born and they were also taken in to care.\n\nShe got away with the premeditated attempted murder on grounds of mental health.",

My client had schizophrenia and BPD due to childhood and substance abuse. \n\nShe stabbed me three times in the chest (once in the heart, penetrating my right ventricle and severing a major artery) after I advised her against a medication (nicotine gum). I almost died, doctors said that it was a miracle I survived, with a 3% survival rate due to the severity of my injuries. \n\nThat only happened back in August this year, I\u2019m still in recovery and I\u2019m dealing with PTSD. She\u2019s completely ruined my life, and I\u2019m now struggling with my identity and what I want to do in life.",
            "my mum was incredibly abusive. on one occasion, I was around 12 and she came into my room while I was sleeping and stabbed me in the chest with a kitchen knife, puncturing my lung (I didn't know this at the time). obviously this woke me up and I just rolled out of bed and ran around the house screaming. someone on our road noticed the noise and called the police. just before the police arrived, she started choking me and I lost consciousness. I later woke up in the hospital and (mostly) recovered. she's now in jail. this is not the only time that she tried, but it was the most dramatic and came the closest to actually killing me.",
            "Not me but my friend's mom. A coworker of hers was stalking her, obsessed. Convinced he was in love with her and nobody else deserved her, that kind of thing. Eventually he came to their office with a revolver.\n\nShe was bending down to put files away, or something similar. He quickly approached her from behind and shot her in the back before immediately shooting himself in the head. She survived obviously, though the wounds were significant. Incredibly fortunate she wasn't hit in the spine or major organs.\n\nI often wonder how different it would have played out if she had been standing, or facing him. More than likely she would be dead. \n\nThis was before my friend was born, and his mom made a mostly full recovery. Still has chronic pain and PTSD, but she can walk and has a job. Not reclusive or unfriendly to strangers. Terrified of guns, of course, but that seems fair. Both my friend and her are extremely lucky.\n\nEdit: Spelling",
            "I was 17 at the time. I was wicked sick one weekend and my mother decided I needed to go to the hospital. She had been drinking all day, as she was a terrible alcoholic. It turned out that I had strep throat. So they're typing out my discharge paperwork and my mother approached the desk where the nurse was sitting. Clearly stinking of alcohol, the nurse told my mother that she wouldn't be allowed to drive me home because she was clearly intoxicated. This sent my mother into a drunken rage, swearing and threatening the nurse. Who told her if she left the police would be called. My mother grabbed me and hurries me into the car. I start yelling at her about how irresponsible she is and how she is ruining her life with alcohol. This pisses her off even more. We only live less than a mile away but my mother has taken a different route than normal, when I ask why she just says it's the long way and she doesn't want to get caught. As we're traveling down this dark, Maine back road she begins speeding like crazy. We were doing at least 90 mph when she looks over at me with a blank face and says I'm sorry. She then pulled the E brake and cut the wheel sending us flying off the road. The next thing I remember is sitting in the front seat of a pickup truck with an EMT shining a flashlight in my eyes along who the president was. I responded that Bill Clinton was the president (2000). Apparently she had crashed us into a huge rock at the end of someone's property, directly on my side of the car. Apparently I crawled over her and staggered to the door of the property to ask for help. They put us in different ambulance and we headed back to the hospital we just left. Upon arrival, the nurse my mother fought with said \"I knew you'd be back\". My mother in a drunken semi conscious state kept saying I'm sorry I tried to kill you, I love you, over and over. She suffered several broken ribs, a broken collar bone, broken nose and cracked vertebrae. I had a concussion and some cuts on my face from the door window basically exploding on impact with the rock. She was sentenced to some alcohol program through the courts and some community service. She suffered severe depression and six months after this she took her own life in another car accident. She actually asked me if I wanted to go for a ride with her that night and I told her no, I'll see you when you get home. That was the last thing I ever said to her.",

            "At the beginning of October my husband was trying to buy a PS5 on letgo. He wanted to make sure it actually worked so he gave the guy our address. I told him a dozen times that he was going to get robbed. He still had the kid come over. \n\nAs soon as he got there he pulled a gun, grabbed the cash and shot twice. One hit my husband in the abdomen. The second went through the stairs behind him and traveled 30-40 feet to the kitchen. \n\nI heard the commotion and ran downstairs and chased him away from the house. We got to the front gate and he pulled his gun again and shot at me. He missed my head by less than 2 inches.\n\nHe was caught and is being charged as an adult (16) for 2 counts of attempted murder and a variety of other charges.",
            "I was in Thailand, heading back to my apartment from a popular corner of bars in Chiang mai.  I went down the same streets and alleys I always did, cutting through the center of the city to the edge of the moat by RAM Hospital.  \n\nI passed by the technical college and saw a group of guys hanging on the corner, I didn't think anything of it as I entered the final alley that would put me at the moat and my apartment.  Two mopeds passed me and went into a alcove to my right, and as I passed it they zoomed out and cut me off.  4 guys hopped off their bikes and one approached and said, \"where you going?\" and decked me in the face.  \n\nAs I think, \"did this motherfucker really just punch me in the face?\" I look up and he has his arm up and holding something, in a swinging motion, and I did the only thing I could, put my arms up to protect my face, and yell out.  After several blows to my arm, I attempted to turn and run, but his buddies were there to stop me and kept cutting off my escape. After a couple minutes, could've been less it's all a bit of a mess of memory, they all hopped on their bikes and dipped, I have no clue why maybe it was my yelling, and I looked down at my arm.\n\nMy left arm, below the wrist, was cut halfway through, one of my bones completely exposed, marrow and everything, my hand hanging uselessly at the end, and I immediately knew I was in deep shit even though I didn't feel a thing.  I have minor medical training so I  took note that no arteries were severed, but I was bleeding profusely and needed help.  I went to the guesthouse nearby and asked the attendant for help, poor thing looked faint when she saw me lol.\n\nShe got me in her car and took me to RAM Hospital literally 100 yards away.  Turns out what they guy swung at me was a machete according to the doctor, I thought it was a cane or rod of some sort.  So that's my story.  It's important for me to say I stayed in Thailand for a year after this event, despite friends pleas for me to gtfo and come home.  I wasn't about to let that shit ruin a lifetime opportunity for me.  \n\nAnyway I have full function of the arm and hand now, and after 4 years of drinking to bury the memory, I'm happy to say I started therapy 6 months ago, I quit drinking entirely, was diagnosed with PTSD, and am finally addressing the demon who's been hiding in the depths of my mind, and that motherfucker has his days numbered.\n\nThanks for reading my story, it's one I just recently had the courage to tell in full, rather than passing it off as \"shit happens\".  Peace and love, redditors.\n\nEdit: cleaned up the wording.\n\nEdit 2: cleaned up paragraphs, too",
            "Ah, my heart dropped when I saw this question. I was 15 and my dad plotted to murder me. My dad had only been back around for a few months after being homeless for a while due to his 20+ year meth addiction. He had never been violent towards me before, but I later found out he had tried to kill my mother just months prior and she brushed it off as him having a PTSD episode.\n\nI came home from school, he surprise attacked me by suffocating me with a pillow/strangling and attempted to sexually assault me. I had just gotten a boyfriend and wasn\u2019t around as often and by the language he used when trying to assault me, it was clear this was the source of his anger. He had the TV turned up to an extreme volume so no one could hear me scream.\n\nI ended up being able to get up and run to the bathroom- the only room in our house with a lock. He grabbed the door but I found a sharp object in the bathroom and told him to back up or I\u2019d kill him. I somehow was able to shove the door shut and lock it. He tried to get in the bathroom but couldn\u2019t.\n\nHe actually said \u201cI\u2019m leaving!\u201d and open/closed the front door to try and lure me out. It was quiet for a while but then I heard him breathing outside the door. He eventually left after a few hours, taking my money I had hidden in my bedroom, and called a relative telling them I\u2019d been in a terrible accident and he needed a ride to the hospital. He ended up running when dropped off and was missing for a year. Most terrifying year of my life.\n\nHis body was found by a fisherman at his favorite lake growing up. They found high levels of meth in his system and it appeared to be a suicide.\n\nLater, when investigating the home I was attacked in, they found hammers/duct tape/knives under my mom\u2019s mattress and looked like he very much so intended to kill me.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. Certainly the craziest life experience I ever hope to have and therapy was a long journey. The craziest part of it all was that my dad from childhood was still there simultaneously with the horrid attacker. He cried outside the door for a while telling me he was so sorry and I wouldn\u2019t ever see him again, but would switch to trying to lure me out and being aggressive. There were many moments I could hear the duality of who he was. The murderous cracked out crazy person and someone who was regretful and really sad inside. Idk- just thought that was an interesting thing to add for context. It\u2019s not always just so cut and dry between a crazy/bad person and a good/normal person I\u2019ve learned.",
            "When I was 11, my stepbrother (16) started sexually abusing me and my little sister (didn\u2019t know this until much later. She was 8). We had just moved in with him and his family and it was 5 states from my mom. We didn\u2019t know anyone and my dad took him volunteering spending time with me as him being a nice older brother. After a year, I started to realize that this was seriously wrong and started to fight back. One night, I just got fed up and sick of the shit so I told him no and that I was gonna tell my dad what was going on. He started to strangle me and I believe he would\u2019ve killed me if my dad didn\u2019t come stumbling home from the bar. \n\nThe next day, I told my mom what happened and she told my dad. After talking to my sister, he sent me and her on the next flight home to live with my grandparents. He said he tried talking to his wife about it, but she called us liars. He stayed married to her another few years before getting a divorce. I\u2019ve seen my dad maybe 15x since it\u2019s happened. \n\nI\u2019ve never really told anyone about this but my partner, because the one person I expected to be there for me really wasn\u2019t. I feel like he betrayed me and my sister. He may be able to drink himself to forgetting, but I can\u2019t because I have a scar on my neck as a constant reminder.",

            "I don't personally remember this, and only found out the story after I told my mom I have fear of looking out windows at night. Apparently when I was 3 or 4 I was in the kitchen with my mom one night, when a man came through the kitchen window and tried to stab her. My father ran in with a gun and shot at the man. He climbed back out the window, and the police never found him. \n\nAnother time when I was 13 we lived in an apartment complex my father owned. At night the laundry room needed to be locked up and the change emptied. The change was close to around 100$ a night. I would normally lock up the laundry building around 10pm. It was a really rough neighborhood, so my father had a large dog, Rottweiler/Malamute mix, and he was trained to walk with me everywhere. I was a very small girl and I'm sure that dog was a big deterrent for a lot of people. Anyway, one night I go out to close down the laundry building, and my dog won't come inside with me. He is barking up at the sky, and won't follow any command I give. I cleaned up the building and gathered the coins, and the whole time my dog is standing by the door looking up at the sky. I lock up the door and turn to leave, and a man jumps down off the roof. He has a huge knife in his hand. He yelled something, over my dog losing his mind barking and growing, he had a crazy shit eating grin on his face. He then tried to run at me, and my dog jumped up on him. I ran back to our apartment, and my dog stayed back to fight him. \nI told my dad what happened and we ran back to get my dog, and find the man. My dog was stabbed 3 times, and needed to be hospitalized for days at the vet. He pulled through and lived many more years. They never found the guy.",
            "My ex was using meth, he held me hostage for a few days. He decided on the 6th day that I was going to die. He made me write a goodbye letter to my family. Lol not a suicide letter, a goodbye letter. He wanted everyone to know that he \u201ckilled his cheating whore of a girlfriend\u201d.\n\nBtw I wasn\u2019t cheating, he was just so delusional from the drugs. I took forever writing the letter because I couldn\u2019t stop shaking and I was also trying to stall and figure out what the fuck to do. He sat there with a gun watching me. He finally said I was taking too long and goes \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom, when I get back this better be done.\u201d\n\nWell, this was the first time I wasn\u2019t tied up. So the minute he was out of sight I bolted out the door. I was barefoot but hauled ass to the neighbors. My saint of a neighbor let me in and called the cops. Cops got there and my ex was gone. Haven\u2019t seen him since and had my dad and brother go and collect my stuff from his house a few days later. \n\nIdk if this is classified as \u201cattempted murder\u201d he did beat me for those 6 days. But he never tried to actually murder me I guess? But when he was sitting there with a gun making me write a goodbye letter, I fully believe he was going to kill me.",
            "Not me but my dad, when he was in his early 20s he was in a band staying in a hotel with his then gf when he woke up in the middle of the night to someone trying to rape her, he pushed him off and they started to fight.\n\nHe tells the story comically about they fought through the hotel out on to the street, long story short the guy ends up stabbing my dad 11 times and leaving him to die on the sidewalk. A stranger was walking his dog at 5am, calls an ambulance and keeps on his way. They come, save my old man, reinflate his lung and he survives.\n\nAttacker gets caught and thrown in jail, find out he had gotten out of jail 2 days prior to the attack for stabbing another person to death. Fast forward a couple years again and my dads playing in a band in a bar owned by his buddy, spots the guy who stabbed him.\n\nTells his friend who owns the bar that guys gotta go thats he guy who nearly killed me, stabber gets kicked out and was found hanging the next day in his hotel room. But wait there's more.\n\n35 years later, my aunt moves to the city we live in and hits up some dating app or some shit and meets the officer who responded to my dads attack when he was a rookie, so a lifetime later my dad gets to shake the hand of the cop who helped save his life nearly 4 decades earlier.

            "My ex boyfriend was not well. He was my first big time serious boyfriend when I hit 18-19 and he was so abusive to me. He and his friend and I went to Walmart and his friend said something that made me laugh. My ex got out of the car and left and we had to go everywhere looking for him. When we saw him, he threw his phone at the car because I was in the passenger seat. I got one of our mutual friends who I had known a lot longer and we went looking and he was at his friends camper. He was sitting in the dark, holding a gun. When I walked up, he pointed it in my face and racked it. Definitely loaded. Said mutual friend ended up getting between us and was able to take the gun from him. \n\nThe guy stalked me afterwards for a while and then I got a call around Christmas like a year after that he had been murdered in Georgia and dumped at a construction site for trying to take drugs and money from three people, who ended him quickly. \n\nAlso, to be totally clear, he did a lot of horrible shit to me. Said a lot of shit. Him dying was probably one of the happiest days of my life because he always told me he would finish it if I came back to my hometown. Luckily, he had gotten into bath salts and finished going crazy and ended up dying exactly how he always thought he would. Call me heartless for being glad he\u2019s dead, but I missed seeing my grandma one last time out of fear he would find me and I\u2019ll never see her again.",
            "My then boyfriend threw me to the ground repeatedly and then strangled me into unconsciousness and left me for dead in the middle of the road. An eye witness was so disturbed that he flew in from hundreds of miles away to testify in the trial years later. I don\u2019t remember most of the encounter (side effect of strangulation) but they had all the pictures of my injuries and the coroner also testified because my injuries matched those he usually sees on corpses. But my ex was military in a military town, got up on the stand and argued that this was self-defense (he was six inches taller than me and at least 40 lbs heavier), and the jury let him walk on all charges. He has since been promoted in the Army as well while I still wake up with strangulation nightmares.",

The bullet intended for my friend grazed her hand and head and she played dead. She was the only survivor. \n\nShe came back to school the next year, but people were horrible.

She said he was very quiet and shy but always looked out for her if things got rough or she got bullied when they would play with all the neighborhood kids. The way she describes it, one day he just snapped. He was in 8th grade, she was in 6th. He snuck off to the bathroom to skip class with a couple friends where he stabbed them to death with scissors, and was on his way to her classroom when he got stopped by a teacher. He had a list in his backpack with her name on it and a couple other kid from their friend group. He was charged as an adult and put in prison/mental health facility. He wrote her several times while incarcerated apologizing. He got out a few years ago and committed suicide not long after. My wife still struggles with strangers and to this day playgrounds and things like that make her extremely uncomfortable. We\u2019re now starting our family and it weighs heavy on her that our kids might have friends where that could happen without warning. It\u2019s not easy.",

            "Not my story, but my cousin's.  She was married to this crazy man.  I won't go into detail about the ways he was awful, but he was insane.  Also, before he married my cousin, he had another family who all died in a house fire.  All four of his children and his previous wife.  We all felt bad for him for suffering such a tragic loss, because we didn't know what he was like behind the scenes at home.  We never suspected anything off about that, just thought it was a tradedy.  Well, finally my cousin decided to leave him.  She took her two kids and moved away.  She had to leave abruptly, so she was missing a lot of important things.  Social security cards, birth certificates.  Stuff like that.  One day, after things cooled down some between her and her ex, she arranged for her to go over to their old house and gather the rest of their things.  He asked that she bring the kids, because he \"missed\" them.  Luckily, she decided to let them stay at their friend's house instead.  She went over to the house, and he was absolutely enraged that she didn't bring the kids.  He shot my cousin four times and then shot himself in the head.  He was planning to do a murder suicide with the whole family, that's why he wanted the kids there.  My cousin was shot twice in the neck, in the face, and in the arm.  Somehow, none of the bullets struck any major arteries or anything.  She was able to make it next door to her neighbor's house and get help.  She survived a murder suicide attempt, and her ex didn't.  That whole thing really makes me look at that house fire tragedy in a different light.",
            "I wasn't the intended target but I could've died.\nI worked at small family-owned bicycle shop. My boss, the father of the family was a pretty nice guy, as far as I knew him, anyway.\n\nOne day, I was rearranging displays and my boss's wife and kids were there - a pretty normal day until somebody slammed the shop door open and emptied a full pistol clip into the shop, specifically at my boss.\n\nI got on my stomach as soon as I knew what was happening and waited until I heard the guy running away.\n\nMy boss was shot a couple times in the head and chest and was obviously dead on the spot. His daughter got hit in the upper arm and the wife broke her arm diving to the floor.\n\nEdit: I tried to find any news article about this but couldn't. It happened in Iloilo City, Philippines around December 2015.\nApparently, it was about my boss not paying money he owed to the guy that murdered him. Don't know if they ever caught him.",
            "I was working from home one morning and heard a knock at the door at 8AM. I ignored it at first hoping whoever it was would go away. After a minute of knocking I opened the door. It was my neighbor who I had spoken with a few times. \n\nMy wife was at work and I could tell he was surprised when I opened the door and not my wife. He was expecting her to be home and not me. He noticed that I recently purchased a new car and asked if I could show it to him. He tried to walk inside but I asked him to walk around to the garage because of covid-19.\n\nI showed him the car and he was acting strange. Always kept one hand in his pocket. My garage is very small so we were in close proximity to each other. He kept inching closer to me which made me uncomfortable. He brought a opened coke bottle, filled with a tan liquid, and said \"I brought you a coke\". I declined the offer.\n\nAfter a few minutes he asked if he could see my gauge cluster. We walked around to the drivers side and I sat in the driver seat to turn on the car and show him the gauge cluster. With door open, there was very little room besides the side of the car and the garage wall.\n\nAfter turning on the car he pulled a large hunting knife to my neck. I immediately grabbed his wrist and slammed him back into the wall. At this point we are wrestling between the car and wall as I try to get the knife away from him. During this 30 second period, it seems like a absolute miracle that I was not stabbed. The blade grazed past my stomach multiple times.\n\nI was eventually able to grab the knife and force him out into the driveway. Immediately after grabbing the knife he started saying \"what are you doing!? I was just trying to show you my knife??\" and acting like I had just assaulted him. I was in such a state of shock that I actually started to believe him and wondered if I had overreacted. I know this seems ridiculous but I was completely delusional at the time and did not know what his intentions were.\n\nI stood in the driveway, hands shaking, with 911 dialed on my phone but did not make the call. He acted like nothing just happened and start asking my questions. Really suspicious questions. \"do you have a security system?\"... I lied and said yes. \n\nI asked him to go home multiple times and eventually went back inside the house but did not shut the main garage door. At this point I needed to drive into work and started getting ready. Showering, getting dressed, ect.. I assumed he had just walked back home.\n\nAfter getting ready I went outside and walked around the house to the garage with a can of bear mace. I searched around the garage and was worried he was still there. As I started to get into my car and leave, I saw my neighbor laying down behind some boxes in the garage... staring at me. I yelled and ran as fast I could back to the front door and called the cops.\n\nCops arrived quickly and my neighbor had disappeared. They searched around his house and mine but could not find him. They said they would stay in the area but were going to leave for now.\n\nMy house is surrounded by woods and I have a large back porch. Frightened, I stood in the middle of the porch while holding bear mace. I looked around and noticed my neighbor hiding in the woods staring at me. I ran back inside and called the cops.\n\nCops arrived quickly and pulled guns on my neighbor and arrested him. He later said \"I was just trying to scare him\". They found the knife, zip ties, vodka, and a note on him that read \"turn around and put your hands behind your back.\"\n\nIt was later discovered that the coke bottle he wanted me to drink contained pesticides. He was there to murder me or my wife.\n\nHe was charged with 3 felony counts and is currently awaiting trial.",
            "My father tried to choke me to death. I fought him off and beat the shit out of him. It was the last time he put hands on me. But the other abuse kept going. He died twelve years ago from cancer. I struggled with ptsd and alcoholism until he died. I got sober and haven't had a drink since he died. I see a therapist and take medication. I go to AA and now work with addicts and abused people. I have also chosen not to have children. I have no desire to ruin a human and and too afraid I would if I had a kid. My mother, who was also an abuser, died three years ago from a heat attack. What did I do?  I survived them. I never gave in. I grew and healed and now I help other survivors. Thank you for letting me share my experience. If you are abused or have survived attempted murder, it doesn't have to rule your life. You are not alone. You can heal too.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you to everyone who responded. I am overwhelmed. I never thought my post would garner such a positive reaction. I want to remind all survivors of violence that we apparently have a voice, as evidenced by the response here. I know the tide is turning. I see it daily at work. The more we talk about this stuff, the more we heal. Thank you so very much.",
            "It happened during my first year in uni. I lived with 3 roommates at my dorm. A few months into the first semester, one of my roommates had a mental breakdown and attempted to strangle me while I was asleep. I woke up to his hands around my throat, his knee on my chest and a deranged look on his face. I tried pushing me him off me, clawed at his face etc, but to know avail. My eyes started to dim, my hands felt leaden, I was sure I was going to die. Fortunately my other roommate wasn't asleep, he was laying under the covers browsing on his phone. The sounds from our struggle caught his attention and after seeing what was happening, he pushed the attacker off me and knocked him to the ground. He then woke the other roommate and together they restrained the attacker on his bed and called the university police. The police arrived around 15 minutes later and after we told them what happened, they called the actual cops. My roomamate was arrested and taken to the police station, there he had another breakdown and bit one of the cops. He was transferred to a psychiatric facility after that. He was also expelled from the university.",
            "In 1998 I was walking with two friends to the corner store after school. After leaving with an armful of snacks and candy we were about to cross the street. Next thing I know, I'm waking up in the hospital. \n\nCome to find out I was hit by a loaded Mack truck going 30mph. The kids that were with me told the police I ran into the road, turned around, taunted them and was hit.\n\nI was age 10. At age 20, I learned from a mutual \"friend\" that one of the kids that was with me had pushed me into traffic. I considered him to be a good friend at the time. \n\nIt was rough going to school just weeks after the incident. After sustaining two skull fractures I recovered well. But, the rumors at school and never knowing the truth was troublesome and weighed on me heavily. \n\nThe person who pushed me is now in prison on counts of aggravated assault. Unfortunately, he wasn't charged or tried for what happened to me. Local police refuse to reopen the case twenty years later. I'd feel a lot better if I could get justice.",
            "When I (M) was 7yrs old I made friends with a neighbor girl and we would frequently have play dates. She had an older brother, around 17 that would \"baby sit\" us during these hangouts. One day my parents let me go over to their place on my own, as their house was in spitting distance of ours but the brother was the only one home. He assured me that his sister would be home soon so he lured me out to the back yard. (For background the house was completely fenced in and the backyard had a tree line surrounding it). He told me to wait by the swings, which I did and all of a sudden he charged at me with a sledgehammer. I fell on my back in fear and his swing landed between my legs into the ground. I ran as fast as I could back to my house. My parents, to this day, say it was just horse play but I will never forget the look in his eyes after he missed his swing.",
            "My father had several mental disorders, which I later learned. He tried to murder me when I was 9 years old, after years of physical, mental, and emotional abuse. His mental disorders (that I'm now aware of) included anger issues, bi-polar disorder, PTSD, and paranoia. He would tell me all the time that he hated me because I looked like, and reminded him of my mother who divorced him after he hit her. His abuse continued for years because he told me if I told her about it, he'd kill me and her, and my mom was unaware because he only ever hit her once, so I don't think she realized he'd abuse his own child. One day, he was especially bad, I remember I had multiple fractured ribs, a fractured collar bone, and several bruises/cuts. By this point, I was already into horror movies (thankfully) and all I could think of, because of that, was \"get a knife\" because the \"damsel in distress\" always goes for a knife. I managed to get some distance between us by running inside, I went straight to the kitchen, and grabbed a knife off the counter, then got down on my knees and elbows to use my body to hide it (it was a big butcher knife) I heard him stop behind me, and when I saw him lean forward, I turned and lashed out at him, leaving a sizeable gash across his face. It didn't kill him, but he died when I was 13 due to a heart attack, that was the last time I saw him, other than when I saw him in court, for my mom to get full custody. She asked me during the hearing about the gash, all I said was \"I cut him.\" But I think she put the pieces together because she never pressured about why.",
            "My drunk (ex) husband came home in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. He was pissed off at me for some unknown reason and got on top of me in bed and strangled me to the point where he thought he had killed me. When I came to he was sitting on the side of the bed crying. He had choked me so badly that I had broken blood vessel\u2019s in my eyes. I never spent another night under the same roof as him and we divorced soon after.\n\nEdit- Thank you for all the kind words and the awards. I never expected my story to generate so much attention. This incident happened over 25 years ago. I moved on, got some therapy and am doing well now. I began working as a domestic violence advocate many years after my incident and helping others helped me to heal. To all those that also shared their stories\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for your suffering. If you are currently experiencing DV of any kind consider reaching out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE, or your local advocacy group. There\u2019s a lot of people out there that do care and are willing to help. Reaching out is hard, I know, but it can be life changing.",
            "My older sister was incredibly abusive towards my family, but especially me (I\u2019m away now, so no worries). When I was fourteen, our dad and her were having a super petty argument that just exploded into her trying to kill him while he tried to defend himself without hurting her.\n\nShe tried to stab him three times over but thankfully failed as my dad disarmed her. I could only watch this whole thing happen, completely frozen.\n\nShe then turned to me and let out a horrible scream that I will always remember. She grabbed a knife off the floor and lunged at me, knocking me to the ground. She swung the knife towards my eye while screaming something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m taking your eye\u201d. She kept pushing the knife towards it, but I managed to put my hands over hers and pull it off, my dad also tried to pull her off but when she got like this, she had this insane primal strength and could barely be moved. The knife then cut underneath my eye, nearly hitting the eyeball. \n\nAs usual with these events, nothing came of this and my mum and sister still gaslight me and say that I had some glandular issue and that\u2019s how I got a scar.\n\n\n\nEDIT - Wow, I had no idea this would get as popular as it has. Thanks to those who are offering their support and sharing their experiences, it\u2019s a very difficult thing to do.  \n\nA lot of questions and statements on here, some are ones I\u2019ve heard all my life, others not so much. All of them are hard to answer.\n\nQuestion: \u2018What\u2019s the deal with your mum?\u2019\n\nI love both of my parents very much and we still have a good relationship, however, the way they dealt with and still deal with my sister was at best, awful. When I say that I was abused by my sister my whole life, I\u2019m talking as far back as when we were babies (we\u2019re only two years apart). Whenever my sister would get violent or aggressive, sometimes my mum would step in and defend me. \n\nShe knows my sister\u2019s behaviour isn\u2019t normal, but she\u2019s terrified of her and what she might do. My mum\u2019s behaviour can be a little weird around it, but as I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve come to understand why she acts this way. \n\nAt times, my mum will downplay stuff and will mention how her older brother did similar stuff to her growing up. To her, this is normal. However, sometimes when I get flashes from my PTSD, she comforts me and confirms that what I went through was hellish, even going as far as saying she\u2019s a terrible mother for not stepping in when she needed to. \n\nAlso, my mum wasn\u2019t present during the actual stabbing, she was only there for the aftermath and my sister fed her a bunch of lies. For example, I once caught my sister punching herself in the legs so she would bruise up and make it look like my dad had hit her, when he didn\u2019t.\n\nQuestion: \u2018What about your dad?\u2019\n\nI love my dad but he\u2019s a deeply flawed man. He grew up very poor without education and has a very old fashioned way of looking at work and masculinity. My whole life he would joke around and say things along the lines of he didn\u2019t think I was a real man because I was less \u2018manly\u2019 than other guys. A few comments state that my mum and sister are similar, however, this is the opposite.\n\nIn fact, my dad and sister are incredibly similar. My dad has never been physically abusive like my sister, but his behaviour is often erratic and overly explosive. My dad has had a long line of mental illness run in his family ( a fact I only found out a year ago), so it\u2019s incredibly likely my sister has inherited it from him. She either used to bully me or bully my dad, because she has a control complex and wanted everyone to let her do whatever she wants.\n\nQuestion: \u2018Where were the police?\u2019\n\nThis is a question I get asked so much. As to why my parents never contacted the police, I have no idea.\n\nI think there\u2019s a selfishness from my parents, for sure, and I think they\u2019re aware of this. Nobody wants their kid to be \u2018the crazy one who got arrested\u2019. It seems like a stupid thing to state, but presumably once you\u2019re a parent, your attitude changes.\n\nIt even took some convincing for my mum to let me go to therapy because she was sure I didn\u2019t need it.\n\nAlso, the police aren\u2019t equipped to deal with \u2018domestic disputes\u2019 like this. They just don\u2019t give a shit. At best, nothing will be done and my sister would\u2019ve had even more reasons to be angry. \n\nNearly every authority figure I tried to tell through my life has teased me about it. Once when I was 11, I tried to tell a school counsellor about the abuse while crying my eyes out. He told me that I was lying, that I was a \u201cgood actor\u201d and that the fact I\u2019m getting bullied \u201cby a girl\u201d shows how much growing up I have to do and that I should just \u2018punch her\u2019. Awful guy.\n\nJust after the stabbing, my mum came home and called my sister and said that if she didn\u2019t come home (she had ran off) she would call the police. She promptly came home. \n\nQuestion: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you just fight back?\u2019\n\nThis abuse was going on my whole life. It took 4 years of therapy and a therapist telling me at 20 years old, \u201cyou were abused\u201d, to make me realise what a cruel joke my life was.\n\nFighting back only made it worse. You raise your voice a little? Get smacked. You tell her to stop? That\u2019s another smack. You get aggressive? All your stuff gets broken, and a smack.\n\nThere have been few times where I\u2019ve had to physically fight back because if I didn\u2019t, I would\u2019ve been killed by her. If I ever beat her in a fight, nothing would happen. Just the same shit the next day.\n\nAbuse was my life. It still is. If nobody is hurting me, then I have to hurt myself. It\u2019s the way my brain will work for the rest of my life. I\u2019m actively trying to get better, and I am healing, although very slowly.\n\nQuestion: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you get the hell out?\u2019\n\nWhere was I going? I had nowhere to go, I was a child/teen.\n\nI left the city for another when I was 21 to pursue university, that\u2019s when I knew I could feasibly get out and never talk to her again. I blocked her number the moment I moved in.\n\nI still haven\u2019t spoken to her since June of 2019. She talks about me to my parents every time she sees them, faking sadness and saying how much she wants to see me. My parents refuse to tell her where I lived and I currently live with my partner where I\u2019m much happier, she also knows of my abuse and supports me. \n\nHowever, I soon have to go back to see my grandma. I have been making an active effort not to run into my sister, but it\u2019s inevitable. I\u2019ll try and work it out.",
            "When I was living overseas, a man broke into my apartment. He came in through the window of my studio apartment at about 5-5:30 in the morning. Thankfully, I was awake. He started to go attack me and tried to strangle me. I was able to fight him off, by getting my feet up onto his chest and pushing with all my strength. This happened a few times. The only thing he would say was \"You die, you die.\" \n\nHe was slender and I don't think he was very prepared and I don't think he expected me to fight back. Partway through this, when I realized that he wasn't giving up, is when I really started to get scared and think to myself that I needed a plan and to get out of there. My friend lived next door, so I decided I was going to make a run for it. Once I stood up, he ran back out the window. I grabbed my glasses and my phone and ran to my friend's apartment. Thankfully she was awake. \n\nI told her what happened and she was like, \"you have to call the police!\" By this time, shock was starting to set in and for some reason, my brain was telling me, \"I am okay, so nothing happened.\" She kept reiterating that I needed to call the police. I decided to call one of my coworkers who spoke English really well and ask her. This coworker was horrified at what happened and immediately said that she was going to call the police for me and call me back. Once the police arrived, she acted as the translator to tell them what happened.",
            "While transferring work locations, I was staying with a cousin of mine at the new location. Her psychotic, alcoholic, drug addled, vicious ex-boyfriend (whom she had just kicked out of her house) was stalking her. He saw me move in, assumed I was the new boyfriend, and lay in wait for me outside her house one night, where he jumped me from behind and slit my throat.\n\nDespite losing massive amounts of blood, I didn't die. I didn't even feel that bad, so while he was trying to break into her house (presumably to kill her too), I grabbed a baseball bat from the trunk of my car and beat him until I passed out.\n\nWhen I woke up I wasn't thinking all that clearly, so I went inside, cleaned myself up and drove the the hospital. My cousin wasn't even home at the time, she had gone into the city with her mother for the weekend to see a show and go shopping.\n\nMy attacker and I ended up in the same ICU. I had rendered him a quadriplegic. There was a great deal of civil and criminal legal bullshit to deal with, but in the end I was cleared of any wrongdoing, and he was put on probation for ten years. As he was no longer able to so much as brush his own teeth, his lawyer (provided by his wealthy family) convinced the judge/DA that he was no longer a threat to anyone and the state would be spared the burden of providing him the round the clock care he needed if he wasn't sent to prison. \n\nI was left in massive debt which took me many years to pay off. I did sue him for the injuries I sustained, but despite being a trust fund baby from a wealthy family, he himself was indigent. He'd blown his trust fund on drugs, booze and gambling, and had nothing. His family provided him with everything, including his lawyer.\n\nHe died about the same time his probation ended.",
            "When I was a kid, my father got into a relationship with a rather strange, but still kind woman.\nShe had a son, who was only a couple years older than me. At the time I didn't think anything of their relationship, but looking back at it it was very abusive.\nThey got into fights often, most of them turning physical, even when both me and my father were present.\nThe kid would always try to push me over and hit me, but I would never say anything to my father because I didn't want to ruin his relationship.\nNow here's where my memory get's hazy, so take the details with a grain of salt:\nMy father and his then girlfriend were having a conversation, while I and her son were a few meters away from them. He once again tried to hit me, at which I sat on top of him to prevent that (I was a really fat kid and he was very skinny so despite the age difference this somehow worked). I told him I would get up if he left me alone and he since he promised to do so, I just sat beside him. He proceeded to get on top of me and strangle me. I remember trying to cry out fot help and reaching out to my father, but not being able to make a single sound and feeling like I was being pulled away from him. I'm pretty sure I passed out after that or was at least very close because after that I only remember that my fathers girlfriend and her son were now gone.\nI never saw them again, though the last I heard of them was years later, after my dad recieved a \"anti wedding invitation\" from her. \nFrom what my dad told me, she was angry at her son, but was even more pissed at my dad for ending the relationship. \nI'm pretty sure he didn't really intend to actually murder me, but then again what is the intention of trying to strangle a 7-8 year old kid?\nAll in all, this was surprisingly less traumatizing than you think it would be.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Fathers ex-girlfriends son tried to strangle me",

            "Not me but my sister.\n\nShe was working in retail sales at a large popular mall in a large city a few years ago. One day as she arrived at the mall for work, she stopped to use the restroom. The ones general mall goers would use. After using the restroom, she went to wash her hands when she noticed in the mirror that a man standing was standing behind her. She made eye contact with him and apparently gave him a nod of acknowledgment. The man was apparently holding a garbage bag he had gotten out of the roost room trash can and had fashioned it like a rope. He proceeded to approach my sister and wrap it around her neck, choking her and then slamming her on the ground. She doesn\u2019t remember much, but the security camera showed the man literally choke her unconscious and then jumped/stomped on her head repeatedly. The man fled and she was found by another mall goer. She was covered in blood and her face badly disfigured. She broke her jaw and lost several teeth. Long term Brain damage is still not known. He tried to kill her. He was a complete stranger but the police think it was a gang initiation type of thing. The guy is now in jail for a very long time, and my sister has very severe ptsd from it.\n\nEDIT: For everyone asking about the cameras in the bathroom. I didn't see the footage myself, my mom and dad saw and relayed what they saw to me. The cameras were only on the hand wash area and entryway obviously.",
            "Oh boy I just woke up but this is finally a reddit question I have an answer to. I was waiting at the bus stop, it was only me and an older woman waiting there, I had received a phone call from my partner a few moments earlier about how there had been a stabbing and that I should stay safe, a few minutes after that call a man crossed the road, walked up to me and hit me over the head with a wooden fence post. I blacked out, not sure how long it was for but I came to, on the floor with blood spilling out from my head, it's foggy, I don't remember his face but I know I looked up, said, \"What the fuck\" over and over, I somehow managed to stand up and run, I don't think he expected me to get up and was put off guard.\n\n I know now that around 30 minutes before hitting me this man had stabbed and killed a 24 year old man, I often think about how if I hadn't woken up in that moment I most likely would have been killed, this guy had done it before, he had the capacity to. I ran across the road, almost getting hit by a car and made it to a pharmacy where she amazing staff took care of me while we waited for an ambulance, I apologized many times for getting so much blood on their floor, I remember finding my wallet and phone in my pockets, realizing that this guy did what he did solely to hurt me made me break into tears. I made it to hospital, gave a 12 page statement to the police, they took my clothes as evidence, my favorite Balor Club shirt which was covered in my blood, I'm still mad I wore it that day. I got 7 stitches in my head, I passed out when getting them, my family smuggled in some McDonald's and I requested some earphones because I knew I wouldn't sleep that night, I think I listened to like 5 Giant bomb podcasts that night, sorry this is disjointed, these are just the things I remember. \n\nIt was a long recovery, lots of hard moments, it really shakes your trust in strangers when one tries to kill you unprovoked. 2 years after there was a trial where they sent him to a mental prison, it was a long week, while there I met the mother of the man he had killed, she cried throughout every day, when I met her I completed froze, I couldn't say anything, its the hardest thing I've ever done, even though I did nothing.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your wonderful words and kindness, it's really made my day and hello to all my fellow Irish folk, it means a lot and truly amazes me that you remember this. \nI've had a few people offer to buy me the shirt I mentioned, that's unbelievably kind, I'm not too sure how how that would work but feel free to DM me.",
            "Not sure if this counts but:\nHad this neighbour kid I used to play with, a complete psycho. I was 4/5, he was a year or two older than me. \n\nOne day he convinced me to walk well beyond the distance that my parents allowed me without an adult, wanted to show me something he said. \n\nWe arrived at a small lake. He pointed at the water and said \u201dLook there's tadpoles in there! Let's catch some. We don\u2019t have a net, you'll have to jump in and catch them with your hands.\u201d \n\nI told him I couldn\u2019t swim, he insisted. He told me he\u2019d pull me up if I was drowning. \n\nI refused, he kept trying to convince me but eventually gave up, said I was a coward\n\nA friend of my mom saw us on our way back, and my mom wasn\u2019t very happy about the situation when she found out.\n\n11 years later: \n\nI transferred schools and ended up in the same class as him. I figured my childhood memory of him was exaggerated\n\nWe talked about childhood memories. he told me how one of our neighbors (who was a cop) had screamed at him for no reason because he was playing with a cat. (Remember this) \n\nI told him it was nice to see him have so many friends, he responded \u201dFriends? They're not my friends, fucking kids\u2026I only let them think I'm their friend.\u201d Smiling the whole time, figured he was joking.\n\nI later told my mom about having met him, she went quiet. I told her that he seemed to have turned out alright\u2026nothing more said.\n\nCouple of weeks later, I brought it up again. She said \u201d as a mother I'll never be able trust that boy, and you shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d \n\nShe went on to tell me how I was unable to sleep and cried a lot at night when I was a young kid. Reason being that he had told me he was planning to burn down our house and murder me and my family in our sleep.\n\nAnd about our neighbor screaming at him, turns out he was actually caught torturing the poor cat. \n\nAfter that I avoided him. Thinking back, his behaviour was off even as a young adult. He was clearly manipulative and lacked empathy. \n\nFinal thoughts: Pretty sure he wanted to drown me that day and wanted it to seem like an accident.",

Honestly can't remember. He tried to strangle me, I clawed his arms like hell and passed out. His brother who we were living with stopped him.

My sister was blue by that point. \n\nLong story short, his mom was friends with the town judge and he got LET GO, NO JAIL TIME. He went on to kill another woman, who was a young mother.

            "I took a date out of town to a zoo and on the way back into town, we stopped at a popular ice cream shop.  Once we get our ice cream, I decide to pull over into a shopping center to park so I could enjoy the ice cream without driving.\n\nThis shopping center had a few big stores in it, but the bulk of things were closed or closing as it was about 11PM.  So there weren't many people around.  But I didn't think anything of it.  It was a sorta nice night, we had the windows down in the car, and we just sat there and talked for a few minutes even after we finished the ice cream.\n\nAt some point during our conversation out of the corner of my eye I see something shiny in my side mirror.  It turned out to be a knife and some guy was coming up to the car.  He didn't say anything, he swung the knife in the car.  He kept flailing the knife around.  I climb on top of my date in the passenger seat, kicking at the guy who is wildly swinging the knife.  I go into my glove box, grab my pistol, and I fired it 4 times.\n\nI then got out of the car and found out there was another guy who was at the passenger door, but he was unarmed.  He ran off once I shot.  He was messing with my date, he prevented her from being able to get out of the car so we could get away from the knife guy.\n\nI got cut and stabbed in my legs and my left arm a bit.  All superficial stuff thankfully.  Lots of stitches, bandages, and pain.  But I was *fine*.  The person I shot wasn't so lucky, as I hit him directly with 3 of the 4 shots and grazed him with the 4th.  He was still alive when the ambulance rolled up, but he didn't make it to the hospital.",
            "Not me, but my mom. A man entered her house just before lunchtime and stabbed her and her maid multiple times. He also kept punching both of them while stabbing them. Eventually he got tired and left. My mom played dead, then when she was sure that they were alone, she checked on the maid to see if she was still alive. Both of them survived the attack, but the police never found the guy. \n\nThe thing is, my mom knows the guy. See, she owns a flowershop, and had two people working for her. One of them is this nice gay guy, and that guy had a boyfriend. It was the boyfriend who attacked my mom, and my mom told me that he was high and was looking for money. It seemed like his boyfriend didn't want to give him money that day, so he decided to attack his bf's employer instead.\n\nSince then, my vibrant, outgoing mom became reclusive and she developed various health conditions. She's also always in a state of pain, which led her to become dependent on pain meds. The meds ruined her kidneys and liver, and now she's undergoing dialysis for it.",

Thank you.\n\nSo to fill in some blanks I don't think there was any warning about what was going to happen. The night it happened he shot my mother came upstairs, shot me, shot at my brother and then shot himself.\n\n He survived until he reached the hospital but he didn't make it despite their attempts. So no he wasn't punished or locked up. I guess I'm glad or I might have always been looking over my shoulder in case he got released. \n\nYes it was on the news. Which was horrible because everyone at my school knew all about it, when I was just trying to live with some kind of normalcy, it was out there for all to know.I just wanted to be treated the same so I could pretend like things where the same.\n\nI found out a few details years later and just when I thought I had kind of accepted it all, it turns out my mum was getting ready to leave him. Not only might she have been spared what happened to her but she wanted to get back together with my dad! \n\nSo that's pretty much the story.\n\nHope I satisfied your curiosity.

His mother did not care, although she did (disturbingly calmly) call my mom when I asked to leave. Fast forward a few days, and he\u2019s being ushered out of the classroom and is no longer permitted near me because the teacher caught him writing a letter detailing all of the ways he planned to torture and eventually execute me.

I'm fit and used to do combat sports, so I was able to do quite a bit of damage right back. I think when they realised they themselves were taking too many hits, they cut their losses and fled. I have no doubt they would've killed me as well as raped me if I hadn't made it such an unholy battle for them to get me down. I was a mess, and still needed to hike back to civilization after that.

            "So... we were at a buddies apartment in college. Over the summer he had sublet to a local townie guy that turned out to be a nightmare and he was telling us about it (among MANY other things the guys had stolen all of the roommates' credit cards and IDs- strange since they were of different racial ethnicities so the IDs wouldn't help). \nAs he described the guy, we all realized that he was the \"crazy\" man we dealt with while walking over-there had been a dude saying real violent and crass things while walking next to us, uncomfortably close).\nAbout an hour into hanging out, there was a VERY LOUD POUNDING on the door!!! And crazy guy starts yelling \"Let me the fuck in, now! I know it was you!\"\nApparently, our buddy had (appropriately) called the police on the stolen cards and ID. Guy was yelling \"let me in, Im gonna KILL you!\" and pounding on the door so hard the deadbolt was starting to crack in the door frame.\nWe were juniors in college and my gf (wife now!) and her friends were freshmen and getting nervous- he had been saying things about \"rape\" when we were all walking in.\nSo we call the police but it was a weekend night in a college town and they told us it could take up to an hour for them to show up. The guy had been pounding and threatening for 10+ minutes and didn't sound like he was gonna stop- he clearly knew the doorframe was cracking too. So we push the ALL THE FURNITURE up against the door. Felt like we were in a movie- would have been funny if it hadnt been ridiculously terrifying. We were on 2nd floor of a building and the girls and one of our buddy were legit trying to build a rope ladder out of sheets to go out a back window.\n\nAll of the sudden the knocking and yelling stops. And its quiet for like 3 minutes. Then, from upstairs where a college party had been going on, we hear yelling and banging around and then a bunch of dudes getting really loud. Then there was the clear sound of someone falling down stairs and a building shaking BOMP! (Apparently- we found out later- crazy guy had gone upstairs to an open door party and started groping girls. It took 3 big dudes to push him out the door and he fell down the stairs and the BOMP was him hitting the drywall at stairs end.)\nGuy left the building after that. Cops show up 5 minutes later - apparently upstairs called cops too (to realize how dangerous this guy seemed, college kids were calling cops TO COME to parties). We had to unstack furniture to speak with the police and they knew EXACTLY who we were talking about as soon as we explained what was going on. \nUnfortunately- they didn't find him that night. He left there, stole our buddy's car, stalked, kidnapped, raped, murdered and burned the body of a 19yr old student that night. He wasn't exaggerating when he was yelling he would kill us or saying he wanted to rape the girls. \nThey caught him because he continued trying to use our buddy's credit cards.\n\nWe found out that IN PRISON he RAPED AND MURDERED a female correctional officer who was transferring him out of solitary confinement.\n\nDude was a killer and had us cornered... I am glad that we stacked that furniture. It creeps me out to think about how close it came to a face to face confrontation with a literal crazed killer.",

We had talked for months before actually meeting due to the pandemic so at this point I\u2019d known him for almost 6 months. \n\nAfter the date I invited him over and honestly, my intention was to sleep with him that night. But once we got upstairs I just wasn\u2019t feeling it and told him I wanted to wait. He agreed and said he thought he should go. \n\nI walked him to the door, but when I turned around, he pushed me up against a wall and started being really rough. I thought he was \u201cjoking\u201d until he pulled me to the ground and pinned me. Once I realized what was going on, I struggled and started to fight like hell. His eyes turned black and I could tell he was enjoying seeing me so scared. I tried negotiating, begging, crying, fighting. He was like a robot on autopilot. \n\nAt that point, to stop me from struggling, he just started to hit me as hard as he could in the face and head. I played dead until he stopped. \n\nHe was so turned on by this that the \u201cact\u201d took a split second. Then he just got up and left me there, thinking I was unconscious or dead. \n\nI reported, they got DNA but he was never caught.

He came to my house the next day, as agreed, and picked up my car. At that time I gave him 100 dollars for a specific part he said he needed to fix it. Later that day, he returned to my house with my vehicle and another man. The car had not been fixed and he said he needed another 200 dollars for parts. Both men were clearly on drugs. I told him I didn\u2019t have the money and that I would just drive him home and I would have him fix it in the next couple weeks when I had saved the money. While driving them home, the man who I didn\u2019t know pulled out a gun and held it to the back of head and told me drive to a secluded location. On the way out to this location my gas light came on. He instructed me to pull into a gas station. When we pulled we exited the vehicle and walked up to an ATM just outside of the gas station. He held his gun against my side as we walked up to the ATM. I reached into my back pocket, pulled out my wallet and threw it toward the door of the gas station. I have no idea why I did this, I just knew I had to do something to throw him off. He immediately cursed at me and went toward my wallet and I took off running and went behind the gas station, and kept running toward a field. I never turned around until I got to a tree line where I could see the gas station behind me about 100 yards. I had no wallet, no cell phone, and I could see my vehicle going very slowly up the road in the direction I was hiding. With the driver side window down, this man was now driving my car. He reached his gun out the window and fired 6 shots towards me. He then sped off down the road. I continued to stay where I was until 3 police vehicles, with sirens going, arrived at the gas station. I then started walking back to the gas station and towards the police with my hands up. I was never so happy to be placed in handcuffs.",

The cops did not hesitate to take him out, they didn't even fire a shot, after the gun shots at me there was no more shots, guy came out peacefully. This isn't exactly a murder attempt but he did fire shots at someone in hopes to harm them so it counts in my book",

I was somewhere in the middle there and the next thing I know there's a car driving over me and my head is bleeding and I'm going into shock.\n\nIt's not *clear* whether he saw me before running me over, but one of the people in the car with him at the time told me that he had clearly said \"Hey look, it's [my name]\" before *accelerating* and that after the Bump, he just laughed and couldn't seem to figure out why everyone in the car looked so horrified.  \n\nAnyway, the first thing everyone did was \"get their story straight\" and said I had *jumped* in front of the car, and the kid's dad was so rich that *I* got in trouble, got sent to *rehab,* and then later drummed out of the Navy. I was also told that if I ever received a civil settlement from the kid, then I would have to pay the government back for all my medical care after the accident.  \n\nNothing is fair and fuck the military.",

They left, but one cop had a bad feeling, bless his heart (he told me afterwards) he waited outside.

            "There was this guy who I used to chat with at the bar, he was a little weird. but seemed lonely so I would talk to him because I felt a little sorry for him. this went on for months and eventually he asked me out and as tactfully as I could I said no I wasn't interested in seeing anyone now and I thought he was ok with it. He'd do and say the occasional innapproriate thing that made me feel uneasy, but not bad enough to be rude or make him feel alone and we both liked horses, so that's pretty much what we talked about.   \n\n\nI thought he was fine with this and things went on as before. But then he came in with a friend from work and I was sitting with them and the friend was extremely obnoxious and loudly making all these rape and GHB jokes, like he just wouldn't stop even after I said he was making me feel uncomfortable. He said in a condescending tone \"You don't really think we are going to rape you, do you?\" and I felt stupid and ashamed and said no but they kept going on and finally I said I was going to the washroom and please get the jokes out of your system while I'm gone or I'll leave. That was very stupid and it gave then time to dose my drink.  \n\n\nNow it doesn't make you pass out like many assume but it kind of makes you a suggestable zombie but also get drunk a lot faster (or enhances the effect of the alcohol, whatever). Anyway he told my other friends I wasn't well and he's going to take me home and I'll be safe and after that I don't remember anything till being in his room and the assault happening. It was surreal, like I was floating though the ceiling watching what was happening from above and trying to will my body to get up, run, get up- run! GET UP RUN! But it was like a marionette with the strings cut. Then he pushed my shoulder really hard and I heard a low snap and I rushed back into my body and I had the sensation of dying, of being drowned in blackness.  \n\n\nMuch later I woke up and it was day as there was light coming around the curtains and I managed to find my things and get out but I have PTSD from it to this day and I need a cane to walk.   \n\n\nAlso, the police did nothing so I also have PTSD from the patronizing way I was treated by the police after this.",
            "My brother is prone to violent outbursts and my mother is not very good at handling them, due to the fact that she's a shitty parent and that she's only 5'2\" to his 6'4\". One day when he was 18 and my sister was 11, they were arguing. I stepped in to try to mediate, knowing that if he went off on her she would be severely injured immediately. \nHe completely snapped and picked me up by my neck, holding me against the wall and yelling at me. I couldn't reach the ground but I was kicking him and trying to pry his fingers apart. I felt very faint but I managed to get him to drop me onto the couch where I tried to breathe and told him he needed to go for a walk to calm down. Thankfully he did, I guess he realized that he'd taken it further than he meant to. There were other outbursts but that one was the worst by far. \n\nNo authorities were involved because they always hung up on me when I called (I was a kid at the time) or if they did arrive, they believed he wasn't really a threat, just a good kid who had a bad day. My parents either didn't know or didn't believe me about this incident for a while, but we've since talked about it. I don't talk to that brother or my mom much and I've had plenty of therapy to try and deal with all the feelings I have (rage, distrust, sadness, guilt, etc).\n\nEDIT: A little update on my siblings' current situations. My brother was (mis)diagnosed and then poorly medicated as a kid, which led to him having a hard time regulating and understanding his own emotions; I don't fully blame him for having a tough time but I will never be in a closed space with him again. He has improved somewhat over the years, post-puberty especially. My sister still lives with him and our mother and they all have shitty attitudes towards life and horrible interactions with each other, but given that she's an adult now there's not much I can do for her.\n\nRe the authorities not helping, this is the norm. I was 16 at the time of that event, but had been shielding my younger sister from our brother's outbursts since I was 10 or so. At first I tried to call 9-1-1 but the operators must have thought it was a prank or not truly an emergency due to how young I sounded, so I eventually gave up trying to call them at all. If a neighbor heard something and called and the cops did arrive, my brother would either have left to go on a walk so there was nothing they could do, or they would ask for his story first because he's the oldest and the only male so they would believe him over us. Defund the police.",
            "To be clear, I was not the intended target. It was around 2001. I was back in my hometown for a visit hanging out with some old high school buddies who, since I'd left, had become more involved in the Indo-Canadian gangs in that area. I'd known of it a little, but really didn't overthink it as these guys were all my old friends.  \n\n\nSo we're sitting at one of their houses having some drinks and playing GTA III. I'm sitting on the couch and we're having a grand old time. Suddenly, one of my buddies announces there's someone in the yard, and as if on cue, the window blows inward and a bottle flies through it. The bottle hits the couch right next to me and gasoline is just flowing out of it.  \n\n\nThankfully, whoever lit the thing must of thrown it too fast and the piece of cloth or paper or whatever it was went out before it even hit the window, but the couch-- and me are still covered in gasoline. My friends run outsider to catch whoever it is, and I'm just sitting there stunned.  \n\n\nI left a few minutes later. Never went back, never even talked to any of them again. That shit had an effect on me that lasts to this day. Be careful who your friends are.",
            "I wrote about this in another post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7tpuqb/i_told_a_serial_killer_to_fk_off/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nIn 2006, I was a college student at ASU. I lived in an off campus apartment (on the ground floor) and it was a block off a major street here in Phoenix called Baseline. \u200bThese details are important.  \n\nIn the summer of 2006, Phoenix Arizona was plagued by two serial killers. One was the \"Phoenix Shooter\" who ended up being a team of two guys randomly shooting people, and the other was the \"Baseline Killer,\" a rapist and murderer. Having two serial killers put the entire city on edge, and everyone was talking about it. I even saw articles in Time or Newsweek about the situation. \n\nSo, the Fall 2006 semester had just started. Now, you may have heard this, but Phoenix is HOT in August. It would get stuffy in my apartment, and so I'd leave the window cracked a little because the morning air is nice. The blinds provided visual cover.\n\nAnyways, one morning, a strange sound woke me up. It was the crack of dawn-4:45 am, and the sun was just barely coming up. It was the sound of someone lightly tapping on the window...and it seemed intentional. In my tired state, I figured it could be a bird or some branches or something trivial. \n\nTap tap tap...silence. \n\nAfter about 90 seconds of nothing, the tapping returned, and it was absolutely purposeful. I was positive it was a human producing this noise.  I thought it was my boyfriend, who thought it was cute to try and scare me sometimes. I decided I'd be a bit of a brat and make him wait, but I was also getting really angry:\n\n\"How dare he pull a prank when I'm trying to sleep! This is just like him. I'm going to give him a piece of my mind about disturbing my sleep like this.\"\n\nTap tap tap...\n\nAt a certain point, I got up to get a glass of water, still being in the mindset of wanting to annoy my stupid boyfriend who thought this would be funny. \n\nBut I saw some movement through the slit in the blinds, and I marched over and yanked the blinds so I could see:\n\nDefinitely. Not. My. Boyfriend. \n\nI said very loudly, \"What the FUCK?!\" He sort of seemed taken back by my anger, but only slightly.\n\nThe man I saw will be with me forever, or more specifically, his eyes and the feeling they gave me were insanely...CREEPY. Honestly, words can't do justice to how terrifying his eyes were. \n\nThey looked like black orbs with no white in them. Absolutely predatory. When I see pictures of Ted Bundy or Charles Manson, that's exactly what he looked like. Even if you saw a picture of how they looked, it's different when you experience it in person. It totally floored me-something about this man was profoundly WRONG.\n\nHe was crouched down, like an umpire. He had on dark pants, a dark purple shirt, and a dark Nike hat. \n\nHe had dark skin-I thought he was Hispanic, but later I found out he was a light skinned black guy (you'll find out how I learned his name later). \n\nAnyways, after I yelled \"What the FUCK\" at him, he whispers to me, \"Can I talk to you?\" If you want to know how insanely creepy that is to hear, just whisper that sentence out loud to yourself right now. It still sends chills down my spine when I think of how that sounded...\n\nHis hands subtly moved towards his waist. I later learned he would blitz attack his victims and he probably had a gun. All that separated us was a mesh screen. \n\nNow, this is about a 3 second interaction at this point. For some reason, I thought of Ted Bundy and how he'd pretend to be crippled to target his victims. I thought of my mom telling me to not be nice to strangers-don't be afraid to be a bitch. My thinking wasn't as \"calculated\" as all that, but it was more the nano-processing of how to deal with the situation. \n\nSo, when he whispered that, I started yelling at him: \"Hell no, get the FUCK out of here douchebag!!\"\n\nI shut the window angrily and locked it. I can\u2019t over emphasize how incredibly irritated I was that this person had the audacity to disturb my precious sleep.  \n \nI laid back down and wondered if I'd been too mean. What if he needed help? But that didn\u2019t really make sense.  Why would he be, like, tapping and whispering if he was truly in trouble?  I decided he was a creep after all. I was too annoyed to go back to sleep, but I sort of laid back back down. \n\nI told my room mate about an hour later and she sort of jokingly asked if it could've been the Baseline Killer....\n\nWhen she said that, my heart sank. His face looked exactly like it did in the police sketches that were on billboards EVERYWHERE. The only problem is that those billboards showed him with dreads, and the man at my window had no dreads. Apparently, he was some sort of disguise artist who'd wear wigs (updating the police sketch would've been a nice move, but they didn't.) \n\nI called the Phoenix Police, and the detective I talked to agreed that it sounded like his M.O. The suspect would say something to throw off his target, and then he'd blitz attack. The detective said that my angry response probably made me seem like too much of a hassle and moved on. The only problem was that I thought the guy looked Hispanic, and the detective said many witnesses described him as black. \n\nI thought they might want to come out and try for samples or surveillance video or something, but I didn't hear back from the detective.\n\nMy parents freaked out. Then got us knives, pepper spray, and put up signs. EDIT: Some ppl asked why I didn\u2019t get a gun. I can\u2019t remember why I didn\u2019t at the time, but I remember it being something I was open to when my dad brought it up. \n\nWe learned another tenant had complained that same morning! I never learned the details, but this idiot was apparently going around the damn complex trying to find a target. \n\nThe stupid apartment wouldn't let us out of our lease, so we moved to a 2nd floor apartment right above our old unit (Sidenote: the neighbors who moved into our old unit were HORRIBLE. Obnoxious tweakers who would do meth and play Pitbull on repeat for hours and have knife fights at 11am on weekdays. There were times I wondered if they might be worse than the actual serial killer who came to my window. So, that unit was cursed somehow).  \n\nAnyways, on September 4, 2006, they arrested Mark Goudeau. I think the detective didn't call me back because they were days away from arresting Goudeau. \n\nWhen I saw his mugshot, I was sick but also relieved. He was absolutely the guy outside my window. To me, he looked like he could be Hispanic. You can judge for yourself if you google it. \n\nHe's on Death Row in Arizona now. His wife tried to mount some campaign to show that the police were framing him or something. On a personal level, it certainly would make for an interesting coincidence if this poor innocent man who they \u201cframed\u201d was also whispering like a creep and tapping my window.  \n\n\u200bI can't think of something more scary than a serial killer tapping on your window. That actually happened to me, and if it happens to you, just scare them right back. Don't be afraid to be downright rude to someone who's injecting themselves into your space. It could save your life if you're not afraid to throw your weight around and tell someone off.  TRUST YOURSELF!\n\nYou can still be a kind and generous person and still tell someone to fuck off. \n\n[Arizona Republic Article: Summer of Fear](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-best-reads/2016/09/02/summer-fear-when-serial-shooter-and-baseline-killer-terrorized-phoenix/89557694/) \n\n[Phoenix New Times: Baseline Killer](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/take-a-chilling-look-inside-the-baseline-killer-case-6451168)",
            "This is like hard to directly call a murder attempt but when I was little (maybe 5 or 6)  I was playing in my back yard with the family dog and a man walked up to me from the street. Asked me questions about the dog then told me \u201cI have a dog just like him in my car if you\u2019d like to come see.\u201d Luckily I chose to run inside and ask my mom instead of go directly with him. It didn\u2019t click to me what had happened until years later and I remembered him trying to lure me to his car and I cringe in almost physical pain when I think about it. He probably would have murdered me right? Yikes.",
            "Not sure if this counts because although I don't think murdering me was the goal but it sure felt like it was a real possibility at the time...\n\nOne night in July 2020, my husband and I were in bed and he wanted to get intimate. I was very tired and he had been acting a bit strange for a few days (saying weird things, not really sleeping or eating). I declined and that's where it started.\n\nHe screamed, I tried to lock myself in the bathroom but he kicked the door off it's hinges. He pushed me into the bathtub, pulled the shower curtain down, dumped the cat's drinking water over my head. He then sat down near the door, told me to stare at a uv curing light he was holding and asked me to take off my shirt and \"give him a spin\". He also started singing \"Let it Go\" from frozen. I was beyond terrified and I remember thinking \"This is it. My life ends in this bathtub. I hope my kids don't find my dead body.\"\n\nThere's more that happened in between but the end result was him being diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and that night was a psychotic break/manic episode.",
            "The guys who drugged me, gang raped me, and beat me 3/4 of the way to death and all the way into unconsciousness, thought they\u2019d killed me, so they dumped me in the snow on the side of the road. The doctors told me later that the cold is probably what saved me.",
            "Oof, which time to talk about... Let's go with a simple list and if you want story time let me know. \nA monster brought me in to this planet but did not want me so they attempted to get rid of me. \n\n\nThey instructed my sister to try to drown me. She was successful twice but was  resuscitated by my Mom each time before major brain damage set in.\n\nI have been shot at by handguns, rifles, and once a shotgun. I can tell you, the racking of a shotgun before the blast still sends shivers up my spine. \n\nStrangled until blue a few times. Again saved by my Mom. \n\nLocked outside in the mid of winter in a location that snows in shorts and no jacket. That time I walked two miles to get to the fire station for help. That one sucked as it feels like a million needles poking you when your skin warms up. \n\nI was taken in by my grandparents and they showed me a different way to live. I was tricked into taking care of the monster for 7 years financially and emotionally. I worked my buns off at school and work and got to the point when I was ready to let go of the trauma and left that mofo monster in someone's garage and moved 1300 miles away. Through lots of therapy and learning how to love myself, I have built myself a beautiful life. For those that read this and can relate l will leave you with this message. Stay strong as it's not your fault this is happening to you. You can and with work will heal from the damage your monster put upon you! You are beautiful and got this!!! You are loved!\n\nFor the curious, the monster was my biological father.",

The evening at the club was normal enough until it got later in the evening and he was annoyed I was talking to my friends. He grabbed me by the throat and had me literally off the ground  my friends managed to get him off me so he took my bag with my keys, phone, wallet etc and left me at the club.\n\nI had no where else to go so had to home. When I got in he started to rape me then was strangling me at the same time. I passed out and don't really know what happened after then. When I came to I was covered in scratches and bruises and couldn't turn my neck, my throat was sore for ages so I could barely speak. \n\nI ran into a friend the next morning and broke down, found a new place and moved out as quickly as I could, didn't tell him where I was going and left the uni that we were both at. \n\nIt wasn't the only time he tried to kill me but it was the one that was the wake-up call.",

Left my purse.\n\n I have PTSD, but I have also gone to a ton of therapy.\n\nMoral of the story, if you see that dead, angry look in his eyes, just run. Get out of their presence, even if they are a friend, a boyfriend, a husband who has never done anything to you before. If that look is shark like- LEAVE as fast as you can, and figure things out later.",
            "I was 16 walking to school alone. Some random meth user pulled up in his Ford Bronco and pulled a gun on me ordering me in the car or he would blow me away. He then took me to a second location where he told me of his plans to murder me. That nobody would ever find my body. He showed me his knife, shovel and fertilizer. For some reason I decided to talk to him and not shut up despite him ordering me to do so. He held me hostage for several hours and proceeded to rape and beat me. I remained eerily calm throughout and just kept talking. I asked him a lot of questions about him and his life. Eventually he broke down and decided I was \"too cool\" to kill. He ended up dropping me off at school. I reported it immediately to the school and he was later arrested and put in prison for 10 years. Because of the nature of the crime, he was put on lifetime probation, which is highly unusual. But the judge felt that he would likely commit another sex crime and wanted to make sure he had tabs on him for the rest of his life.",
            "I don\u2019t know if she actually meant to kill me but; I was around six or so and had a neighbour/friend who was a little older. Can\u2019t remember, maybe nine? Anyway, we were at a lake near our houses and I couldn\u2019t swim yet so I had one of those inflatable rings around my stomach. We were playing in a shallow part of the lake and my dad walked away to go pee or something? All of a sudden she just flipped me over. The ring was big enough that I could get in it but still quite tight. Add wet skin and I was basically stuck with my head under water and legs kicking in the air. I don\u2019t know how long I was under for but luckily my dad came back and rushed in and picked me up. I was fine afterwards, still don\u2019t know why she did it.",

            "It was Halloween 2020, and my friends and I were in a park in north London setting off fireworks as a celebration. Totally benign and good vibes. Some time into the night at around 9pm, a car pulled up and set off fireworks aimed at us, some of which hit my friend. My friend immediately ran to his car and chased after the perpetrators, with the rest of us following suit. Once we caught up to the car, we discovered two youths around 18/19 who were completely unapologetic. Well, my friend did not like that so took the rest of his fireworks in his car and snapped it in two to teach him a lesson. That was that - we parted ways, with the driver saying \"Enjoy your night lads\" with a very chilling smile.\n\nI had a bad feeling from that moment but remained in the park with my friends to continue the celebration stupidly, despite saying to my mates we should leave. Ten to twenty minutes later, around three cars pulled up with more fireworks and a whole bunch of youths with knives jumped out of the car and started to terrorize us. Me, wanting to protect my car, and not realizing what was going on, stupidly went forth to my car in an attempt to get to it and drive away. My best friend came with me for some stupid reason. The rest of my friends dispersed, running away. Once I got to my car, I jumped in and my hand was shaking so much that I dropped my keys in between the clutch and my car seat. I was frantically trying to reach it, and was making a bit of commotion so much so that the attackers noticed that my friend and I were in the car and beckoned the other attackers over. They proceeded to try to break the window, roaring at me to come outside. For some reason, God was on my side that night as my VW Polo windscreen and windows did not cave in. It was incredibly close - they were beating on the windows for close to 2 minutes and any longer it would have caved. One of them even had a gun they were brandishing - in the UK! Guns are illegal here. They must have run out of adrenaline and realised the police would be on route, so they ran off in a hurry.\n\nTwo of my mates got stabbed that day - one in the kidney, one in the neck with both surviving their injuries. But, it really could have gone left for me and I consider that night as the night I should have died. We messed with the completely wrong people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** video of my car the night it happened: https://imgur.com/a/Wbo6UCM",

Partly because he was embarrassed and partly because his paranoid friends liked to get him fired up. \n\nThe next weekend my neighbor sent me pictures of him in my alley with a gun, looking in my living room windows. If I was home that would have been a mess. \n\nThankfully posting the pictures on Instagram forced him to fall back. He doesn\u2019t live in the neighborhood any more.",
            "Sadly, my story is common among women. \n\nMy (now ex) husband wanted to see my phone one night in a drunk, jealous rage. And I said no. \n\nI saw the look in his eye; I was on our bed. I threw my phone at him and leapt up a split second before he lunged at me. I fell a couple times as I tried to run down the stairs and out the door. Unfortunately, our front door was locked, so in the time it took me to try and unlock the door, he managed to grab me and throw me down the hallway. \n\nOur (then) two year old son had woken up at that point and was screaming and crying on the landing of the floor above me as my ex started to strangle me. I remember thinking, as it went black, that this was the end and I hoped our son would be okay. \n\nI regained consciousness a few minutes later and got out the door. I called the police with a different phone and they showed up right as he was loading our son into a car seat to take off with him. \n\nHe was arrested and the police were very well versed on DV where I am. \n\nIt took me a few years to file for divorce with more violent outbreaks. My job requires spotless credit, and there was no way to pay the mortgage by myself. I sought out the free DV counseling provided by the state, finished my masters degree, negotiated for higher pay, refinanced\u2026and THEN left him. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this but thanks to the requirements of my job, I had no choice. I lived in fear for those years. \n\nI\u2019ve sought out counseling to deal with why I even put up with him from the start; he had a history of violence with women, even in childhood. And I\u2019m convinced that under his \u201cnice guy\u201d exterior that one day he will snap again.",
            "I was dating a girl who had a super jealous ex-boyfriend. I woke up one morning to the guy calling me on my phone. I answered it. It\u2019s the ex and he\u2019s breathing heavy and telling me he\u2019s gonna kill me. I\u2019m all \u201cwhatever man, quit calling me\u201d he tried calling again but I ignored it. 3-4 minutes later there\u2019s violent pounding on my apt. Door. Apparently the heavy breathing was due to him stalking towards my apt. From a distant parking lot. He is screaming about he\u2019s gonna kill me,telling me to come out. Well my neighbor across the hall, a older lady came out of her place clutching a baseball bat. She says \u201cget outta here or I\u2019m calling the cops\u201d\u201d I\u2019m watching this through my peep hole. Finally he turns and heads towards the front door of the building so I figured he was leaving. I run over to my floor level window in the living room to see him go and as I pull back the blinds I see him staring at me, inches from my face. He punches through the window at my face. Thankfully I have good reflexes and was able jump back to only get some glass embedded in my face. The guy rears back and jumps head first through the window he just broke with his fist. He\u2019s wearing a cowboy heat and a full length duster as if he planned on getting in my apt no matter what (I\u2019m not kidding) I\u2019m wearing shorts and nothing else as I had been woken up by all of this. He lands on the floor in a crouched position and I ran and jumped on his back trying to get my arm around his neck. He stands with my full weight on his back and starts backing into the shelving and walls really hard trying to knock me off of him. Pans were bent it was so violent. Finally when he slammed me into the wall the last time his chin came up and I was able to sink my arm around his neck tight. I then threw my body down and backwards and pulled. I was choking him so hard that his legs starting twitching after 7-10 seconds. I knew this meant he was out but wasn\u2019t sure if he was playing possum so I just choked harder the whole while  screaming \u201c HELP! CALL 911! HELP CALL 911!\u201d At the top of my lungs intermittently saying to the guy \u201cFUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU\u201d I then started thinking about not wanting to kill this guy. Even if that was his intent, I didn\u2019t want that on my conscious. So i let him breathe. When he finally snapped to he started trying to attack me again flailing his hand backwards, a hand with a piece of glass in it. So I had to choke him out again, Still screaming for 911. This happened 3-4 times before the police arrived. Thankfully the neighbor across the hall described us well and explained the situation so when they came in they just yanked him off of me as I was still on my back with my arm around the guys neck. He woke up in handcuffs.  As it all calmed down the first arriving officer comes back to me and says \u201c are you aware he defecated in his pants during this fight?\u201d I said No.  I\u2019m told \u201cthe guy says you squeezed the shit out of him and that he was here because you are on drugs\u201d I tell the officer that it\u2019s ironic to have a guy that jumped head first through a window to say someone else is on drugs. Fast forward through the PPO\u2019s and plea agreements and he was ultimately charged with 2nd degree home invasion and that was it.  He spent 3 years of a 5-10 in prison.. nice , huh? I fully believe that if I had not gotten the upper hand I wouldn\u2019t be here today typing this. I\u2019m not sure he would\u2019ve stopped to think \u201cI shouldn\u2019t kill another human\u201d.. Well that\u2019s my story.",
            "When I was almost 17 I was kidnapped by my friends boyfriend while I was at a Wendy's and when I tried to open the door to get out (he was fortunately very stupid and didn't use the safety locks for kids in the back seat of the truck) he threatened to kill all three of us (me, his gf, and another friend I was eating with when he took us). I obviously didn't jump out of the moving truck even though I didn't visually see the gun. He forced us back into my house where he raped my friend (his gf) in front of us as a threat. His gf was an innocent, abused party and I never blamed her for what happened. He made us watch while he took a baggie of cocaine out of his pocket and cut lines on my dresser, got super high and beat his gf. He tried to suffocate me with a beach towel he found in the closet but I managed to fight him off and he got bored of me and went back to torturing his gf. Somehow I managed to sneak to the kitchen and called my mom (if I was gonna die I wanted to say goodbye that's why I didn't call 911 first). My mom ended up calling the cops but the guy fled in his truck and when they did find him he got a slap on the wrist. My landlord claimed after that she had heard us yelling but yet she never sent help and just listened to what was happening. We were juniors in high school (2006) and the principal did expel this dude permanently. Last I knew about him as a teen was that his dad beat him senseless and tried to sue the school for the expulsion. Saw him a decade later at a bar with his wife but ran for my life and got the hell out of there immediately.\n\nETA the \"slap on the wrist\" punishment was being remanded to house arrest for the remainder of the school year. He wasn't allow to attend any school public or private in our area and his parents were forced to homeschool him. He was still allowed to go to work and stuff. For those wondering what the punishment was as far as his crimes. The county basically just said \"we don't want you\" and our private school headmistress fought back when the dad threatened to sue her. She basically flexed and said come at me bro because it was discretionary. She can choose not to have a student at her school. That she owned and funded privately through tuition not state funds.\n\nETA2 this occurred in Florida.",
            "When I was about 5-6 years old, my (ex) stepfather was extremely abusive. I wasn't allowed to eat dinner with them and would get locked into my room. He would threaten my mom by pointing a gun at her head (he was a cop). We were in that situation for about a year. Things reached breaking point when we had to lock ourselves into the bedroom and push the bed against the door because he walked around the house with a knife threatening us and cutting up any furniture and whatever else he could get his hands on. My granddad came over from our hometown with a moving truck the next day and we took whatever we could in that time while he was at work and left everything else behind. Unfortunately not the only abusive man we had in our lives but definitely the closest we got to death.",
            "I wasn't the surviver but I was the reason she survived.\n\nMom and Dad were getting a divorce but they were still living under the same roof. Dad was an alcoholic. one night he couldn't get a taxi back for some reason and begged my mom to come get him, she eventually agrees and goes to go get him. At this point I am asleep on the sofa after a long day. She picks him up and the whole car ride back he is saying to her 'when are you going to give me sex?' she obviously said no in responce. when they get home she goes into the kitchen he follows her, gets a knife, corners her and asks it again she says no, he slowly starts to push it into her, she starts screaming. the knife luckily chips one of her bone and stops it from going further into her. I wake up from the screaming and wrestle the knife from my dads hands, somehow manage to get it off him and call the police, we go across the road to a neighbours till the police arrive and take him away.\n\n\nafter that he was obviously no longer staying at home and got an apartment above a shop. one night before the trial he gets drunk and falls down the stairs leading to his apartment, can't get up and dies of internal bleeding.",
            "I\u2019m an older guy and this younger fellow, the son of one of my pals, was down on his luck. Couldn\u2019t find a steady job, bouncing around from job to job, etc. He was always a little odd but quiet and I invited him to stay with me rent free if he didn\u2019t mind taking care of stuff around the house. Mow the grass, help prepare food, minor maintenance, stuff like that. I\u2019m getting too old and my house is too big.\n\nHe agreed and things were fine for a while. We developed a good relationship - we\u2019d play chess every night, eat together. I tried to help him with job interviews and he held up his end of the bargain with the housework.\n\nI developed a pretty bad cataract in one eye and it was clearly bothering him. He\u2019d stare at it and his face would just go blank. He was always kind of odd but something changed in his demeanor. I caught him peeking his head in my room at night when he thought I was sleeping. He stopped eating with me and withdrew into his room. \n\nAfter about a week, I woke up in the middle of the night. I knew he was in my room but I couldn\u2019t see him. You know that 6th sense when you can just *feel* someone is by you? Suddenly, I\u2019m thrown from my bed and he is on top of me, trying to smother me with my own bed sheets. I screamed so loud the neighbors heard and called the police. I managed to get out of his grip, lock myself in the bathroom until the police arrived. \n\nScariest moment of my life. When they arrested him, he kept rambling about my eye, and voices in heaven and hell. Last I knew, he was in a mental health facility.",
            "Invited a drunk \"friend\" to sleep over at my place. Woke up to him raping me, when I resisted he choked me. I lost consciousness and he left me for dead. My case was rejected because it took me too long to report it and no forensic evidence could be taken and the court said that since I invited him I was supposed to expect something like this to happen.",

(Damnit).\n   He yelled at me then reached over and squeezed, I fought and fought until I watched my world fade away. I don't know how long I was gone. I woke up to him pounding on my chest with his fist and I sat straight up. He started to cry. \n   I lived with my abuser until I was 17. \n      This was the closest I came to my end.",

            "Not 100% it would've been an attempt but it sure felt like one. Some 2 decades ago my mother had a streak of boyfriends (yeah yeah OP's mom is a ho', and yes she is) and this one basically turned out to be a paranoia and drug-fueled psycho and parasite. He was ok for a while, lived with us and couldnt hold a job except a few IT things here and there like fixing or installing PCs (thats about all he could do). A few years down the line, my mother realised it was time to cut loose ends and that he was useless dead weight so she slowly started trying to usher him out.\n\nI was already getting sick of him as well, but being around 15 or so, there wasnt much i could do or say to a 30 year old moron that was a head taller than me beyond \"fuck off\". Except one day i made the mistake of laughing at him and taunting him on one of his off hand comments. It started off with him playing comedy and \"falling unconcious\" in the corridor. I saw him lie there, and then just left (i've fainted before when i was younger due to a lack of vitamins, and when it happens you're not comfortably laying on the floor, you're a mess of arms and legs bent like Peter Griffin after falling down the stairs) to go back to play on my PC. I could hear him get up, shuffle off and walk up to me asking \"didnt you hear me faint?\" to which i simply answered \"I did, and i dont care\".\n\nSo thats when the record scratch comes and you're starting to wonder how i got here, well here's the rest. He started spewing threats and other weak shit to which i had the stupid nerve to say \"Yeah, try me.\" Well the issue was, he did. I was sitting at my computer, my back facing him and he simply walked up to me and threw me on the floor and tried to beat me (he was really weak by then, probably trying to look miserable on purpose as he wasnt eating anymore). When he got off, i locked myself in my room, called my mom and packed a bag then basically ran away and we had to hide in a hotel for a few nights. Two days later, when we came back when he wasnt there, i noticed that i was **also** missing one of my hunting knives (i used to collect knives when i was a teen) from my wall, so thats when we basically decided it was time to call the cops and force him out.\n\nTurns out, that same night we left, the asshole came back and barricaded himself in our appartment by locking the door on all locks and bolts and the police had to break the door down and physically drag him out of there. Never found the knife, he even had the balls to blame it on me trying to set him up. I honestly wish i did think of that...but he dug his own grave on this one.\n\nLater we found out he also stole money and some jewelry from us, and while sadly he wasnt extradited back to his country...the thing that worries me the most and im still shocked it happened was that my mother, the fucking warrior she is, **DROVE** that fucking piss stain back on her own.\n\nSo yeah, Danny if you ever happen to read this: I hope you fucking die a slow, painful, lonely death, you useless piece of psychopathic trash. You're a waste of human flesh and dont even deserve people to remember you, and it pains me that i have to remember everything you did.",
            "Not sure if this counts as I wasn\u2019t the target, but just happened to be standing between the shooter and his target, but here goes:\n\nA kid in my middle school stole $20 from his gang banging brother. The banger decided that the proper punishment for that was death. So after school one day, the brother and his friend roll up, someone yelled, \u201cget down,\u201d and then all kinds of gunfire went off. I ducked when I heard get down, so I didn\u2019t see much of it, but several of the billets zipped right over my head.\n\nThey didn\u2019t jut anyone, thanks to whoever saw them coming and yelled. That night the brother just gave his  kid a black eye and that was that. Insane.",
            "Just some regular ole domestic violence. Step dad had gotten back on crack and my mom told him he had to leave, it was over. So he took a bunch of pills to OD and when that didn't gain him sympathy he went for regular murder. He was mostly trying to kill my mother but since I was in the way he didn't hesitate to throw gas on me either. I was 11. \n\nIt really wasn't the first time, I had seen him shoot at her years ago and lot of strangulation attempts but this was The Big One. Eventually his stupid ass threw fresh fuel on open flames (he was trying to burn the house down from the outside) and caught himself on fire. \n\nWe had to put the flames out ourselves because the volunteer firefighters weren't willing to get involved until the cops got there 45 minutes after I called to say our lives were in danger. Fucking pussies stayed back while my mother screamed and fought and put our fires by taking off her clothing to smother the flames. \n\n\nSo yeah. I was 13 when I stood up in court and ask that the judge give him consecutive sentences because he had a manslaughter charge he was dodging back home. He got 7 years and I got a nice case of PTSD.",
            "I wasn\u2019t going to comment because it will get buried but changed my mind. I will add to the pile domestic abuse. \n\nMy ex is a 6\u20193\u201d 300 lb chef. Former football player. He thinks he has behavioral problems from so many concussions and so much head trauma. I agree. \n\nBy the time this happened, we were in the middle of a breakup I had initiated. I was sleeping in the spare bedroom, he came home wasted. He woke me up and demanded I sleep in the bed with him. I\u2019m a lot smaller than him and was a little scared of him, even though he\u2019d never been violent. I complied. He passed out, I couldn\u2019t sleep so I was texting my girlfriend from work, trying to make a plan to leave. He woke up, saw me texting, and flipped out. He was completely naked. I was in pajamas. I jumped up and ran out of the room, grabbing my contact lenses and makeup bag and nothing else. I ran downstairs, he caught me at the front door. He picked me up by my neck and held me against the wall, alternatively strangling me and bashing the back of my head against the wall.\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what happened, but he dropped me, I was able to crawl through his legs and run out the front door. \n\nThis was February in the Rocky Mountains. I ran to the neighbor\u2019s house (H, another friend who was also his coworker, and who knew we were breaking up and how his temper could be). He tried to break into her back doors. He failed. We didn\u2019t call the police that night for a lot of reasons, but I did go to the police next day to get a restraining order. They declined to help me. This was a well known and well loved guy in our tiny town; I left after being told it was a \u201cone off\u201d and he needed to \u201cget it out of his system\u201d. I had strangulation marks on my entire neck and popped blood vessels in my eyes. They told me to get some rest and to try not to antagonize him. \n\nHe moved out and I stayed in the house. He began to stalk me. Like I said, it was a very small resort town, not much more than a mile square. My friends would call me and tell me where he was so I could avoid him. His friends, who had formerly been my friends, would see me on the street and call me all kinds of horrible names. He called me incessantly. One day, driving around with H, the calls came one after another. I had over 100 missed calls from him in under an hour. She said it was time to get a restraining order. We went to the police, showed them the call log, and I was able to petition to get a restraining order. They told me I\u2019d also have to press charges for the assault, and made it seem like I probably shouldn\u2019t because it would hurt his career. I did. The DA (who was later charged with DV and financial abuse against his wife) wouldn\u2019t charge him with attempted murder, although all parties agreed that was his intent, his defense argued successfully that he was \u201cnot of sound mind\u201d because he was drunk and therefore did not mean to try to kill me. He plead out and got his guns taken away and had to go to 40 hours of anger management classes. He got his guns back legally after 90 days and my order of protection against him expired after one year. \n\nHe moved out of the country not long after we went to court. After he left, he never tried to contact me again. He lives back in the states now, is married and has a food truck in the Midwest. I don\u2019t wish him ill but I certainly don\u2019t wish him well, I just hope he continues to leave me alone. This morning I found out a good friend of his is an investor in a business I\u2019m involved with through work. I just let me boss know that I can\u2019t be involved in the project anymore. I don\u2019t think I am in any danger, but you can never be too sure. I\u2019ll always be scared of him. \n\nAs a fun (~s) aside, my friend H moved to my city about 5 years ago, which was about 4 years after the incident. She asked me if I still talked to him. I was shocked, of course. I told her no, he had tried to kill me, you were there. Her response was \u201cthat\u2019s not how I remember it. Y\u2019all need to bury the hatchet. Just let that shit go.\u201d I have not spoken to her since.",
            "Not quite an attempt, but an intent. \n\nI was about 11 years old. My father l, brother and I,  lived off the grid in the northwest US. No electricity. No running water, and a gas cooktop. A small camp trailer.\n\nOur living room was outside around the campfire. My brother and I slept outside mostly. \n\nMy father was a drunk. He had a bad habit of sleeping with women who were married to people who were not him. In this case she had moved \"in\" with us. \n\nUsually what would happen is that we would all go to the bar. My brother and I would sit outside while my father drank. \n\nI had hurt myself cutting wood in a way that is not pleasant to describe.  I could not attend the bar with them today so I stayed back in camp. \n\nThe man who was married to the woman who was living with us discovered where we were.  He was not a nice person and came to the camp with murderous intent. \n\nIn the camp was a picnic table that had a plastic tablecloth on it.  Timothy was long enough to cover where you couldn't see underneath it from the sides.  You could however see underneath it from the end. \n\nI saw him pull up and I saw that he had a gun, so I hid underneath the picnic table.  He was very drunk.\n\nHe was certain that my father and his wife were there and were hiding so he fired some rounds off into the bushes.  All the while screaming about the things they were doing and whatever.  I was terrified obviously\n\nHe came to the table, placed the gun on the table and sat down at the table.  He seemed to be determined to stay and wait them out. \n\nAll the while I am underneath the table holding my breath. Trying not to move knowing that if he found me he would kill me. \n\nHe ranted stood back up. Walked to the road. Came back sat back down. I heard the clump  of the gun back on the table. \n\nAfter some time he finally got up, got back in his truck and left. \n\nNeedless to say, I had quite a bit of trauma in my childhood.

He was enraged from a high speed wreck he had in front of the store. Carrying a broom and a knife he had grabbed while in the restaurant, he caught me off guard and wrapped his arm around my neck and dragged me to where the whole lobby can see and shouts \"this boy's gonna die tonight!\" An off duty cop happens to be in the lobby and begins somehow trying to negotiate or something while women are screaming and running. The man dragged to the back of the store in a corner where he forces me to lay directly on top of his body and he shouts demands to the cop. He told me to scream out for help. He halfass fish hooked me and fake eye gauged me. This smeared his blood all over my face. Eventually I see a swat team has shown up and they are peeking through the shelves with big guns. For a brief moment, my captor had to rearrange his grip on the knife so I took a risk and disarmed him with a quick hand twist and slid away between a nearby officers legs. He was shot 3 times immediately and I ran outside...the whole thing lasted 35-45 minutes",

It's not a crime to be friends with a criminal, so one would have to prove that they had some foreknowledge of what was going to occur, and were not just nearby when their friend did something stupid.\n\nWhile I think everyone knows that's far fetched, it's difficult to prove and there's no strong evidence to prove otherwise, and we cannot prove they ever handled the gun either.\n\nWhen people take plea deals, the likelihood of conviction comes into play. Because they might have been acquitted in a trial for attempted murder, they were offered a plea down to 2nd degree assault with a weapon which they accepted.\n\nThe prosecutor did have a conversation with me before she offered the plea, but made it clear that the state does the prosecution, not the victim.\n\nWhen statues of George Floyd went up, I could not stop imagining how livid I would be had statues been erected to one of my assailants.

            "I woke up to the sound of my mom screaming. In one motion I jumped out of bed and into some shorts. I opened the door to find my ex standing *right* there with blood on his white shirt. I asked what happened as I pushed past him towards my mother's room. He said \"she fell\" and those were the last words I ever heard him say. \n\nAs soon as my back was fully turned to him (coward), he started hitting me on the head with a solid steel object.

The second one drove past me, but stopped down the street so I knew they were calling 911. I guessed they were probably too scared to get out - fair enough!

            "This is probably one of the only things I've ever had a story to tell for on here.\n\nI was maybe 3 or 4 years old, very young. I typically refer to this event as my first significant memories as a child. As when looking back, it's essentially the first thing that I can recall from my early childhood years.\n\nThere was this young Preteen/teenage kid who used to come around and hang out at my place and talk to my parents and \"play\" with me. He lived down the street to the left of my house, maybe 4/5 houses. I didn't see him very often but he would come around. Apparently he actually lived out of state but would come back over to where I lived every so often.\n\nWell, there was this day during the summer when my parents had set up a swimming pool in our back yard. One of the Blue ones with the puffy dark blue rims around the top of the edge of it. I was playing in the pool by myself at the time, because it wasn't all that deep, I could reach my feet to the floor if needed and hold myself above water but was really enjoying floating around.\n\nFrom a distance I could see the kid referenced before walking towards my house/me from down the street. He was cutting through yards and made a direct line towards where I was. He was pretty close after a minute or so and started yelling \"can I swim with you\" etc. My dad was always at work when I was this age and my mom was, not very reliable, she had drug problems, alcohol issues, a lot of other things I did not know about. So needless to say, she was not the most attentive.\n\nHe came up and got into the pool with me, and everything was fine for 30 minutes or so. My mom had apparently seen he was in the pool with me at some point by looking out at us through the patio window but didn't think anything of it and let us be.\n\nAfter that point, I don't have much recollection of the specifics of what happened. I remember him asking me to have a \"hold your breath\" contest to see who could hold our breath the longest. So I went once or twice, he went once or twice, and I finally went one more time, but on that last time he decided to hold me under. I felt his hand wrap around the back of my neck and hold me down under the water, as I started to panic and not know what to do, he was shoving his penis into my mouth. He was holding me under the water and drowning me while doing this. I don't remember much outside of this.. I have very detailed memories of the experience itself and then everything just being black. I remember this intense feeling of helplessness and fear and the physical sensations of him holding me down under the water and, well, doing what he did.\n\nI came to with my mom freaking out screaming and crying and my neighbor holding me over his knee on the ground. My understanding is that he was either a firefighter or an EMT of sorts, not sure exactly but I was told he probably saved my life that day. He had seen what was happening from next door. There was maybe 40/50 ft of distance between my house and that neighbors house. When he came over to help, I was already unconscious and as he was coming over the kid had ran off and left/ran away.\n\nHe was never held accountable for anything. After it happened, my parents went to talk to his parent/s or whatever they were, legal guardians, over at the house down the street from us, and they said he wasn't there and that he had gone back to whatever state he lived in. It ended up being a situation where it was nearly impossible for us to do anything legally for some reason. I don't know why.\n\nFlash forward, years later as I was entering 5th grade. The kid who had done all of that to me was maybe 14 or 16 and was in 8th grade, he hadn't been there the years prior and had shown up for the final year back from the other state he had stayed in. He walked through the hallway by the cafeteria one day and as soon as I saw him I had this visceral reaction that completely overwhelmed me with fear. I yelled out at him, and said something like \"YOU, YOURE THE ONE WHO TRIED TO KILL ME\" and of course everyone probably looked at me like I was crazy.. everyone around me and my friends at the time didn't know what I was talking about. He kept walking, (assuming he was on his way to a class) and looked back at me but he was grinning at me.\n\nA day or two later I had come across him again and directly confronted him and he denied all of it, he denied even knowing who I was and said he had just moved here from out of state to finish his last year of school. None of my other schoolmates knew who he was before this, and he got along really well with everyone at the school, the teachers and students and what not. So I was treated like a lunatic over the whole situation.. I basically just resigned myself to pretending it never happened and having to spend an entire year of school walking around in the same halls as him and seeing him constantly. He would always randomly look at me and smile/wave or single me out by coming up to me, knowing I would be intimidated and then talk to someone who was right besides me at the last second..\n\nMy time in school for that period was hell.. the whole experience was.\n\nSorry if this is somewhat disjointed, it gets really hard to talk/think about the more I dwell on it.  \n\n\nEdit: I know I said I was entering 5th grade, but I feel like that's not right as it doesn't line up very well with the age gap between us at the time of the event occurring, I know for a fact I was 3 or 4 years old. So when he had joined up at the school, I know for certain that he was in 8th grade, I don't know exactly what age he was, he may have been held over a year, not sure. I want to say that it was somewhere between me being in 3rd grade to 5th grade, I'm not entirely sure on the details of which grade it was I was in at the time. I also corrected because I misspoke on his age at the time, saying he was 17 or 18 in 8th grade, which obviously is not right because 8th graders are typically about 13/14. So that's the age he would have been around that time and I edited it to reflect that change.",
            "I was a jail guard. Lots of drugs and weapons were being brought into the facility. As a security measure, the white shirts imposed harsh rules and restrictions (ex. random frisk searching, limit to phone calls and pleasurable activities). It was my job to enforce these mandates.\n\nThis pissed off the inmates. They decided to show their own level of force and planned the murder of the biggest officer and started a unit riot. 7 inmates had attacked me at once knocking me unconscious immediately. Once unconscious an inmate put me in a choke while the other 6 beat the shit out of me. I somehow survived but am now housebound and unable to drive.

He was also using some of her stronger medications for recreational use.\n\nMe and my best friend and a couple of others staged a rescue one day and got her out of there whilst he was being distracted by the others ( me and bestie physically picked her up and got her in the car and drove off) because she was not acting herself and was sicker than she should be.

            "Not an attempt, but I went on a date with a serial killer between murders. He was the scariest person I've ever seen, he went from nice and personable to rage in two seconds.

Suddenly once we were alone and I didn't want to hook up (it was first date,  and that is not my thing), I thought I would have to fight for my life, but something made him let me go. \n\nHe later murdered another woman, burned her car and her body was found with his first victim's body. The first woman had been missing for 10 years. \n\nHe's in jail for life. I feel so guilty and sorry for those women.\n\nEdit: words",
            "Not really a \u201cmurder\u201d but on deployment I was shot at by a \u201csniper\u201d. My buddy and I were on post. Our whole platoon was at a small patrol base and we were getting ready to be replaced and move towards the south to meet up with our company. The new unit was coming in and I went to radio the last truck coming in. They had their IED jammer on still so it blocked our \u201cblack gear\u201d radio. Right after I put the radio down and told my buddy that we were jammed still, I leaned against the open window and I hear a loud pop and dirt hits my face. I get down and my buddy sees a guy out next to an old compound. Then a truck drove over, picked up the dude, and they left. Afterwards we checked and a sandbag was exploded. If the shot was up 3 inches it would have hit under my armpit and I would probably would be dead. I still have the sandbag that saved my life.\n\nFunny thing is, the week before we were adding new sandbags to that post. We had to carry them across the outpost and I was complaining. I literally said \u201cwhy are we doing this? Sandbags can\u2019t stop a bullet\u201d. Sandbags can stop bullets, or at least break them up.",

            "The Versailles wedding hall disaster.\n\nIt was a fairly lucrative event hall in Jerusalem. The contractor who built the hall cut some corners and it was not up to specs, in particular, they misused a newly invented building material called Pal-kal.

            "Imaging guy here. I have a million of these, I work with vascular patients and wounds. Had a guy whose foot was completely broken sideways at the ankle. he had it still wrapped from when he left the hospital. He would use the stumpy part to move around on his wheelchair and leave little blood sponge prints on the floor. \n\nAnother guy with bad ankle and foot wounds decided to stop going to wound care, and was afraid to take the wraps off even after his foot started to stink. By the time I saw him his skin had kinda liquified. \n\nEarlier on in my career I saw a guy with necrotizing wounds to both legs that had eaten to muscle in multiple places below the knee. I asked him how long they looked like that and he said about two years. Next time I saw him he was bilateral above knee amp. \n\nStump wounds. Just... Stump wounds. \n\nTake care of your feet people. If you're diabetic and can't feel the bumps and scrapes please check your feet regularly.",
            "Former medic here. Called to a patient who had cut their leg while chopping wood about a week prior and now it was really itchy. Old gentleman, didn\u2019t drive, lived alone. Got to his house, unwrapped the ungodly swollen leg to find that he\u2019d tried to superglue the wound closed and maggots had commenced to growing inside. The itching he was feeling was the writhing maggots under his skin.",

Guy had several clots in his lungs and legs. Undiagnosed atrial fibrillation. He couldn't believe we were going to amputate, kept asking me what else I could do.  \n\n\nGo back in time a week ago and come in.  Kinda around when it turned blue.",
            "Doctor here, might be a bit late and will probably be buried but had a 65 year old dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma 8 months before we saw him. He lived an hour out of the city and didn't want to drive in for treatment so decided he wouldn't get treated at all and stayed on his little remote place in the country by himself. \n\nEssentially, because it didn't get treated, it spread along his skin and his neighbors called an ambulance when popping in on him. \nIt had spread so far that it essentially went from his head to his knees. It had started to invade his eyes and mouth membranes. He couldn't drink and could barely see. His skin had started to slough off and he was so severely dehydrated because he was losing so much excess fluid from his open skin that we had to treat him like a severe burns patient and had plastics involvement. \n\nThe consultant said if he had received treatment, there was a chance he could have recovered. Instead he died 3 weeks later.",

            "Years ago as a nursing assistant on an oncology floor we had a guy admitted because he had had an erection for several days and had lost the ability to pee. His bladder was close to bursting and his poor junk was... think microwaved hotdog. Really bad. \n\nBut NONE of that was as interesting as the fact that this guy had untreated skin cancer on his nose for several years that had over time become infected, developed MRSA, and spread across his face. He had no nose, no cheek, and no eye on one side of his face, and was starting to lose his other eye. You could see part of his fucking skull. I dont know why he chose to leave it untreated and I have no idea how long it took to get that bad, but I will never ever forget the smell and texture of his rotting face. \n\nOn the upside, we were eventually able to convince him to have reconstructive surgery. He ended up getting a skin graft that covered up his eye, nose and cheek. So, if you ever meet a very grumpy dude with nothing but a mouth and one eye, know that this is way better than the alternative.",
            "This has happened a few times, actually... \n\nBut I had a gal come in on Monday after being discharged from the hospital Friday after giving birth.  \n\nSo basically, we tell ladies to avoid intercourse until a doctor clears you, and well, her spouse kept insisting and insisting and insisting that Friday night she caved and let him go to town. He wound up tearing some stitches that were placed and bleeding like a stuck hog all weekend long. \n\nCame into our clinic, blue in the lips and fingers, and her hemoglobin was 4 (normal should be 12 - 15). \n\nShe didn't wanna be a bother, so she waited until she started feeling dizzy all the time. She got another trip to the hospital for transfusion and repair for that. \n\nBut...like I said, this isn't the first time I've seen that, so for the love of God...if homeboy is begging for it after you just had a baby, maybe he needs a lesson in self control and a bottle of moisturizer.",
            "Once had an older lady call in wanting a prescription for pain meds because she was sure she had shingles.  Said her neighbor had them and she was sure that\u2019s what it was. She hadn\u2019t been in for an exam in almost 2 years, so the doctor asked that she come in to be evaluated before a prescription could be given. She refused and called again the next day asking for a prescription.  This went on all week.  Her calling for pain meds, the doctor asking her to come in to be seen.  She finally agreed to make an appointment.  It wasn\u2019t shingles.  It was a skin ulceration from advanced breast cancer. :(",

It had been progressing over the last several years. But, if she didn\u2019t get diagnosed with breast cancer, then she couldn\u2019t have it. In the other category I\u2019ve seen a few cases of Fournier\u2019s Gangrene. Pretty much obese, male diabetics that had a pimple/sore that started in the pubic region. By the time they come to the hospital it\u2019s a raging infection where the treatment is basically to cut away everything in the pubic/ groin region down to the muscle layer. That little sore didn\u2019t seem like much at first.",
            "Not a doctor/hospital staff, but my grandpa ended up passing away because he waited too long before going to the hospital. This was about 17 years ago, he was tending to one his mules when something spooked it and he got kicked in the gut. He was in a lot of pain, could barely move due to the abdominal pain so decided to take it easy and lounge on the couch for a week, he refused to go to be taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, that mule kick ruptured an unknown tumor in his intestines. The doc said it was huge, like volleyball size huge, and he may have survived if he came in sooner. By the time we got him to the hospital he had a severe case of gangrene. His leg needed to be amputated within a day of him being there, he passed away a week later.",
            "We once had a patient who went to Emergency for abdominal pain and they discovered a fungating breast wound (don't image search that) that she'd had for two years and hadn't gotten medical attention for.

            "I am a doctor and while working in A&E we had an older chap, possibly in his 70s, who several days prior to presentation had a sudden onset severe chest pain and vomiting while loading the car with shopping. He ignored it and struggled home.\nThe next day he started to lose the use of both legs and by the time he came to hospital had been CRAWLING around his house for SEVERAL DAYS because he thought it would get better.\n\nHe had had a major cardiac event, developed a clot which his heart had pumped out, it went down his body, broke in half and blocked off the blood supply to both legs. He literally had dead legs.\n\nI don't know what ended up happening to him, but there was no way to save the legs and I reckon the outcome was very poor, if not fatal.\n\n\nEdit because there is a lot of USA assumption going on: this is in the UK where healthcare is free-at-point-of-access, so debt is not a contributing concern for our patients.",
            "Children\u2019s nurse here, my first week in paediatric ED we had a young girl (6/7) come in with a really swollen jaw/face.  Poor girl was unable to move her jaw without intense pain and hadn\u2019t been able to eat for several days.

            "Obligatory \"not a doctor\", but I have a story about myself.\n\nI got really sick really fast, but didn't realize it. I had stage 4 burkitts leukemia cns positive, which is very important to know. Less than 100 people my age will get that cancer each year in the USA, so pretty uncommon. \n\nAnyway, I got super sick just over a year ago, and just happened to have a doctors appointment scheduled. Went to the appointment and felt like absolute trash, sweaty, hot, lethargic, light headed, terrible heartburn, and just tired. Also could barely breathe. My dad who was driving me to the appointment had to wake me up and I remember him saying \"get up fatass, we have a doctors appointment to get to, you better be fucking sick!\" \n\nIn his defense, he had no idea and neither did I just how sick I was, as 2 weeks before I was fine, working in South Carolina on a construction job.\n\nSo we get to the appointment and I get bloodwork and an ultrasound of my chest cavity. The doctor saw the ultrasound photos and was stunned. Then saw my bloodwork and told me to get the fuck back to the hospital, as we left to go home and would hear the results later. Doctor saw 7 tumors on my liver, the biggest on the size of a grapefruit and the second largest the size of a baseball, and then saw my bloodwork was trashed. Diagnosed me with cancer and said it was a miracle I was awake, let alone walking and cracking jokes. Only found out later that burkitts cell can double in size within 24-48 hours. \n\nDoc wondered why I hadn't had problems with my monster tumors before since I only scheduled the appointment to fix heartburn.\n\nTl;dr: i made a doctors appointment for heartburn, got diagnosed with super cancer",
            "Obligatory Not a doctor.   \n\n\nI was sitting in a hostel with an emergency nurse and an emergency doctor that had just found out that while they worked on different continents, they did similar work. We were happily chatting along and this older guy walks in. He overhears that they're in the medical field and comes up to see if he can ask a question. He shows them his leg, that's got large black spots on it everywhere below the knee. Both the nurse and the doctor look at it and immediately go \"you have to go see emergency services. That leg is necrotic, you'll loose the leg if not your life\" and the guy goes \"Ha, that's what my doctor back home said too. But the leg feels fine, I'd know if it was dying. You are wrong. Besides, i'm not gonna ruin my vacation by seeking medically treatment. \", which left me wondering why he asked in the first place. He goes to sit at the bar and over the course of the evening both the nurse and the doctor leave the table to try to get this guy to understand that he may not have 10 days until he's back home, that he needs to have this looked at NOW without success.  \n\n\npretty sure that if that guy made it to a hospital, they asked themselves that question.",

            "I work in Orthopedics, a very common occurrence is a patient is told to follow up within the week (we like to see fractures between 5-7 days) and the patient will call on the 6th day and say \"I broke something and need to be seen tomorrow\". This is frustrating because we very rarely have the ability to get a patient in next day, and if they had called the day of or the day after then we definitely could have gotten them seen. \n\nBUT my number one \"why didn't you come in sooner?!\" moment was getting a call from a patient who had broken their forearm *two months ago* and never followed up. I got them scheduled, they no showed their appointment. Rescheduled, they no showed. Second reschedule, they arrive with a very obvious deformity to their arm due to the fracture healing incorrectly. If they had just come in, it wouldn't have been an issue at all. Blows my mind that they went almost three months without care.",

            "Patient here. For six months in 2014 I complained to my family doctor that it felt like I swallowed a super ball and it had gotten stuck and that walking to the mailbox and back caused me such labored breathing that I needed a ten minute break to catch my breath. I was also coughing up quite a bit of blood from time to time. He was getting annoyed by my complaining and would just keep prescribing steroids. He told me that because I was fat and a smoker that I needed to accept that I had COPD and that was going to be my life from now on. I finally said \"look send me for whatever type of test will look that far into my throat and if it comes back as nothing I will stop complaining.\" Three weeks later I had a sonogram and they asked ne to stay for another test and then they started freaking out and said I had to go from the testing facility to the ER in an ambulance. Their hospital refused to see me so they sent me to a different one that also refused to see me. We still had no clue as to what was going on. I finally get taken to my current hospital/medical center and they tell me I need emergency surgery to try and remove the cancer tumor that is growing inside my airway. I only had 4mm (a coffee stirrer) to breathe through. Had I not made that deal and had just accepted that not breathing was my new normal I would have only lived another week or two. My family got a new family doctor. I was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 cancer, throat, lungs and spine in April of 2015. I am losing my fight though and started Home hospice two weeks ago. I put up a good fight and I am so thankful that I didn't die in 2014.",

            "I was working as a surgical junior when my team was called down to A&E to see a patient who had come in with a complication from a recent hernia operation. When we came down, we saw that the patient was holding a plastic bag over their abdomen. When this was removed, we found that their wound had opened and their intestine was visible to the air. It transpired that this was not something that had happened over night, it had taken several days. The patient had started using plastic bags and newspaper to dress the wound when they ran out of dressings.\n\nEdit: Addendum - because this is getting a lot of views, I must stress that this case was exceptionally uncommon, and an example of what happens when someone does not seek medical attention when it is obviously required. In general, hernia operations are very common and very safe; that being said, if you have any surgical procedure and you are not certain the wound is healing properly, you must seek medical attention.",
            "Not a doctor or nurse, but worked as a doctor's office assistant. A regular patient, who was very sweet but unfortunately had an ongoing battle with alcoholism, was brought in by his roommate and I knew instantly that he would be dead soon. I'd seen some jaundiced humans in my time there but this man was a yellow I never knew was possible. His roommate said, through tears, \"I've been telling him to come in for weeks!\" and the patient kept telling roomate to relax, that he was fine. Majorly in denial. I helped him to the exam room and when the doctor entered the room, he immediately asked me to go call an ambulance.\n\nA few weeks earlier wouldn't have helped, but perhaps the end could have been made bit easier for him. He died 7 days later in the hospital.\n\nHit me very hard because I'd known the guy for a few years. Sometimes he would be sober when he called, and sometimes he would be slurring and completely incoherent, but he was ALWAYS kind.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for sharing your stories of loved ones who struggled with alcoholism. I've read every comment, and she'd a few more years at how many of you know someone who had such similar stories. Something has to change with the culture around drinking. If you find yourself wondering if someone will be saying these things about you someday, talk to someone. An unbiased friend, or family member. Be honest with your doctor.  And if anyone ever tells you they want to quit drinking, be supportive.",

My whole right side is totally numb. \n\nBut, I think, it's midterms week, and I probably just need to sleep it off and it'll be fine. Right? So I go to bed, wake up for my 8am, and the numbness is all worse.

It's too expensive!\" -- I get it. Dental insurance is NOT insurance. It's a discount program you pay for, or it's a benefit from your employer. In this instance, the patient had state medical and dental coverage -- it covered all exams, fillings, and extractions. He still didn't come in until it was really bad. He didn't pay a dime for the care he received. I also worked in my residency seeing 90% medicaid patients. The other 10% were charity cases. I am acutely aware of the problems with cost for dentistry and access to care. Blame the insurance companies, not the dentist. \n\nIf you are looking for cheaper dental care, look into dental schools and Federally Qualified Health Centers. The former works at \\~50% private practice fees. The latter works on sliding scales. In the meantime, DO WHAT YOU CAN TO PROTECT YOUR TEETH. Dollar store has toothbrushes and toothpaste. Actually use them. A VAST majority of dental problems can be prevented with adequate oral hygiene. Cut out soda from your diet, get rid of energy drinks, don't live off of candy and cookies. Get in at LEAST once a year for an exam.",

We expected to go and help this person to their feet and maybe get a refusal, or transport them to the hospital based on an assessment. When we arrived on scene, a cop was there along with a neighbor who told us it was really bad in there. The second I walked through the door of the house, the smell hit me. I have smelled many dead decaying bodies that were not this pungent. We walk into the living room to find a man laying on the floor of his living room saying he could not get up. His legs were wrapped in what appeared to be plastic wrap and plastic bags. You could see the wrappings filled and dripping with brown liquid. The guy said he had started gettin sores on his feet and rather then go to a doctor, he elected to just wrap them up in plastic wrap. I don\u2019t know how long he had been doing this but it had reached a point where he could no longer gather the strength to get up and he was extremely septic. It was HORRIBLE. We carried him out of the house and I was down at the legs and the gangrene juice was dripping all over me. The back of the ambulance smelled like death for days. We dropped him off at the hospital and I went outside and puked. I see nasty shit every day but this was by far the nastiest.  When they took the wrappings off in the ED, the nurses told me both his legs were completely black and rotten up to the knees.  They had to amputate both legs up to the hip and they found the gangrene went up into his pelvis so they had to transfer him out for more surgery. I don\u2019t know if he lived but if he had just gone to the doctor when it started he would have probably just found out he had diabetes and been given medication and lived many more years with two functioning legs.",
            "Had an older female patient come in for abnormal labs secondary to extreme diarrhea. Her potassium was critically low and all of her other labs were out of whack. Turns out she had been having at least 5 totally liquid stools for SIX WEEKS before she sought out any treatment. Three days of that nonsense and I would've been in urgent care. \n\nHer poor, poor butt. Totally red and excoriated. Everytime I had to clean her up I could only think of the scene in P&R where Chris says \"Stop. Pooping.\" in the mirror.",
            "Not a doctor but medical physicist. About 12 years ago I was asked to look at and give advice on a lady who had a very slow growing tumour on their nose. A  Basel cell carcinoma. Usually not much of an issue as if caught early can be cut off with surgery and that's it or a short course of radiotherapy.\n\nTurns out this lady was quite vain, and as soon as the lump had started to grow she hid it under a scarf. She ended up hiding it for 20 years. By the time it was seen by any medical professional the tumor had taken over most of her nasal cavity, had crushed 1 eye, deformed her whole face, and grown inbetween all the nerves and blood vessels. It was inoperable and there was very little you could do with radiotherapy without doing alot of damage to everything else.\n\nSuch a shame as it would have been so easy to fix 20 years ago. Please get lumps and random bleeding checked out",

            "I'm not a doctor, but a patient, does my story count? so for a long time I've been feeling out of breath doing physical activities and I thought it was because I was out of shape, then at one point I started coughing a lot and I continued to ignore it until I started having chest pains. I went to the doctor and they did an xray and the entire left half of my lung was filled with fluid. There is a lining outside the lung called the pleural lining and the space inbetween is called pleural space. A condition called pleural effusion can occur where fluid fills up that space. usually it happens due to injuries to the ribcage, pneumonia, TB, cancer, etc. But the doctor had not seen something as serious as mine and called his colleagues to come take a look and used me as an example of a severe pleural effusion. I was sent to emergency, a CT was taken and they discovered a bunch of tumors in my pleural lining. Then I had a biopsy and turned out I had stage 4 lung cancer. I was 33 :S In the initial surgery they drained out 2.5 Litres of fluid from my left lung, imagine having 2.5 L of fluid in your lung thats bigger than a big bottle of pop, and not going to the doctor.",

            "My grandparents lived in a remote corner of WA State, an hour away from the nearest piddley small-town \u2018hospital\u2019. Grandpa had been recovering from bladder cancer and became dependent on pain medicine. Grandma and my aunt were doing their best to care for him at home. They told the doctor about the issues with his pain meds and they tapered him off. After a few weeks, he began asking for more pills again. The complaining got worse and worse. Grandma assumed that he was just trying to get more drugs. It took a month or two of telling him \u2018no\u2019 before they gave in and brought him back to the hospital. Turns out the cancer had returned, aggressively. He did develop a dependence on the pills, but he had also been in agonizing pain the whole time he\u2019d been at home. By this point there was nothing that could be done, and he passed away very quickly. There was a tremendous amount of grief in the family. Nobody blamed grandma and my aunt, they did the best they could in the circumstances. But they felt a lot of guilt, and there was probably some underlying resentment toward them. The family has really not recovered, or even gotten all together since except for grandma\u2019s funeral.",
            "I once worked in a dermatology and rheumatology ward and while the patient themselves didn't wait too long, they came from a nursing home. They were admitted the night before I came on and they had a bed sore on their sacrum (just above their ass) that was so large you could fit your *fist* inside it and not touch the sides. I'm talking up to your wrist. They also had bed sores on the hips, heels and shoulders. We had to order in a special sci-fi hoverbed for them to try to help them (the only time in my life I've seen that machine be necessary - it *is as cool as you think, by the way*). They were in so much pain that they were kept sedated at all times, too. It was a nightmare trying to fix them, but eventually we managed to get them down to minimal wounds and they were discharged back to the nursing home.\n\nWithin a month she was back and they were WORSE than before. She died in hospital. If they'd actually cared for them properly or admitted her to hospital earlier, she'd have lived.",

We tried brushing her hair to reach her scalp, but her hair was matted so badly we couldn't. We had to get permission from the family to cut her hair so we could do the test. As her nurse that shift, I was given medical shears and told to get to work. As soon as I started cutting the matted section of hair began peeling back in one piece and I realized it was, at one time, a wig that had essentially dreadlocked with her natural hair over the course of MANY years. After I cut this matted rug of real/fake hair off her head a few bonus goodies fell on the sheets in the form of mummified dead bugs. I gagged.",

Went in and talked to the patient aswell as examined him. The lump had trumbled him putting on his pants for a couple of months. He hadent shown his wife or no one els. I could instantly see that it wasnt a hernia as suspected, but a giant tumor with several lymphatic metastases, found around 5.

            "Not a doctor or nurse but someone who was lectured on how I should have acted much sooner.\n\nIt was at around 1 AM and I started to have very intense stomach pains, I mean absolutely crippling pain.

I honestly thought I was just having GERD/IBS issues and making it worse with my mind.\n\nFinally around 4 hours later I called an Uber and took it to the hospital. The triage nurse took one look at me and asked if I was having chest pains and took me right back. She took my blood pressure right away and took an EKG and it was within moments of having the EKG I was being rushed into surgery. There I was screaming that I was going to die. About seven hours later I woke up in the Cardiac ICU after having two stents put in my heart and was told I had a widowmaker heart attack and they weren't sure how the hell I survived waiting as long as I did. \n\nThe funny (or sad thing actually) is that the first time that I actually didn't think I was having a heart attack due to my panic attacks was when I had my heart attack.

            "Nad but patient. I got my period but it wouldn't stop. On week 3.5 I was feeling ill (kinda nauseated and light headed) so my boyfriend, now husband, drove me to a walk in.  Walk in takes me pretty quickly and the dr immediately takes my blood pressure. He does it once, frowns, does it again, calls the nurse and goes this blood pressure cuff I think is broken lets take her to exam room 3. We go in, he checks my blood pressure again and goes this cant be right. My husband asks what is happening hes like has she fainted at all he goes no why? The dr calls the nurse in again and goes to me your blood pressure is so low how you are even conscious is a miracle, we need to call an ambulance. So I do not know if it was the blood loss or just my twisted sense of humor but I go omg its like the movie death becomes her and start laughing my ass off while denying an ambulance and insisting my husband drives me to the ER. The dr asks which hospital and I had to sign an ama. We go to the hospital I check in and they immediately rush a stretcher out and im taken right away as the walk in dr called to give them a heads up.  Long story short,  it was a ruptured cyst along with the start of a very long journey with pcos that messed up my hormones and stopped my body from stopping my period. Total disconnection between my brain and uterus I guess.  I was hours away from needing a transfusion and drs had no idea how I stayed awake let alone did not need a transfusion given the amount of blood loss.  So far I've been very blessed to have two kids naturally (drs weren't optimistic) but also had 3 surgeries and a bout of stage 1 ovarian cancer (surgically removed because the cyst grew around the tumor so cyst finally came in handy somewhere). The worst part is you think I learn my lesson but it happened again and its like I go into denial (that was surgery #2). By the time I got cancer I had kids so something pushes you to be more dilgent. The scary part is I had a late period and it was heavier then normal and THAT is what made me go in to get checked out fast. Had I waited that out i doubt I'd be writing this. I'm going in for tests next week as things have gone wonky again so fingers crossed nothing comes of it.  So ladies if your period is acting wonky go see a dr!! Could be something, could be nothing but ovarian cancer is called a silent killer for a reason.\n\nEdit: thank you for the hug award and kind comments!",

            "I had just gotten my first job out of college at the ER at my local hospital. My first week went by with the usual stitches and broken bones. My second week around midnight, this very obese woman came in complaining of chest pains. So we rush her back, grab her vitals and do an EKG and blood work. Everything comes backs normal but this woman is still complaing of chest pain. \n\nSo my supervisor and I ask the lady if we can do a head to toe check up. Now this woman had a rather pungent smell to her when she came in but I've learned to not think of it, as people in the area weren't known for their cleanliness. So we're looking at her chest and I notice that her left breast was reddened and swollen. So I tell her that I'm going to lift up her breast to rule out any skin infections; as I lifted up her breast a wave of noxious stench engulfed the air around me.\n\nThank the gods for facemasks. As I lifted up her breast even more I could seen what looked my a mass of rotting tissue going into her chest. Now my supervisor ran out of the exam room and proceeded to vomit in the nearest trash can. I looked at the lady and asked her why she didn't come in earlier as it looks like a massive skin infection was raging under her left breast. She replied that she didn't have insurance and that she didn't think it was a huge deal. \n\nSo I called in a few other nurses and the doctor to assist with cleaning the wound. Well as we begone cleaning, one nurse noticed a bit of fur and bone. As we further inspected, we come to find out its a small animal of sorts. So they collect the sample and sent it to pathology. After we removed said animal, we noticed that it had rotted into her chest so much that her ribs could be seen. In the end it ended up being the ladies missing kitten and she spent 4 months in the hospital for massive sepsis and other related issues.",
            "I'm a doctor from a third world country and spent the a year interning at the government funded hospital that provides free or subsidised treatment for the poor. Most patients were poor and reported very late to the hospital, especially if it were a woman who's in question. There seems to be too many posts about gangrene, so I'd talk about something else instead.\n\nWe provide a state funded insurance for all those living here. Women are actually paid a small sum of money if they show up for antenatal visits regularly and then a little more once they complete their kid's vaccination. We also actively promote sterilization.\n\nThis was during a month long posting at the labour ward. We had to do 12 hour shifts everyday, which was very tiring, considering the huge number of patients who would show up.\n\nOne day, a 45 year old woman came with labour pains. It was her fifth child and she hadn't taken a single visit to an obstetrician. She had refused sterilization, refused to use contraceptives. We checked her blood hemoglobin, it was only 4 g% (should be at least 10-11 by the end of pregnancy to avoid complications).\n\nShe was looking very pale, thin and sick. You could see she absolutely couldn't tolerate the labour pains. She couldn't push. We didn't have the facility to give an epidural. She demanded us to deliver the baby via a C-section, but this wasn't possible as it increased the chances of her losing more blood, while her hemoglobin was already low. Also, her age by itself made the pregnancy a little risky \n\nThe government funded blood banks run on the kind stranger who donate blood and we had to call up every other hospital to get blood of her blood group.\n\nNote: She eventually did give birth and went into a lot of complications and was shifted into the icu.\n\nNote 2: the reason she kept having children even though they're unable to take good care of them was because all her first four kids were girls and her in laws wanted her to have a boy.",
            "I had a guy come in saying his back was hurting so bad that he couldn\u2019t stand anymore. This man was extremely pale and couldn\u2019t be touched without crying. Trying to start an IV was difficult because he was so dehydrated. He said he had never seen a doctor before nor been to the hospital, which is pretty rare for a man in his 50s. Sure enough blood work comes back and his lab work is all over the place. His hemoglobin is crucially low (4.0, we administer blood when it\u2019s below 7). So we start giving blood to the guy, while the doctor orders CT scans. Many of us felt this guy was in horrible shape despite being able to speak and being very oriented. CT scans come back and this man is ridden with cancer that has metastasized to his bones and several other organs. He didn\u2019t have much longer to live at that point. I felt terrible for him.

            "Well, me. \n\nI was undergoing chemo for lymphoma once per month complicated by the fact I was allergic to the stuff. As a result they loaded me up with dexamethasone (the same stuff they use for COVID). This has behavioral effects as well as suppressing the immune system. \n\nThe doctor gave me very specific instructions about going to emerg if I got a fever, etc.. Anyhow I was pretty out of it for a couple weeks after each session due to the effects of the chemo and the dex. Usually I'd just start to be getting back to normal and the process would start again: I'd see my doctor and she'd prescribe me more dex and a few days later I'd be back for chemo.\n\nI knew I was out of shape. Not much change to do much when you are tired and feel like shit all the time. No fever or anything but I found that I was huffing and puffing even after taking a shower. Anyhow I made a note to mention this to my doctor when I saw her in a few days. I mentioned this and she asked me to walk down the hallway and the nurse would re-check my vitals. I did and as soon as the nurse checked my blood oxygen she started shouting for the doctor and things started happening. I was on oxygen within a couple minutes and admitted into isolation within 15 minutes. I had pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and I am old enough to remember that that was a major killer in the early part of the AIDS epidemic. Having PCP and a crippled immune system is not a good prognosis and like an idiot I left it grow for a couple weeks. I almost died.\n\nAbout a year later I was getting chemo every 3 months. Still getting vast quantities of dex but they were manage the allergic reaction much better. Probably due to the dex I decided a few days after the chemo would be a great time to do the wheel bearings of my pickup truck. I was sure I pulled a muscle or something so I asked my wife to put some analgesic cream on my shoulder. A few hours later a rash started. And the pain got worse. I stayed in bed. I had a small fever but nothing serious. I couldn't sleep because of the pain and the rash got worse and worse. I thought it was an allergic reaction to the cream. I hadn't slept in 3 days (not unusual with dex) then my fever got to the \"get to emerg as soon as possible\" point. \n\nIt turns out I had a raging case of shingles. I was hospitalized, again, in isolation, for several days. There was a high risk of death due to secondary infections due to the 'rash' which now looked like 3rd degree burns over my chest and back. I asked my doctor if it was serious and she said \"look - we don't usually hospitalize people for zoster\".\n\nTL:DR thanks to dex I had potentially life threatening infections twice and, again thanks to dex, couldn't think straight to get prompt medical care.\n\nAs it happens over 2 years later I am still in pain 24/7 due to shingles (get the vaccine).",

I gained weight over the last few years and just chalked it up to aging but never changed my diet. \n\nWhen I called to make the appointment, I couldn't even put my finger on why. I just felt... off. I knew something was wrong, but nothing hurt and I had even lost a good amount of weight recently. \n\nWhile in the office, the doctor obviously didn't know what to check for, just did a routine check-up and physical and was ready to send me home. Then it clicked for me. The spirit of Wilford Brimley appeared to me in a vision and said \"son, get tested for the diabeetus.\" So I asked the doctor about it. He asked if I felt we should check for it, I reiterated my family history and diet a little more clearly, and we drew some blood. \n\nThe next day I get an emergency call from the doctors office saying to come in NOW. I go in, had an A1C of 15.7. Diabetes starts at 7. Their chart went up to 13. They didn't know how I was still functioning. I didn't know how it could be so bad with literally no symptoms aside from a vague feeling of \"off-ness\". I'm not making this up - literally no symptoms. I felt silly making the original appointment. \n\nAnyway, we monitored the shit out of this for several weeks while it got under control. Was placed on a strict diet and did it.

I hate them so much that I passed out at my most recent vaccination in my mid-20s. \n\nLong story short, a few months later my A1C was 5.6. Down 10 points. Done with shots.

It's nearly a year later and aside from a new diet, being a diehard hydrohomie, and taking a couple pills a day, life is pretty normal. \n\nTLDR: If you feel off, you should probably get it checked out!",

            "The ones in Vancouver may have medical professionals available, but the people who work at them are much more likely to be just employees - it is a unionized job here, many people have a background or education in social work, but not medical degrees. I know a lot of people I know who work in these services who are musician friends who like it because they can take time off to tour whenever they want, they are not easily frightened by how crazy it is, have very left politics, and like helping people. Detox is literally in the same building on a different floor than the one in Vancouver, and the people who work in these places tend to go to all different buildings that are administered by the same or linked organizations, so the people working for the safe injection site would also be working at single room occupancy places, or other mental health services/homes around the rest of the city. \n\nThere is a lot of issues with corruption amongst the people in charge of these organizations, in my city anyways, and many of the workers end up having to do leaves of absence or go on workers comp for ptsd, due to the amount of severely fucked up shit they are dealing with all the time, and not being given proper support by the people in charge cheaping out on following safety procedures and abiding by the rules of their own union. It's an extremely difficult job with huge burn out rates. \n\nFor a better idea of what it looks like here, and to evolve some people's black and white opinions regarding addiction, I highly recommend books by a Dr. who works in Vancouver's Downtown East Side, Gabor Mate.",
            "Throwaway here so hopefully nobody identifies me. I don't see a lot of \"medical professionals\" in this thread so here is the perspective of a registered nurse who has cared for OD patients and patients with history of IV drug abuse/addiction.\n\nI could never work in a setting like this and I feel that most of my colleagues would agree. 3 major reasons come to mind:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Ethical/health concerns - I cannot ethically condone drug use \"under my watch\" just to give them Narcan and let them continue to use. Those drugs are harming the person. Giving them a safe space to use by eliminating the risk of overdose does not reduce all risk/harm of using the drug. IV drug users are at major risk of infective endocarditis. This is when bacteria enters the bloodstream. Repeat venipunctures push bacteria on the surface of the skin into the blood vessels. This bacteria attacks the heart valves, causing major damage to the heart and requiring open heart surgery to replace the valves. If left untreated will lead to heart failure and a painful death. Even when treated, life expectancy is drastically reduced.\n2. Legal concerns - What if, despite my best efforts, the patient overdoses and is unable to be resuscitated? Am I liable for malpractice? What if the person develops one of the many other complications from IV drug use? Am I liable for those because I was a trained medical professional available to them when they were using? A good malpractice lawyer would have a field day with this - not worth losing my hard earned license/career over.\n3. Safety concerns - Illicit drug use and IV drug users can sometimes be desperate when looking for their next fix. I have been threatened in my current practice setting for not bringing pain meds fast enough or not giving higher doses than prescribed. I have colleagues who have been assaulted for similar issues. What if I am threatened/cornered/robbed on the job or outside? Will there be enough security to handle this?\n\nI'm not judging a book by its cover. I care for patients with IV drug use and their complications on a regular basis and I don't treat them differently than anyone else. But these are valid concerns that any healthcare professional would having working in this setting.  \n\n\nEDIT: For those refuting my points without any evidence, please give me some studies to read. I'm a nurse - nurses LOVE evidence based practice.",

There aren't anywhere near as many people out of their mind on heroin passed out in the streets or wandering and stumbling around like zombies barely able to speak much less walk anymore.\n\nOverdoses in general are down and deaths due to overdoses are down dramaticly, there are far less needles everywhere because of the needle exchange where they will give them a clean needle to use everytime and being given a place to dispose of their previous needle in a biohazard safe disposal box like in hospitals or clinics when before you couldn't go anywhere, a park, a mall stairwell, a mcdonalds, hell even elementry school playgrounds and properties were having needles found. You could go nowhere without seeing atleast 5 needles in your travels to or from that location or the location itself, most of which had no caps and you could see blood in and on the syringe. I started wearing steel toed boots with a mental slab covering the whole bottom of my foot between the rubber and interior from heel to toe because There were needles in the gutters on the road, in every public bathroom, in libraries in the aisles that had a bit of cover, even some in grocery stores, it was awful.\n\n So many people were getting stuck with the needles too because no one was throwing them away before or even putting the caps back on and i know 5 people personally who have been stuck with one, one was diagnosed with hiv that he knows for a fact he didn't have before from some asshole who hid an uncovered dirty needle on the bottom of a hand railing in a parking garage, two got hep c, one from stepping on a needle and it going straight through his shoe into his foot which is why i started wearing the boots,m.  thankfully the other 2 didn't catch anything but so many others did before program targeted that issue. One of the worst ones i heard of was some piece of shit actually glued an uncovered needle to the bottom a childrens slide with the needle pointing up so when a poor little girl slid down the slidr she got a needle jammed in the back of her thigh. \n\nAlso because they are getting clean needles for free with zero questions as often as they want, i have heard that diseases are spreading much slower than before. Arrests are also down because they are being contained to the safe injection sites when high rather than being on the streets. At the end of the day it has done wonders for the city and many other cities too and at first i was a skeptic but i'll say once again i was happily proven wrong and it has imroved the safety of the city and public, the lives and safety of the addicts and i now support this 100 percent i recommend you do too.",

They were fairly heavy and we couldn\u2019t possibly guess. \n\nCome Christmas morning, we open them at the same time to prevent a spoiled surprise for each other. Mid 1980s, dark brown bath towels. Not a joke with money or a toy in the bottom of the box. He said he thought we all needed new towels. \n\nHe came from a poor family and when he made a lot of money, he didn\u2019t lose that attitude towards gifts.

At 11 I was mortified and also I had an aversion to wearing a bra at that point and also that\u2019s a shitty gift. Then she insisted that I take it out of the box and hold is up to show everyone because she was \u201cso excited\u201d that I was \u201cblossoming into a woman\u201d . Thankfully my mom stepped in and told her it was an inappropriate gift and she took the box away.\n\nMy dads parents would always buy me little kid clothes even well into my teen years?

I was living on the edge and decided to have 3 bites of cake last year and it was coming out of me like lava \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35\n\n2nd edit: For all those wondering, IBS is irritable bowl syndrome. I have a severe case of it and it\u2019s super painful and I lost 20+ lbs in two weeks as a result. I won\u2019t get into all the gross details (unless you want me to lol) but it\u2019s a bad time.

I'm just one of those people that everyone forgets my birthday because it's on a weird date (not a holiday). So my entire life, 95% of my friends, coworkers, significant others, bosses, classmates, family members, have all missed my birthdays - no calls or presents or decorations or taken me to bday dinners. \n\nSome people used to \"remember\" 2-3 weeks later, and call (and later,  text) and say, crap, I forgot your birthday again...sorry...and still not celebrate it at all. Lol. But mostly it has been crickets.  I just got used to it.  \n\nOnce I got in my mid 30s and started hearing how others were/are typically celebrated, as kids through adults,  I  really put together how odd this was, and it broke my heart.  It's hard not to take it personally. Funny thing is, I'm really easy to buy for and don't have expensive tastes. So yeah, baffling.  I swear I'm a really nice and kind person. \n\nWhat made it even worse was that I was the one who always remembered everyone's birthdays and bought presents/called/taken them out to dinner. It's not about money, it's about the disregard. \n\nSo eventually, I stopped calling/buying presents/taking people to dinner and a lot of people noticed and were upset about it.  When I would say, but this person had not called me for my birthday in 10+  years of friendship, they'd say, it didn't matter, I should still call them and celebrate their birthday.  My self care said Nope. \n\nSo when I turned 40, I made a pact that, going forward, every year on my birthday,  I'd buy myself a big present and get take out from my favorite restaurant.

I was on the job site till almost 11pm. My family ate the dinner they got for my birthday without me and nobody even told me happy birthday. I got home and my then girlfriend had gone out drinking with her friends. I slept on the couch still covered in dirt and didn\u2019t eat anything all day.\n\n2015, I sat alone in my bedroom playing fallout 4 and trying to deal with the death of my ex girlfriend a few months earlier.\n\n2016, then girlfriend forgot it was my birthday and volunteered for me to drive her friend 9 hours for work. Her friend got a Facebook notification saying it was my birthday after two hours of complaining about her boyfriend. She said happy birthday and we mostly sat in silence afterwards.\n\n2017, someone smashed out my car window, stole all my stuff, and I had to pay for it to be fixed. My girlfriend at the time spent the whole weekend yelling at me for talking about another girl. My mom got shit face drunk and disappeared, so I spent all night trying to find her. Then I had to drive 5 hours since my mom was still drunk and I ended up call it off work because of it. I went back to work the next day to a write up. Then a coworker accidentally sprayed chemicals into my face causing chemical burns.\n\n2018, I had finally dumped my girlfriend. I spent the day working a super busy double shift at my work with my only coworker calling off. Around 7pm I get a notification on my phone that my bank account is locked. Ex girlfriend figured it I was dating someone new and emptied my bank account on Amazon videos since I let her use it to finish what she was watching. I spent the night in an apartment I just moved into with no furniture crying on the floor.\n\n2019, I decide to just ignore my birthday and hope nobody notices. I get an invite to hangout with a girl that I really liked after spending the morning destroying my legs at the gym. I show up and she tells me that her and her ex were back together. So I get to spend the night with a girl I liked and her boyfriend who absolutely hates me for obvious reasons and is super abusive toward her. Then they tell me they got us tickets to go rollerblading. I can barely even walk after the gym so I just sit out. I can\u2019t even talk to the girl or her boyfriend will probably beat her when I leave. The best part is I had told her how I felt and she said she was interested but didn\u2019t feel ready to start a new relationship yet. Another birthday ended with me laying on the floor crying.\n\nWho the fuck knows what\u2019s gonna happen to me this year? I\u2019m guessing is this November I\u2019m probably going to get shot or end up in a car accident or some shit. Wish me luck!",

            "My experience as a kid.\n\nEverything was new, so much to explore. Every smell, every sight every texture, every sound was unique and related to eachother to make up many conjoined moments/experiences. Every now and then I smell, see, hear or taste something that just throws me back into one of those experiences but that's fleeting more and more as the years go by.\n\nNowadays those things don't really combine anymore, everything seems separated. If I'm walking down the street and smell the restaurant up a ways, I think \"oh yeah the restaurant\" instead of \"oh yeah this sidestreet im walking in, along with the wet rain, along with the glistening cars, along with the cloudy sky, along with the toads down the river croaking, along with the beautiful smell of the restaurant\".\n\nI would also see things only on the surface level, which I miss. Now everything is so complex and deeper than it was. Like if I were to look at a shiny diamond or ruby as a kid, I'd think \"ooh, shiny!\". But now I when I see those shiny stones, I can only think of how they were acquired, if they are real or not, if the seller is trying to scam buyers, etc. Everything was much simpler back then.",

I think that's why I space out so much, just listening to the music all around me. It's a wonderful way to live, and I wish more people could experience it. Nobody seems to understand when I explain the experience, or they think I'm crazy or on drugs or something. \n\nI'm not sure why I hear music all the time, but I really enjoy it.

The Milky way galaxy is just one of a nearly countless number of galaxies of various size and shape. We are only the beginning of the universe when it still has light, as eventually the last high-mass star will explode and no new stars will be created, so the universe becomes just white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, and unilluminated dead planets. Eventually, those black holes will probably die and the white dwarfs will become black dwarfs. Proton decay will take place and all matter in the universe will become energy.

Hilarious side note, the gates were colored: cyan, magenta, yellow and black.  She got mad at me one time when I referred to them as the Printer Gates.  And you'd think that after unloading all that people would run screaming but they....didn't.  They'd show up at our apartment to talk to her and they'd be talking about these battles and stuff.     \nAll I can figure is she was good at spotting people with over-active imaginations who didn't fit in well.  She probably would've made a great cult leader TBH.  She now works in IT and we still talk to each other pretty regularly.  She wrote a fantasy novel that she's trying to get published which was actually quite good when she let me read the draft.  I'm guessing that became the outlet for her stories when she grew up so to speak.          \nI kind of want to ask her about what was going on with her, but I kind of don't want to open that can of worms ever again.  When she wasn't in full-on wtf mode she was the most kind and genuinely fun to be around person.  I'm sort of afraid the Printer Gates will rear their ugly head again if I bring it up.     \n**EDIT:** For everyone that keeps assuming people were going along with it because she was hot I'm just going to leave it at this - the bullying she'd been dealing with was because of her physical appearance and weight.  I think the appeal is more along the lines of what one person said in a reply (in an unfortunate parallel to Charles Manson)...she was good at spotting cast off people and then you're just excited to belong to something so you go along with it.",
            "Not exactly the same as \"otherkin\", but very much in the vein of the question in terms of total reality denial, I know someone who totally, wholeheartedly, believes that they are a Jedi master.\n\nOur families go  way back so I happen to know other kids were merciless to him all through childhood.  He's always had problems, though.  Kind of one of those people you can feel aren't quite right but not exactly why.\n\nHe decided he was a jedi master one day.  Just, like, out of the blue. Credit where credit is due, he went all the way with it.   Became a minor nerd celebrity for a while.   At first when people challenged the \"jedi\" thing (Why don't you have powers then?) he'd say \"Jedi is a mindset not a power\", or sometimes \"You don't know the powers I may have\" and try to play it off like a joke, but the dude was 100% serious.  If you pushed he would outright melt down with tears and screaming.\n\nApparently his parents financially supported him pretty much entirely, until he (and this part confuses the crap out of me) got married and had a kid WHILE STILL INSISTING ON THE JEDI THING.  After that the wife supported him.  Eventually he got tired of that and left his family to take off with a teenager he met at a convention.  That's when we cut ties with him.  You can be a jedi all you want, but cutting and leaving your kid is some sith lord shit.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold and silver, folks!  Seeing the comments I should clarify he was mid-20s when he went jedi.  Also, dang there are way more jedis out there than I thought!\nPS - I avoided identifying info in my post.

            "When I was a kid, I think my classmates believed I thought I was a Power Ranger. I wore morphers constantly, it was my favourite show on TV and I was kind of obsessed. Now, at the same time, I may have pretended I was a Power Ranger in play, but I knew I wasn't. I kept the morpher with me because I was so freaking alone I needed something. I was getting treated badly at home, school was just as bad and I was incredibly anxious and I just broke. I was puking every single morning before school multiple times. Being that anxious all the time sucks and I just wished the Rangers would come and rescue me. That's why the morphers were always with me. I was 9/10 and looking back, I knew they were the only reason why I'm still here. \n\nThe thing is though, I enjoyed the show until I was 13 because the show grew up with me. I kept it all quiet, the morphers stayed with me but hidden in my backpack after I turned 11. Somehow, thanks to my ass hole mum, everyone knew I still watched it. Even after I stopped, people still believed I was still obsessed with it. they weren't wrong, but I kept it all quiet. Also, I don't know why it was such an issue in the first place. Everyone seemed to think I thought I was a Power Ranger and I don't know why. That crap even followed me to Uni via one guy from my school. He very quickly shut up when I asked him why he was pulling this crap here. I had never spoken to him before or had anything to do with him. He stayed out of my way after that. \n\nPeople.

            "When I was a kid there was an odd girl at my church. She and I were the same age and grew up together so we were friends by default, but she was nice and I didn't mind hanging out with her. I thought she had a wild imagination, and one time she told me that she was a witch and her little brother was a warlock, but she didn't know about her younger siblings because they were too young to do magic still. I just said \"Cool!\" or something and let her tell me a little bit about it, then we started talking about boys and school and the norm. When we were 12 we started going to our church's summer camp for girls (Girl's Camp, very clever name) and she would hardly ever leave her cot. Everyone thought she was a weirdo already so they just let her be, and even when I talked to her about it she just claimed she didn't feel well.\n\nOur 2nd year at GC we went to a pretty far away state park from home, and the group from our town was large enough we needed two cabins, the older girls took one and the 1st and 2nd years took the other. One day around lunch time, I came back from the mess hall and a lot of the older girls were in our cabin talking to her, and apparently while they were doing the bored-teen-at-camp thing of yelling into a box fan to \"chop\" your voice, they woke her up and made her angry, so she screamed out the window at them that she'd hex them if she didn't stop. Now they were here to test her abilities as a witch, approaching it very civilly but trying very hard not to laugh or criticize her while it played out.\n\nMean girl 1: \"What can you do?\"   \nWitch girl: \"I can make people do things.\"  \nMean girl 1: \"Show us! Make me do something!\"  \nThey set up a whole show of it, they put WG on one end of the cabin and everyone else stood between her and MG1 at the other side. WG closed her eyes and concentrated, and then told MG2 what she was going to make MG1 do, which was look at a specific person nearby (it happened to be MG1's cousin, now MG3). MG2 went to go see if it happened and just exclaimed almost immediately \"OH MY GOSH IT WORKED!\" MG1 hadn't done anything at all, but the whole group of them decided to convince WG that she'd done whatever she set out to do so they could antagonize her about more of her \"abilities.\" Each time she showed them something new, they pretended it worked, and started treating her like their mascot the rest of camp.\n\nBecause of these events, the whole group of girls at church relentlessly made fun of her at every opportunity about her supposed powers. She ended up going to therapy and being an introverted shut-in for years. Senior year, she started going to public school and I got to see her more again.\n\nThe end result and your TL;DR if you like:  \nShe told me she lied to the therapist about ceasing her magical practices to make her parents get off her back, and that not wearing it proudly had cursed her and caused a physical disability she'd developed. Now that she was getting ready to graduate she'd move out and get better and help people with her magic. That was 10 years ago now.",

            "Wow, I\u2019m surprised I can actually answer this one.\n\nIn high school I became friends with a girl I met through theater. This was during the Undertale craze. She got me into the game and eventually confided in me that she was \u201ckin\u201d with Sans, the skeleton from the game. I decided to go ahead and go with it because I really liked her and I didn\u2019t really have many close friends at the time. I asked her what made her believe she was Sans, and she explained that since there\u2019s an infinite number of universes with infinite different timelines, there\u2019s probably a timeline somewhere in which she really is Sans. I think she also identified a lot with his whole \u201cI\u2019m funny and outgoing on the outside but I\u2019m actually really depressed\u201d thing. \n\nIn all honesty, she had a lot of mental health issues and it was a form of escapism for her. She kept it to herself and never talked about it at school, but I would listen to her when she needed it and I would call her Sans after school because it made her happy. I felt bad because she really needed someone to understand her, and it felt like one small thing I could do to make her feel better. \n\nShe\u2019s doing much better now. We kind of fell out of contact, but she\u2019s got a good job and I think she\u2019s moved on from the kin thing.

At some point he decided that I was a good enough friend that he could open up to me about it.  So we had a long convo.  For some reason a goodly part of the story was that he woke up one morning at the age of 10.  However, the night and those dreams had lasted a good 30 years.  He lived every single moment of his life until the age of 40 or so, then woke up and it was all a dream.  And his life played out just as it had in that 30 year dream, every moment.  He said that he knew ahead of time that he was going to meet me.  He said that he knew when WWIII would start and what would happen.  When I asked for details he told me that he was not allowed to tell me that information.  And then he told me the most important part of it all, which is that he was the 2nd coming of Jesus and that he was destined to save the world.  But was also not allowed to get more specific.\n\nI can't stress enough how nice of a dude he was.  He was a damn good friend and the gentlest of souls.  And you would never have guessed he was carrying this dark secret, this weight if you will of \"knowing\" that he had this tremendous responsibility and destiny.  And he was SO lucid when he was telling me about it.  And this is a man without a sense of irony in his being- he was absolutely serious.  \n\nThe relationship with his friend didn't last long though we remained friendly.

He also claimed he had fibromyalgia and blamed it for everything. Would straight up stop working and take naps, saying he was disabled so he couldn't stay standing. No idea if this was true or if he was just a lazy person that didn't like to do any sort of work. I could be wrong, but it may have been the fact that he was 30+ and still drinking & smoking like 22 year old party mode me. Levi also insisted on using a fake last name all the time, something related to Italian royalty.\n\nNow, here is Ryder. Ryder isn't even this dude's given name to my knowledge. Ryder always dresses in some black cutoff shirt with chains. Thinks he is some sort of super hero clothing designer. Ryder routinely buys jeeps, gets them repossessed, then shows up with a huge chunk of cash for a new down payment from unknown sources (seriously, NOBODY bought his clothes). We had a theory he got the money from his mom, cause last we knew, he lived with her (guy was in his mid 30s as well). \n\nSince it was a small town, Ryder and Levi would show up to parties together in the doorless jeep. Both in seemingly strange clothes talking about weird supernatural happenings and fighting crime.  I wish I had some better more specific details but this the the tale of a dynamic crime fighting duo I once knew. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just did some creeping and the pair are still alive and kicking, Ryder still looks like he is living in the matrix or Blade. Levi looks the same as always as well.",
            "I used to work in a psychiatric facility with adolescence.  We had a girl that acted like a Jedi.  She would come out of her room in the morning rolling on the ground, shouting there were Storm Troopers and take her imaginary light saber and attack them full force. Every morning.  She talked as if she were truly friends with Yoda and Luke Skywalker and would have full on conversations with them throughout the day.   (She would also catch fairy like creatures that would fly around her and put them in her pocket.) When confronted, she would argue and say that whomever was arguing with her was a minion of the darkside, and had their minds warped by Darth Vader.  This went on daily for about 8 months.  She told me that Obi Wan wanted me to be her Jedi trainer to reach the next level in her force abilities.  After work, I wrote up a 20 page manual detailing next steps and fun little things to help her on her Jedi Journey, incorporating reworded parts of her treatment plan (She was there for aggression and running away).  Through her working in her Jedi ways she learned what she needed to do to cope with her aggression and part of it was \"a Jedi need not tell others they are a Jedi, only the wise with the force should be able to perceive those with the Jedi powers.\"  She eventually told me she knew she wasn't a Jedi (her first admission ever), but that life was hard, and it was easier convincing herself of this alternate reality instead of acknowledging and dealing with the pains and disappointments in her current reality.  Her improvement rapidly brought about a release to return home.  I don't know how she's doing now, but wish her nothing but the best.",
            "Hooo boy, one I can actually answer. I knew a girl in high school who was nice enough. One day, in a conversation, it turned out that she 100% believed in werewolves, vampires, ghouls, etc. So I just chalked it up to her being woefully gullible, felt bad for her, and forgot.\n\nMany years later, I hear about her death in the news. After high school, she had gotten in a relationship with some crazy conspiracy-obsessed older man, and together they were going to \"start the revolution\" or something. They armed themselves, drove out west, and executed two cops in a Cici's pizza, and then invaded a Walmart where they killed someone who was about to fire back. They held up in the back, and committed suicide.\n\n[And here's the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Las_Vegas_shootings).\n\nHer gullibility and inability to think critically lead her down a life path that ended in the back of a Walmart with blood on her hands. Pay attention in school, kids.",
            "Yeah unfortunately because I dated her.\nWe were still at school (I was 16 she was 15), and she was my first ever girlfriend. It was around the time Twilight was a HUGE fucking deal.\n\nSo, she decided to tell me after seeing each other for about a month or so that she had 'multiple personalities' and one was called Violet and she was a vampire. If I had a cut, she'd try and lick it, and she also gave me a lovebite on my neck so bad it was black and hurt like fuck, but she didn't stop because 'Violet doesn't know when to.'\nNot long after this she then told me that I was a werewolf (?!) because my eyes changed colour from Hazel to yellow (?!) and she wanted me to scratch her with my 'wolf claws'. Obviously this was news to me because I'm pretty sure I'm not a werewolf haha.\n\nWhy I didn't nope the fuck out of there at that point idk but she then went on to tell me that she couldn't see ghosts but could 'talk' to them and would proceed to have conversations with ghosts of dead relatives of people we knew. Needless to say, I then left, and how that whole experience didn't put me off dating forever I'll never know.",
            "Legitimately went through grade school, junior high and high school with a guy who imitated a dinosaur daily. If any of you have seen step brothers, the scene where Dale\u2019s dad, Robert, told the boys he wanted to be a dinosaur. He would chase cats, roar at people, etc. But finally had to grow up. Well yes, I went to school with a guy just like that named Christopher. Ironic as hell is we were juniors in high school when step brothers came out. \n\nSo Chris was actually an honor roll student, wasn\u2019t a total outcast and had a decent amount of friends. But he would perch his arms up like a T-Rex through the halls and I remember seeing him in the lunch hall eat without his hands to imitate a dinosaur. It was beyond bizarre to see but since he\u2019d done it for so long it became regular. I actually ran into Chris a few years back at the local movie theatre since I still live in my hometown and he seems to be doing well. Has a wife, three kids and a steady accounting job. Due to us not attending the same movie I cannot confirm if he used his hands to eat his popcorn though.",

            "Ok. This is really hard to type, and the first time I've said anything in a public forum (only close friends & family have known). Also forgive formatting, I'm on mobile at work.\n\nAround 2009 (dates are fuzzy), I had this recurring hallucination of a blonde woman following me around. I started to listen closely to her when she wasn't paying attention, and discovered she was responsible for having me ejected from \"The Council\".\n\nI started to believe that I was some kind of powerful ancient being charged with watching over the human race. I spent 3 weeks in the psych ward, under 24 hour supervision, with daily psychiatric treatments, and suffered a major psychotic break when faced with reality.\n\nIt took 2 years and a lot of good people for me to get \"better\", but thinking about it still hurts. Nobody knows to this day what brought the whole thing on.",
            "When naruto was really popular this girl walked around with crutches at my junior high. She hung out with some of the ultra nerdy kids but she was okay (nothing crazy or red-flag type) until this stint she did with crutches. \n\nShe was in love with sasuke from the anime and he was bitten by orochimaru (or whatever) and he got this black mark on his neck which meant he was a vampire. This debilitated the sasuke while he recovered.\n\nSo she was walking in crutches with a black mark sharpied in on her neck but with no boot or cast. So when she was asked she would loudly shriek \"DONT YOU KNOW? I WAS BIT BY A VAMPIRE\". When our science teacher asked what happened that caused her to be in crutches she flipped out (because kids were already laughing at her for putting this show on) and yells at him then storms out of class with her crutches... weird times.",
            "When I was on the psych ward, there was a kid with a severe psychosis who through it believed that she was nobility, and that it was just a matter of time before her brother would come get her in his helicopter. It was kind of amusing and infinitely sad at the same time. She got better though, as her medicine kicked in, you could see the real personality poke through. \n\nThere was a kid who was dissociative, I remember once asking what landed him in the psych ward, and well he pushed back of course. We weren't good friends, and you don't end up with dissociative identity disorder for no reason... His entire demeanor changed, even the way he sat and carried himself. He told me to fuck off in a different accent and I did just that. It was really weird befriending both identities.\n\nI know this might not be the kind of thing you might have expected. But mental illnesses can also change your perception of reality. Distort your memories, create false ones. Mental issues, behavioral issues, loneliness and other things can make you want to escape into a new \"form\", but mental illness isn't escapism. It's losing yourself.",
            "I went to highschool with this kid fairly normal albeit a bit slow he was in special ed classes but not because of his learning disabilities , it was because he had behavioral control issues and he believed he was a dragon. Great kid but he was prone to outbursts. His mom sewed him special socks with tassels that would flap when he ran and he ran pretty fast they looked cool AF the way the billowed in the wind either his mom was seriously skilled or he ran with grace I think it was both but they flowed like a day dream. I remember everyone was supportive of him but didn't really hold a conversation with him for long because he would just drone on and on. I remember going to his house one day because I stepped in as his bus para/supervisor and he lived near me so I was just going to walk home after he got off. He asked me to stay for a few minutes he wanted to show me something cool. He brought out all these paper mechet dragons some were super shitty, I assume the first ones he ever did, and some were magnificent (dad was an engineer) those were his latest ones. We talked about them for a bit and I was going to leave to go home he asked if I could stay a few more minutes to wait for his mom to get home so he could 'show me something cool' I agreed and when mom came home he set stuff up in the drive way I had no idea what was going on. Turns out he was a fire eater he'd been practicing for like all of highschool and took up fire dancing (what he called it not sure if its accurate). It was truly a beautiful display. His mom said its what he wanted to do so she allows it with supervision . I can't gawk enough about this kid. I'm not sure what happened after highschool but i really hope  he got to use his talents.",
            "When I was a teenager my family owned a small dairy farm. During the summer of my junior year of high school we had an exceedingly dry summer. We could have the well feed the barn with our cows, or the house, but not both at the same time. My father decided that was unacceptable, and got the old timer from the local town who had helped other farmers find places to dig wells.\n\nThis old guy comes to our farm and starts walking around with two wire coat hangers that have been cut into an \"L\" shape that could be held with the short part of the \"L\". He pointed the long parts of the coat hanger away from him noted the spots where the coat hangers would cross one another. I had never seen water dousing at work before, so I asked him how it worked. He said that if he walks over an underground stream of running water, his coat hangers would follow the direction of flow. He had mapped out where several branches seemed to meet and showed me the spot. From my perspective it looked like he was full of shit and just tilting his hands and making the hangers swing.\n\nHe found a spot that was reliably moving the hangers and asked me to try. I said that I would knowing that this probably wouldn't work. It did work. As soon as I stepped over the spot on the ground that he did, the hangers moved on their own. I was shocked. At that moment I believed that he and I had special powers. My parents both tried, and the coat hangers did not move for them. We dug the well, and there was indeed a lot of water. My dad and the cows were happy.\n\nAfter that I thought magic was real and was a full believer. When I went to college, I majored in engineering. During my physics classes I learned about charge and how flowing water can be influenced by charges. I went from having magical powers to a somewhat poor capacitor. It was a bit of a letdown.",
            "I lived up the street from a girl who thought she was a vampire and could telekinetically move stuff with her mind she came out of her room one day exclaiming to her mom she had bent a spoon, she claimed her friend showed her how to do this and she was just all around weird. Her mom told her you just bent it with your hand and she got really upset I couldn't help but laugh.",
            "Probably not a good answer to your question.\n\nMet my brother at the pub, and one of his friends were there.

            "Once when I was in a psychiatric ward for a suicide attempt I met a young guy who thought he had special powers. He thought that he had the power to manipulate people\u2019s body\u2019s like growing new organs on changing people\u2019s DNA. He was transgender as well and one day he decided to become female and have a baby. Obviously as the months went on no signs of pregnancy appeared. I thought this would make him believe he didn\u2019t have powers but instead he thought he had miscarried and got really upset. He actually was a really nice guy though and he regularly tried to cure the other patients by manipulating their DNA. It didn\u2019t work at all of course but it was a nice gesture.",
            "I met a woman who said she could communicate with trees. She really believed it. But I didn't see any reason to confront her about it. It seemed to bring her solace and really just amounted to her hugging trees on her own property and connecting with them. No harm done and it had a positive impact on her. Maybe it was just her way of telling herself something in a way she could handle.\n\nAnyway, sometimes the voices in your head can be good friends.",
            "Hey guys, I guess I could say I was this person too. I randomly said I was a wolf some time in year 7 (11/12 years old) and until around 15 I proper was into it. It became part of my personality so bad that sometimes even now I'll catch myself doing something small, such as cocking my head, sniffing or yawning like a wolf. Complete accident, my new friends think it's cute, and my boyfriend calls me his pup sometimes when I'm really down. It really was an escape thing for me, I was so mentally ill and didnt realise that I was. I'm still not great, but I'm glad that isnt me anymore. The old friends I still have will joke with me about it sometimes, but i still write short stories and things about this wolf that I have a strange connection to. Idk.

            "There was a little gang of LARPers at my university who turned into a wizard elf (?) cult! They started out pretty normal as I understand it, just a group of nerds who hung out in a little fort in the woods and did whatever LARPers do. Their 'king' was kind of a weird dude who walked around barefoot a lot but seemed basically harmless.\n\nApparently he started getting increasingly controlling over his subjects, so first they all had to sit together in the cafeteria, and then they had to use their larper names all the time, I think eventually they *all* stopped wearing shoes, they could only take classes he approved of, it was a whole thing. Turns out he'd convinced them he was some kind of magical elf lord who had unlocked their fantasy-world other selves (through the power of LARP, I guess) and bound their fates together with his mystical powers etc etc. \n\nEventually the administration figured out there was some kind of Serious Craziness going on, King Elf Wizard got expelled, and I think most of the cultists ended up dropping out.\n\n...and that's why my friends and I had to convince several administrators we weren't planning on becoming cult leaders when we started a Dungeons & Dragons club, lol.",
            "My mother-in-law! \n\nShe thinks she has prophetic abilities that she obtained due to Project MKUltra, and that the Mexican Government has hired the cartels to kill her. They attempt to do this by engineering every mild inconvenience and irritation in her life in order to drive her to suicide. She believes the CIA still observes her, but is no longer actively trying to kill her. The only people in the world that she trusts are her daughter (my wife) and her old pot dealer, though she is starting to also trust her landlord (because she wants to get in his pants). We know this because she is scatterbrained and terrible at technology and so she frequently texts my wife these things while addressing other people. Of course, she claims that this is just the cartels intercepting and redirecting her messages to make her look bad. \n\nShe occasionally tries to use her prophetic powers to help people, like telling her daughter that I was abusive, or by giving me investment advice. She also used them to discover her landlord's sexual kinks, which she then accidentally sexted at her daughter three times. \n\nIt's gotten less amusing recently, as she's started to believe that her daughter is part of this conspiracy and that she may have to be killed. Same with my father-in-law/her ex-husband, but she's afraid of him because he's best friends with the KKK Grand Dragon. My MIL lives in the next state, never learned to drive, and is a frail old woman who probably weighs about 90 pounds soaking wet, so we don't feel endangered, but we do worry that she'll try to attack her drug dealers or a cop or something.",
            "I knew a kid when I was young, around 9-10, who was a few years older than me. He was a neighbor of my best friend and absolutely believed he was a werewolf. He had a necklace that he wore to \"keep him from turning\". He was a cool kid and we had fun playing video games/playing outside.\n\n I feel bad because we always thought the werewolf stuff was silly and we would tease him about it. One day we were play sword fighting in the back yard of my friend's house and I pulled the necklace off and broke it. He lost it and bolted to the gate to run home. All the while I held his necklace in the air chanting \"Who let the dogs out\" \n\nIf you're out there Logan, I'm sorry about that.",

He got sent to the psych ward for awhile and came back at the end of the year as a mute, or at least rarely talked from what I remember",
            "Okay, I was this kid though! I had used a spell I found online and wholeheartedly believed I had turned into a werewolf. I would eat raw meat, bite alot of people, hated shoes and most clothing, etc, etc. I was sent to MANY therapists, and specialists, most of which said it was a coping mechanism for some trauma I must have had. What started worrying people was when I started to grow hair and stuff, my sense of smell became quite good! I would stay up most nights and could see in the dark fairly well, etc. It was like I was honestly a werewolf! Later found a tumor in my brain that, when removed, I started to have doubts, my hair recessed, my sense of smell deteriorated, etc. The tumor has been on some gland that came from when we were monkeys, and had triggered it to start controlling more than it was supposed to.\n\nTLDR, a brain tumor made me a werewolf.",
            "\\*Furiously searching this thread for anyone talking about me\\*\n\nI wasn't at the level of totally believing I was a cat, and this was long before Tumblr and the whole otherkin thing were popular enough to be on people's radar. But I \\*was\\* obsessed with the musical Cats. So I made tails to wear, usually on special event days, and painted my face. At one point my freshman year of high school I dated an abusive dude who forced me to wear  a collar too, out of some kind of control/BDSM thing? I dealt with the bullying before that, but after the collar it fucked with me because I hadn't really chose that for myself.\n\nI'm okay-ish now. No longer dressing up, but still not totally mentally healthy. I do work and live independently with my partner, so there's that lol",
            "OMG yes. My brother. He believed (believes?) he is a dragon. And he's also a furry. And he also believes he can see people's auras. He was/is such a socially awkward person, and I think in some weird way this is how he f found community. Apparently there is a whole bunch of people who think they are dragons! Who knew. Now that he's in his 30s, he's grown out of it - or at least he doesn't talk about it or insist that people call him by his \"dragon name\" anymore.\n\nI'm under the impression that it was something that slowly fell away from his belief system, bit by bit, but one interaction sticks out in my memory. While we were on a long road trip he was bitching about how our mother kept asking him all sorts of \"ridiculous\" questions like if he believes he can see the future, if he believes he can fly, if he believes he can see ghosts, etc. And I was like, \"Yeah dude. She's trying to figure out exactly how delusional you are. Don't complain that her asking you if you can see the future is ridiculous while simultaneously claiming you are a dragon that sees auras. Keep this shit up and you'll be forcefully admitted to the psych ward.\" After that he stopped talking about being a dragon so much.   \n\n\nInterestingly enough, on paper he's the most successful person in our family. Despite his social ineptitude, he's brilliant with computers. He had more money in his retirement account by age 30 than my mother has now, and she's like 2 years from retirement (and makes 6 figures). He lives with his girlfriend (who he met online, of course) and they seem really happy together. But he still has dragon art all over his house, attends furry events, wears a floor-length hooded cloak everywhere and spins around septar/walking stick. Still a weird dude, now just a weird dude with a big paycheck.",
            "Throwaway time!  \nI've been in these communities before.  \nDon't get me wrong. there are plenty of very strange people in these communities- some who are very toxic and ignore people's boundaries.  More often teenagers or young adults who are using it as a coping mechanism to help manage their emotions.   There are plenty of nice people who are involved who are perfectly reasonable and will mostly keep it to private communities and not force it on others including fairly well-adjusted adults. \n\nI think the most important thing is to be kind to people even if they are engaging in something you find weird.  My conclusion is people sometimes believe weird things and honestly its best to just accept it and move on given its a) harmless b) they are otherwise decently adjusted. You should only be concerned if it seems to come at a detriment to their or others health.",
            "There were a bunch of kids in my HS who were part of this thing where some were vampires and some were werewolves. I was friends with some of them, though I never participated in their thing. Though one of my closer friends there was convinced I was a werewolf and was desperately trying to get me to play along with her. Her reasoning was that it was because I loved nature so much (I'm a biology buff and wanted to go to college to be a zoologist, ended up becoming a game dev lolol) and my favorite animal happened to be a wolf.\n\nI never did play along with her in earnest because I really thought it was just silly, but I kinda eventually just went along and said \"Sure... I'll be a werewolf\" and for whatever reason she was the happiest person in the world when I said that half-hearted response. Like, the smile on her face you would have thought it was her birthday.\n\nOf course they grew out of it, and we're still friends to this day, but sometime earlier this year I asked her why me letting her think I was a werewolf that made her so happy, and she said something along the lines of \"because I didn't like the vampire-werewolf war and I wanted to be a vampire who was best friends with a werewolf\".\n\nAnd for some reason I was really touched by that.",

            "I auditioned to be a face character and Disneyland and made it to the stage where they run through scenarios of unruly guests, rude comments etc. and you have to respond and come up with responses in character. \n\nMy dance teacher was a face more than 20 years ago and she had all kinds of stories of people trying to reach up her skirt (she was Pocahontas mainly). In the end I'm glad I didn't make it through! At the time it was like barely above min wage which was like $6.75/hour or something like that.",
            "I know this will get buried but OP will like it.\n\nI chaperoned a gentleman with special needs to Disneyland as part of a group tour. When our group of special needs individuals met the characters, they were all absolutely incredible with our people. Minnie flirted with my friend I took, Merida flirted with me. But the best of all was Cruella De Ville. Normally she insults whoever she takes pictures with. With us she managed to stay in character but not say anything actually mean. She said to one guy with a cane, \u201cAh, I like your cane. You can use it to beat little ones out of your way.\u201d",
            "Maybe someone who actually played Tarzan can confirm this for me;\n\nDisneyland used to have a Tarzan character, but you don't see him anymore.        Since the characters are always expected to pose for photos  and selfies, and Tarzan wore nothing but a loin cloth; woman were constantly grabbing the actor's ass, when they got in close.        \nSo, the park just quit that character.\n\nUpdate: After some confirmation of the bad behavior, there are still recent Tarzan sightings.\nIt appears Disney paused the character and re-designed his loin-cloth costume into one more like a pair of shorts and a 'jungle-vine' sash.       Apparently, women are still 'grabby' but the costume department tried to make it a little less easy.",

            "On a disney cruise I met a guy who looked EXACTLY like Peter pan. When we asked him he said \"nope peter pan has brown eyes\" (or something like that) the next day when we went to get a picture with peter he got super close and whispered \"see? Peter has brown eyes\" \n\nHands down best Disney employee I've ever met (he was also Pluto)",
            "Ex cast member here. While not a character myself, I did have to work the parade route from time to time, making sure kids didn't dart out in front of floats and such. \"Friends of characters\" would often be playful with CMs along the parade route. Winking, making silly faces, etc. There was one day where Baloo came up to me mid-dance, and proceeded to bow to me. Baloo also happened to be wearing some sort of crown/hat thing with a star on the top. Baloo probably wasn't aware of how tall that actually made them.. Baloo managed to smack me right in the mouth with that star, cutting it open and giving me a fat lip. Fairly certain I heard Baloo audibly gasp when they stood upright again. Paws to mouth. Immediately stopped dancing. Just stared at me as I bled. They tried to grab my hands and pull me to them, but their handler came and ushered them along. Oops.",

            "I watched Jack Sparrow talking to a kid when the kid started puking everywhere. He said \"too much of the ol' apple juice eh? been there myself! even ran out once!\". All the while, the kid is just projectile vomiting everywhere.",
            "A bit late, but I did the College Program at WDW. Never saw a character break when I worked audience control for parades. Definitely saw a a few fully costumed characters puke in their heads, and Prince Naveen once got heat exhaustion and managed to leave the parade route fully in character. Once the parade was over, we saw him in the back almost completely passed out. Typically the parade will just speed up to double time if a character actor is in distress.",
            "I was at Disneyland once and the Sheriff of Nottingham was fake-menacing a child. He reached out to touch the kid\u2019s balloon and for some reason it popped. The character actor was clearly stunned. A new balloon appeared less than 30 seconds later.",
            "Saw a recent video on youtube of a Rey talking to this little girl and her dad had just started filming. Apparently the story the little girl was telling got Rey laughing so hard, she had to turn her face away and eventually got up and ran away because she couldn't stop laughing at whatever the little girls story was.\n\nSuper adorable.",
            "I have a close friend who was Woody for a while at Disneyland. He said that one time the a float caught on fire during a show and they had to play it off completely in character. They danced around it and had to quickly get it backstage to deal with the problem. He said they played it off well enough that no one seemed to notice/there wasn\u2019t any panic. \n\nHe said he had never seen an instance of anyone breaking character because everyone was very well trained and there\u2019s always at least 6 or so cameras that can see you at all times. \n\nI also one time offered an unopened water bottle to an employee when it was near 100 degrees and he said if anyone at Disney saw that, he would be fired. They can\u2019t take anything from guests. He also mentioned the cameras constantly watching both crew and patrons.\n\nEDIT: I texted my friend to confirm and he has given me another story to share. \n\nOne time an acrobat fell off a float, face planted into the ground and knocked herself out. They had to surround her in a circle and dance in sync as they dragged her body away. They played it off well and apparently no one noticed.",
            "I've seen articles that face characters can leave at any time if harassment is bad, using in-character excuses. Costume characters always have an attendant with them to control unruly guests.",
            "Worked at the Disney Store in late '87 and '88 in Orange County, CA. I think, at the time, it was like one of only a handful of stores open. The back of the store had a big screen, where we constantly played some Disney video. Every once in a while, the biggest (muscular), blackest, gayest dude would come in and kindly request we play anything Pooh related. He'd then proceed to prance around the store (he came in the evenings, towards closing) and sing the Tigger parts of either dialogue or any song. Turns out he was one of the Tiggers at Disneyland. Dude just loved being Tigger.",
            "My cousin used to do this when I was a kid. We\u2019d always go try to find her on days we knew she was working. She mostly played Pooh Bear \n\nShe would never say out loud \u201cHi Noogatuck!\u201d\nBut she would get very animated and jump around to give us hugs. Occasionally she\u2019d still say things like \u201cI have a rumbly in my tummy\u201d\n\nI thought I was the coolest kid cause I knew Pooh bear.",
            "I wasn't a character but was a cast member. I was walking from backstage into the park. If you've seen the transitions, they are S shaped to keep people from peaking in. \n\nI was pushing a dolly/hand cart. The ones we used had 2 long supports sticking out from the end. As I was going though Winnie the Pooh was walking in from the other side. I hit him/her square in the leg with it. Hearing Winnie the Pooh say \"Fuck!\" was a pretty damn funny.",
            "A few days ago, me, my sister and her friend went to the new galaxy\u2019s edge area. My sister\u2019s friend was around 6\u20191\u201d and had never seen Star Wars. We were walking around and Chewbacca ran up to her (he was around her height) and hugged her. The he put his hand above his head (Showing they were both tall.) She was super embarrassed and while we were walking away, he did that fist pump thing. Since then we refer to her as Chewbacca\u2019s girlfriend. Seriously the cutest thing ever.",
            "I couldn't even get the zombies at Halloween Horror nights to break character. Asked one where the restroom was and he flung his arms in the proper direction and grunted. Pretty hilarious.",
            "WDW character department @ Magic Kingdom many years ago.  I can't remember breaking character but I do remember working the restaurant at the Contemporary for dinners; one time we had a \"Make a Wish\" kid as a guest and they were just the most awesome kid, and it was just heartbreaking to know why they were there.  So our Lead let us do a group hangout with the kid for something like an hour in costume, playing and running around and having fun; you could never play like that in the parks, you'd start a kid riot.  No consequences, we just all hoped we made that little kid happy.\n\nBonus fun fact: the Goofy costume for the Electric Light Parade was worn by a float driver.  Because the driver was seated -- no pants with that costume, just the glittery top and head and gloves.",
            "They do not break character.  My best childhood friend is a face character.  During the interviews they bring you through a TON of challenging scenarios like kids with lost parents, kids who act mean, etc.  If you break character, there are 1000 other people of your exact height and hair color ready to play the character better than you.  They even made her do an impression of a disney character without speaking.  She had to be able to just portray the essence of the character and if they couldn't guess who she wrote down her interview was over.  They are incredibly serious about staying in character.  Any time something bad enough would happen that they *should* break character, their handler would just guide them away and handle it themselves.  \n\nBonus info:  She isn't allowed to tell anyone who she plays (except family and friends) or post anything about work on social media for the entirety of her time at Disney or else she will be fired.",
            "I wasn\u2019t a character but worked closely with them, as a photographer. Disney performers are trained to never break character for whatever reason. They have ways of signaling their character attendant that they are in distress, and it\u2019s generally up to the character attendant to avoid any weird or uncomfortable situations. As far as weird situations, they do get people that \u201cstalk\u201d them in the park. Like some people get in those lines multiple times to get a photo with a specific performer. The weird side of Disney fanatics are something else.",
            "I don't work for Disney but I work for Party Princess Productions that does disney bday parties on the weekends. I was Darth Vader in Malibu for this kids bday. It was only him which was rare but we had fun. We played lightsaber hide and go seek where when he finds me we duel. I had him practice the force on me, helping him focus and toss me to the wall. \n\n In the middle of all the fun kid starts coughing. It's subtle at first then gets worse. Gets to the point he's not breathing and he's not moving. I took off my helmet and was about to perform CPR when the mother came out with his inhaler. She told me he can't play anymore because he has bad asthma and it gets worse the more active he is. I put the helmet back on played things off, we opened presents together and I left. To this day I hate that mother for watching me play with her kid knowing his condition and not telling me a word until the poor kid nearly suffacated. I called my boss and told her that I need to know all medical conditions before the party right away for now on. I hope that kid had fun, I still feel horrible for almost killing him from teaching him the ways of the dark side.",

            "I wouldn\u2019t say break but I was a lifeguard and I had to ban this kid from going down the water slide. Every single time I told him he had to be feet first and everytime he said ok. But he kept going head first and it got to the point where the other kids saw him and were copying him. \n\nHe left and cried to mom and dad and I explained to mom and dad why. They left and cried to my coordinator and my cord came back saying that wasn\u2019t very \u201cmagical.\u201d I explained after several times of this kid not listening, other kids were copying him. In any case I got a stern talk to about being the \u201cnice lifeguard who explains why versus the mean lifeguard who just yells orders.\u201d\n\nLater that day that kid was running across the deck, despite several requests not to, tripped and ate concrete. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nDon\u2019t hate me because I don\u2019t feel bad.",

            "My neighbor (he died a couple of years ago, so I'm safe in telling this) worked at Disney for years. One day he was stocking shelves in a gift shop and came around the corner and nearly ran in to none other than Paul and Linda MacCartney. Before he could stop himself, he loudly exclained, \"HOLY SHIT! It's the MacCartneys!\"\n\nHe immediately realized how big of a breach of Disney \"cast member\" ettiquette he had committed and turned twelve shades of red, but before anything bad could happen, Paul and Linda just smiled and laughed and introduced themselves. Apparently they were wonderfully laid back about such things, and quite used to surprised reactions when people recognize them in public. He didn't get into any trouble (his boss saw the whole episode and thought it was hilarious) and I think they both signed a hat or something for him as they were checking out.",
            "A face performer broke character for my husband and I. I won\u2019t say which park, but we took a trip to Disney about 2 months after our infant son died. He was our first. Our entire nursery was Neverland/Peter Pan themed. We always wanted to take him to Disney, have him meet Peter. Well, he couldn\u2019t. I got a memorial tattoo, an exact replica of my son\u2019s hospital ink handprint, and we got a picture of Peter Pan with the tattoo. We were alone with him and his handler. I tearfully explained the situation before asking him to pose with my arm. He took lots of photos with my tattoo and us. And afterward he hugged me tight, told me he was proud of me, and god bless us, and he was so so sorry for our loss. It was amazing, emotional, and I\u2019ll never forget that Peter Pan was proud of me for finding the strength to keep on living. It honestly meant the world. I\u2019m so glad he broke character. I\u2019ll always treasure those photos and that memory.",

            "One of the traditions for our college sorority back in the \u201880s was that the day after initiation, all the new members and their \u201cbig sisters\u201d would go to Disneyland sporting their brand new letters to wear. One of the costume characters in the parade kept throwing gang signs or something at us and we were so confused. Turns out it was one of our sisters who had to work that day. She was trying to do our sorority\u2019s hand symbol, but with her hands in oversized furry gloves it didn\u2019t show up so well lol.",
            "My wife was goofy for a semester in college. She accidentally ripped the feeding tube out of a make-a-wish kid in a wheel chair going in for a hug with poor visibility from the costume. Luckily all wandering costumed characters have uniformed handlers to assist, but it's kind of hard to \"stay in character\" as goofy after something like that.\n\nShe felt terrible and was traumatized for weeks. The kid was fine (from that incident at least). It was a hassle to mitigate, but no medical damage resulted from it.",

            "When I was 6 or so, I went to Disney World with my mom and aunt and cousins. I really wanted Capt Hooks autograph, but per his character, he wasn't supposed to give it. I started crying over it, and my mom went and asked him again (nicely, I hope) and told him that I was very upset over it. He signed my book, even though he wasn't supposed to, and I always thought that was neat.\n\nSo, to Capt Hook from 1989 or so, if you're out there - Thanks, and I hope you didn't get in trouble for that.",

            "Obligatory \u201cnot me\u201d but my best friend is a very popular face character and she\u2019s told me some hilarious stories. One time though when she nearly broke character was when she was doing a meet and greet thing, a young autistic boy came in who got very overexcited and yanked her wig off. They put hundreds of bobby-pins in your hair to keep them on so you can imagine the pain and she had to restrain herself SO hard to not scream out. She said the wig was hanging off her head and everyone in the room just froze. The little boy started crying hysterically and had to be rushed from the room. They ended up closing her room up so she could get fixed but she said it was a pretty crazy moment. Apparently the parents were so embarrassed they didn\u2019t even say anything to her and just bolted from the room with the boy.",
            "Awesome question. I don't work at a park, but I took some time to look through some older threads for some relevant responses to get the discussion going. \n\n/u/Theblkjedi said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/76rb80/seriouspeople_who_dohave_worked_at_theme_parks/dogh582/):\n> At the mouse we had a kid who had a check list shirt on. On it said darth maul \u2705\nDarth Vader \u2705\nThen the last one beat cancer \u2705 \nThe kid was 6yrs old. Then I\u2019m told backstage that the parents wanted to do something special for him in the show. But my director couldn\u2019t find a spot in the show where this special moment would work. So we finished the show (Jedi training academy) and set up a meet and greet with the kid. I get out there and this kid\u2019s whole family is at the greeting area, I mean everyone. So I hear \u201cok champ you ready!\u201d Kid reply\u2019s \u201cyup\u201d he pulls out this pill swallows it and the family breaks down crying! The kid yells I\u2019m a real Jedi! Come to find out the kid took his last chemo pill that eradicated his cancer in front of us. He waited al morning to show us that he was brave and a true Jedi. We were all holding back tears.\n\n/u/in_the_vortex said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qe3e7/employees_of_disney_what_is_the_craziest_thing/cdbwmdr/):\n> I worked at Club Disney for the brief time it was open.  We had codes we used on the radio headsets that were coordinated with character names.  For instance, code **B**aloo meant there was **b**lood that needed to be cleaned up immediately.  \n\n>One day, I'm taking a stroll around the club to check on things when I spot a small boy about two years old taking a massive dump right in the middle of the play area. He sees me, starts to cry, and runs away with no clothing on the lower half of his body. I get on the radio and can't think of what to say as we hadn't discussed a code for \"human feces in the play area and naked kid running around.\" So I just called, \"I have a code Pooh situation in the play area and Piglet's on the loose.\"\n\n/u/[deleted] said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qe3e7/employees_of_disney_what_is_the_craziest_thing/cdc4uxj/):\n> I was sitting with a group of guys by where Mickey and Minnie get dressed.

            "I'm not a character, but here is my story of it kinda happening to me. \n\nThe 1st week of January in 2018 my family went to Disney World, it being everyone's  first time except for my wife, and we were in line for the meet and greet where Kylo was on one side and Chewbacca was on the other. When we got to our turn, I let my 2 children who were with me go up first just so they'd be ok with him and so I could get extra pictures on my cellphone. At the time I had a huge mustache that came out right at the corner of my mouth but the hair could almost fall below my chin. Chewie saw me and got crazy excited, might've been part of the show. He pointed to my mustache and brushed his face then motioned like he was twisting his mustache hairs also. He really played  it up, howling, thumbs up, the whole 9. When we posed for our Disney pic, he actually brushed MY mustache with his hand and gave me an awesome hug. That was probably my most teary eyed happy moment of our trip. Kids didn't understand why I was so joyous. I told them that Me and Chewie bonded.",
            "Highly doubt this will ever get read but I have a story of someone I know who used to do the mascot stuff at Disneyland. \n\nBack a couple years ago he had to dress up as Nick from Zootopia for his shift. Now the thing about this costume is that the tail is massive metal spring to help give the illusion that it can move on it's own. \n\nWith that out of the way, one day he was doing his rounds with his partner (Judy) and they had a bit of a trouble maker (11 ish boy) who was being a little rough and pulling on his tail. Keep in mind this tail is pretty heavy at around 40 lbs and is attached to his back pretty firmly. With no real proper field of vision other than the tunnel vision they get, no breaking character, and no security near by to stop to issue, he was in a bit of a pickle.  \n\nFortunately for Nick, the father of said trouble maker told him to stop and apologize. He did so with a sour disposition that gave the impression he really didn't care. After said apology, a young girl behind him goes \"Hey Nick!\" and with out missing a beat he does a complete 180 attempting to hit the trouble maker with his tail. He gets purchase and smacks the kid with a good thud and knocks the kid on his ass. \n\nWhile he was giving attention to the little girl his mind was racing that he was gonna get fired for this little stunt, but luckily for him, the dad pulls through by laughing at his kid's misfortune telling him something along of the lines of \"you know you deserved that right?\".\n\nHe had some other stories of some of the stupid stuff they would do, but for reals, they drill it hard in your head when you go to work them to not break character period.",
            "My mom was a costumed character for a couple of years at Disneyland. She was very committed to keeping character, but there was one instance where she broke character. \n\nTwo teens jumped her when she was playing Piglet and started beating her. At first she just tried to block and defend herself, but at one point she knocked one of the boys to the ground and pinned him. Considering my mom's only 4'10\" and was wearing ~50 lbs. of costume I consider that fairly impressive. The other kid continued to assault her and I think she may have yelped or cried out because the kid she had pinned heard her and said \"oh shit it's a chick!\" Like, no shit dumbfuck. Most of the shorter characters are women because, well, they're shorter.\n\nCast members came to help her and the kids were banned from the park. My mom got in a lot of trouble for that too, though, because she broke character. IIRC she was suspended for a couple days.",
            "Not a character but my family went to disneyworld a few times when I was a kid.\n\nMy dad was abusive, physically and verbally. We eventually left him when I was 12.  He was awful on vacations for just being miserable in general.\n\nIt was valentines day and my mom, dad, older sister and I were at one of the parks (I dont remember which). All of the characters had big red hearts on a string around their necks. My sister was at oldest 8 and I would have been 6. We had just gotten ice cream and my sister and I were excitedly looking around for our favorite characters. My sister just saw Eeyore (her all time favourite character) so she turned around and my dad (not paying attention) ran right into my sister holding her ice cream cone and got it on his shirt. He hauls off and smacks her in the side of the face, knocking off her glasses and making her drop her ice cream cone. She starts crying as my mom starts giving him shit while he defended his actions, saying she should have watched where she was going.\n\nThe next thing we know is my sister is being hugged by Eeyore. It shocked her out of crying and she was suddenly so incredibly happy because EEYORE. Eeyore just kept hugging her while my mom started taking pictures. Eeyore stopped hugging my sister only to point to his paper heart then to her. Then he hugged her again. There is a picture somewhere in my moms basement of my sister and I standing with Eeyore, my sister beaming but clearly looking like she had been crying.\n\nI still think about that Eeyore to this day and wondered what they were thinking. It was the early 90s when people were largely still expected to mind their business when it came to such things, and reading these other comments makes me realise he may not have been able to do anything else anyway, but I appreciate his gesture nonetheless. \n\nThanks Eeyore.\n\nPost blowup edit:\n\n1. If you are currently crying in the club I apologize. Some days it be like that.\n\n2. No I'm not going to post the picture. Aside from it meaning I have to dig through literal thousands of pictured from my mom's film camera days that are in a town I no longer live in, this story is not about me. It's about my sister when she was a child and, while this is a heartwarming story to some, it's a bit of a tainted memory for us. So it wouldnt be appropriate. Plus I just really dont wanna *shrug emoji*\n\n3. We are absolutely in a better place. My dad lives several hours away with his wife and we see him perhaps twice a year. My sister has made some semblance of peace with him but I keep my distance because I have not and dont feel the need to at this point in my life.\n\n4. As funny as having Eeyore lay my dad the fuck out would have been, their actual reaction was much more in character and made my sister much happier than the alternative would have. Plus, on a suckier note, it most likely would have just made my dad more mad at my sister later.  You da real mvp Eeyore.\n\n5. Thank you for all the awards. All I ask is to pay it forward: if you ever have the chance, be Eeyore.",

            "Not a character, but a security guard. At disney, security has a \"character\" too. Look intimidating. And we can be. We've got a ton of different passage ways and some lovely cells we'll lock you up in if we need to.\n\nWell... This one day, there was a domestic case at the parks. The cops took \"dad\" away and I, from that point, was to escort mom and her little boy to their hotel room as they were worried that the dad would somehow sneak back into the property. They were VERY afraid.\n\nI was walking them and I hear the mother talking softly to her son. \"you see? Yor mama's strong and we'll be just fine, the two of us. We're gonna have a great trip. See that lady?\" she gestures to me. \"See, she's a girl too and look how tough she is! I bet they gave us the toughest guard around.\"\n\nWell later, I got called again when they were ready to go to the parks, as they were still paranoid that dad would come back. I was walking them and the little boy looks up at me as says\n\n\"miss? I'm scared. Are you sure we're going to be ok?\"\n\nAnd I stopped, knelt down to his level, and said \"you're going to be just fine. Your mommy's really tough and she was right, I'm tough too, and best of all, my best friend, mickey mouse , made sure to tell all the strongest, toughest people in the park to protect you today.

            "Not a character but worked there.  Disney has a hierarchy of what's important in a guest interaction symbolized by the acronym SCSE, which stands for Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency.  Safety first, obviously, and next is to be kind and courteous to everyone.  After that, protect the \"magic\", the show aspect of Disney by doing things like not walking through one land wearing another land's costume, or referring to Mickey as a real person instead of an employee in a costume (by saying things like \"Mickey's taking a break\" and not \"Fred's on lunch right now but he'll come out as Mickey in 15 minutes\").  And efficiency, which is basically another word for working hard.\n\nOne time during the Buzz Lightyear show at the Tomorrowland Terrace (called \"Club Buzz\" at the time), a kid came up to the counter crying because Zerg was beating Buzz (put him to sleep using a weird device on his back) and so the kid was really worried.  The mom wanted us to just tell him its fake.  We did, though thinking back on it, we could have say something \"show-y\" like \"Just keep watching, I bet Buzz will break out of his spell any minute now\".  But the kid was crying so me and the other cast member just told him what the mom wanted us to say.  No consequences because the boss wasn't around",

            "Sooo. Story time. I have 3 cousins who have been Disney princesses, 2 of which are still at it. About a year ago my grandparents decided to go visit one of my cousins out at Disneyland Tokyo. My grandpa had (has) relatively advanced Alzheimer\u2019s but he is generally easy to handle. Anyway, somehow he got separated from my grandma and started to panic a little\u2014looking for anyone he knew. Turns out the first person he found that he recognized was my cousin in full Cinderella character. (They allow the characters to come out and walk around the park in Tokyo because the Japanese are super respectful). He started to talk to my cousin, calling her by her real name and quite directly asking her where his wife/her parents were. He started to get pretty angry and frustrated when she wouldn\u2019t give him a straight answer. She kept character as best she could but her \u201chandlers\u201d whisked her away pretty rapidly. He was reunited with the rest of the group soon after but it was quite the scene. \n\nAdditional note/edit: Yes, it was tragic. Disney could/should show a little more leniency. My extended family just tries to remember it as a ridiculous chain of events and not as a traumatic one. It ended up being relatively ok in the end. Alzheimer\u2019s is a shitty disease, and I guess we think that it\u2019s still better to include my grandpa in family events and risk these kinds of happenings than to lock him up in some room somewhere where he would be completely \u201csafe\u201d. I wasn\u2019t actually there so I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing some details, wasn\u2019t expecting this to get as popular as it did.",

Everything went great, and at the end of the visit I told him I was going to work for the dark side.  As he menacingly stared at me while I told him this, my example of doing something evil was that I would go spill someone's drink.  This caused him to let out a barely-audible, breathy chuckle.  \n\nTo this day I consider that one of my greatest accomplishments (I have not accomplished much).",

            "Not me, but a co-worker of mine was Tinkerbell. Not just any Tinkerbell, but the flying one during Fantasmic! (Or whatever they call it now.)  At the time (I\u2019m unsure of now as I have since moved on from working at Disney) Tinkerbell as a character was never portrayed by anyone in a close up fashion; it was only portrayed through the show and therefore always a long distance portrayal. Well my co-worker was walking around Downtown Disney just burning time before she had to backstage to get harnessed up and a family was nearby and the daughter had collected nearly every character except a couple. The one she really wanted but didn\u2019t have was the Tinkerbell one, but because no one (at the time) portrays Tinkerbell in the meetable fashion, it would be impossible for the little girl to get it. Now, every cast member who becomes a character goes through autograph school,  no matter what role you have or how often to face guests in a close manner. This rule includes Tinkerbell. So my friend explains who she is and asks the family to distract the little girl for a few seconds, she signs the autograph book without the little girl seeing and gives it back. The parents exclaim something that directs the girl\u2019s attention back and they were like \u201cwow!!! Tinkerbell heard you wanted her autograph and came and gave you this and then just flew away!!!\u201d The little girl was so star struck.",

Scared and crying, I ran back to Aladdin and Jasmine (who were about to go on break) and told them I lost my mom. Jasmine comforted me while Aladdin went to look for my family. Jasmine held my hand and we walked into the alleyway I lost my family and I saw my mom. To this day, Jasmine is my favorite princess.

One story I\u2019ve heard is that during a family\u2019s meet and greet with Goofy, the performer, in Goofy\u2019s voice, whispered hi to the little kid they had. As the family was leaving, the kid told his mom that Goofy talked to him, but she told him that\u2019s silly because Goofy can\u2019t talk.

In reality, he couldn\u2019t see them as he was turning to walk away.  \nThe lady then called him racist, and said that Goofy was ignoring them because they were black.\nGoofy turned around to greet the child and signed his autograph book, and then turned to the mom, and slipped up his sleeve to quickly point at his own black skin underneath before walking away.\n\n[EDIT:  A few people commented that this isn\u2019t how the costume works, and that the sleeves aren\u2019t possible to pull up under the gloves.

            "Former Disney photopass!! I was a photographer at Magic Kingdom for a year and I got to work with the characters quite a lot. They have a way to deal with situations with characters. I have seen little breaks in characters, like laughing fits but not anything a guest would ever really think is out of the ordinary. If there\u2019s a costuming issue the attendant will fix it or pull them backstage quickly if they need to. If the character is having an issue of any kind that needs to be fixed they let us know and we try to fix it if we can.  I\u2019ve heard of stories (not sure if they are real or not) where characters have passed out on stage and have had to be dragged backstage, but most would say something before it gets that bad. On the hottest days set times are reduced, and higher ups are understanding when it comes to heat. \n\nNow the fun part. My favorite story is working with 2  characters. A cockroach ran across one of their feet and scared most of the cast members there (2 characters, 2 attendant, and me). The characters were freaking out the most and couldn\u2019t even talk, so one of them decided to distress (signal), then they both started to do it (both jokingly). Everything was fine, but that\u2019s probably the closest thing I\u2019ve seen to a break. People just thought it was funny. Another time a character tripped and fell. We were terrified but they were just laughing and totally okay. Most \u201cbreaks\u201d guests can\u2019t even tell have happened. CMs live and breathe character integrity so the chances of anything major happening is pretty rare.",

Sadness broke away from the kids, approached my wife and just held her hands for a few moments, looking exactly as Sadness does. The character, of course, wasn't demonstrating any emotion, but didn't have to because Sadness looks like this sad, empathetic person and it was just an incredibly touching moment.

One duck specifically she said was annoying when guests would pull the tail. She said what people really don't consider is how small the person is in those outfits. The heads are super heavy and the padding around the body is not that protective. She said teenagers and some adults were rude and inconsiderate.

That really depends on the character i was friends with that particular day, because that can be handled in character if youre a villian (or most often for me, woody). \nThe most impactful for me was doing dining at Cape May cafe at the beach club for the breakfast shift character dining.

You gotta move, but i digress.   So im chillin, spending a couple minutes per table, doubling back on families cause ive done full rotations.  \n     \nThere was a large family group at one of the long tables though, probably 10 people.  Id already seen them once and heard the cast bring out a birthday cake and sing happy birthday to the little boy sitting at the head of the table so i saunter on over as one would.  They sing and cheer and then the wait staff leaves and i notice lil bro with a super sad face.  The following convo happened on that paper (he responded vocally), and i think about it and that young man at least once a week ever since and im holding back some tears trying to write this right now; B is boy, M is me:    \n\nM: Why the long face, pal?   \nB: I appreciate the cake, i just dont really like chocolate anymore and it reminds me of when i did.   \nM(being a naive 19yo): oh boy that doesn't sound fun, what made you stop liking chocolate all of a sudden?   \n   \n  \n  \nB: it happend during my chemo, and it never has tasted the same since.\n  \n  \n\nBRUH.   \n  \n  \n  \n  \nI wasnt ready. Holy shit dude what do i say? What do i do? WHAT DOES GOOFY DO RN!?!? It was like a train hit me yall.   \n  \n   \nI deflated and  looked around at the family like od just beem tased lol. I was kneeling next to him this whole time so i did what character performers do better than ANY humans alive; i hugged him. I gave that young brother all emotional mana i could muster. I stood up, trying to hold myself together inside, and wrote \"you are stronger than you will ever know. We all love you so much pal\". I hugged him one more time, went straight back to the kitchen, found a vacant corner and just cried into my head, up against a wall until it had all worked itself out. Then i went back out and kept going until it was time for me to come off set.     \n    \nThat was the only time in my 6 years of performing i did that role or worked that location. I never got his name, but i cant ever forget his face. I hope he kept that cancer away, and that his love for chocolate came back to him. \nMaybe it was cause i was fresh on the job, and reality hit my butt hard, but of all the stuff i did at that job that experience hit the hardest. Maybe it wasnt very out of character, but to my take on goofy, it was. I was the one talking to that kid, not the fur."

Even now,10 years later with a pretty comfortable middle class paycheck I have to remind myself that I can absolutely afford buying a coffee on my way running errands or buying new hoodie, just because I like it, not because I have literally nothing to wear. I've been wearing hand me down clothes all my childhood and teen age years, so I taught myself to be numb to the subtle feeling of shame about how shabby I look, too.

I think I actually got pretty good at arithmetic from trying to add up the shopping as we went round the supermarket as a result.  Even when I had been working steadily for 10 years and had plenty of money in the bank to cover the cost, I would still have that sudden panic or fear everytime I went shopping and would have to check my balance before I got to the checkout.    It dawned on me a few years ago that I did not check anymore, but probably it is a big issue for many people living paycheck to paycheck.",
            "Friendship.  \n\nWhen you are the poor kid in a not so poor area your classmates treat you differently.  You are the inferior and are treated with contempt.  You are bullied constantly. Should you overcome the baseless negativity to start a friendship, you will find the first time you visit your new friend's house that their parents are judging you. They ask you questions on where you live?   What do your parents do?  They are hyperfocused on your behavior.  Rambunctious, excited, imaginative play is not chalked up to being a kid, but of poor parenting.  They notice what toys you are excited about because you don't have them. What clothes you wear and their condition.  They especially notice what car your parents drive should you be dropped off or picked up.  Generally within that first day they've decided if you are good enough to be friends with their child.  The answer is no.  If not then, within two weeks when they've found out who your parents are and are banned from ever playing with that person again.  Forbidden to even be seen talking to each other in many cases.  The parents ensure you or your family are never allowed to be \"a bad influence on their child.\"\n\nI was always aware of how cruel, petty, and illogical these adults were towards me.  All driven by economic classism.  They always thought that I couldn't possibly understand their meaning or intent.  I'm not sure if it was because I was a kid and kids aren't supposed to be intuitive or poor kids are all dumber than them.   Looking back I'm more sorry for their kids.  They started to make a new friend only to be crushed by their parents.  Kids being visibly fearful of being caught just for stopping to say hi is not something that can be good for growth.  \n\nThe really messed up thing about this experience is I'm only talking about relatively poor. My poor was just not upper middle class to rich.  My poor was the top of poor to lowest middle class.  Others certainly struggle far more just to survive.",

So many of these comforts have been denied to people. Both to those dying and those who are being left behind.\n\nIt has been a gruelling and incredibly depressing 18 months in this field, and I believe that we are going to see a huge amount of unresolved trauma and complicated grief over the next few years.\n\n(edit: grammar)\n\n(Edit 2: I just wanted to say that I'm blown away by the response my reply has had. Thank you for the upvotes and awards. But in particular, thank you for sharing your own stories with me.

I believe that healing can begin when we share the burdens we carry, and when we feel truly heard. \n\nFor anyone struggling with their grief, please reach out to support groups or organisations that may be able to help you. While demand for therapeutic services is at an all time high, we are doing our best to help as many people as we can. While grief itself is devastating, the complications of trying to mourn during a pandemic can lead to similar responses to PTSD, like intrusive thoughts and images, preoccupation with the person who has died or the manner of death, low mood and depression, anxiety, hyper-vigilance, and feelings of isolation or dissociation. Grief is inevitably painful, but stalled grief can be overwhelming. Please reach out for help. You don't have to do this alone.\n\nFor those, like me, who are in the helping professions, such as carers, therapists, healthcare workers, etc, your mental health is as important as the people you help. Vicarious trauma and burn out are real, and you will also need support. \n\nWe are dealing with a collective trauma. The only experience that this can be likened to is a war. We will need each other to make it through this.\n\nThank you again. x)",

She has never been to the park, the beach, the mountains, the zoo, the aquarium, she's almost never seen another baby in her life except on screens, she's never seen a restaurant or a shopping mall, we had to cancel every trip, every vacation, every birthday party for the last year and a half, we even had to cancel our trip to Disney that we had been saving up for since I got pregnant with her. I can't even take her shopping because people here refuse to mask up (AL), and every day her older brother goes to school there's a risk he will bring covid home (he's too young for the vaccine) and if my kids get it...

The callousness of it all is overwhelming. You've got millions dropping like flies and we are all just going about our business like it's a regular Tuesday.

One thing we regularly talk about in our meetings about covid are the long term effects that the virus is having on people who have recovered (commonly referred to as \"long covid\"). Some of the more severe long covid effects are atrophy of the dura mater of the brain, stiffening of the pleura in the lungs, and atrophy of the ventricle walls in the heart. There are many other effects like prolonged loss of taste and smell, chronic headaches, fatigue, joint stiffness/pain, and a pretty large variety of others.

            "Collateral damage. We talk a lot about people who die OF covid, but not much about the people who have died BECAUSE OF covid. My husband died because of covid, not from it. He had been battling colon cancer for almost 4 years when covid hit. They had removed part of his colon and did radiation and chemo and was fine, but it ended up going to his lungs. However, the plan was to use what they call cyber knife to attack any of the nodes in his lungs that started growing. One of them started growing and they did three of these super targeted radiation treatments on the node and it didn't exactly get rid of it, but it shrunk remarkably in size and stopped growing entirely. None of the other nodes showed much in the way of growth, so the plan was to do CT scans every 2-3 months to check on growth and if any of them started growing, they would attack it with the cyber knife. \n\nAll was going well, then covid hit.\n\nHe became too afraid to leave the house and go to the hospital for the CT scans. I knew his immunity was compromised, so I was the only one that went out, and I wore masks, limited my time out, and everything was disinfected before it came into the house. His oncologist cancelled his appointments but he was free to call if he needed anything. Everything was fine at first, but by May of 2020 he started coughing. He would occasionally cough up blood, but he refused to go to the hospital or doctor. He got to the point where he would cough so hard he would gag then throw up anything he had eaten. He was getting weaker and weaker. Finally in August he was feeling so bad I finally convinced him to go to the ER. They did a CT scan and told us to contact Hospice.\n\nHe died August 25, 2020. \n\nI am sure many people with health issues did the same thing. Put off healthcare for fear of contracting covid only to have their other health issues spiral out of control. I know my husband was going to die eventually, but I have the feeling if it hadn't have been for covid, he would have lasted another year or two.",
            "We're in the middle of a bizarre economic bullwhip effect.  We still haven't even felt the full effects yet.\n\nIn my industry, I deal with a lot of raw material suppliers as well as suppliers that provide high-tech equipment.  So, when prices on raw materials have gone up by 10%-15% and leadtimes are 50% longer, that's *before* our other suppliers feel that same pinch.  It compounds itself.\n\n***Suppose:***  *A supplies B supplies C supplies D supplies E, to you, the consumer*\n\nIf prices go up by 10%, that doesn't necessarily mean you're only paying 10% more...  Oh no.  If there are 5 tiers, and everyone has to make profit along the way, you're going to see a compounding increase of 60% *minimum* (in this particular scenario I'm dealing with).  It all depends on how many hands touch something before it winds up at the end user/consumer and how greedy they are all with profit stack.\n\nSo, it's dangerous to make any promises or major financial committments right now.  Based on what I am seeing in my industry, don't expect prices to come down on anything for quite a while.  7%-10% per tier across the board.

By contrast I find the film Trainspotting to be a much more grounded and honest look at the life and struggle of an addict. This is all based on my own personal experience, of course.",

            "I had a pickup truck, and anyone with a truck knows that means all of a sudden everyone and their cousin that is moving wants help.\n\nI'm fine with that. I had ground rules, and I didn't stray from them. You pack the shit, I just put it in the truck and move it to the new place. You tell me where the box goes, and once its down thats the end. Got a lot of pizza and beer, and cash back in the day.\n\nBut no no, thats not the direction of this story. I had an old acquaintance from school. We weren't close, in fact he was a bit of a bully, but he seemed chill enough almost 15 years later. He asked me if I still had a truck, and if I could tow his car someplace. I said sure, throw me a couple bucks and rent a trailer and I'm your guy. Have the rental arranged, and I'll show up with a hitch and we're off to the races. I told him here that I work midnight's, and I'm gonna be tired, so the faster its over the better for me.\n\nWell, I showed up, and he didn't have the trailer. OK, fine. We go get the trailer, and head over to his place. We get the car in, its all dandy. I ask where we're going. We're going 2 hours away. OK, that sucks. Just gonna race the car at the drag strip 2 hours away, do a couple runs and we'll head back.\n\nMy phone died, and my truck didn't have a clock. Fuck. Hes off racing his shitbox, and I can't find him anywhere. I finally manage to find him, had to be 4 hours later, and tell him its time to go. He says sure, just one more rip up the track. Fine. He disappears again, can't find him. I've got the truck running at this point, ready to tell him getting the trailer and the car back is his problem unless we leave right now.\n\nI'm exhausted. I barely slept, and I'm cranky. I see him flashing a big huge wad of cash. I think, well, at least I'm gonna get paid a decent chunk for my efforts. We get the car loaded up, and head back the 2 hours to our city. Drop the car off, drop the trailer off, and drop him off. He says thanks, and gives me 10 bucks.\n\nI'm astounded. I tell him \"dude, this doesn't even cover gas. It was supposed to be a half hour, and it was pretty much all day.\" He goes \"well, its all I've got on me, sorry man\"\n\nAnd that was the last time I ever hauled a car. Fuck that guy, god just typing this out made me pissed off.",

She wouldn't walk the 4 blocks then reported me to the group and got me kicked out for \"not following through\". I ended up with a fractured sternum, yeah Fuck that shit, never again.",

He gave me a sob story of why he was getting kicked out of his communal house and I offered to let him stay with me because I live alone and have my own place. \n\nHUGE MISTAKE! He hadn't hit a rough patch, he was the rough patch. Barely paid for anything and would get wasted while I was at work and be a total ass hole when I got home. Got fired from his job, ate all the food I'd buy and make excuses as to why he hadn't found another job yet. The absolute kicker was when I went home for my Nonna's funeral, he treated it like a mini vacation in my place. Invited friends over, played music so loud the cops got called and when he was supposed to pick me up from the airport, he was wasted at someone's house at 8 am. Never felt better than the day I kicked him out. No more financial and emotional abuse. Finally felt like my place was mine again. \n\nI've learned an expensive lesson.

            "I'm a teacher. A parent of a former student contacted me in an emergency situation, couldn't afford to pay bills, and needed help. She was super helpful to me in my first year teaching, so I asked friends and family to help out and raised her about $2,000. Never again. She has contacted me every few weeks since then, always with a new reason why she needs more money (and when I offer food and clothing resources, she refuses it). It has placed me in such an awkward situation and I regret ever trying to help her out in the first place",

            "I was walking to a concert in downtown Chicago in late November. This happened on North Dearborn right in the loop, if you've never been to Chicago its one of the nicer parts of downtown. It was a cold night, so I was walking with both hands in my pockets and a cig in my mouth. I was approached by a younger dude, who didn't appear to be homeless immediately as he was dressed semi decently and didn't reek or anything. He asked me if he could bum a cig, I was in a good mood going to the concert so I said sure and gave him one, along with my lighter. He handed me my lighter back and I expected he would keep walking on, but he matched pace with me and asked how I was doing. I told him fine and asked how he was doing, he said he's just trying to make it out here. I thought \"here we go\", he asked me for money because he said he hadn't eaten all day.\n\nNow I had about 200 in cash on me, mostly in 20s, I had maybe a couple smaller bills so its not like I couldn't give him money. But I didn't want to pull out a wad of any size in front of a guy I don't know on the street, and people can judge me or whatever but I'm not in the habit of giving money to homeless people but I always try to treat them with respect and dignity. I politely told him \"sorry man I don't have any cash.\"\n\nHe got kind of angry at that point, and launched into a guilt trippy tirade for the next half block or so about how nobody has any compassion anymore and sometimes people just need a little help. I didn't say anything in response. Truth be told I started to feel kind of bad for him, what he said is pretty true a lot of people aren't willing to help other people and sometimes people really just are down on their luck. I was second guessing my decision to turn him down until we reached the next intersection, I was going straight and he cut to the right. I had to stop for the crosswalk, and I watched him get not five steps away from me before he took the cigarette I gave him (that he'd barely sucked on because he was too busy yelling at me) out of his mouth and threw it on the ground. He then proceeded to walk right up to another dude and start talking to him.\n\nMaybe I didn't \"help\" him much per se, but if he was as down on his luck as he wanted me to believe he would've been burning the filter on that thing before giving it up. I instantly felt vindicated.",
            "Had a friend years ago who was a bit self centered & prone to stretching the truth, but he was a nice enough guy with a rough backstory and my friend group liked him, so I cut him a lot of slack.\n\nI like to host and I have friends staying over pretty regularly -- back then, I usually had one or two people spending the night on any given day.\n\nAnyhow, over the span of a couple of years this guy starts abusing that -- staying over for days or even weeks at a time, eating my food and drinking my liquor without contributing, that sort of thing ... While constantly talking about his grand plans and day dreams as if they'd already happened. A little sad, but also pretty annoying after a while.\n\nAnyhow, I sit him down one day and let him know he's gotta head home, and that he's free to come over and hang out but I'm not comfortable with him staying over for the time being. He leaves, I think it went remarkably well and head out to work...\n\n...and it turns out that he broke in while I was away at work and stole a bunch of my sister's things because \"his birthday was coming up and neither of us even thought to get him a gift.\"\n\nIt takes a special person to rationalize how *burglarizing someone is really their fault*. \n\nAnyway, all slack and sympathy went out the window immediately ...

            "My mother and her new husband had moved into a new place and invited all the \"kids\" over for Christmas. \n\nIn previous years we would buy a whole turkey dinner from somewhere so no one (me) had to cook, so imagine my surprise when my husband and I walk in, my mother walks out of the kitchen, hands me a spoon and says,  \"Good, you're finally here\", and goes to sit down in the living room.\n\nAfter a quick and awkward conversation, it was determined that my job was to make sure everything currently in progress (or not even started) got to the table on time, while everyone else socialized. Basically, I was the help and should have realized that, so any feelings I had about that were my fault. I was a good cook, and my mother taught me everything (not) so I owed her. \n\nSo I did, and not knowing the family dynamics, my new step siblings were very thankful and appreciative of all my efforts, which caused a meltdown from my mother about how we all should be thanking HER.\n\nThat was the first time I used a phrase that has come in handy for these situations, \"I'm so sorry, it will never happen again.\"\n\nAnd it never did.

            "We have helped out my sister n law a few times with money/bills.  Never a lot, $50 here, $100 there.  Usually for some bill to avoid services being cut off. I\u2019m usually the more heartfelt one in my marriage, but I ended up being the one to put my foot down. \n\nWent over to her apartment once.  She had two big flat screen TVs, new couch, new fridge, kids on PlayStation or whatever console she got them.  It was all Rent-a-Center stuff, but that was the end for me.  I didn\u2019t have any of those things myself, not to mention the incredibly bad financial decision those things were with the high interest rate.  Part of me felt like I was taking food out of her kids mouths, but realized that no, her poor decisions was doing that.\n\nEdit: Wow! Thanks for all the support (and awards)! The situation, on both sides, is way more complicated than I can put into just a couple paragraphs as you can imagine.  I want to help others and still do, but it is hard to keep supporting those that refuse to make any attempts to help themselves.  I mentioned below she has started to do things differently.

            "I used to frequently stay late at work for clients who showed up to the veterinary clinic last-minute with a non-emergency problem and no appointment. Then three times in a row, three different people were told up front about the after hours fee, agreed to pay it instead of scheduling an appointment for the next day, and all of them called back the next day fussing that they shouldn\u2019t have been charged extra for keeping us 30-60 minutes past our scheduled hours and that we were terrible and trying to scam them by charging for our time (even though we told them up front and they had another option). It was exhausting and demoralizing- we did more than we had to for them after already working a full day because a desire to help is why we\u2019re all here in the first place, and they responded by saying our time was worth nothing and we suck. The entire staff said \u201cfuck that.\u201d\n\nNow - unless it\u2019s a literal life and death situation - if we can\u2019t fit someone in before closing and they didn\u2019t have an appointment it\u2019s a firm no. I\u2019m in this profession to help others and I still work late for real emergencies when they happen or if an appointment runs longer than expected, but I\u2019m done sacrificing my personal time for entitled people who don\u2019t actually need it.\n\nEdited to clarify: The people did pay, but they were calling later to complain about it and demand a refund or say they were cancelling the transaction on their card. Instead of dealing with the headache anymore we stopped giving non-emergency walk-ins the option of being seen after hours. No animals were harmed and the staff (and their families) are all much happier.",
            "I was working at a fast food place when I was a student. I usually did overtime to help everyone clean up and close the restaurant until about 1am because we were so understaffed.\n\nI guess people got used to me staying late because one night when I was supposed to finish at 11, I overheard some of my colleagues (the stereotypical mean girls) say how bad the clients had cluttered everything tonight and how it was going to be a mess to clean up. Then they say 'but hey, [me] is gonna stay late tonight again, let's leave it to her, she always does the cleaning anyways', followed by laughing and some bitching about me.\n\nThat night I clocked out at 11 after doing all of my tasks at the counter and left. The girls stared at me in shock and when I was outside I saw one of them standing in the middle of the restaurant with her hand on her forehead, looking at the mess she would have to clean before going home.\n\nWeirdly, after that day, they started cleaning earlier without waiting for me to do everything!",

            "I used to babysit a newborn for our friends. It started out as me watching her so the dad could do side jobs to supplement their income. I didn't expect payment for it. I was doing it to help them out. Well, he started dropping the baby off so he could go play disc golf with his friends. He would also show up to drop her off first thing in the morning without even letting me know ahead of time. He would just be there and bright and early and be like, \"You can watch her today, right?\" He totally took advantage of the fact that I was a stay at home mom, and was watching his kid for free. (But he would say stuff when he was dropping her off, like how he wished he could afford to send her to a proper daycare that would teach her things... Like I didn't do enough for his precious NEWBORN spawn. ) It was frustrating, to say the least. As these things do, it came to a head. I saw on Facebook that he had gotten a full time job. So I was expecting to hear from him about watching her full time. The day goes on, and I hear nothing. So I figure maybe he's made other arrangements. I make plans for the following day because it looks like I'm not going to be watching the baby. Around 9pm that night he texts me to ask if I can watch her the following morning and I tell him no. He blew up and threw a huge fit. \"You knew I had work... Blah, blah, blah.\" So, I was supposed to put my life on hold because he posted on Facebook that he got a job? It was just amazingly inconsiderate how he expected me to be his on call nanny and he wasn't even compensating or offering to compensate me for my time. It all worked out in the end, though.

We walked out to her car and continued talking like friends, but as she got to her front door her entire demeanor changed. \"I actually don't know you that well, and I don't feel safe driving someone I don't know in my car.\" And she got in her car and left without a \"thank you\" or goodbye. MOA had closed, so I had to carry the equipment down that ramp, around the Mall, and back up the other ramp to the station's van. Didn't do shit for her at any other events again (though she was fired a few months after my internship ended.)",
            "I often donate to causes I feel strongly about and still do to this day, now typically it may not be a ton of money ($20/month as an example) but my rule is, if they contact you for more money you're likely going to have to discontinue. \n\nOne group called me and basically belittled the amount of money I was giving saying they really need people who are contributing $100/month or more, or large one time donations. I immediately told them to stop any further payments from autopay and to stop contacting me. It makes me reconsider charitable giving all together.",

His scamming strategy was pretty clever and I can see how people fall for it, but I caught on (thankfully). \n\nNow I focus on broad community initiatives and, if I do give someone something, it's only in situations where I know I am 100% safe and can leave immediately.",

            "Alright, my time to shine. \n\nHad a friend, call him Mark, who was going through a breakup and needed a place to stay for a couple weeks while he landed a new apartment. I just bought a place with enough room so sure, what the hell. Honestly just happy to see him getting out of the toxic relationship, so whatever I can do. The lease is running out for them, he just wants to spend the last weeks searching up a new spot instead of fighting. I sympathize, crash here. \n\nWell... They worked it out, or \"decided to keep trying.\" The lease is still running out though, so can they both stay here those two weeks while they search? They'll keep to my spare room, they say. Only bring the minimum of things they need, they say. Won't even know they're there, they say. Hoo boy! These are now red flag phrases for me forevermore. \n\nOf course I'm also going to help them move. Mark works long hours and the girlfriend, \"Laura\", can't drive, so I'll head to their old place after work on moving day, help load up the truck and then drive it to storage - you know, all those non-essentials they won't be bringing to my place. Mark will get home by the time I'm back, movers will show up for the heaviest stuff, we'll get them into my place and it's a done deal. Holy shit I was so naive. \n\nI get there on time. Laura is just getting out of a long bath, because she really wanted to soak up the apartment on her last day there. Nothing is packed. She's puttering around in a robe, lazily and haphazardly tossing things into boxes at random. The clock is ticking on the movers, the truck rental, and the hours at the storage place. So what can I do but help get shit into boxes? Laura directs me on generally where said shit goes. \n\nIt's not until Mark gets home that I realize how badly this is going; remember all the stuff that's supposed to be going into storage and not my home? It's boxed up with the essentials, the stuff going to my home. So now 90% of their stuff has to come with and they'll sort it out into storage \"ASAP.\" Just like \"two weeks\" this is a phrase that actually stands for \"whenever.\"\n\nHours of moving later, I got them started getting things inside my place and left to meet an out of town friend -- had anything been done according to plan, we would have been done by that time anyway, and this was already an abuse of my generous nature, so I wasn't going to skip this social occasion. I found out later they were moving in until 3am. \n\nFast forward. My friend staying for 2 weeks has turned into my friend, his abusive girlfriend, and their dog staying for 3 weeks... Then 4... With no apparent end in sight, because they're applying for certain kinds of housing and the approvals keep falling through. Fed up, I finally said as politely as possible, \"here is your move out date. If you're not approved the week before this, figure out plan B because I need my house.\"\n\nWell the week of reckoning finally arrives, and Laura tells me they're waiting on final approval (and that she could finally get in the last of the paperwork, now that I had brought her some envelopes from my office to send in the forms with...) and that it should be resolved in two more weeks. \n\nTwo. *More*. Weeks. \n\nSo I said \"bummer, where you going to live for the week in between?\"\n\nShe did not take this well. Pouted, waited to get Mark alone to tell him how offended she was, and instruct him to tell me to apologize to her... Which I laughed at and refused. She then started a text-based tirade against me for throwing them out, being a shitty friend, \"sorry we needed help\" woe is me, etc etc. This spun up into a full narcissist meltdown over a few hours and crossed more lines than I care to remember as she accused me of being every kind of shitty character you can name. \n\nThey moved out the next day and I changed the locks that night. Moved in with her dad for the interim, which it turns out was an option all along, just not as cushy for Laura's ego as squatting at mine. \n\nSometime in week 5 we all agreed that with this dragging on as long as it did, I needed some rent from them for the second month. Never saw a dime. When they broke up for good a couple months after, Mark had the balls to call me up, try to insist on a face-to-face meeting to \"brainstorm places for him to stay.\" Fuck no, Mark. You're hundreds of dollars and at least one apology in the hole already, and I can't trust you not to wedge into my house long-term anyway. \n\nLast time I'll ever have roommates. Last time I'll ignore my gut feeling to be generous to a fault, too.\n\nEdit: Hey thanks for the silver, friend! It's all worthwhile now.",

He had **nothing** he was homeless and on top of it had been robbed an hour ago. No worries, empty my wallet for the man, we all need help. Coming out of the shopping complex I see him hiding in the bushes opening a pack of smokes on a laptop while on his iPhone.\n\nThen a month later, saw a man I regularly donated to on Government street. I would catch him on weekends - but this weekend my drop-offs started early so I saw him as he arrived in downtown BR.

I was very hesitant to let him stay in our house but my roommate insisted it would be fine. The guy was the laziest, whiniest, useless fucking bum I have ever met. Constantly complained about the way we did things (in the house he was living rent free in), did nothing but smoke pot, drink vodka, and watch Youtube on his phone all day, and never contributed so much as a dime to the house. It's pretty obvious the guy's life consisted of freeloading until he got kicked out and then starting the sob story all over again. \n\nRoommate and I gave him the boot and he had an epic temper tantrum and threatened to kill us, so I called the cops and told him I was filing a restraining order and he better get the fuck out of here. He left in his shitty beater truck and we never saw him again. Any time I've heard \"I just need somewhere to get on my feet,\" I'm extremely hesitant and this loser did nothing to dissuade that.",

He said they didn\u2019t have the right kind at that particular store. I told him I\u2019d walk with him up the avenue, there was another pharmacy less than 10 blocks away. He walked for like 3 blocks as I tried to make small talk, before he said, aw man, I feel bad making you walk all the way there\u2014you don\u2019t have to come, could you just give me the money? I made up a lie that I was a country boy who\u2019d just moved to the city, I don\u2019t carry cash in case I get robbed on the mean city streets. He apparently gave up when he couldn\u2019t think of another lie to keep this going, so in about another block he said, oh, I just remembered, that other pharmacy doesn\u2019t have the kind she needs either. I offered to walk to a different pharmacy, but he declined, thanked me, & walked off.\n\nAbout a year later he walked up to me in the same neighborhood, and I immediately recognized him. He started into his spiel, and I said, oh, right, she\u2019s still on formula? Special kind, right? Locked in your truck again?

            "So I live in the suburbs and we have a food bank. My wife and I decide it would be a great volunteer opportunity to do with our kids with the hope that we can do this on a routine basis. So we sign up for a four hour volunteer window. The lady running the place is kind of bitchy, but whatever. So I'm stocking shelves and I'm working with my then 10 year old son. We are working our butts off and the lady running the place proceeds to start yelling at my son because there was a product on the shelf in the wrong place. First, we had not been stocking the area she is referring to, so it was not my son or myself that made the mistake. Second we are volunteering so don't go yelling at volunteers that are helping you for free and third and most importantly that's my son, so fuck you if you are going to yell at my son before talking to me first.  So bad start, just after that another father and son (this other kid is in my son's class) drop off like 5 cans of food. This lady running the place starts fawning over this other kid like he just gave this food bank a million dollars, all while still dismissing my son and the work he's been doing all morning.  Strike number two. Third and final blow, this lady comes in to receive FREE groceries. The lady pulls in driving a newer model BMW, dressed in nicer clothes than I own and has a designer purse (my wife recognized this a very expensive purse, i can't remember the brand). This bitch is slightly younger than me and starts snapping at me like hired help. She the starts demanding all organic food (which this a food bank and not Whole foods) so we don't have organic food. She then beging bitching because we were giving her generic boxes of food. The bitch that runs the place is trying to give this other bitch every thing she demand  and got upset with me because I packed in generic mac and cheese and not the Kraft Mac and cheese. Then they both demand me to carry out the groceries and put them in the car.  Yep I'm done, still get emails and phone calls to volunteer on a weekly basis, nope not going to happen.

            "I was asked by a guy I barely knew if I could proofread his thesis for him, and in exchange he would proofread mine as well (his was due a few months before mine). We were getting the same degree and even had a similar topic for our thesis, so this seemed like a good arrangement for both of us. (Spoiler: it wasn't.)\n\nHe had a mutual friend relay the thesis to me - as I said, I barely even knew the guy - and I started working on it. This was honestly the worst thing I have ever read by a fellow student, or probably by anyone for that matter. The title of his thesis alone had two errors in it and it got worse from there, the text was riddled with mistakes, I could barely understand the points he was trying to make and he was throwing around technical terms like he had no idea what any of them actually meant. What's probably worse is that everything was just so sloppy - he did not cite properly, used different fonts here and there, ended paragraphs mid-sentence so you had to read them several times just to get a hint at what he was saying. You know, if it had just been a bad thesis because he was a bad student I would not even be mad. But giving someone your thesis to review without even proofreading it once for yourself and spare the other person some work by correcting at least the most basic mistakes seems kind of ignorant to me.\n\nI went through the whole thing (took me about six hours), even though I already knew there was no way I was going to take the guy up on his offer to proofread my thesis as well. (He would have probably just made it worse.) I sent him the document with a final count of about 1000 comments / corrections made, and even some additional feedback on what he could improve in terms of structure, figures, charts etc. I don't even know why I put so much effort into this at this point, I guess maybe I felt sorry for him and didn't want to let him fail - which he maybe would have otherwise.\n\nWell, this was about three months ago and I have not heard from him since - no \"Thank you\", not even a confirmation that he got my e-mail. I asked our mutual friend about it and apparently the guy did get my e-mail and used my feedback to improve his thesis before handing it in. Well... you're welcome, I guess?\n\nSo yeah, I'm definitely going to be more careful with this kind of quid pro quo favors from now on, if you're not my close friend,  proofreading is gonna be like one beer per mistake. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

            "I\u2019d probably starve because I\u2019m lazy as fuck.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m vegan is because I realised that if I raised animals I wouldn\u2019t be able to kill them or use them in any way (taking calves away from their mother for milk production etc.)\n\nThat being said fair play to those who could, I don\u2019t agree with it but respect it regardless.\n\n**EDIT: spelt calves as calf\u2019s which some people politely and impolitely pointed out. \n\nJust to clarify as i was unclear- I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable paying others to do what I morally can\u2019t. I added about the calves to explain why I\u2019m not vegetarian instead of vegan- not to make people feel bad or cause debates (which I know with loaded topics like this it\u2019s inevitable anyway).\n\nI understand that on small family farms this may not be the case but from an industrial point of view (having family who have worked in many different butchers for years); some, if not most, people lie to make profits. \n\nIn a large business scale animals aren\u2019t living beings but commodity\u2019s or even just walking bank notes. It\u2019s easy to detach from the idea that meat is a living thing that feels emotions and has family and friends.\n\n I know I personally can\u2019t detach like that, I\u2019m not mentally \u201cstrong\u201d (or how ever you see it) enough to hurt another being, even in self defence against humans I feel terrible. If someone else can kill an animal for food then it\u2019s not my place to judge.\n\n I (and other people) cannot tell people how to live their lives. And I know most vegan things can sound a little \u201cholier than thou\u201d and I bet most people read anything with vegan in it and get defensive because you expect people to make you feel bad for what you do and don\u2019t do.\n\nIt may seem \u201cstupid\u201d to people but that\u2019s just the way I think. I work at an animal shelter so seeing animals in care settings constantly. I personally can\u2019t give a pig nose scritchys then eat a BLT but I know others who I work with who can no issue.\n\nFelt like a mini rant there- I am a human with flaws and issues and it\u2019s safe to assume everyone else is too (except that alien behind you).

            "As someone who works in the agricultural industry, I'm gonna answer for 99% of people and say no.  First, agriculture is a lot harder than most people think. It takes a lot of work and needs to be very precise to get right. Just messing one thing up a little bit and your whole crop can get messed up. That's not accounting for disasters like bugs, diseases, and storms. Second, unless you live in an area with beautiful weather year-round, your going to be severely limited what you can get ahold of. Good luck finding ANY fresh produce in Michigan in the winter. Third, you need GOOD land with access to water and equipment, all of which are expensive. Finally, you need a lot of time. This means working only part time or not at all and completely forgetting about any hobbies. ",

Although being self sufficient is always a good long term strategy. ",
            "The situation in which this would be necessary is the same as the meat question.  Would society have broken down enough to necessitate a return to hunting and farming individually.  If you wanted to survive you would need to hunt and gather.  If you would be unwilling to kill animals or plant enough food to survive, then you die.  Pretty simple really... And harsh.

We drafted everything, they were mid-70's to early 80's. Married 40 years total. Divorced and remarried once. Husband wanted us to put in his will that his kids get his entire estate, but did not want us to tell his wife. He wanted to have us make a secret will and a fake will. The fake will would be signed with her present, and then he wanted us to shred it and he will come in later to sign the \"real will.\" He copied his wife on the email that had all of this information disclosed in it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 weeks later he called us and said he wanted to file for divorce instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus one:\n\nA previous client was PISSED his wife was cheating on him.

            "I am a lawyer that handles quite a few divorces (among other things), and I've seen all sorts of reasons for marriages ending. The only thing that is consistently true (and relevant to this question) is that it is NEVER for just one reason, and it is NEVER one-sided. In fact, I've started telling potential clients in our initial interview that I am well aware that I am going to uncover some dirt on my client in the process--not to scare them, but to put their mind to ease that I've seen worse, the fact that you haven't been 100% an angel up to this point doesn't scare me, and I'd rather find out about it from my client beforehand than later on from their spouse at the worse possible moment.\n\nAll this is just to say that when you hear about people divorcing over one stupid argument or mistake, usually that's just the straw the broke the camel's back. That said, some of the lighter straws I've seen include:\n\n* A guy who is 100% convinced that his wife (our client) is actually a lesbian in love with his sister and just using him as a cover (but he also claims she is having sex with me to pay for her legal fees, and with every male who's phone number is in her call history);\n* A woman who is divorcing my client because he was \"too sad\" after his father died last year (my client had to break down her door to get his father's ashes a few weeks after he left the house and she refused to let him back in or give them to him); and\n* A woman who claims my client was emotionally abusive towards her because he refused to yell at her, and sat in silence ignoring her when she screamed at him (he has this recorded, time stamped for the dates and times she insists the incidents occurred, and she's listened to them and his complete silence as she goes on tirades and insists this proves her point that he was \"emotionally distant and abusive\").",

He was a good attorney but every day I would hear him yelling on the phone at his clients.  One day I asked him why he did when it was obviously stressful in a non-legal work type of way.  He pointed out that there's one chapter of statutes dedicated to it, and you need to know a little Civil Procedure and that's about it.  It's an amazing segment of business, not only is not that difficult from an intellectual rigor perspective, but holy shit...those family law attorneys make serious bank for willing to put up with the headaches.  \n\nI would routinely hear him yelling at clients like, \"Don't go over there.  I'm INSTRUCTING you to not go there.  If you go there, I will fire you as a client and when you go to jail I won't take your call.\"  (for the record: this was in a fairly affluent suburb).  \n\nMost of the disputes that would drive him into my office for a \"break\" would revolve around parents wanting to know their recourse for ex-hubby dropping the kids off 4 minutes later than agreed and how the client planned to get \"even\".  \n\nI also recall one time a client had gotten his cell phone number and called him on a Saturday evening with some \"emergency\" (spoiler, his ex- had done something egregious like took the kids to the pool without his consent).  So, on Monday morning the attorney sent the client an invoice for $500 for a Saturday phone call (which probably lasted like 5 minutes).  He did it so the guy would call him and say \"what's this?!\" and then the attorney could explain to him that is what he charges for non-emergency weekend calls, this time he'd waive it but if he ever did it again he could be sure to get a bill that he'd end up paying.",

She assured us he would agree to everything she suggested in the paperwork if she talked him through it.\n\nOne day, we get an email from her saying to halt the divorce.  Not because they were reconciling, but because he refused to keep her as the beneficiary on his life insurance if they divorced.  So, she stopped the divorce.

            "Not a divorce lawyer but used to practice criminal defence work. \n\nOnce had a heavily pregnant client that attacked her husband (of less than a year) with an iron. Said client was now sitting in a police cell, sobbing and insisting that her husband deserved it and she wanted a divorce.\n\nI asked what he had supposedly done, assuming he'd cheated or something similar. Turns out she'd checked his phone and found a single pornsite in his browsing history - from over two years beforehand...\n\nNot the most pleasant thing to discover, but hardly worth battering him half to death and demanding a divorce.",

She wanted to make some repairs on the house but, with their combined income, the couple earned about $1k per year more than the limit (to receive about $4k in assistance). She initiated the divorce proceeding in pro per but found out she only needed to have him out of the house so she filed to eject him from the premises.  ...which brings us to the day's proceedings...\n\nTo succeed on her motion to have her husband (who, unlike her, was represented by counsel) forcibly removed from the property, the woman had a hefty burden of proof. In the very beginning, she conducted herself admirably. She asked relevant questions (of her own husband on cross-examination) that comported with the rules of evidence.  45 seconds later... this wife was berating her husband on the stand about how he was a drunk, came downstairs naked once when her friend was over, and, was causing her mental trauma by his accumulation of alcoholic returnable cans*. Mind you, the non-alcoholic cans caused no such trauma. Needless to say, the judge reigned her in. She couldn't keep it together after that and almost had to argue her motion in contempt. Moral of the story: get a lawyer.\n\n*This is in Michigan where we proudly recycle... if only so we can return our cans for that sweet 10 cents a piece.",

They kept separate lives for 30 years.\n\nShe began corresponding with someone she believed was a 3 star General serving in Afghanistan.

            "I\u2019ve had a number of bizarre divorce cases in the handful of years I\u2019ve been practicing.\n\nIn my very first case, my client filed for divorce based on her husband\u2019s physical and sexual abuse. I later discovered that the husband had never actually abused her in any way, but she was using made-up allegations to gain an advantage in custody. The real reason she was divorcing her husband was so that she could marry the teenage runaway the couple had taken into their home a couple years prior. This teen was 15 when they took him (a trans male) in, and the week he turned 18- about a month after she filed for divorce- she came into my office and announced they were in love. Also, she had begun forcing her children, who were all 2-5 years younger than this kid, to exclusively refer to him as \u201cdad.\u201d I ended up dropping her as a client after she refused to stop breaking the law in trying to frame her husband for crimes he hadn\u2019t committed (like hiding drugs in his car), so I unfortunately have no idea how the case ended.\n\nI had another case where bestiality was a primary reason for the divorce.  Not the fact that one party engaged in sex acts with animals, mind you, but because one party began doing it without the other party present, and said party felt that was \u201ccheating.\u201d\n\nI had another train wreck of a case where my client filed for divorce from her much older husband (she was mid-twenties and he was in his 50s). She had always been a subservient wife, but the first time she stood up for herself and argued with him about something he had done (I can\u2019t remember exactly what he had done, but he was an abusive piece of shit), his response was to tell her he was going to have her family murdered. The next week, somebody shot her brother several times (he managed to survive), and she finally got the nerve to file for divorce.",

The day he found the papers he jumped into action, clearing out his money from any joint bank account, looking around for any evidence of her cheating, and then setting a time to sit down and talk with her. When he did confess to her that he knew she was filing for a divorce she basically said that she only married him because he was the \"safe choice\".

Obviously arguments are more likely to result in the phenomenon being described by OP's quote, so that's the relevance. But the method is, when the other persom has taken their turn speaking, you repeat their argument in your own words. If they are satisfied that you repeated it correctly then you can respond, but if they think you missed something they will communicate it to you again, and you repeat it again. The idea behind this practice is that in order to understand what someone else's argument is, you have to be listening well enough to repeat it AND you have to be capable of rephrasing it (which shows that you understand the concepts well enough to find alternate ways of articulating it) AND you have to be able to recontextualize it so that they still value the argument when they hear it spoken by someone else.\n\nIt's a tough thing to do because it takes a fuck ton of patience and it makes arguments so much slower. But without fail, when I've tried it with my gf, our arguments get solved so much more quickly. You've got no idea just how much time you waste in arguments uselessly going back and forth with your shitty one liners and insults and \"ugh no you don't understand.\" All that red tape adds up. This method immediately turns the argument into something constructive, since each person is essentially trying to help the other be understood.",

            "I used to do pool and spa maintenance in my 20s. I worked on one property with a mountainside, 10 bedroom/14 bath mansion, with a saltwater pool, tennis courts, guest mansion, and a servants house that was 4 bedroom 5 bath. The property had so much more stuff, but that isn't the crazy thing.\n\nI worked on this property for 2 years, year round, 5 days a week, and not a single person was ever there. The middle aged, single woman that owned it lived in a city about 4 hours away and just didn't come to the property, because she was so busy with work. A multi-multi-multi-million dollar compound, just empty. All the time.\n\nFinally, after 2 years, I got a call from my boss on my day off. He asked if I could go to the house to put some pool floats away. He apologized, because it was my day off, but said the owner would pay me $500 to go put them away. I was confused as to why there were even pool floats out anyway, because nobody was ever there, but I figured fuck it; $500 for 10 minutes. I show up to the house and the woman's adult children were staying at the house with about 10+ kids between them all, and they were having a massive pool party/cookout. I awkwardly walked up and said to one of the parents, \"Sorry, it must have been a mistake, but I was told to come put pool floats away, but you're obviously here so I'll leave.\" Presumably the woman's adult son said, \"Oh, no, we're getting ready to leave. You can take them.\" Then he instructed the kids to push them towards me. I literally grabbed one inner tube float and 4 pool noodles, brought them 10 feet into the pool house, and put them away. I, confusedly, said they were all set and went to leave. The son thanked me and handed me a folded mass of $20 bills. It was $400. I was expecting $500 from my boss for payment, but I figured $400 cash was still overpayment, so I didn't mention it. The next day at work, my boss gave me $1,000. I told him the son had already paid me $400, which was fine. He said the son told the woman how great a job I did, so she wanted to pay me $1000 instead of $500 and the $400 was a tip from her son.\n\nFor 10 minutes of work.... She actually called my boss the next day to ask if she should reimburse me for gas, since it was 15 minutes from my house. I told him that I was all set.",

She could be a doctor, a lawyer, or a businesswoman. Their son was lucky enough to study at the Geneva conservatory but that was only because he was really talented. In this family, if you didn\u2019t have a natural artistic talent you only had those three career prospects to chose from.

            "I worked for UPS for a hot minute as a driver helper and got to see some interesting things. The one driver had the rich of the rich route- the mansions worth tens of millions around the Ann Arbor, MI area. The Ford mansion, Lloyd Carr, the one recent guy for Michigan football that I'm forgetting that also worked for Little ceasers. Edit: the name I was forgetting was Dave Brandon \n\nAnyway I got to see Dave Brandon's mansion- it was gated, deep in the woods, and absolutely HUGE. The driver (a 33 year UPS veteran) told me these guys with these huge mansions like this, they don't live there by themselves. Sometimes don't live there at all. They move their entire extended families in there. Parents, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. And they all live off the rich guys dime, ordering whatever they want whenever they feel like it. I think we delivered 30 or 40 packages there that one day. \n\n2nd story from the same day and with the same driver, we delivered to a smaller (but still huge) house with an extremely long and wooded driveway. The driver was cursing about how much he hated these people because they always parked this huge-ass boat in the only possible turn around point in the driveway. So he goes in backwards- and FLOORS IT. Maybe 40 mph BACKWARDS, about 250 yards of bends, straights, and he drove it absolutely perfectly, never driving off or missing the driveway. We get to the house and he needed a signature. He handed me the package and said he'll get the signature and just hand them the package and we'll go. Well, we get to the door, and this maybe late 40s or early 50s man, kind of a rick moranis/George costanza type of build. Short, extremely thick glasses, balding, but very skinny build. He's standing in the front door with a lab looking dog on a leash. The driver says, good evening we just need a signature and we'll be on our way. \n\nThe guy says... No. I can't I have to take my dog out first. This fucking guy was fully prepared to make us stand there and wait for his dog to do whatever business before just signing his name and letting us drop the package by his door. The Driver said, no we just need your signature, and we'll be on our way and you can walk your dog. The guy said fine and took the 2 seconds it takes to sign your name and we dropped off his package and left. \n\nThat left an impression on me. That guy valued our time so little it was worth less than his dog's shit. Like he was in his own world, and we weren't delivering 300 stops just before christmas",

They're a bit out of touch with the realities of the world. I used to think that they were a bit naive too, because I saw a lot of other people taking advantage of them / outright robbing them.\n\nOver time, I realized while that's not untrue, it's more complicated. They did fail to notice a lot of... uncollegiate activity on the part of the people they hired -- but not all of it. What they did notice, they wrote off as the cost of finding people they could trust with projects that were *actually* important to them, and work with for years. So yeah, you could overbill them for a few thousand bucks once or twice, but if you worked hard and produced results instead, you could bootstrap your whole business to the next level with just them as a client.\n\nEventually, I realized they valued trust a lot more than they valued money -- they made their money with fairly long-term, high-risk, high-reward ventures running in parallel (e.g. research). So it all makes a little more sense now.\n\nI know plenty of rich useless people too, but... not very well. A lot of wealth is simply inherited in Asia, cashflow is a really difficult thing here.

Long story short the guy got really good and won several small championships earning a spot in a training camp with some of the current formula 1 pros.

            "I once worked at one of the largest private clubs in the world, in one of the little boutiques. In addition to clothes we also had a small selection of things you'd find at a convenience store, snacks, magazines and newspapers. For some reason these mega rich, high society people loved buying the magazines, and were kinda fixated on them (People, Us, Cosmopolitan, etc.) but they all acted like it was below them. Like it was trashy and frowned upon to look at them. The men would come in and grab their newspapers, buy a magazine and hide it inside the newspaper so no one else at the club knew they bought it. The women would come in and buy multiple, asking if we had newest editions yet, and then hide them in their purses. One of them, who was a Golden Globe awarded actress, got a magazine with something about The Bachelor on the cover. I said to her \"omg I love that show, do you watch it?!\" (this was before I knew it was taboo, also don't come at me, I love me some reality shows) and she got SUPER weird, like all embarrassed. She looked around making sure no one heard me say it and was all paranoid. She was pretty friendly with me up until that point and afterward wouldn't really make small talk with me anymore. I wish I could have said to all those people \"don't you realize you ALL buy these magazines?!? That's why we keep them in stock!

There is a very nice Safa couple I clean for who have an amazing house that always smells great and doesn't really need regular cleaning, it's always just so nice. Besides some lovely accessories, they don't really have anything particularly spectacular. Just a well decorated modern home, nice alcohol, business casual and a nice attitude. Most of our (probably) *verrrry* wealthy clients are like this.\n\nMeanwhile we also clean for some rather reckless clients. They are wealthy but don't have fuck-you-money. Their houses are usually messier and they are usually not that pleasant to us either. Nice cars, designer bags and glasses. Houses look great from outside but inside looks like the A-bomb was dropped.

I have a lot of \"super-rich\" clientele, but my scope is fairly narrow to gems (and I guess watches). \n\nPeople spend millions of dollars on natural fancy colored diamonds, and hundreds of thousands on colored gems like Sapphire/Ruby, Emerald, Paraiba. The higher-end gems are investments, although they tend to buy them in jewelry form so they can be showcased via wearing. Hundred-thousand-dollar watches are fairly normal (Patek, RM, J&co, etc...). \n\nIn terms of outside of direct business, I do hang out with them, and it's mostly just overpriced things for the sake of being able to afford it. Expensive real estate is one thing since you at least keep it as an asset, but spending tens of thousands on a bottle of wine is another.

            "My favourite story about a rich kid actually involves consequences and lessons learned!\n\nI had a friend who was from a wealthy Saudi family. But just \u2018wealthy\u2019, not \u2018superyacht wealthy\u2019.  He is the eldest son of the family, so he comes to Canada for his university degree and the expectation is he\u2019ll work a few years in banking before returning home to manage the family\u2019s businesses. \n\nThat all goes according to plan, except after his business degree, he\u2019s working the same meh entry-level banking job that I am. Which is a pretty solid job for 22-year olds, but about 16 levels below what his privileged family would expect someone of their social rank to get, since Canada doesn\u2019t quite work like that (again, he wasn\u2019t super-rich, or else it would work like that here too of course!)\n\nSo after a year or two, his family decides he should just come home. But he was never really the \u2018wealthy-heir\u2019 type and quite enjoys Canada and the low-pressure career he has embarked on (he was good at his job), and has even met a lovely (non-Muslim!) woman.  So he wants to stay, and secretly applies for permanent residency.\n\nA few months go by, and time is running out for his application. He finds out his family has been applying pressure to hold it up. After a fight with them, he gives in and agrees to come home. As far as he\u2019s concerned, he is leaving Canada forever. So what does he do\u2026applies for as much credit as he can and runs it to the max! And he gets a decent amount, since he has been in Canada for years, has regular income, etc. He maxes everything out, mostly buying clothes and renting fancy cars but also donates a bunch to our team\u2019s social fund and a friend\u2019s charity drive, as well as spending over $1,000 helping our coworker buy their schoolbooks for the year. \n\nHe puts in his resignation, we have a goodbye party, it\u2019s all a bit somber and sad. The day before he flies out, he has another argument with his parents. Apparently his younger brother is also turning away from the family, and this has given the parents a softer approach\u2026they agree to let him stay! He gets a visa extension, his family calls the local embassy and his permanent residency magically gets pushed up and approved.  It\u2019s honestly a really moving situation, to see a conservative religious family really take a step back and evaluate things, and to allow their eldest son to go against their plans and pursue his own happiness. Our company allows him to rescind his resignation, we have another party to welcome him back, and he proposes to his girlfriend (married now for 8 years).\n\nSo everything is amazing, except the joker now has credit card debt that\u2019s twice his annual salary! Apparently he was too ashamed of it to even tell his parents what he did, so it was all on him. So for the next 3 years, he had the most amazing suits and ties, lots of fancy customized stuff\u2026and was eating ramen or canned tuna every meal.  To his credit though, he worked hard, lived frugally and paid it all off. Now he has a senior banking job, a happy marriage (as far as I know), and a strong relationship with his family.",

The billionaire thought that was peak comedy and cried laughing about it the next day.\n\n-  After watching Mr Deeds, my step-grandpa was convinced that the Hawaiian Punch scene was based on the billionaire because he was a Hawaiian Punch fiend.\n\n- Was bummed when nobody visited his house for trick-or-treating the night before. His whole ranch is gated and the front gate is 3 miles from the house.\n\n- His wife made him throw away his bowling ball that had a replica of his head in it. He was extremely proud of that bowling ball and didn\u2019t understand why it bothered his wife. \n\nThere are many other stories, but those are my favorite. Everyone says \u201ceat the rich,\u201d but if they do, I hope they spare him because he seems like a top notch guy. He\u2019s old as fuck now and probably won\u2019t make it much further in life. I hope I can meet him one day.",
            "One of my dad's best friends made hundreds of millions buying and selling oil refineries in the 1980s/90s. In his 60s he decided that he'd accomplished his professional mission and let his freak flag fly. He's the friendliest, goofiest, and most down to earth person you'll ever meet.\n\nHe drives around in a busted looking but fully functional car from the 1930s. He hand painted a folksy-looking American flag on the driver's side door and loves it when people wave at him while he drives by.\n\nHe submitted his very first painting (made while he was in his 60s) to a local art competition. He won first prize and for the next month he walked around with art catalogues stuffed in his jacket pocket handing them out to anyone who'd listen, because his painting was on the cover. \n\nHe now collects antiques, but not fancy/expensive antiques. He loves fun and colorful American folk art from the first half of he 20th century and fills his home with it. He spends his days driving around the county and dropping in on his friends to tell then the latest dad joke he heard. He's kind of my hero.",
            "When I was younger I worked for a chain restaurant and moved to Florida to open a new store. Found out that a few of the new hires were insanely rich kids that got the job for fun and to meet people. It was kinda crazy. One of them gave me a set of NHL Playoff tickets to the Flyers vs Panthers that he had bought thinking they would be playing the Rangers. Him and his girlfriend lived in my apartment complex and would routinely buy me shit like groceries and stuff because they hung out in my place a lot playing Playstation.\n\nAnother one was a girl I dated that was Wayne Huizengas niece. Shed literally babysit for Dan Marino. Same deal. Shed buy me all kinds of groceries and come over to cook for me all the time. It was weird but very cool.",
            "Obligatory not somebody who catered to the super rich, but I went to school with someone whose family was decently wealthy. Their parents bought a whole house near the school so they could spend their breaks there. Had their own driver and an expensive ass car. Last I heard they were burning $300k+ at an Ivy.",
            "I clean houses and I've learned, that generally, the more money they have the nastier they are. One couple had six bathrooms. I cleaned once a month and every single toilet would be decimated. Dried diarrhea down the sides, on the seats, on the fucking flusher handle. Globs of toothpaste everywhere. They had a huge walk in closet with a lidless trashcan. It was filled to the top with piss soaked adult diapers. No lid. The whole closet reeked of piss..even their clothing. The kitchen was.....let's just say I had to spray everything down with cleaner and let it sit while I cleaned another area and then I had to use a scraper to get the counters clean. They literally never wiped them down after cooking/eating. Appliances and sink weren't any better.   \n\nAnother lady had a fondness for butt plugs. Problem is that she didn't clean them. She'd toss it in the nightstand drawer and buy a new one. I know this because she left the drawer open once. There were a dozen or more very used, very dirty butt plugs in there. Caked in dried shit. People are fucking gross. I refuse to clean for the wealthy anymore. No amount of money is worth a hazmat situation.",
            "Not exactly cater but.. I felt the need share.\n\nMy brother married into a multi-billion old-money family. The family celebrates it's \"own\" holidays, usually the birthdays or deathdays of past family patriarchs. For one such occasion my brother invited me to come along as a glorified nanny for my nephew and niece. I decided to join.\n\nHere's a list of some of the weirder things.\n\nWhile they had an army of chefs and other staff on payroll, when it was time for the holiday dinner, the serving was to be done by the youngest generation, and everyone had to pretend that grandma had cooked everything herself by hand, even though everyone knew that everything had been prepared by the chefs. \n\nEveryone wore old clothes, not in terms of style, but their actual old clothes. Wearing the same sweaters they wore as teens or young adults. My brother got to borrow one of his father-in-laws old sweaters. I was more dressed up, which meant I very much looked like \"the help\".\n\nThey had a small ceremony where everyone took turns in getting down on their knees in front of the patriarch and matriarch who then gifted them some small heirloom or other trinket and told them the story behind it.",
            "A lot of fighting and also not wanting to divorce and lose 1/2 their money, all while ignoring their kids abs buying expensive cars and houses.",
            "Worked in a deli/brewery place. One of the local rich guys always came in and was super nice, tipped appropriately. Sometimes when it was slow he\u2019d come in just to chat and for whatever reason he\u2019d always leave us all $5 each \u201cfor our time.\u201d \n\nHe even helped me roll silverware one morning",
            "I\u2019m a nanny to rich folks (by my country\u2019s standards) and I see waste like you wouldn\u2019t believe\u2026 getting packages daily, eating out, presents for the kids every week, food deliveries, friends in the guest suite every month. The worst I\u2019ve seen is their disciplining, because they\u2019ll use the threat of me leaving/quitting to incite better behavior.. at the end of the day the children love me but I\u2019m just replaceable staff:\u2019)",
            "Owner of company Rented 2 yachts and owned 1 personally for company outing. Every yacht had staff to serve food and alcohol unlimited. One of the yacht had 5 bedrooms and few jacuzzis",
            "I used to chaperone groups of foreign students on field trips around LA while they were taking English classes/participating in exchange programs. Sometimes it would be big groups from one country (like, an entire class of teenagers from France or Korea), but occasionally we\u2019d get people that would come on their own from almost every country\u2026 and that\u2019s how I met the princesses from Kazakhstan. \n\nWhen we did our photo op at Rodeo Drive, they brought things to return.",
            "I was (and still am) friends with the CEO of my last employer, which I joined at 24 when we had about 40 employees. Well, those 40 employees are now something like 5,000 around the world and he sold the business (while remaining CEO) for a reported \u00a3200,000,000. \n\nHe was and still is one of the kindest guys I know. Still replies to texts and came to my leaving drinks. The only time I saw him do anything ridiculous was when me and a workmate turned up to the pub to find him already there. His eyes lit up as he waved the company credit card, yelled \"It's tax deductible boys\" and bought us some of the finest whiskies in the place. \n\nDue to being a weird guy, I always approach everyone as a friend. And that's how I always treated him. At my leaving drinks, he asked me why I didn't come to him directly when another business offered me more (my boss's boss was an elitist prick) and that was my answer. We're friends. It didn't cross my mind once. \n\nI last texted him about 9 months ago to congratulate him on the company's success. He texted me straight back. The next day, he was on the cover of a major industry magazine. \n\nSometimes the craziest thing a wealthy person can do is surprise you by staying true to themselves."

            "A human bite. I worked at a kindergarten and one kid was sometimes super sweet but sometimes really mean. He could switch in a second. While I was naming the colouring pages they were about to get he walked up to me and bit me in the arm. Didn't think it was through, cuz no blood. But it started swelling and getting red and the marks were clearly there. Went to the doc right after my shift. He explained a human bite is the second most dangerous bite there is. Got antibiotics but they didn't work. Arm just kept swelling and getting completely dark purple over two days. Doctor sent me to the hospital where I got strong antibiotics. Basically everything in me was cleaned with that shit, felt weak for months. If it didn't start working by that night is have to come back and be hospitalised to get my underarm removed. I've shat some bricks there. Never thought a kids bite could cause this. Luckily the swelling got less and the bruise stopped spreading so I still have my arm, but that was very close.\n\nEDIT: For the people who asked me if I punished the kid, his parents did that for me. My coworker reported the incident to the parents and it was one of his last days there as they were moving (this was planned before he bit me.) His parents were really sorry and a few days later when I worked again, it was the last time I'd see him and the parents brought him towards me because they wanted him to apologize. My arm was still fairly swollen and purple at that point and he was absolutely shocked that he had been the cause of that. He apologized with tears in his eyes and actually hugged me. He promised me never to bite anyone again (apparently he had bitten his family and even other children before! So far no one had gotten an infection apart from me.) and I really think he meant that. Still had a good day with him, but was still pretty mad as I was scared my antibiotics stopped working or something but now that I think back on him he's not a bad kid, just a troubled mind that didn't get the right treatment.

Just to put some paint on a wall or train and take a photo of it.  \n\n\nEDIT: Yeah I definitely got some kicks, the big kicker was watching a train go by and seeing 4 or 5 of my pieces on it, or seeing something of mine in a newspaper. I put it down to being fascinated by the artform, and not normally feeling anything due to the antidepressants I was on at the time. The anti's helped with the anxiety and fear of doing criminal stuff too. Like having the mental battle with myself to force myself to break into a train yard or paint a wall in-front of cars on the highway.  \nI haven't done any illegal stuff for a few years now, I have things to live for. It was a very strange time in my life to say the least. Thanks for reading.",

Every time you move, there's a risk of being involved in an accident (especially by crazy drivers who drive like they're in a Fast and Furious movie). Then you risk picking up crazy passengers or drunk ones who would vomit in your car. If you somehow end up picking a \"Pool Ride\", which turns your car into a damn bus and you have to pick up different people and they all sit together, there's a huge risk they're gonna start fighting with each other or maybe one of them could turn out to be a mugger. You can pick up problematic people, like potentially sick ones who might give you some kind of sickness or another. Then let's not forget there are people who would risk their lives during an emergency and order an Uber ride instead of taking an ambulance to save money, and of course guess who's gonna be responsible if they suffer or die in your car. Then there are those MINORS who would order a ride even if they're not allowed to do so, which wastes your time as a driver because you're not supposed to pick them up. If you do pick them up and you get into an accident and the minor gets hurt or dies, guess who's responsible for it, again. \n\nAside from life threatening things, you alone have to deal with the car's maintenance and filling it up with gas every day.

            "One day I was walking down the street from my friends house back to my home. Like a 5 minute walk. As I'm walking down there was a couple in front of me, a woman and her boyfriend. \n\nWe keep walking down and this guy is shouting abuse at her, treating her like a dog, being aggressive. She does not seem in a good place. \n\nWe get to my house, I live above a shop. So the guy goes into the shop while the woman waits on a wall nearby. I go over to her quickly, ask her if she's okay, does she need help, can I ring the police and make sure she knows I will protect her from him if needed. \nShe says she's okay but thanks me. I tell her to contact the police if she needs to, no one deserves to be treated like that, but otherwise resign myself to knowing I did what I could. \n\nThe boyfriend comes out of the shop, I walk towards the shop, not going home yet as I don't want him to know where I live. He walks over to her and they proceed to cross the road. During that time she must have told him what I said. \n\nThe guy walks back over towards me, shouting abuse and telling me to keep my nose out. Now he's a big guy and I'm a 5'3 woman. I will not be talk to like that. So I give as good as I get and tell him if he does anything to her I know what he looks like! \n\nHe proceeds to curse me out some more. The bad thing was even though I took a risk and that woman then put me in danger for trying to help her, and I was scared, I still felt bad for her. They looked like substance abusers and I just wish she had accepted my help and got away from him, even after throwing me under the bus.",

I cleaned out the French class then moved onto history, then English then every one of my classes no longer had scissors. That was around fifty pairs. Then they all got new ones before I cleaned those out too. This went on until I had around 200 pairs and my parents couldnt ignore my ever growing pile of scissors when they caught me.

Because of this I always pictured snow as eternally white and ethereal, like in all the cartoons I'd watched as a kid.\n\nWent to spend time with my partner's family back in the Midwest in early February. I was absolutely enchanted on my first day of the two week stint. Then I watched what happened as the snow stayed around.

I didn\u2019t learn until a few days ago that microwaving metal might start a fire. \n\nHow can I not know? I don\u2019t own any (edited for clarity) metal cups, plates, bowls or serving dishes at home. I know not to leave cutlery in the microwave, but I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s because they\u2019re made of metal.

And I lived happily ever after alongside this ignorance. \n\nUNTIL I don\u2019t anymore. \n\nDuring a volunteer shift I was asked to microwave several pet food bowls for our finicky eaters. One of the other volunteers quickly pointed out there are paper plates nearby and then left. I didn\u2019t get it. Why would I need paper plates? \n\nI couldn\u2019t figure it out, there\u2019s nobody around to ask, and the dogs need their dinners, so I just chucked the bowls in the microwave. The METAL bowls. What are those crackling sounds? Huh, that\u2019s strange, some sparks are flying. Yeesh maybe this microwave is old. \n\nJust as I started wondering if I should take the bowl out, another volunteer walked past, spotted my innocent attempt at arson and straight up divebombed into the kitchen yelling STOP STOP STOP!! TAKE IT OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\n\nLuckily I stopped the microwave before armageddon happened. Unluckily, I now must explain myself. The sheer LOOK on this poor soul\u2019s face when I honestly told him I didn\u2019t know is still branded to the back of my mind. I swear I could almost hear his thoughts. Am I lying? Has an arsonIST (cheers, grammar nazis) successfully infiltrated their organization? Am I just that dumb? Is it possible to be so dumb? What ELSE do I not know about the world? Am I an alien studying human life?\n\nLong story short, the other volunteer gave an overly detailed explanation about why metals can\u2019t go into microwaves, I apologized profusely, and now I don\u2019t volunteer there anymore.",

Although I did wonder why we were packing so much stuff. After a few weeks of \"camping,\" I started to complain, but my mom kept insisting that it was good for us to get in touch with nature, etc. Then school started, and we were still camping. And we kept camping for another 6 months. When we finally got a house, my mom cried with joy. And we don't camp anymore.",
            "I was 13 when my parents kicked me out and told me they no longer wanted anything to do with me. I was terrified to visit a shelter because I'd known some foster kids and the whole system scared me plus I wanted to continue going to the same school. In didn't want to lose my friends too. The scariest part at that age was really finding out what I was hoping to eat. There had been a dilapidated trailer just minutes down the road from my dad's place so I stayed in that. \n\nI don't think it all really hit me until I had to choose one night between food and blankets because the temperature was expected to drop down to the mid 30s and I had only had one somewhat thin blanket at that point. The next day, I put on my best attire which was nothing impressive and asked for a job at Long John Silvers. I lied and told them I was 15 and I worked 5 days a week rushing over after school.\n\nI ate more unhealthy than I have since to save money for some form of shelter which came in the form of a 91 Toyota Camry that I purchased out of the Thrifty Nickel for $300. I loved that clunker plus heating myself was much easier. \n\nFrom there it was mostly uphill. Found an older lady willing to rent me her garage without any sort of credit check. Took a couch off the side of the road to sleep on. I even had internet in there where I mostly read scary stories all night (I wish video streaming services were really a thing back then) and I just kinda... Learned to roll with the punches.

The first night was hell but the next several weeks were actually not so bad. I had a spot in the woods where I was well hidden and would cook over a fire.\nI really didnt have it that bad but it gave me quite a bit of sympathy for people who really do end up on the streets in a much more desperate situation.

After several years of depression and anxiety slowly eroding my resources, relationships and general will to try anymore, I ended up having a final blowout with my gf, who reasonably couldn\u2019t handle me anymore.\n\nI started sleeping at work, which wasn\u2019t even a full-time job.\n\nThe delicacy involved in not getting caught, and the freedom from the extremely unhealthy state my relationship had been in, kept my mind away from the absolute, abject terror that was hiding beneath the surface; the scary part of homelessness for me was the growing sense that if I fell any further I\u2019d probably never get back up. It takes resources to be clean, fed and rested, and if you aren\u2019t those things it\u2019s very hard to get resources, let alone find the will to try. But that first night was all triage, all focused on being sure the second night wasn\u2019t going to be on the street.\n\nI pulled it off for six weeks, and that time, actually, saved my life; I was away from conflict,  intimately connected to how dire my circumstances had become, forced into a very regular schedule (routine is *really* good for me but nigh-impossible in a depressive state), and, without bills, was able to save enough for damage-deposit and rent.\n\nI still struggle with depression in a pretty serious way but the animal terror of having no where and no one really seared itself into me. A better motivation would be the-future-i-want than the-future-i-fear, but as it stands I at least have a motivator strong enough to escape the incredible gravity of mental illness.",
            "Sleeping in my car wasn't that bad. It was summer, so it was pretty warm which was my biggest issue. \n\nShowered in the gym, and spent most of my day at the library before going to work. \n\nFor the first few nights it wasn't bad. However one night police found me sleeping in my car and escorted me to the local homeless shelter, which was one of the most terrifying nights of my life. Since I'm lying there in a top bunk, when a huge argument breaks out because one guy breaks out some meth, wouldn't share it with a second, then a third got pissed and started screaming at them to be quite because he needed to sleep.\n\nEdit: since this is coming up a lot, people keep asking how it was legal that the police escorted me to the shelter. I don't know the legality of the issue, what I can say is that I was woken up by a knock on my window to see four cops, two cop cars, they were singing those super bright flashlights through my window at me, and I didn't even think of arguing with them.",
            "When you're a teenager it seems kind of cool to sleep in the car, on the couch or floor of a friend or acquaintance, or for your dad to scam a rented apartment for a month or two without paying for it. Moving around every few months carrying everything that you can in an old Honda Civic seems like an adventure. We once moved a couch across town in it. We must have looked like a couple of idiots.\n\nOnce after a few months of staying in a place where we had no furniture, were sleeping on the floor, the carpet of which was so flea-infested that you could literally see the fleas hopping around, the landlord got so frustrated with us basically squatting in his property (my dad promised to pay and never did) that he removed the front door.  So we went out to scam some food from somewhere and came back to find no front door. Which in retrospect is a pretty awesome way to get someone out of your property.\n\nOne of the ways we scammed food would be to go to the breakfast buffet of a fancy hotel, tell the server that we had a room there, eat a ton of food and just walk out. This was also kind of fun but looking back it is a kind of fucked up way for a dad to treat his teenage kid.",

            " Slept in my vehicle, couch surfed with a friend, squatted in an unused trailer; all while still working at a Walmart. Saved enough to get a crappy apartment and just kept going from there.",
            "First night my wife and I landed up sleeping outside we slept in a local park that I knew. We had come down from the countryside with a few Rands (enough for 1 meal maybe) and had hoped to stay with a friend. He was unable to give us a place to stay, so we had to sleep outside.\n\nAfter the insecurity of that 1st night I told my wife that we have to find a safer place to sleep, so we climbed up the slopes of Table Mountain (about a 1 hour walk) and found quite a obscured spot amongst some bushes and trees. We cleared it out of sticks and rocks, made it a bit habitable and then went make to the city looking for work. We'd spend the day going from one place to the next looking for work until it started growing dark. Then we'd head up the mountain to our little spot for the night.\n\nDid that daily for a month until we were able to secure a small shack room in the townships, where we stayed for another few months until I get a job offer.\n\n\nWas my wife's temp waitering jobs that kept us fed whilst I was looking for work.\n\nBiggest challenge was mental, keeping focussed, clean, looking presentable and just making my job looking for a job.",
            "It was terrifying and cold and hungry. I didn't sleep a wink. I adapted over time. Extremely steep learning curve to surviving homelessness. Nothing really prepares you for it.",
            "I kept waking up in the middle of the night and would start walking \"home\". I'd get a few steps then stop and realize I had nowhere to go and turn and walk back over and lay on the ground. \n\nThe ground is very cold and I felt a lot of shame.",
            "When I was a teenager I had lots of problems with my mom, I pretty much chose to be homeless. I slept at a Catholic Church across from my high school so I could still make it to school and graduate early. I remember feeling really sad because I slept where they put peoples ashes, and I remember being so sad that those people could comfort me in death more than anybody alive. I used to talk to them, if there\u2019s camera footage I look insane. I never realized how alone I was in the world until I was homeless. And I never realized how cold concrete can be, it chills you right to your bones and is painful.",
            "I started being homeless at 19, a previous foster parent put me out for coming home from college one night, and I had called up a friend last minute. When I started to realize I wouldn't be able to crash or stay anywhere, I am fairly certain I started to dread, and spiral into a constant, underlying depressive state. All I could think about was \"am I going to die like this? Do I matter? Will no one help me? I'm sad, I'm scared. I don't want to feel like I have to beg. What if I'm stuck like this? Is this really my life right now?\" 19-26 was a very challenging time...\n\nEdit: I am stunned, taken aback and truly appreciate the feedback and support that's been granted to me this day, and will continue to respond, but I am not used to so much verbal traffic to peruse. Never the less, I will make an AMA upon several redditors suggestions, as a lot of this can be encapsulated in so many words, and I want to help by way of sharing. \nThank you all again, and I am still doing my very best, better or worse to this day. I simply have no intention on going backwards. \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\n\nSecond Edit: I have now put an AmA up as per request. I will gladly answer just about anything that anyone wants to know and please, use my experience to consider helping others. Please and thank you!",
            "I once was fooled by an ex into moving back in with her after a break-up. After a couple of weeks she decided to have a yard sale. This yard sale ended up featuring most of my stuff. Then with money in hand she decided it was time I went back to my place.\n\nMy place which had nothing in it. My place which I had given notice on. My place which was already awaiting a new renter.\n\nI spent my last two weeks sleeping on a hardwood floor using sweaters as blankets and then when the day came to vacate I threw all my clothes in a plastic bag and just started walking. I was destitute. I had absolutely nothing and no idea where to start.\n\nIt was right in the Canadian winter so staying outside would be a death sentence in many cases, so I did the only thing I could think of, I sat in a 24 hour Tim Horton's. I used what little money I had to purchase small coffees once in a while so I at least had an excuse to sit there.\n\nEventually my cash ran out and I thought for sure I'd get the boot. Then one of the ladies working the counter came over and just handed me my usual order. I guess she probably figured out what was going on and felt bad. The second time she did it I struggled not to cry.\n\nI'm pretty thankful because my next idea if I was asked to leave was to politely refuse, then sit and wait for the cops. Better than freezing to death.\n\nMorning came and I had saved only enough to catch a single bus. Headed downtown to try to find some friends. I did, and I couch surfed between a lot of them. I never spent a night out in the cold, but I spent many in a coffee shop or bouncing between friends.\n\nIt was the worst my depression ever got and the closest I ever came to actually ending my life. Things are a million times better for me now, but I'll never forget how worthless I felt.",
            "I was getting high, so it really didn\u2019t truly sink in until I was broke and dope sick. Then the desperation started. Going to gas stations jumping car to car asking for money. Stealing what I had to. It was a miserable existence. There are so many things you don\u2019t think about when your not homeless...taking a shower, washing your clothes, and the boredom. Hours upon hours of nothing to do. And the constant noise. There was nowhere to go where it was truly quiet. \n\nFortunately I eventually got arrested for shoplifting reached out to family who helped me get back on my feet.",
            "My parents didn't tell us that they lost their house to the bank. One day we left everything but a few clothes and essentials. I remember sitting in the car watching the world outside and I felt extremely alone. The drive just endlessly went unless we had to go to the bathroom. We ate some cracker things and had water at rest stops from bathrooms. Sleeping in a carseat that you couldn't lay back really was hard to adapt to so I didn't sleep for the first couple nights. It really sucked but as the days turned into weeks things just became the new normal. We would drive around for hours and sometimes camp out at campgrounds or road sides instead of sleeping in our woefully tiny car.\n\n\nThis completely ruined our education because we couldn't stay at any school long. I loved school for their food and I would steal paper, pens, and books sometimes so I had something to do. My mother eventually said she would just homeschool us but that was soon dropped for us kids to do for ourselves. I was able to almost get my ged before a sickness stopped me but some of my younger siblings only have an education from 3rd or 4th grade. When it was winter I remember having to take showers from those hand pumps at the camp ground. The water was so cold it would instantly burn and numb up anything it touched. We also didn't have winter clothes so most of us would wrap up in our old blankets and layers of clothes. We rarely had any food and I resorted to eating some of my clothes, paper,  grass, or tiny pieces of my own skin to try to not feel hungry.\n\n\nOnce we had to eat pancakes as our main food for months. I cannot eat pancakes anymore because the very smell of them makes me sick now. Other food we got was ramen, and rarely a hotdog. I'm not sure how my parents managed to get the food or have money even if it was very little. Maybe from a food pantry. Cooking food on the fire wasn't that hard to do and I learned how to make a fire and gather what a fire needs.\n\n\nIf we got sick we never went to a doctor. Just had to hope it got better. We were on and off homeless until I was in my late teens when my grandmother bought my parents a house for us all to live in. It still feels so strange to actually have a home and even food. I still have a hard time knowing a lot of social norms because of the isolation from homelessness. You just do what you can to survive.\n\n\nI still resent my parents for avoiding any help from the government or going to any homeless shelters. They lost our house because of stupid spending and going into bankruptcy. Their habits never changed. We would get a place to live for maybe a year or two then lose it because my parents were terrible at managing money.\n\n\nEdit- I'm on mobile so Idk how to edit my post to look pleasing. Sorry for the wall of text.\nEdit 2- I think I fixed my text wall.",
            "I packed three bags, one with clothes, blankets, and a pillow. One with food, and one with books. I couch surfed for a little bit, a week or two with each of my friends, slept in my car while I had it.\n\nI used other people's kitchens to cook stolen food and ate food that 7-11 threw away (every morning at about 6am, night shift would throw out all the food that sat too long).  I would wait for the clerk to go back inside, and then fish the bag out of the dumpster.\n\nSlept outdoors in some parks after the car got towed and I used up my friends' goodwill. Got really good at 5-10 min \"wash ups\" in public bathrooms with hand soap. \n\nTeeth, armpits, underboobs, and butt. Let me tell you how nasty hand soap tasted. Would occationally wash my underwear with hand soap real quick too, and dry it with the hand driers. \n\nI would generally use 2 24 hour McDonald's at about 4am so no one would walk in on me. \n\nWhat I would do is I would pan handle outside of a subway station for enough money for a crack rock, an egg of heroin, a needle, and a sandwich and tea. If you wear semi-professional clothes and say \"Omg, my purse got stolen, does anyone have any spare change,\" you get more money than just asking amd wearing, like, jeans.\n\n  I would then go to the first McDonald's, order the sandwich and say I had to use the bathroom. Then I would do a wash-up, grab the sandwich, and eat it on the way to the next McDonald's.\n\nAt the second McDonald's, I would order a tea and ask for lemon juice, pocket the juice and ask to use the restroom. In the restroom I would use the juice to break down the crack, mix it with the heroin, and shoot up. \n\nThen, sadly, I would usually actually use the bathroom in a park or something. \n\nDid this for years until I accidently got pregnant. I would be goddamned if I screwed my kid up by being a junkie, so I cold-turkeyed everything.\n\nI own a house now and will be 14 years clean on November 18th.\n\n(Edited for clarity and spelling)",
            "I didn\u2019t really realize what was going on, I was about 6-7 at the time. Dad said we were going to go for a drive and to pack my backpack with all the clothes I could fit and one toy. Mom was just crying. Me and my brother sat in the backseat, he was a little older and was holding our Sega Genesis and looking scared. \n\nWe drove for a little while (it was already getting dark) and we parked in front of a Walmart and dad said he had to rest for a while. Was the first of many....many nights we slept in the car. \n\nI remember one of my parents was always awake, with their hand in their coat pocket. Looking back it was obvious they had a gun for protection, sleeping in shifts.\n\nEdit: Jesus this blew up and thanks for the gold. Trying to respond to all but my poor inbox....\n\nEdit 2: wtf guys 3 gold?! Thank you!",
            "My ex wife made up a bunch of shit to get a restraining order. I got served at work while she simultaneously shut off my phone service and locked me out of our shared bank account.\n\nThis was Jan 7 2016. I had a t-shirt and slacks to wear for clothes, and no where to sleep. My car didn't have working heat. Thank god for my parents who got me a hotel, new phone, and some money for clothes.\n\nI ended up living in an extended stay hotel for 2 months while I looked for an apartment, and got my affairs in order.\n\nThe restraining order was dismissed, the divorce went to trial, and I got the house and the kids.",
            "I lived at school until I dropped out due to a bunch of personal reasons piling up. My mom was mad that I dropped out and wouldn't even talk to me the first few days after and my relationship with my father is complicated/nonexistent. \n\nI took the train to my home town, even though I didn't know what I would do or where I would go when I got there. I ended up staying the first night in my brothers room (not quite an apartment, just the one room with a kitchen and bathroom he shares with like 5 other people)\n\nAfter that, I posted to social media that I was in this unfortunate situation, and a friend I had lost touch with despite once being very close offered that I could stay with him and his fiance until I got a place of my own.\n\nI never actually had to sleep outside, and I found an apartment after about one month so all in all I was pretty lucky with how it turned out.\n\nOh and my mom and I are cool now, and my dad and I are also trying to rebuild our relationship after he finally divorced his no-longer-new wife (I've always referred to her as his new wife even though it's been over a decade)",
            "I was homeless for a little while in the 80's. Its terrifying at first.  You feel so unsafe. I was a teenager, and wasn't willing to close my eyes and sleep on a park bench alone.  So, I went to a local shelter and lied about my age.  The forced me to shower and do a pee test. It turns out the women in that shelter were scarier than the street so the next night I didnt go back.  I slept in a park but ultimately made squatter friends and stayed with them.  It was very much a community and I felt safe and loved there.The biggest problem with being homeless in the city is no one wants to let you use the bathroom.  Even park bathrooms are locked.  Squat peeing in between cars can be done quickly and undercover,  but when you get your period its a nightmare.These days I have stability so I never pass a homeless person without buying them some food or giving them a little money.  And if they use it for drugs or alcohol I dont care.  Living on the streets is HARD, drink if you need to my friend.",
            "I don't recall my very first time exactly. I do remember looking for a friend that was homeless and his friends ended up watching over me. Everyone was drunk except me. I didn't sleep.\n\nMore recently. Less than a month ago I lost my housing and everything I own. I'm alone this time. I sleep during the day and browse Reddit at night. I was homeless for 10 years the first time. And I am terrified now.",
            "First thing I realized, at 18 when leaving home and finding myself stranded straight away, is that I wasn\u00b4t as unlucky as I had always thought. Female, young and \"normal\" looking, got support from loads of random people who deemed me very brave.  It hit me really hard that if I was fat, or a guy, I would have been screwed. I lived in Spain by then and a couple of nights at a park was quite exciting. Just a couple of nights is what it took to get emergency accommodation, and nobody bothered me. Then jumped from shit job to shit job for a few weeks, ended up getting a year long apprenticeship selling shoes...   \n\n\nSecond, I learnt that hitchhiking is very cheap and pretty safe in Europe. Just kept clean looks, did loads of workaway placements and slowly got on my feet. I am 28 now and settling down in Cornwall, UK, which is the nicest place where I could ever imagine living =)",
            "I feel like I'm too late to the party, but. \n\n**I was actually born homeless.** My mom put newborn me into a small laundry basket filled with blankets she'd been gifted. I spent the first year of my life living out of a car with my family. My mom had my 5 year old brother and 4 year old sister with her, too. All living out of a grand caravan in the early 90s.\n\nShe'd taken us to Wyoming to hide in the Rocky mountains, so, at least I got to sleep under the stars at night.\n\nI've been homeless most of my life. I have stories about it if anyone finds this and is interested.",
            "I was 18 and had depression. Only had to do the final exams and I would've been good to go. But I panicked and didn't attend, which caused me to fail of course. Me failing made my depression even worse. My parents couldn't take it anymore, packed my clothes in a case and set me on the street. \n\nI had no idea were to go and didn't want to sleep in the city like most homeless do because I was to afraid of something happening to me or the few things I had while I sleep. \nSo I went deep into the woods, opened the case with my clothes and curled up in there to sleep. Needless to say I didn't sleep much that night. I was just to disappointed in myself for being such a failure and cried a lot.\n\nThank god I wasn't homeless long before my grandparents took me in until I found a job. \nWhen I had a job my parents took me back in and I went to therapy. I'm good now but getting abandoned by my parents when I needed them the most still hurts to this day.",
            "I was homeless about a year or two ago. God, it was bad. Although, the reason I left was because I was being abused by my father, so I guess you could say it was sort of better. As everyone says, the first night is bad, bad bad. You come to the conclusion that \"this is really happening.\" There was actually a shelter that took me about 5 hours to walk to (I had no idea what huge difference a car would make) but I'm going to give advice. Do not bother going to a shelter. Maybe it was because I went from one lifestyle to another in a day, but the people there are rowdy, they smell, they steal your stuff, and fights have broken out more than one time. I only lasted three days before I left and decided to leave that. \n\nI found a secluded place in a parking lot that wasn't too bad to sleep in. And probably for the whole time, except for when I went long distances away from the area, I would sleep there. It was shaded from the sun, it didn't get too stuffy (it was spring to summer) and again, pretty hard to find. At least, I've never seen anyone sleep there.\n\nI brought my phone with me when I left, and when I went to a starbucks or a library or whatever else, I would get on wifi and watch youtube or whatever else I was feeling at the time. That's actually how I found reddit, and I lurked for a while before I ever started posting. I would visit libraries and search for jobs online (thank god they let anyone use the computers). After I got a job, it took a few more months, but I rented a small apartment and then applied for school. I'm on scholarship right now, technically full ride if you count the 3 others!! I've been living in the dorms, but I'm getting ready to move in with a friend. \n\nSo what's being homeless like? It's so fucking hard. It makes you want to cry; I've had moments where I thought I would be better off dead since both lives (with family and homeless) were failing. I never want to go back to that time. I'm going to treat my kids right so they never have to go through that, or feel like they have to make that decision for themselves. I kinda went off on a tangent, so sorry if I ended up saying more than what the question asked. Nobody else in my life knows about me being homeless, so I'm extremely grateful for reddit letting me express myself.",
            "I was only 13, the first night I had to just turn the fear into strength. It got easier and easier every day, I figured out how to get clean, where to sleep, where to eat. It was easier to get used to than when I got a home again and had to get used to staying in a house again.",
            "I was young, 11 years old, but I was aware my mom was on drugs and that my situation was going where it ended up. It started out with moving a LOT, state to state, wherever the cheapest place to live was. The living conditions got worse with each move. In our last house as a family before we got taken away by CPS, we had to clean it out before moving in, some deal my mom made with the landlord. It was disgusting. Full of mouse shit, dirty needles, porno magazines, and the floor was completely covered in garbage. Oh well, I thought, at least it's a house. I was excited for a new place to live. \nThen, the gas got shut off, and the electricity, in the middle of winter. My mom's car got the windshield busted out of it and we used plastic wrap to fix it. We were always cold. The cops would knock on our door and we'd do as we were trained- hide under the beds, don't answer, don't make a sound. \nOnce the utilities were out I knew we'd be moving again. We stayed in a homeless shelter for a short while, until school started back up. I was in middle school for less than two months before in the middle of the night, as usual, my mom said to pack our things and we'd be moving that night. But I didn't realize how bad on meth she was, not fully, not until we arrived in Death Valley and slept outside of a church. Desert nights are very cold and the days are very miserable when you live outside. I just accepted it, I felt my 11 year old heart grow cold, like a candle was blown out in me. My mom didn't enroll us in school, we got MRSA (a flesh eating disease yum) and got no medical treatment, we weren't fed so we'd steal food from stores and ask restaurants for free samples. I met 2 strangers who cared and bought us food. It was embarrassing, I felt unworthy. Being homeless made me feel a little less human than everyone around me. I could go on about the experience but this comment is long enough lol",
            "Edit: Thank you guys for the updoots. Makes me feel a little better to hear that I'm not alone in this struggle. I sincerely hope that everyone is doing well, wherever you are.\n\nI wasn't homeless to the extreme that some other guys I got to know who camped in the woods outside of town were, but I did a spell at a mission in town for a summer.\n\nThe first night was pretty rough. I had been living with some friends after losing my place, but life caused them all to go separate ways so one drove me to the mission and pretty much was like \"K Bye\".\n\nThe mission was your typical ultra conservative Christian ran shelter. The owners were hyper aggressively masculine, to the point where they demanded your respect even while driving around in their brand new sports cars and treating you like dirt. \n\nThe guys living there were a mix of ex-cons and drug addicts, but there were also some older gentleman who were there simply because they were old and the government assistance wasn't enough.\n\nYou have to adopt new ways of thinking amidst the less reputable side of that crowd. Learn how to keep people from stealing your stuff, learn how to talk to people who are drugged senseless so they don't start beef with you.\n\nI pretty much spent that summer walking around town from dawn to dusk looking for a job. Pretty sure I applied at literally every business I could, updated with them regularly. Did my best to avoid picking up any addictions.\n\nA year later I'm sitting in a rented house with a lovely girlfriend and a cozy desk job. And I'd rather die than go back to that hell.",
            "Slept in the backseat of my friend\u2019s broken down VW beetle.

That worked for a while until I got caught and his dad kicked us both out.  Went back to sleeping in the bug.

            "I\u2019m not sure if this exactly counts as homeless but it sure felt like it at the time!\nI\u2019d lived with my partner in his house for 2 years and put up with domestic abuse pretty much from the beginning, I had two children from a previous relationship so felt like I had to stay and I should be grateful, one day it got far to much and I felt that the kids could be in danger (aged 7 and 3 at the time) so I literally packed 1 change of clothes each a few pairs of underwear and a pair of pjs each and walked out the door I had less than \u00a330 on me, with the clothes on our backs and that one bag, was the scariest time of my life, I got on a train and went to my closest council office. \nWe sat in that office for nearly 24hrs before they found us a b&b to stay in for a couple of days, was about 4hrs away from the kids schools and my only support (my mum) I understand they did it to keep my ex from knowing where I was but I\u2019ve never felt so alone, we got moved from one b&b to the next for 9 months (them 9 months were the hardest of my life) before we finally got offered a flat to settle down in, I know a lot of people have had it worse but I\u2019ll always feel guilty for putting my children through that at such a young age.\n\nEdit: thank you all so much for your kind words on a comment I thought would get lost! I\u2019m overwhelmed with all the love and have shed a few tears tonight, it really does mean a lot to me so thanks again kind strangers xx",
            "I grew up in foster care and then when you become an adult you \u201cage out\u201d, meaning you are no longer in the system. Some kids who age out are allowed to stay with their foster parents if they have a good relationship. I didn\u2019t have a good relationship with my foster parents; they had a mix of foster children and their own bio children living in the house and they basically just did it for the check. Anyway, I knew my birthday was approaching and that I\u2019d have to leave and I was really nervous to talk to my foster mom about it. I did and she was pretty dismissive of me, saying that there would t be room but that maybe I could stay a few weeks after my birthday.\n\nA few days after my birthday, however, the caseworker shows up and I had to leave. I signed a bunch of paperwork and other stuff. they watched me as I packed my stuff. The shitty part was that I didn\u2019t have much stuff because I shared a room (plus I had lived in multiple homes and never had more than one duffle bag). I asked to take a small blanket that I had had since I had been there, but my foster mom said no because it had been in there family for years?!! I got a little money from my caseworker (not a lot) then she escorted me out lmao like this bitch walked me out and down the block. \n\nMy first night was actually okay? I slept in the park but it was pretty cold at the time because it was in November. But I got used to it. Honestly at the time I felt... free? Like I had always lived with crappy people in crappy homes where I had no privacy or a billion chores to do or just getting yelled at. Out of the street no one bothered me much unless I was begging money off people. Of course, in my homeless years I didn\u2019t make the best decisions, lots of guys used me or took advantage of me and there were times when it was super rough and I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d make it. But at least I was in charge of myself if that makes sense?\n\nAlso (and this is random) homeless people often get asked why we stay on the street and don\u2019t go stay at a shelter. FYI they fill up fast and run out of room, and they can be dangerous. I\u2019ve known a few people who have been raped there. I\u2019m not saying all are bad but in my experience they are not a safe place.\n\nI have a home now but sometimes I set newspapers on top of my sheets and sleep on them. I know how bizarre that sounds but there were nights when I was out of the streets and had nothing but I would find a whole stack and be so happy and Id wrap up in them and feel warm and safe.",
            "I think people have this idea in their head that homeless means you're out on the street under a bridge or in a tent but there are many facets of it.\n\nWe were homeless for about 10 days after my mom left my dad.  I was younger and it didn't click with me until I got older.  Mom called me and my sisters and told is to pack up our stuff.  We then just did what we needed to got those 10 days until she could secure some housing for us.  I remember eating corn and rice for a meal but that's the only real thing that sticks out to me from that time.",
            "Honestly it wasn\u2019t too bad for me, I got kicked out but lived in a good area. I had a car so I just parked it in parks and stuff and it was only about two weeks before I found a new place to stay. It was also just me at the time so I really didn\u2019t mind too much. \n\nNot all cases are like this though, it was temporary and I was lucky enough to have a car, a job where I could shower and spent most my days and nights at work (I worked at a kennel and theater so I generally didn\u2019t get off until 2 and was at work by 6) so I wasn\u2019t in my car much anyways. It was also the early spring so it wasn\u2019t too hot and wasn\u2019t too cold. I was lucky.",
            "It didn\u2019t really occur to me that I was \u201chomeless\u201d for a couple weeks. I was 16, and my mom and I were in a domestic abuse situation. She fled to a friends house, and I fled to my friends house, and then from there, sofa surfed for a few weeks until my boyfriends mom caught on that something wasn\u2019t quite right. \n\nI had spent random nights at their house prior in the spare room, but during that 2 weeks I had stayed 3 times with them, and at dinner she gently put down her fork and goes, Sara, something is going on. Tell me about it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question. So I started bawling at the dinner table and realized I didn\u2019t have a home, and in the next 5 minutes, me, her, my boyfriend, and his dad all had our shoes on and in the car, on our way to my the abusive house to grab my things. Then they made the spare room my real room for a year before I could go to university and get an apartment.",
            "The first time, I had to live in a motel for half a year. Each night was the same as the last. Cramped, upsetting, but dry and safe.\n\nThe second time, I got lucky and was already staying at my grandparents house the night when I became homeless again. Thankfully, they allowed me to stay until I eventually got a new home. The first night there was blissful peace and ignorance.",
            "I was 17. I hit a car with my dad's Corvette. It wasn't that big of a deal, it was just a little damage to the front. Well, the guy I hit called my dad before I got home and told him a bunch of BS. Said his bumper fell off of his car and read my dad the riot act.  When I got home I walked through the front door, my dad hit me in the chest and knocked me back through the doorway. He screamed at me and told me to get out of his life.  \n\nI went to the Redondo Beach pier where I hung out and stared sleeping under the pier. The first night, and most nights after that, were a series of moments of having no idea what to do. I was lost. After 7 months I called my maternal grandparents and asked them for help. They moved me back to Arizona and got me into college.  \n\nEdit- Man, I haven't thought of that in years. A sudden wave of emotion just washed over me. I miss my grandma an grandpa. They were so good to me.",
            "I had no clue I was homeless. I went to stay the night at a friend's house on a weekday and after not feeling hated for existing I just didn't go back. I ended up couch surfing for 2ish years until college hit.",

            "I lived in a mini van for half a year while I worked full time at an airport. The trick was not to actually leave when the shift ended. Or if I left, I wouldn\u2019t go super far. I could afford to eat a couple times a day and I had a cheap gym membership so that I could shower. The boredom was mind numbing but if it got too bad I would just go back to the airport and people watch or pretend like I was about to fly somewhere. Never missed my family so much. Eventually gave up and moved back home",
            "I was 20 at the time, and it was the dead of winter. My first night was lots of \"Why does no one care? Where will I sleep? How will I eat? Fuck it's cold. Why me? Is this the end?\"\n\nThe first night, I walked to each one of my friends houses and eventually found one with their car unlocked. I slept in the back seat of their Honda and made sure to set an alarm on my watch to wake up before they left for work. It was shady, but to this day I'm grateful they left their car unlocked.\n\nA week or so later, I called family to see if I could spend Christmas with them. It was a resounding \"NO\" from all parties. I cried. A lot. It really broke me. That situation lasted for a little over a month. It pressured me to get clean off the drugs I was using. I was confident that I would die (or commit suicide) if I had to live that way for any longer.\n\nBeen clean 7 years now. Being homeless humbled me. I'm no longer the arrogant, selfish asshole that put himself in that situation.",
            "Well for me it wasnt due to economic reasons, i was in a new town for work and had my wallet, car keys, and phone in my jacket, went to a library to loan some books as i had nothing else to do. Left the jacket unguarded for 10 minutes and someone stole it.\n\nHad no access to any money, couldnt call almost anyone except my family and it was 7pm already and getting dark outside. Borrowed a phone and called my girlfriend, then my parents, and asked them to contact the company i work for and let them know what had happened and how they could contact me the next day.\n\nSo i spent 2 nights without a roof because it took that much time to sort things out mostly because i couldnt really prove who i was, so i couldnt acess the things they helped set me up with.\n\nIt sucks beyond belief, you cant sleep because its too fucking cold, and there arent any places to go either because everything is closed. I remember when mcdonalds closed at 10 pm the first night, jesus christ that was not fun but i wasnt very hungry as i had had dinner before i went to the library. The second day i was tired as i hadnt slept i was so cold as well. I thought \"we will sort this through today easily\" but boy was i wrong.\n\nIt took untill 2pm to get in contact with the company and they really tried to help me, they set up an emergency account at a well trusted bank, called them in the town i was in and said explicitly exactly what i looked like, what i was wearing and that it was an emergency situation.\n\nOf course the bank didnt trust them so when i went there they just said no, being really hungry i borrowed a phone again in the library called the company and said what had happened, so the mailed me a credit card to the library, talked with some staff at the library to lend me some cash so i could eat untill the credit card arrived. So had one more night to spend outside and havent slept the first night at all i managed to slumber for 10-30 minutes woke up from the cold had to start moving to build up some heat in my body, slumber a little bit more.\n\nWhen mcdonalds opened at 7am, i went there bought breakfast and coffee and asked if i could sleep there for a while, after explaining my situation they agreed, slept untill 10am went back to the library and waited for the mail to arrive. Got the credit card and paid the person back with interest, i returned the double she had lent me.\n\nBecause the gratitutde you feel when they really fucking saved you from starving just a day is a very immense feeling. Used the credit card to rent a car, in the companies name by having the place who rent out cars call the CEO of the company i work for so he would vouch for it. I drove home and started to get my life back on track, drivers license, my own bank account, keys, phone etc etc etc.\n\nWe take these things for granted, losing them all at the same time was hell. If you ever travel and get to a town you dont know people be very careful about your things so it doesnt happen to you.\n\nThe only thing i had was my clothes and shoes minus the jacket. But it did harden me, im more resilient now.\n\nSo now i have lived out of a car for 2 weeks, for work because i couldnt find a cheap place to stay at and i get 60% of the difference between what they have to pay for my residence in a new town and the actual cost of the residence i choose to stay at.\n\nLiving out of a car is hard, there are so many things you take for granted that you lack, running water, toilet, shower and clean clothes. Just a place to eat that is your own place is something you will miss. If you plan on doing it, get a volt meter, because i plugged my laptop into the car battery to charge it then i spent an evening watching youtube videos and shit, the next day the car was dead because i had drained the battery.\n\nWent to a gym for shower but had to pay to use it well obviously. Here in Sweden we have no laundromats, so i had to use a dry cleaner to clean my clothes once. The worst part is that the chill really does creep into your car so try to find a warm garage, or a sleeping bag. You have access to none of the things you take for granted, electricity becomes something you begin to think very carefully about. Always have 2 bottles of water, one for drinking the other for sanitation fill them up before you go back to the car for the night. Keep some toilet paper in the car at all times it has more uses then merely wiping your ass.",
            "The first night it didn't sink in right away the situation I was in... kind of in a daze of get shit to a storage unit, what do I need, what do I throw out. About 5 days in it set in.\n\nI was never on directly on the streets but I did some couch surfing stints and slept in my car, having you're own room and place to just zone out/ be by yourself is a luxury I will never give up again. The real bitch of it all is the getting back to where you were before... but it also puts a lot of shit into perspective of wants vs needs. I was also between jobs which is a whole other hurdle to jump over.\n\nWent from mildly inconvenienced to \"oh shit this is for real.\" It makes you grow up real quick if you want to get out of that situation... I slipped for a few months having \"pity parties\"... luckily one of my ex buddies helped me by booting me out the door... shit is awkward because I still feel like I owe him and shit got real between us while I was real deep down depressed. It's not easy pulling yourself out of that rut but he gave me the kick in the ass I needed and while we're not real close friends anymore, I don't resent what happened and I still wish I could make up monetarily all the things he did for me, even though it was never expected. Luckily I didn't have anyone besides me to worry about... I didn't want my family to know but they've since pieced it together, I can't imagine how difficult it's gotta be with a kid.\n\nI would never wish homelessness on my worst enemy.",
            "I was 17, a week after I graduated high school.   My adoptive mother kicked me out.   She was mentally and physically abusive that a massive opioid addiction didn't help.   Well, all I had was a social security card and what I could carry.   Couldn't get an ID until after she (thankfully) died because she knew id find out I was adopted as soon as she gave me the bs birth certificate that was just a printout on a very old piece of paper that didn't even have a raised seal on it. No I don't know how that even worked but I imagine she was just too lazy to go get a new one after she got the one the state sent her after my adoption. Mind you, I was 19 when I was officially told despite constantly questioning why I look nothing like them...  I was ecstatic to leave.   Living on the streets I had the best time of my life compared to the battlefield that was my adoptive mother.   I've always had to survive in my own way so surviving the streets took a lot of creativity I already had.   I slept in a local park bathroom that oddly had heat and air.   Not once did I beg for money on a corner or stay in a mission.   To this day I have hip and knee problems thanks to going from locked in my room unless I was at school to walking hundreds of miles.   \n\nTl;Dr I was ecstatic, had the time of my life, and survived by living in a park bathroom.  My adoptive mother with a pill addiction wanted a baby and not a child to raise so she got rid of me as soon as she could.\n\nEdited for grammar and context.",
            "I've been homeless twice, but both times I managed to secure a temporary place to sleep after a couple of days. Those days, though, were among the worst I've ever experienced. It's just a sense of panic and feeling exposed and unsafe, and every time you go inside you tell yourself to enjoy it for as long as they'll let you because it's raining and windy outside and you know you'll soon be back out in it. I have no doubt that if I had to do it for longer in either instance I probably wouldn't have survived it, one way or the other. So I can't answer the adapting-to-it part, but thought I'd share what I do know anyway.",
            "I walked for as long as I could and passed out on a bench in front of a church. So\nSomeone woke me up and asked if I was ok in the morning and I explained the situation and then they told me to leave since it was private property and there would be people there soon and they didnt want me making the place look bad. As soon as the words left his mouth I realized that I was already viewed as less than human after one night. I ended up going to work still as I never told them I was kicked out of my home and showering at the local community college since they never checked to see if the people using the gym were students. Eventually I got back on my feet and even now that I'm not homeless I still feel that way inside often, like I'm less than human.",
            "It sucked. It was freezing. I learned how to start a fire with very little supplies though. Tortilla chips/Doritos are GREAT fire starters. Once I acquired a tent it was much more tolerable.",
            "It was quite brief. I lived with my grandmother until she died, just after I'd turned 18.\n\nThe building society (like a bank) had refused to let me have anything to do with her house and opted to evict me. So I did. The last week was madness trying to get all my stuff out. I gave loads away to different people. I had a tiny flat lined up but that was taking longer than expected and the eviction date loomed. The bailiffs wouldn't extend further.\n\nSo they came, took my keys and that was it. I was homeless, albeit briefly.\n\nBut I had a set of spare keys, so I just let myself in and slept in a sleeping bag on the floor, with our dog, until the flat was ready, with everything I could squeeze into my car in there. The rest of my stuff was tipped, but that's life sometimes.\n\nI did go through a period of being of no fixed abode for a while a year or so later, as I screwed up on the flat and had no idea how to manage my money properly. Eventually got that sorted too, but it's a rubbish lifestyle.",
            "My first day of being homeless I had to bring my son and parents to the airport . I had to make sure my son would be well so I decided to let him  live with my parents , who came to pick him up. It was awful.\n\nBut ,I also timed it so I wouldnt feel the awfulness of being split from my son. I went surfing the same day and stayed out of town with a friend.\n\nAfter the short surf trip, I was truly homeless. And temporarily childless. I messaged a friend to let me stay the night. The first of many nights. I also arranged to stay with another friend and her family.\n\nIt was July. I only had summer clothes. I needed to be able to get my shit together before it got colder.\n\nSo maybe I wasn't out on the streets but I  still had no permanent home. It wasn't as bad as the others posted on here",
            "I grew up busking and begging because my druggy parents couldn't remember to take care of me. I knew most of the homeless in my area because of that so when I ran away I knew things like who to talk to and where to bunker down. It was quiet compared to the constant outbursts of crazy and violence with my parents. I felt safer because most of the more respected homeless people had known me close to a decade and made everyone leave me alone.",
            "My story isn't as rough as some others. I guess I just saw unavoidable homelessness coming about 12 months in advance and I was able to prepare for it. I basically used all my savings to buy a van and kit it out with the basics (fridge, toilet, etc). It wasn't anything fancy, and by spending that money I'd definitely shortened the amount of time I could rent for, but it's been A LOT better than just sleeping on the street. The first night, after my lease ended and my only home was my van, I went to a spot I'd already cased out. I wanted to be somewhere nice on the first night, just so I might feel like things would be alright. And it was a really great night. It was just me, on the beach, no one around for miles. There were so many stars. I woke up just in time to see the sunrise over the ocean (a wild rooster woke me up\ud83d\ude05), and I even found an abandoned camp chair on the beach to sit in! I did really feel like things would be alright then. And the homelessness thing has been good for me. I just feel calmer. Maybe because I'm outside almost all the time. Maybe because I read and write and draw more. Though obviously my experience is a bit better, because I have a vehicle and I'd prepared.",
            "It was surreal. I was at one of my lower points freshly 21 and I met a bunch of people that traveled with Renaissance festivals. So when my lease was up, and I didnt find a new apartment, I went to the campground where all these vagabonds were staying and ended up staying in a guys dog house next to his tent, that he had constructed out of tarps and scrap wood, with his dogs. Overall the night was good for I still had my adderall and money for liquor. I ended up traveling with those people for a few years working ren fairs, partying, seeing the the differnt parts of the US, just being completely free.",
            "My experience may kinda differ and it was actually recently I was homeless. I was in a rough financial situation so I used the last bit of money on a tent, a lock, some food and a bunch of plastic bottles of vodka. I worked a kitchen job with a woodsy area next to it and setup my tent out there. I\u2019d basically just hang around the woods fucking off, climbing trees, trying to build various things until I had to work. Went to work, came back to the tent, put a lock on the zippers and drink myself to sleep watching YouTube. I\u2019d charge my phone at work. I had a planet fitness membership since it was 15$ a month. Go to the gym to shower and all that. After a couple months I\u2019d saved up enough for a place in a new state.",

Does that count",
            "The extremes most people here are describing are actually only the pointed end of homelessness. Far more people lack their own personal private safe space, but do have places to crash. Maybe it's on a family member or friend's couch. Not \"roughing it\", but not necessarily super secure or their own.\n\nThis applies to *massive* numbers of people. And it's good when we have such charity and support networks, but it helps to mask the scope of the issue, which is far larger than it usually appears.",
            "Absolutely sucked and still does. I slept in a shopping mall that happened to be open all night. The next day I was able to get in supported housing that is shared with other people. Fortunately my phone is paid off and I have unlimited data so that gives me something to do as I was big in to gaming before all the shit happened. I'm currently living on one bowl of oats a day until next week when hopefully I receive some government help. (I don't take drugs/drink alcohol & I have no possessions to sell for food.)

            "I wasn't homeless in the living on the streets kind of way, but I did end up couch surfing for a couple of months. It's hard to describe the disconnect with wanting to \"go home\" only to realize you don't really have one. The first night wasn't really a big event for me because I knew I'd be couch surfing for a month or two. It was really the little realizations that I had no home to go back to, that all my stuff was locked up in a storage space and I only have what was in my back pack that got to me sometimes.",

Then I thought it was a little too much and decided to go to the streets, where I already had made some friends who already were living in the streets. \nThe first night was weird: at some point, all this wandering souls gathered besides a train station and everyone started sharing the food they've got during the day.

            "October 2004, I did a moonlight flit to get away from my husband who had threatened to kill me yet again. Although this was a semi-regular occurrence, this time was different and I was truly afraid for my life.\n\nThe first few nights we stayed in a friend's caravan. It was half term and poured down, but my three children saw it as an adventure holiday and were happy, but then I contacted the local council and found out that they did not have provisions in their budget for victims of domestic violence. I searched further afield and was lucky to be offered a place.\n\nWe stayed in the first place a couple of weeks, but it was set up so that we felt too exposed. We had to park away from the property and walk along the main road into town, ring the bell and wait for a member of staff to open the door to let us in. A stranger was taking photos of the children on the beach and he disappeared when I approached him. Later, I found out that he was a police photographer, sent because my violent husband had alerted the police saying that the children were at risk. The police disagreed. They told the children's father that the children were safe and happy, but not where they were.\n\nAfter that, we found another place that was purpose built and was less exposed, but none of us were happy there. When the children told me how much they hated it, we moved on again and were offered a third refuge that the children liked so much that they wanted to stay there forever. The following week a new resident arrived and life changed. More new resident arrived until we had been there longer than the others. One resident wanted to be #1 and started a hate campaign against me. No matter what I did made life worse, but it was not exposed till the house meeting.\n\nAfter the meeting the staff apologised to me, as I had raised concerns that they had ignored. I was offered a refuge house for just me and my children and we were there nearly three months before the council offered us a property of our own.",

            "We were extremely lucky that we were homeless in NYC.  They put us in a temporary shelter our first night but we got there so late that we only had about 5 hours to sleep.  It was me, my husband and our 1 year old daughter.  The next day they have us our placement.  What happens is you get to stay there for 10 days while the city decides if you actually need this assistance.  You have to prove that you can\u2019t stay with relatives and don\u2019t have enough money to move out of state.  The city will actually buy you plane tickets to another state if you have relatives willing to take you in.  So after our ten days we were told we could stay in the shelter.  Our place was a converted hotel near JFK.  They had a playground outside for the kids and we had our own bathroom and a small kitchenette to cook meals.  We wound up being there for six months.  During that time we took advantage of not having to worry about bills to go to all the doctors appointments we needed to do for our disability cases.  My husband had been in a work accident and had a severe spinal chord injury, in the shelter he needed a walker.  I was born with an autoimmune disease and had a flare up shortly after my daughter was born but it didn\u2019t go away so the doctors documented how I got worse and worse and figured that was it for me I wasn\u2019t going to be able to work ever again and was probably going to wind up in a wheelchair I was bedridden on an off again.\n\nHonestly, we were happy to have a roof over our head.  We were optimistic that the city would be able to get us permanent housing and that we could finally get as healthy as we could be and find our new normal.  However after our 6 months they realized my husbands law suit was going to take ages, they were hoping that we could get money from it right away to buy a co op or condo, so they told us that they couldn\u2019t help us find housing.  We had to make a very difficult decision to split our family up temporarily.  My husband went back to his mom in San Fran and I went back to my parents who now live in Florida.\n\nIn August 2018 he took a settlement and we had been back together for a year until August 2019 when he passed away.\n\nIt sucks that part of my memory of him is being homeless, but we were together as a family then and that\u2019s all that matters.",

Had just enough to eat, but waiting on that pay check was a killer. \n\nFirst few nights weren\u2019t too bad. I knew a few places I could crash for one night and no-one would comment. Dorm common rooms, university 24hr computer labs, a church rec room I knew to always be unlocked. \n\nI never used any one place more than once if I could avoid it, to keep from being suspected as being \u2018homeless\u2019 instead of some random who came for a party and crashed out. \n\nBut as things went on and I still couldn\u2019t get an apartment in the new city, the dread of the evening really started to settle in and get loud.  Started relying on the only place I knew to be my own - the car - but it was cold and uncomfortable and while parking in shelter in safe places isn\u2019t as hard as finding safe places to sleep outside a car, it is still hard. Too public and you risk attention. Too private and you risk being unable to reach help, or trespassing.",
            "Im currently homeless, have been for about 4 months. The one emotion that stands out amongst the rest is anxiety. Constant, chronic, crippling anxiety. I've worked full time since before I lost my housing so I have minimum basics covered but I'm terrified I'll never get ahead enough to move back indoors. It's constantly waiting for the next thing to go wrong/ break/ get stolen. It's knowing it's healthier to buy supermarket food but can only afford dollar store canned goods and have no where to cook anyway. It's being uncomfortable anytime you're  \"home\". It's shame and self hatred for letting it get this far. It's isolation because you're too embarrassed to tell all your well off friends you've failed at one of the most basic human needs. It's mind boggling how I have never had a drug or alcohol issue but I'm now living right along side those who do. All this because I couldn't work while I was in the hospital and have zero support system in my life to go to for help. It's dehumanizing and im ashamed of myself to be honest.",
            "Still homeless but about 6 months out from getting back up.\n\nFirst night I had gotten off the bus in Southern California and found some little spot in an alley where I could sleep. I had my backpack with 2 outfits a sleeping bag and some hygiene stuff.\n\nAt some point of the night a guy walked through saw me and stopped to talk. You could tell he was on meth, it's a giant issue here, and was talking about how he sees demons and angles and he is taking part of a holy war. He then at some point told me how I was really wise and my aura was that of a leader and he hopes he could lead his team in the fight against Satan. He then went a little ways down and went to sleep. Maybe an hour or so later I awaken to the sound of another homeless guy yelling at this holy war warrior \"Are you ready to die tonight? Give me all your shit or I'll kill you right here and then take your shit\"\n\nI just silently got up scooped all my stuff up and walked away quickly. Later I found a much safer spot to sleep in but the first few days was nothing but processing I had no home and also finding where all the resources for food, water, bathroom etc was.\n\nFew months now and while the drug addicts and shady people are a concern I have adapted and learned how to take care of myself. I shower daily, I do laundry every few days and keep myself kept up. Being homeless is expensive and extremely tiring.",
            "Fresh out of the miltary with wife and baby and got a decent job that allowed me to rent a nice apatment for my family, but having no experience, I lost it.  The only other job that was hiring, was a job installing car phones; rent was beyond my abilty now (even with WIC and Food Stamps) and after getting evicted, started sleeping in the car on the parking lot to my new job.  After a couple of days in, my boss realized what was going on and made arrangements for us to stay in a Salvation Army Family Shelter.  They provided me the ability to stay for a whole month in their shelter; after that,  they provided me an apartment for 6 months and charged me \"rent\"; at the end of the 6 months, they gave me back the \"rent\" I paid them so I can pay the costs of getting a new place (security deposit, 1st & last month and some baby furnishings).  1 year later, I found out my wife was cheating on me and when I confronted her, she left me... \n\nI ended up moving back home with my son and my family helped in raising him. She never reached out...\n\nToday I have a great paying job (thanks to my military technical training), an amazing wife (25 years together), am a homeowner & my son is a college graduate.\n\nI am grateful for the helping hand I received from the Salvation Army and have no shame in saying so.",
            "It was hot. I was living in the back seat and trunk of my 4-door sedan in Omaha, NE.\n\nI  needed a less shitty sleeping arrangement. So, I \"moved\" (drove), to Denver, CO where the humidity wasn't bad and the nights were not as hot.\n\nI adapted by going into Dunkin Donuts or some other place with a bathroom where I could lock the door so I could shave and wet my hair at least. I slept on side streets or in Walmart parking lots in my car.\n\nIt was difficult, but not terrible. It was just the situation I was in. I'm 6'4\" so sleeping in a 4-door sedan was not easy.\n\nI knew I needed out of that situation, so I went to the library to study web development every day.\n\nI got rid of all of my belongings except for decent dress clothes. I wore button up shirts and dark jeans or dress pants every day. I carried my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on me everywhere I went, just in case I met someone in the software industry.\n\nI didn't want to get job that would keep me poor. So, I didn't work so I could spend all day every day studying web development.\n\nWhen the library wasn't open, such as at night, I would go to a 24 hour McDonalds where I could at least buy a very cheap \"meal\" if I had to in order to stay in the building and use the Wifi.\n\nIt sucked.\n\nI remember almost getting a job in the DTC in Denver. It was a contract-to-hire position that paid $50/hr. I totally bombed the interview questions. I had never been in an interview like that before. The hiring manager took me aside afterwards and said that he loved my personality and thought I was a culture fit. There was one question that I couldn't answer about closures in JavaScript. He said that if I could have answered that one question, he would have taken the chance on me.\n\nThat was a 12-month contract at $50/hr; $2,000 per week. $100,000 per year. And I was homeless.\n\nMissing that one question kept me in the car.\n\nI remember crying while I walked back to my car, which was also my home. I looked around while I sat in the front seat while realizing that if I could have answered that one question, I would have been starting a new job in a couple weeks.\n\nAfter a few minutes I collected myself, and went back to the library.\n\nI wanted to give up, but I couldn't.\n\nSo, I decided to let myself be sad the rest of the day. Woke up the next morning and got back to work and studied closures.\n\nIt's been a year, and things are still tough. I got my first software job before the winter of 2018. It was in Boulder for $60,000 per year. Then another company reached out to me back in Nebraska.\n\nThey were offering me $74,000. So, within four months I left for that job.\n\nThey fired me after just two months on the job because I was talking to an intern about salary. I'm still fighting for backpay because they fired me for an illegal reason (companies can't fire someone for discussing salary).\n\nIt's a struggle, but I'm hoping my transition out of homelessness and into this field is successful.\n\nI work my ass off, but I also make mistakes. I wish I wouldn't have taken that job even though it was a $14,000 raise in just 4 months in the industry, not including the cost of living difference between Lincoln, NE and Boulder, CO.\n\nI'll bounce back; I always do. But Jesus Christ it would be nice to have some sort of \"normal\" life.\n\nI'll get there.\n\nSome day, I'll get there.",
            "I wasn't on the streets but, my alcoholic mother kicked me out the second I turned 18. It was a desperate scramble each day trying to find somewhere to stay, I felt like an inconvenience, the panic if my phone was about to die and I hadn't arranged somewhere to stay for the night, ugh. Luckily I was semi intelligent, worked my arse off through college and enrolled into uni. Loads of debt but a room, at least.",
            "I was 15. Northern England. \nI was sitting in the train station waiting room, not knowing where to go. There was an attendent who locked me in there so that I'd be safe. Said he had a daughter my age. There were padded benches and a toilet so it was invaluable as a 'home' until I was able to find a job and room to rent as soon as I was 16. I wouldnt have been able to keep going to school, or get a job if I hadnt had somewhere to get kind of a good night's sleep and wash in the sink.",
            "This is probably late to the party and will get buried but I had to put my two cents in on this one. I have needed to get this out somehow so what better timeor place than on reddit  LOL. \n\n I have been homeless since the beginning of April. I've never been in this situation before, and it's been a desperate struggle from day one. \nI'm 27 years old, turning 28 in a month and a half actually. April 2018 there was a DV incident with my fiance. No contact order, civil standby, no contact order dropped, second assault, no contact order reinstated, civil standby, and then I was alone for the first time in 8 years. I was working 2 jobs. Working for a longtime friend's business cleaning houses as well as waitressing.\nMy rent was too much for me to handle with my meager income and he had left me with 2 months back owed rent... but I was stubborn. DVSAS helped with the back owed rent but I was always a little behind until I was a lot behind. My vehicle broke down and I couldn't fix it, my friend fired me and a short stint with a roommate that robbed me was just the icing on the cake. \nI got served a 3 day pay or vacate. \nI vacated. \nI lived in a car with my ex that was abusive (he had a room at his parents but he was practically chomping at the bit to have me under his thumb) until the violations of a no contact order that sent him to jail gave me an opportunity to escape. The first night was spent in a casino parking lot - what else is open 24 hours, has clean restrooms, and provides free soda and coffee? \nThroughout this entire shitshow, I was self employed and cleaning houses for the clients that followed me from friend's business to my own. I have hopped from entourage to entourage of users and abusers but as long as they had a car and got me to my clients, I kept pushing onward. \nI've had my own car for a month now and it's been a blessing. \nI only have a few more payments to make on it and once that's done, I will be able to invest in some necessities like a laptop, business cards, personal mailbox, clothes (my ex gave most of my clothes and shoes away when I escaped - cleaning supplies were vital to my income so they were prioritized), and a vacuum for my business. Once I have all of that then I can rent a room without all of these things I need weighing on my mind and stretching me too thin financially. \nI am depressed and lonely, but I try to do my best to remember what I've managed to make it out of. None of my family knows of my circumstances and live on the other side of the state - call it pride, but I can't tuck tail and go back to the unsupportive condescending family that scoffed at my efforts to run a business and felt it was acceptable that they play the \"I told you so\" card after I'd had the shit beaten out of me.  \nMy clients are truly one of the only things keeping me going... one of them is a particularly wonderful human being and is fostering my cat - getting to the point that I'll be able to get my furbaby back is my other reason to keep going. My hero client thinks the place I'm renting doesn't allow pets....\nI have a few different places that I can safely park undisturbed and sleep in peace. I've got a few places I can shower and do laundry, sometimes even get some sleep in a real bed. Because I have C PTSD from the abuse I went through, I haven't been able to bring myself to stay at any missions or places of that nature without having debilitating anxiety due to the feeling of being trapped. \nI've endured living in a motel 6 with a hooker and her pimp and with what turned out to be two tweakers that tried to pimp me out for drugs. I've been propositioned by many men, mostly with the promise of a roof over my head and everything I could want in exchange for my warm body in their bed... \nMy experiences have changed my view of people, society as a whole, the system that can be manipulated or manipulate, drug addicts, homelessness and life itself. I've learned to judge less, listen more. Sometimes I wonder why I keep going when it gets so damn bad but I think of my business, my clients, and my cat and it renews my determination to keep one foot in front of the other no matter how hungry, tired or stressed I am.\nI've got some red velvet chocolate chip cookies to eat, tampons (imagine THOSE being a luxury ladies!!!!) an eighth of a tank of gas (better than dry!!), blankets in the backseat of my car, and wifi to entertain myself on reddit. \"You're okay.\" I tell myself. \nI'm on my way out of this type of life - I have to before something happens that destroys what makes me who I am. I hope that some of the beautiful people I've encountered that are in similar circumstances find their way out too. I've done what I can to help them, but how much can someone in my position really help someone else when I can hardly keep my own head above water?\n*edit: word.",
            "The first night was rough. I slept in the back of an abandoned truck. Later found a friend to stay with.  \n  \nThe hardest part for me was food. It's a different experience when you have no way to cook or store food. I had a job, so I could afford some things. I had about $20 to last the week. I figured I could hit McD's eat a $1 double cheeseburger for lunch (showing my age here a bit), and I'd be able to manage. I knew it would sit in my stomach like a rock, and I wouldn't feel hungry for several hours.  \nUnfortunately, I was in a very liberal town. I was walking all over town, hungry, looking for a McD's, as I remembered there being one. Finally I stopped and asked a lady watering plants out in front of her store where I could find one. I'll never forget the look of shock and revulsion on her face as she said \"You actually want McDonald's!? There's none around here. There's an organic deli right over there though, it's much better for you\". Famished, I went to that organic deli. I bought the cheapest sandwich I could find. $8.50. I was so ashamed with myself. That was 8 meals. And I was hungry again almost immediately.  \nThe McDonald's I'd remembered being in that area had closed. It didn't fit with the image of the town. Thankfully I was later able to get to another part of town that had a McD's.",
            "Reading these makes me feel good. I loved seeing the people who were helped or who got out of their rut. It's motivating. \n\nI was homeless as a kid but my mom always found a friend I could stay with. Or a hotel. Some roof. Then I hit 18 and went through some legal stuff. Lost the apartment I was in but my buddy still gave me a place to stay. \n\nI'm doing very well in my life right now and I show an incredible loyalty to those who show it to me. Very blessed and thankful. \n\nThose public breakfast for kids at school in the morning...those things gave kids with no stability, something to look forward to. Food was warm. milk was cold. I'm going to cry because yesterday I turned 30/went skydiving and had delicious food and I haven't struggled in 8 years and I'm just grateful. For everyone's help. Ever.\n\nThank everyone with kindness in their hearts.",
            "Earlier this summer we spent a month sleeping in my boyfriend's car. It was freeing not to be around people I hate but I could only say that because I had the luxury of his car (with the windows covered at night) versus a shelter. It got very hot though, so we'd spend all day up until 10 or 11 outside of the car, showering at the gym and going to sleep in the hospital parking garage. He was working then so we ate a ton of fast food.  There were nights where he did sleep at the house and I slept in the car, not being welcome, so I begged for a blade for self defense, thinking I was going to try to take some would be attacker down with me.   We are back on his parents' property now, but in the garage instead of the house. Honestly though I still feel like I haven't had a home in the 6 years I've been living here and my boyfriend hates it here too because of the aftermath of the conflict between myself and his brother/brother's girlfriend. I get food and shelter but I still feel kind of homeless.",
            "I lived in my friend\u2019s car for a while, if that counts. It pretty much felt like camping or sleeping one off after a tailgate party. And honestly, I was just stoked to not have to go \u201chome\u201d. \n\nNote: I was 15, working at McDonald\u2019s, and my step mom made home life literally so unbearable I\u2019d rather be homeless. Even after I got a place, no one in my family knew where I was until my brother just so happened to drive by and recognize my car parked outside 2 years later.",
            "I was 18 in a new city and had zero idea where to go. I walked around all day trying to find a shelter and asking around but to no avail. I passed a church and thought it was my best bet. As I knew priests rarely turned people away. I knocked on the door and nobody answered, I wasn't surprised as it was getting late. So I hoped the fence into the back courtyard and fell asleep with my back against a wall. It was about 40 degrees so it took me awhile to fall asleep. About an hour later I woke up to a hand on my shoulder. It was another homeless man and I guess I was sleeping in his and his girlfriend's spot. I explained my situation, he gave me a blanket and a granola bar. I thanked him over and over and the next day he walked me to the other side of town and showed me where the soup kitchen was. His name was Tom, he was a good guy.",
            "Well when my dad first threw me out I was 17.  The first couple weeks were okay because I couch surfed, but being that I had no money and was unwilling to have sex for a place to stay, I soon found myself without a couch.  The first night alone on the street was rough.  I was a 17 year old girl, it was November on the east coast.  I remember more than anything not being able to get warm.  Took a while to figure that one out.  I spent 2 years living on the street and the only thing that kept me from jumping into traffic was drugs.  Being homeless and sober is next to impossible.  The hunger, the depression, the fear, it all gets swallowed up by the booze, the dope, whatever you can get your hands on.  This was more than a decade ago, I'm sober now (other than cannabis in a legal state), I've been living indoors for 10 years, but sometimes I'll wake up in my bed and panic that I'm still on the street.",
            "My youngest son was 18 months old and my oldest was 4. My oldest was spending the week with his father, as he was from my previous relationship. My youngest sons father had pinned me on the floor and sat on my chest, putting all his weight onto his hands that were around my throat. Everything went dark and k could hear a roaring sound in my ears. I really feel like I was close to death. Then in the middle if the roaring sound I hear this banging, which turned out to be my neighbor beating on the door. My partner got up and was telling the guy to mind his business.\n\n Long story short i grabbed my son and ran outside, bare footed, and wouldnt you know it's raining. Walk to a different neighbors house and they let me in. We are all sitting on their porch when my partner sneaked around the side of her house and snatched our son of the porch and ran. We called the cops and they found him hiding in a field so they brought me my son and took his dad to jail. I walked back to the house we shared and gathered some things, diaper bag with stuff for him and an oversized handbag for mine. Oh and I finally got to put on shoes. I knew that if I slept there I would just stay again. \n\nThe neighbors had a full house already so they agreed to watch my son while I walked around town to a few friends to see if I could stay with them for a few weeks. It was really hard for anyone to say yes but my partner was known all over town and everyone knew he would come looking. (He had broken in a window at a friends house in the past when I left. I went back that time because I literally had no where else.) Anyway nothing worked and I went back to where my son was and there wasn't a bed to sleep in but they said we could use their couch for the night. All night I was scared. I had no place to go. All my family was tired of the drama from me leaving and him finding me and me going back. \n\nThe next morning when places started to open I called an abuse shelter. The first day/night there was awful too but at least I knew my son was safe. My older sons father kept him until I got back on my feet, but I saw him every few days and that was hard too, not having him all the time. It took about six months of being there before I got an apartment. The first night there I had an episode of sleep paralysis, but instead of seeing a literal demon on my chest it was my (ex) partner coming through my window. When I was finally able to move I didnt go back to sleep and kept checking my windows.\n\nA lot of stuff has happened between then and now. It's been almost ten years. I'm in another state with my high school sweetheart, my boys are doing great, and we are happy."

Us guys are trained not to assume a girl is into us. If we do and we're wrong, we're socially crucified. At worst, it could result in legal action, depending on the extent it went to.

            "I\u2019m an identical twin so.... I\u2019ve been down this road many a time. In high school during a wrestling tournament there was a need for a supposed \u201cexhibition\u201d round for me and my brother\u2019s weight class, apparently our district scheduled one too many bye rounds. Coach asked if we\u2019d be willing to go for it and we did. The first period I couldn\u2019t help but laugh my ass off. I was literally wrestling my identical twin brother legally in front of an audience from 8 different schools and just couldn\u2019t help but laugh because I knew I could take him. Second period comes around and I had more points from a reversal on him. Of course the ref said top, bottom, or neutral (normal standing position). Of course I said neutral and my brother was still laughing during the second period. I knew what I had to do, went in for a single leg take down that almost ruined the match for me. He fell over my shoulder and brought me down under him. I was able to get based back up underneath enough to grab an arm and tuck and roll him on to his back and \u201cT\u2019d\u201d up and got the pin. Now the glorious part is at the end of the tournament when we received our medals I got 2nd in our weight class because I moved on to the finals and got my ass beat bad, and he got third. Obviously confused about the placing my brother received, we inquired.

I wasn\u2019t allowed to play console video games during the week all the way until I was 18 but some nights I\u2019d really be craving it so I would noiselessly creep through my house into my basement where I could play video games in peace.

            "As a kid, I played Medal of Honor: Allied Assault with my brother. We got to the fifth level, which took place in a rainy French city similar to Saving Private Ryan. However, we always got stuck on the first objective, which was to locate the bazooka team. There were no clues as to where this team was in a giant rubble-filled city with poor visibility. To make things worse, hidden enemy snipers would constantly fire at you, making the search much more difficult than it already was. My brother and I practically scoured every nook and cranny, but we never found this team. If the bazooka team was trying to stay hidden, they were doing a good job. In the months that followed, we reinstalled and replayed the game several times, but would always get stuck on that level.\n\nFast forward several years, and I got the digital version of Allied Assault for nostalgia's sake. I dreaded playing the fifth level, but to my surprise, I easily cleared the first objective by happening across the corpses of the bazooka team in one of the buildings. Turns out the CD we originally played on was bugged where the bodies never even rendered into the game. All we did was waste several hours looking for a group of people that never made it to the battle in the first place.\n\nGiddy at the prospect of finally completing the game, I happily continued the level only to quit when I kept getting sniped by those damn hidden snipers.",

Last year we brought it up and my dad said that he had got up that morning and seen the fish being taken by a raccoon and that he spent the next hour or so frantically fishing for another one.

So it wasn\u2019t all that strange when he said one day (I was maybe 10) we were doing a game where we\u2019d be blindfolded and taken on a drive. The object of the game was to call out what direction we were turning by feel and then ultimately after driving about 30 minutes give a guess roughly where we were and which direction home was in.

We never had to do this previously so my siblings and I were very confused, and anytime we didn't ask she got us in big trouble.\nTurns out the neighbours were harbouring a known pedophile in their house, and that's why mom got so upset with us going outside without asking.\n\nEdit: I have no idea of this man was on the run or not from the authorities, my mom probably had no idea either. Though if she knew he was on the run she for sure would have tipped the authorities. \n\nMom did catch the man having sex with a teen on our front lawn, and called the police.

            "My uncle (single/no kids) lived a few houses away from my grandparents, so my siblings and I would go between the houses and always loved my uncle's house because he had a huge fish tank of tropical fish and let us play video games. He was the most fun uncle there was, always taking us to the movies, amusement parks, fishing, golfing, and was so fun to be around, always had us rolling with laughter. But over time he became less ok with us popping over, and we resorted to sneaking into his house. We didn't get far along and he was pissed. From that point on we always just saw him in my grandparents' house. We used to joke with him about having a girlfriend over. Fast forward 17 years later he had a massive heart attack and while he was in the hospital his sisters went into his house to look for paperwork and get the house ready for his return. There they found ROOMS full of empty bottles of cheap vodka. My uncle had severe alcoholism for years and none of us knew it. And suddenly so many little things started making sense. He ended up dying shortly thereafter of organ failure brought on by alcoholism, wasn't even 60 yet.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the awards!!",

I don't know why no one had ever told me that before, except maybe they didn't because they weren't aware that I always harbored this guilt about it since I kept everything inside. Not one person had ever mentioned to me that he had died before I got it, or maybe I was in the hospital when he died, that part still isn't clear to me.

My brother who was 18 decided we should pull an \u2018oceans eleven\u2019 on it and steal the bottle and go to a massive house party with lots of beauty looking ladies.\n\nI told him that we would surely get caught because this bottle of whiskey was the pride of the house. My brother who is so cunning that if you placed a tail on him you could call him a weasel, explained that we would drink the bottle of the finest whiskey this side of Bonnie Scotland and take the empty bottle home and fill it with cold Irish black tea.\n\nWe duly did this and had an amazing time at the party. Mum and dad came home and were none the wiser.\n\nDay turned into night, days turned into months, seasons past, years went by and both my brother and I were in college.

Every grown-up could name the raindeer, tell you where Santa lived, how he got around, what he wore, how his toys were made, what you get for being naughty, etc. How could it possibly be a lie when everyone knows all these exact details?

As I lifted up the cup my heart sank because of course there was no leprechaun underneath. BUT hidden in the grass under the cup was a small green boot! I was so excited because I thought, well I didn\u2019t catch a full leprechaun but of course he will want his boot back. \n\nSo I ran inside and told my mom the whole story. She convinced me to write the little guy a note and to give him his boot back and perhaps he\u2019d give me a gift in return. So I pulled out some loose leaf and a pen and wrote the shoeless leprechaun a note. I told him that in exchange for his boot I would want a gift in return. I placed the boot on top of the note and left it on the kitchen table. I also made sure to leave the back door open a smidge before bed. \n\nIn the morning I rushed downstairs to see if my plan had worked. On the kitchen table the boot was no where to be seen but in its place was this power rangers action figure that I had bugged my parent for a week or so prior. I was so excited and happy and brought it in for show and tell and bragged to everyone at school how I had cut a deal with a leprechaun in exchange for my new favorite toy. But life went on and years passed and my belief in magic faded along with the memory. \n\nYears later when I was in college we moved out of my childhood home and during the move we all took the time to go through a bunch of our old things. I was helping my mom with one of her memory/keep sake boxes and she was telling me about the different items and what memories were attached to them. At the bottom of the box was a little green piece of felt that was cut and sewn into the shape of a boot. The memory of that day came rushing back to me as finally realized the effort my mom had gone through to make a little boy believe in magic. It is my favorite childhood memory now and one of the most impactful moments in my life. I still get teary eyed thinking about it and hope to do little things like that for my kids because little things like that really do make a difference.\n\nLove you mom! \n\nTLDR\n\nThought I caught a leprechauns boot and exchanged it for a toy. Years later realized my mom had set the whole thing up to help her son believe in magic.",
            "We lived abroad and my mum had her signature apple pie that was just incredible. For four years we ate up this apple pie without question. \n\nWhen we moved back, the apple pie tasted different, not bad per say, just different. My mum fobbed us off with saying it was the different type of apples being used.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t till we were much older that she came clean about how expensive apples were when we were abroad and she had in fact been using christophine (a tasteless plant, I think?) and spicing it to taste like apple pie. It was a real bombshell moment.\n\nLooking back on it, it seems so trivial but at the time it shook the foundations of our reality. If apple pie isn\u2019t apple pie, what the hell else is just a lie?",
            "The Mystery of Zeus.  When I was very young I very distinctly remember having a friend named Zeus. How could you forget someone with THAT amazing of a name? At some point, probably around Third Grade, he moved away and disappeared. I could never even find him in the yearbooks, it's like he never existed. My mother, the family, everyone kept telling me that I was imagining this kid.\n\nOne day I'm telling my wife about my old best friend Zeus, the kid who vanished off the face of the earth and took every person's memory of him with him. I even showed her where he used to love when we drove by it, recounting the day I went to his birthday party and he had a great pi\u00f1ata.  \n\nMy wife stared at me for a moment and, very slowly, asked:\n\n \"Honey, did people yell for him a lot? Like, 'Hey Zeus, come here'?\" \n\n\"Well of course they did, how else would they get his attention? Hey Zeus, what's up? Hey Zeus how are ya? Duh. That's a silly question.\"\n\n\"And he had a pi\u00f1ata?\"\n\n\"Yeah why?\"\n\n\"Sweetie I bet you his name was JESUS. HEY-ZEUS. ZEUS.\"\n\nIt was like being hit with a truck of realization. I asked my mother later and, yes, I did pal around with a kid named Jesus. It was one of the greatest mysteries of my life, one that made me question whether or not it was an imaginary friend, and it turned out to just me being a dumb-as-a-rock kid.",
            "When I was around 10 or so my family moved to a house out in the country. It sat back about a half mile from the road, and in the front by the road was an old graveyard. Old at least in Midwestern US standards, most gravestones were from the 1800s to early 1900s.\n\nThe year that we moved there my parents wanted to start several gardens, and one of them up near the fence line by the graveyard to block the view from the road. I was helping my dad plant things and I found a row of horse teeth, which I thought was weird, but my dad told me that sometimes people buried their horses like we do the dogs and cats we had that passed, and I thought nothing of it and we buried it back where we found it. Dad never ended up doing much with that garden, but I never worried about it. \n\nWhen I was in college and had long since forgotten about it, one of my friends who was my father's teacher's assistant at the time (he taught in the college I went to) asked me about the time I dug up part of a skull. Oh yeah, the horse teeth?\n\nOh no, that wasn't from a horse. \n\nTl;Dr: I guess they used to bury people the town looked down upon outside of the graveyard fence, and I found one and it was NOT A HORSE.",

            "I had a golden retriever growing up who loved chew toys. One year, we got him one of those big, meaty cow bones as a birthday present and put him in the backyard to go ham on it. He had it for a single afternoon, and then it vanished. This thing was over a foot long. We checked all over the backyard (I had a fairly large backyard with ivy, cattails, and some other shrubbery around the perimeter) and could not find a trace of it, not even some overturned dirt where he might have buried it. We eventually concluded that a coyote must have come into the yard at night and taken it, even though our fence was quite tall.\n\nTen years later, the dog has passed away, the whole family has moved halfway across the state, and my parents are renting out the house. They drove down one weekend to do some maintenance for the tenants and found The Bone sitting smack in the middle of the backyard steps, meatless and somewhat bleached out, but completely intact. My dad casually brings it up and the tenants tell him their little dog found it under the back porch.\n\nAll those years we thought the dog just liked chilling under the porch, and he was actually working on that damn bone.",

Well, me being a stubborn little shit just decided if I didn\u2019t go to the bathroom, I wouldn\u2019t have to go to bed.  Only I had to go to bed anyway and ended up wetting the bed. After this happened three maybe four times, my sister came up with an amazing idea. She being 11 years older than me what is my idol. I would have done anything for her because I adored her. So right before bedtime one night, she told me that she really really really had to pee, but she was so busy with homework and could I go Pee for her so she could get her homework done.  And of course my toddler ass was an idiot and did it. The kicker is I was driving along going to a babysitting job when I was 17 years old and out of the blue it hit me that you literally cannot pee for someone. I felt so stupid.

We had two dogs that moved with us and \u201cmy\u201d dog was Hannah, the collie. She didn\u2019t handle the move very well and I remember her always running away and chewing on doors to get outside, stuff like that. Well one day my mother told me that Hannah had gone to live on a farm in Alabama and that she\u2019d be much happier there. I automatically believed her because we lived in the boonies down in Alabama and all our neighbors had farmland. It wasn\u2019t until I was much older (like 20+ years) that a friend pointed out to me that what my mom told me sounds like the classic lie you tell a kid when their pet dies. Well I asked my mom about it again and she reassured me that Hannah had, in fact, gone to live with an old neighbor of ours in Alabama that had enough land for her to run like she loved and even proved it with pictures. It was nice to know she hadn\u2019t actually died way back then but for a few days I felt like an idiot for never questioning that \u201cHannah went to live on a farm\u201d turns out I was smart to believe my momma!",

We have family there, and mum thought it would be a nice change and would give us a nice, wholesome Christmas experience.\nOne day we went shopping with my aunt in a large shopping centre in Glasgow and I distinctly remember something strange happening. \nI saw a man with the exact same bright coloured coat that my dad had at the time. He had similar coloured hair too. I remember trying to run out of my mothers arms, and i was screaming, \u201cDaddy, Daddy,\u201d but obviously the guy didn\u2019t look at me.

When I was a kid, I thought that it was a big cat zoo. I asked my parents why we never went and my dad just kinda laughed and told me I could go when I was older. So I figured it must be a fancy zoo since my parents never let me got to work parties at big fancy houses.\n\n I spend the next 15 or so years believing what six year old me saw as 2 and 2.

            "When I was a little kid in the 80s I was swept up by the Satanic Panic. I went to a Catholic school in medium sized city and they really took it seriously. Everyone did. I was convinced that the entire world was secretly controlled by a cabal of devil worshiping sex fiends and I was determined to grow up and do everything I could to stop them. Then sometime in high school the whole thing just went away. One day the Satanic Illuminati was out to molest every little kid they could find and then next day they were gone. Eventually I forgot all about the whole thing. \n\nFlash forward to my mid 20s. I was in college and sitting in my apartment getting high when all of a sudden I remembered the whole Satanic Panic. I remember thinking \"Whatever happened with that? Were they all caught? Did I *dream* that\"? Luckily the internet was in its extreme infancy but since my roommate was a longtime computer geek we had it in my apartment. So I went online and looked it up. I'll admit that I felt mixed emotions when I found out that 99.99% of it was total bullshit. I was both relieved *and* angry. Relieved for obvious reasons but angry because it generated a lot of fear in me when I was little. Little kids shouldn't be hearing stories of ritual sex abuse and violent sacrifices. For fuck sake my school had a lecturer who was a priest who was supposed expert on Satanism and he showed us a movie where some people killed and ate an actual cat. I was junior high age. We were told it was 100% real and while now as an adult I'm skeptical it was it still *looked* real. Especially to a 12 year old. Anyway, the whole thing was fucked up but I'm glad I got closure. And now it's one of those things that people are now comfortable talking about and being an adult I find the whole thing very fascinating. Everything from how it started to how it ended and everything in between is a pretty wild ride.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI'd like to first thank everyone for their comments but I felt like I had to make one quick edit to sort of clarify one thing: My parents (and my extended family for that matter) were NOT involved in any of this stuff. Their religious inclinations were basically \"Go to church on Sundays and send the kids to Catholic school\". Hell, we owned one \"Family Bible\" and it sat in the bottom drawer of my moms dresser forever.

            "Before I was born my parents and sister had a dog called Sandy - a golden Labrador.\nSandy and my dad were inseparable and when I came along Sandy was apparently not pleased.\nTwo incidents in particular caused my parents to get rid of Sandy which were him dragging me out my baby bouncer and another were he tried to shove me out my dads arms.\n\nGrowing up I was told stories about how Sandy \u201cwent to live on a farm with dads friends\u201d and as I got older I realised that was code for a dog being put down.\nHonestly I felt pretty guilty that I\u2019d come along and this dog has been put to sleep because of it.\n\nSo at about age 20 I asked my dad about it and he just laughed.\n\nTurns out Sandy really did go to live with his ex army friend on a farm in Appledore. He showed me photos of Sandy his friend used to send him and told me how he\u2019d go down and visit regularly.",

            "Growing up, my wife's parents told her she was stupid. Her grandparents reinforced the idea. Through out high school, her home life was such a train wreck, she didn't put in much effort, but she did okay. Obviously, she was too stupid for college but after her sister was encouraged to go, she applied anyway. She was crushed but unsurprised when she didn't hear back from any colleges.\n\nYears later, long after we were married, she decided to try to get into college again. Something was wrong with her application, though. Someone with her maiden name and social security number was already accepted but had never attended. The date of the acceptance was from when she was 19. Her mother intercepted the acceptance letter and threw it away.\n\nMy wife graduates next fall after thinking for 20 years that she was too stupid for college.\n\nI still have a lot of pent up rage against my mother-in-law.",
            "I had this book when I was a little kid. I don\u2019t remember too much about it, but I remember thinking the book was weird because there was one page where the picture seemed to sometimes have a goat in it and sometimes not, and I could never figure out why the goat sometimes wasn\u2019t there. I asked my nanny and she said the goat was away eating or something like that.\n\nWell, when I moved out of my mom\u2019s place, I was going through my stuff and found my old kid books. Turns out I had two copies of this book, but they were from different printing runs, and for some reason, one had the goat in this particular picture and one did not. Guess I never realized since they were basically identical otherwise. Probably was given the same book twice as a gift or something.",
            "When I was 7 years old our 11 year old dog ran away after the cable guy left the back yard gate open. Was never found. At least that's what my parents told me. Last year I was bored at work one day and randomly messaged my older brother to mess with him \"hey did you know that Rex didn't run away, that mom and dad took him to be put down and lied to not get everyone sad?\" I was expecting a shocked text response and was ready to reply back \"sike\" but his reply was \"Oh yeah I know, I went with them.\"",

My mother would tell me, \"They're over at the next door neighbor's house.\"\n\nDisappointed, I would stop looking.\n\nMany years later, when I finally remember to ask, she said, \"Of course they were never at the next door neighbor's house. Who stores their stuff with their neighbor? You just looked in the closets; you never bothered to open the suitcases inside of them.\"\n\nI can't believe I fell for that one, though.",

            "I'm Autistic, and a survivor of abuse because of it. \n\n I grew up in a dysfunctional family that has varying mental health issues and poor education. I was always the difficult child, particular, didn't like to do things the way people wanted me to, always thinking outside the box, and people (my family included) did not understand me, I can recall schoolyard bullies and my siblings basically trying to beat it out of me and \"make me normal\".  I was abused as a kid, and that abuse would/has shaped me.\n\n When I entered gradeschool I was always isolated. I was the kid who didn't talk to anyone else and felt like no one would ever like him.  I would be moved to the back of the class and sat alone. They used to test me to see how smart I was, they wanted me to take medication that I refused, and I was also part of programs where someone would take me to a special room and would spend time being kind to me and taking notes, I would be rewarded by being allowed to play with the toys in the room for twenty minutes.\n\nAs I grew up I struggled with depression, and battled with it for most of my life. I wasn't great at making friends, and always felt like an outcast. I felt envious of others who seemed to have life so easy. My teachers wanted to understand me, they knew I was bright, they were mainly confused about why I would never apply myself. \n\nI ballooned up to 360lbs from the depression and overeating. The weight of the pain I felt for not being able to live life as I wanted to physically manifested onto my body. At my lowest I wanted to end it all and voluntarily stayed on a psych ward to try to get help.\n\nThings changed when I decided to go to a community college. There I found that I was a gifted writer and was encouraged by professors that I was a bright man. Treated like an actual adult I gained confidence, and I began to eat better and work out. I started loving myself. \n\nA few years later my nephew was born. My sister had always feared her child would be \"retarded\", so when he had developmental issues with his speech, she took him to every specialist she could. I never thought my Nephew had problems, I could tell he was smart and he oddly reminded me of myself. \n\nWe later found out that he was autistic. \n\nAnd as my sister began to learn how to care for her son, she slowly realized what I had known the second she told me that he was autistic. I was too. \n\nShe believes that the entire family is on the spectrum, but for sure I am right in-between ADHD and Autism.\n\nThis revelation lead to me finally learning how to accept the things that make me different, to forgive and accept my troubled past, and to move forward in the healing process. \n\n The start of my journey of self healing and personal growth was about 10 years ago now. I went from 360lbs to a current 220lbs, and at 28 years old, I now look and feel like the person I always wished I could be.  I'm employed full time, I rent a room in a home and pay all my own bills, and am growing as a person each day. Money is a bit tight and I never knew how expensive life was, but I'm figuring everything out and going to continue working on adding chapters to my success story.  \n\n\nIf any of you out there feel like or have felt like I did. You can make the changes to become who you want to be. You can take control of your life. And the things that make you unique are the things that will propel you forward.  \n\nBless you guys. \n\nHappy Holidays.",

It's very friendly, but its growth is stunted and its bones are misshapen because it wasn't fed proper food.  \n\n\n\\- A sea serpent who is morbidly obese because it was put into a community fishtank and ate all of its tankmates after the employee at the other pet store said it would get along with tetras.  \n\n\n\\- A prince frog that will transform upon receiving true loves first kiss, but it wasn't handled very much before it was in stock and won't let you pick it up without biting you and/or shitting on you.  \n\n\n\\- A dragon. There's nothing wrong with it, it's in perfect health, very tame and friendly, comes from good breeding, and it's gorgeous.

            "I've been on Reddit for eight years now, and I have the sixth-most comment karma on the site.\n\nIn other words, this is going to be a *serious* answer.\n\nBack when I was first getting my start here, a front-page post would typically have about 1,000 upvotes in total. As time went on, that number climbed to about 2,000. (You can see it documented in [this ancient text](https://i.imgur.com/k3Kf5.png), which is what you start seeing if you [play too much *Skyrim*](https://imgur.com/gallery/fMAYB/).)\n\nNowadays, a top-scoring post will often attract 100,000 upvotes or more. At the time of this comment's writing, the most-upvoted post of all time on /r/Pics currently sits at approximately **258,000 upvotes**, and the highest-scoring post on the entire site \u2013 which was featured on /r/Funny \u2013 is at about **308,000 upvotes**. (A post to /r/Movies was actually higher-scoring at 350,000, but an old glitch keeps it from showing up in most rankings.) Both of those were submitted close to two years ago, and Reddit has only grown since.\n\nThere are currently thought to be approximately **350 million unique users** on the site (once you discount all of the alternate accounts, [spammers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU), and other such things). As such, it isn't a stretch to assume that a single post has *already* surpassed one million upvotes... but due to the way that **Reddit fuzzes its voting numbers**, that submission probably appears to have a much lower score.\n\nNow, that isn't to say that a post has *definitely* surpassed a million, and since nothing has *visibly* reached that milestone, we can still argue that the moment has yet to come. Looking at past voting behaviors and trends, though, it should be easy enough to predict the submission that will finally make it over into a seventh digit:\n\n1. It will be submitted to /r/Funny, /r/Pics, or /r/Gaming.\n2. It will have a well-written, error-free title.\n3. It will be something largely original, but which nonetheless references a trend in popular culture.\n4. It will be posted toward the beginning of the week, probably in the morning (in the United States).\n5. It will not be memetic on its own, but it will prompt emulations.\n6. It will not be political, given the divisive nature of those offerings.\n7. It will definitely not taunt Happy Fun Ball.\n8. It will be appreciable to Redditors and non-Redditors alike.\n\nIf we assume that visible voting numbers will continue to increase at the same rate that they have over the past two years, then we'll probably see **the first visible million in mid-2021**. It might even be earlier than that, assuming that Reddit continues to accelerate its upward climb in popularity.\n\nWith all of this in mind, [here is an artist's rendering of what we can expect](https://i.imgur.com/rZpFtXP.png).\n\nIt... it will make sense once it gets posted.\n\n**TL;DR: A post might have already surpassed 1,000,000 upvotes. If it hasn't, we'll see it soon.**",

Think of how many people use Reddit in relation to the average upvotes you see.\n\nSure not every vote counts and it averages it out, like YouTubes view count, but 12k is the lowest I see on my front page for subs with millions of subscribers.\n\nIt typically tops out at around 26k every day.\n\nThis is a website with 350 MILLION motherfuckers. As long as they get into /r/all they should be getting 50-70k upvotes on average per day. Anything that touches that number is an outlier.\n\nThat's also because the vast minority of Reddit users actually upvote. Triple the current user count and we'll actually start seeing those millions of karma.\n\nMaybe. That's a hard maybe. Honestly times it by 35 and you'll definitely hit that mark.\n\nAs for what it would be I'd imagine news that everyone universally would adore, such as the first manned mission to Mars but more than likely the first man on Mars. That'd be HUGE in history and would absolutely dominate every single subreddit, whether it's relevant or not.\n\nI'd say first man on Mars is more likely because think about the Black Hole or the reusable rockets.

In the back seat there was like trash bags of clothes, boxes of DVDs/games/pc hardware etc. There was also the big paper Victoria's Secret bag that I kept all my sex toys in. Because the dude that hit me was doing nearly 80 and I was at a complete stop, everything that wasn't in a trash bag exploded and went everywhere. So when the police arrived to search my car (I guess to make sure I wasn't drinking since I'd been at a dead stop on the freeway, long story lmaooo) they were greeted with a vast array of random things, including my stash of sex devices. They had a good laugh and assured me it wasn't the weirdest thing they'd seen, honestly I needed the laugh too but it was still hella embarrassing.\n\nOnce that was over, my car was towed to a wrecker yard to be held until I collected my stuff from it. My mom insisted on helping me and I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying no, so I let her come and quickly bagged all the sex stuff before she even got out of the car. Crisis averted. Although everyone at that wrecker yard 100% saw it.\n\nA couple weeks later, my mom was helping me unpack my stuff from the move and she grabbed a bag of stuff that had been in my car. I didn't think anything of it, I was busy. All of a sudden she says she found a dog collar and starts explaining that it must be one of her dog's because she's missing one, but stops her sentence short and I immediately knew what happened.

I stopped just in time to not hit him, but he wouldn't move from in front of my car so I had to sit there until he did. By the time he shuffled away and I was ready to hit the gas again, I got hit. He walked a good distance away from the wreck he caused and proceeded to stare at the guard rail until the police arrived, then he hopped off the highway and disappeared.\n\nI've included a photo of the wreck with the man standing just above my passenger mirror under the streetlight staring at the guard rail for your enjoyment.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/4JrdIv6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4JrdIv6.jpg)",

Nobody used this thing anymore, and I always put it back (usually after hitting it with some dissinfectant wipes). One night, my dad asked me to get the garage speakers from under my bed, and I agreed to get them the next day. A few hours later, I was just casually absentmindedly browsing (I don't remember what exactly I was looking at), when something came up and I needed to go downstairs (I don't remember what). I turned off the phone without closing any tabs and left. My dad for some reason decided to go in my room and take back the speakers from under my bed, where I had also tossed the phone. When I got back, there was no phone or speakers to be found. I honestly could not remember what exactly I was looking at. A few days later, he told me he \"saw what i was looking at on that phone\" and refused to specify, saying that was my job. I wanted to know exactly what was seen, so I could assess the damage. He claimed that as soon as he unlocked the phone, he saw two gay men grinding on each other. I'm a heterosexual male, and most sites I used at the time never had popups THAT bad.

It just called to me, so I went in and picked it up.

Out of the corner of my eye I see some people crowding around a woman who is crying. I keep listening and people are calling out for the person who was her santa. I go over and reveal that it was me.\n\nThe lady I had bought for was crying and hugged me. She said 10 years ago her house burned down along with all her of possessions. The book that I bought her, was her favourite and also the exact same edition so had the exact same cover she remembered. \n\nBecause it was a second hand book it was even weathered in the same places she remembered, so it was as if I'd grabbed the book off her shelf before the fire and delivered it to her 10 years later.",

It got to the point that people would dump them into our back yard.\n\nOne day, 4 dogs show up: two puppies, a brindle, and a beagle. We immediately get the puppies adopted out, because they're young and cute. \n\nFast forward 8 months. We've tried adopting out the beagle male, twice he's been returned to us. The brindle is an extremely tragic case, and I won't get in to her, but she was the mother and the beagle was the father of the puppies. \n\nOne fine Sunday, I decide that we need to swing b my the Volunteer Run animal shelter down the road from our house. It was a Sunday. 3 years I've driven past this place, 3 years I haven't ever been because the owner and I know each other from around town and I do NOT care for her, and today I wanted to swing by because something about their new cages caught me eye. Why not? It's closed anyways, no one's there. \n\nSo we get out and look around. I notice there's a green truck parked in the driveway. Shrug it off. This woman comes around the corner and asks us if we work there. Tell her no, but ask what she needs. She's interested in adopting a dog. She's been living in a different town 10 miles away for the last few months and since she was in town today, she wanted to check this shelter. Her dog ran away about 10 months prior. So I tell her we have two available for adoption. A brindle and a beagle. She says her dog that ran away was a beagle. \n\nAt this point it might be exactly what you're thinking. And you're right. Somehow, some way, we'd ended up with her beagle in our yard. And then coincidentally met her on a random day at a location i had never been to but driven past almost every day. The brindle, it turned out, was his girlfriend from next door that would escape with him. Those neighbors had skilled out on their rent shortly before the woman had moved and were not nice people. \n\nSo, she took the beagle, her beagle who had been missing for almost a year, home. \n\nThe final coincidence is that we named that beagle Bagel. And his original name? Brownie. Food names!!!",

I needed to buy a new pair of shorts since I didn't bring enough.\n\nWe couldn't find any regular clothing stores, so we ended up in a place where second hands clothes were sold. They got their clothes from all over the world, wherever people collect clothes for the less fortunate. We call it \"humanitas\" over here in the Netherlands.

I turned my light off again and it was there, flipped it back on and slept with the light on for the rest of the night. Couldn\u2019t sleep without the light on for days lol.",
            "I was biking down a country road I used to live on, I think I was 8 or 9, and on my way home I saw this small humanoid looking being run across the road, from one crop field into a corn field.\nThe only details I could make out, and I still vividly remember, was that it was completely covered in yellow, from neck to feet, and I think it has green on it's head. I told my mom about it and all she could come up with was something about cabbage patch kids.\nNever saw that thing again, but I still think about it from time to time\n\nEdit: it was the size of a small child, about 50 feet away",
            "My cousin had struggled with depression his whole life, and a few years ago things came to a head. He was 100% convinced the only cure to his depression was suicide, that  death was the only thing that would make him truly happy. We were close, so it hit pretty hard. After the funeral, my aunt told us that she had saw a helium filled smiley face balloon kind of float in front of her, then stop, and it just kinda sat there for a minute. Then it flew up and away, out of sight, on its own. When she told us this we kind of just brushed it off as a coincidence, but it kept happening to her over the next couple weeks. \n\nWe thought she was just recognizing patterns, until I was at a music festival a few months later and the exact same type of balloon, same colour and everything, float through my campsite, and did the same thing where it stopped on its own, \"stared\" at me, then kind of bobbed and flew up and away. I'm not really a believer in ghosts and the like but I'm convinced in some shape or form that was my cousin telling us that he was finally happy.",
            "Early into my now Wife and I's relationship I had a dream about her in childbirth. Very vivid, and long. Like I spent days in the hospital with her and everything was in a strange twilight. When it came time to deliver things went very wrong and she and baby ended up passing away. \n\nI woke up quite shook naturally but brushed it off. I am a nurse and have had to deal with traumatic OB situations before, and I chocked it up to me dealing with that stress through a dream. \n\nSix years later and my wife is pregnant, I have forgotten the dream by now. I get a call late into the 3rd trimester while I am on shift. Wife is going to the ER for a bad BP. I get off my shift and go to meet her. \n\nAs soon as I step into the room I remember my dream. Its the same damn room. Which is extra spooky because the hospital we were at wasn't even built when I had the dream. \n\nThis is last year right when lock down started, my wife is admitted they want to wait a week to deliver if possible, she will be kept in a twilight state until that time. So its me in this room eerily isolated as the world around us is frozen and my wife is incoherent mere feet away. Lingering for days in this room I brushed off my dream, trying to manage my anxiety and stress. \n\nCome show time my wife gets ready to begin pushing and it's exactly the same scenario as my dream. Things start going poorly, but the Dr. Thinks delivery is still possible, but at this point I finally freak out into full panic, and demand a C section for my wife. The Dr. I can tell wants to argue but I think my outburst made her step back and reassess the situation and she made the call for emergency c section.  \n\nTook 10 minutes for me to get taken back and as I'm in the OR I see my baby come out lifeless. They do everything they can and manage to resuscitate her. In the meantime my wife is doing poorly and they are scrambling to control her bleeding. \n\nI follow the baby out knowing there's really nothing I can do. Baby gets life flighted to another hospital, but before we go I see my wife stable and headed to the ICU. \n\nBoth my wife and baby are critical but alive. \n\nToday they are both thriving and my baby is 16 months and just a tornado of energy. \n\nI don't know that they would be alive if not for that dream and it causing me to freakout and demand a change in plan.",
            "I have 2:\n\nOne day (about 20 years ago), I came home from work to find my Dad dead on the sofa. He was cold to the touch, but I still called 911 and tried to resuscitate him in case there was ANY chance that I was wrong. \nMy Grandparents lived down the street. Their house was always the gathering place. People came for a cup of coffee every day. My Dad had suffered some brain injuries a few years prior, but had fully recovered and got sober, so his death was pretty unexpected (he was only\n48). When the ambulance came roaring down the street, my Grandmother said something along the lines of \u201cI hope that\u2019s not going to my Son\u2019s house\u201d. My Uncle was in the kitchen at the time and said. Nah, your Son is at the door\u201d. He had seen my Dad looking for a n the window next to the door. Of course, he was gone by that time. Still gives me chills \n\n\nThe other one is not nearly as dramatic: My wife and I lived next to a golf course. One morning we were leaving at around 5am. A golf cart with 2 guys crossed in front of us. Not dangerously close. But, close. We remarked that it was pretty early for people to be out (I had never seen anyone out that early in the few years that I had lived there). I looked over to my left, and they were nowhere to be seen. This was a very open parking lot. We stopped and looked back, but no trace of of any golf cart or anyone in general.\n\nThanks for attending my long-winded ghost conference. There are refreshments in the lobby.",
            "My dad killed my mom when I was 10. I'm now mid 30s. 2 years ago I had lost my wedding ring. We looked everywhere. I even played back the security camera at work to see if I was wearing it when I left. I gave up finding it and was very upset.\n\nOne night I had a dream my mom woke me up and said \"I know you've been looking for this. I love you. It'll be out here.\"\n\nIn the morning I was getting ready for work as usual, sat down on the couch. Right in front of me on the ottoman was my ring. I went to bed after my wife and she woke up after me. I used that ottoman the night before and there's no way the ring could have been there. \n\nAgain, I checked our camera (we had been robbed once so we kept a camera towards the front door, it could see our couch) and the ottoman had no ring when I went to bed. \n\nI still cry every now and then remembering it.",
            "Many years ago, my parents had separated and my father was planning on taking a trip across the country to California.  He was pretty excited about it.\n  \n  \nI talk to him the day before he's leaving, wish him well and tell him I'll talk to him after he get's to California.  \n   \n  \nThe day of his trip, he calls me and tells me he decided last minute not to go.   Refuses to really get into why.  Just says he changed his mind.  Seemed really odd for something that he had been planning for a couple months. \n  \n  \nThat night I'm sitting at my girlfriends house and we're watching the news, and they report that US Air Flight 1493 - the flight my dad was supposed to be on - collided with another aircraft while landing in Los Angeles.  About 25% of the people on the flight were killed.  Hard to know how my Dad would have made out, because it really depended on where you were sitting (front vs. back of the plane).   \n  \n  \nIt was several months before he finally told me that night before he was supposed to leave, he had an extremely vivid dream that he died in a fiery plane crash.  So vivid that it scared him out of flying that day.  \n  \n  \nMy dad is a marine corps Vietnam veteran who saw combat.  I can only imagine how vivid the dream must have been, to scare him out of getting on that plane that morning.\n  \n  \n  \nEdit: believe it or not I've never actually watched Final Destination.

            "Super minor compared to many in this thread.\n\nNight before thanksgiving 3 years ago I was across the country at my parents, driving back to theirs with my now-wife from a friends house. As we draw near, there is some type of bundle in the middle of the road. I stopped and pulled off to move it, and it turned out to be a barred owl that got clipped by a car. Long story short I spend the rest of that night getting the owl into a puppy cage, gave it some food and water, and the next day dropped it off at a wildlife rescue center. \n\nI got home the next week, all the way across the country (New Jersey to Oregon). I stepped outside and there was a barred owl sitting on my fence watching me. It was gone by the time I got back. But now I know I'm straight with all owls.",
            "My buddy and I were playing tennis one night at some courts by my house. Lights usually went out at 11, but for whatever reason that night they went off at a weird time, like 10:43. Whatever, that was weird, we collected our stuff and started walking to my car about 500 feet from the courts. My buddy\u2019s mom pulls up right as we\u2019re getting to my car and goes \u201cWhere the hell have you been? I called your cell and some guy was just laughing, it didn\u2019t sound like you\u201d. It was then my buddy realized he didn\u2019t have his phone on him. He told his mom to call his cell again and we could see it light up in the middle of the court we were playing on (by the net, but still definitely in between the single lines, not at all where we kept the rest of our stuff). He goes and gets it and only has the one missed call from his mom, the one she just made. He asked if she called the right number and her call log showed 3 calls to his phone all that night. We can\u2019t explain why the cell was on the court or what happened with the calls or what happened with the lights. It was surreal",
            "Went with my brother to see an old family property my mother had inherited in a really rural area. We were just looking about, it hadn't been lived in for decades. A bit of wind, a bit of a rainy day, and both me and my brother were inspecting the house until we started hearing a weird rhythmic knock coming from around the building. Just a knock at regular intervals much like a clock sounds but a lot louder. We stepped out to look around, but the noise started sounding like it was getting further away from us, until it disappeared. We left shortly afterwards.\n\nA couple of days go by, and I stopped by my mother's. I ask her if she has any pictures of the original owner of the house which was her grandfather, so my great grandfather. She pulled it out, guess what? The man had a wooden leg as a result of a war injury. Told my mother all about it and it was like she was remembering him. She says that's exactly how it sounded when he walked on the porch. \n\nWeird af.\n\nEdit: It's possible it was a bird tapping on wood somewhere around, but as far as I know birds that do this tend to tap in a very rapid fashion, in my story above, the knocks were about 2 seconds or so apart, quite a bit different from how an animal usually behaves. I'm not into supernatural stuff but damn... that was eerie.",

            "I have an idea of what may have happened, but I cannot definitively say how this happened.\n\nMy father died in 2000 in my parent's house. I was over one night pretty late after my mother had gone to sleep. I swear I could feel my father's presence, as I was right in the spot where he had died. (They believe he had a heart attack while laying on the couch, tried to get off the couch to call for help but fell on the floor and died, though no one else was home when it happened. I was on the couch when this happened.)\n\nAnyway, I thought to myself, \"This is stupid. People don't leave essences behind, I'm not feeling anything.\" So, I say out loud, \"If this is really you, Dad, knock a box of cereal off the shelf onto the floor.\"\n\nI wanted to pick something I didn't think could happen by accident. I went into the kitchen and watched the shelf with the cereal on it for a few minutes and nothing happened. Since it was almost midnight, I decided to sleep in my old bedroom.\n\nI woke up the next morning and went downstairs and a box of cereal was laying on the floor. I say to my mother, \"Did you knock that cereal onto the floor?\" She said no, it was like that when she woke up.\n\nSo... what the fuck, man.\n\nHOWEVER, my mother had a cat. I'm guessing the cat did it, but I don't know for sure. If she'd gotten on the shelf, everything would have been knocked around and messy from her. Everything was else was in its normal position, just the box of cereal was on the floor.\n\nI mean, regardless, it has to have been the cat, right?\n\n*Edit:* My mother also told me, months before this happened, that she felt my father get in bed with her one night after he died. She said, \"Go away, Greg. You're dead. You don't need to go to bed anymore.\" and she says she felt him get out of the bed after that. Weird. (My mother despised my father by the end of his life though they remained married, it's not surprising she told him to GTFO.)",

About a mile from my parent\u2019s house, there was this old abandoned farm house that all the area kids said was haunted. They would sneak into the house after dark, all the typical stupid kid crap, but I believe there are things in this world better left alone and never went.\n\nYears pass, the house fell into disrepair and was eventually torn down, leaving an old weathered barn. Well, I make a little side money selling photos of abandoned places, so I wanted to take a picture of the barn. I parked on the road and was walking up the drive, I made it about ten feet before I just could not walk any further. My feet wouldn\u2019t move forward, my adrenaline spiked and I burst into tears. So I turned back and ran to my car. I didn\u2019t feel safe until I got past a nearby creek you have to cross to get there.\n\nI let it go, but a few months later we had to drive past the property after having Christmas dinner with my parents and there was a creature standing in the drive. It reminded me of the Faun from Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, just super tall with a wide head and horns or antlers, but the eyes were more on the side of the head.\n\nAgain adrenaline kicked in and I burst into tears, but I was trying to keep it together because I didn\u2019t want to freak out my kids.

He said she was the lady who taught him how to do his \"silly laugh\".\n\nContext: his \"silly laugh\" as we called it was a laugh that sounded just like my Grandmother's. The reason it was so specific and \"silly\" was that my Grandmother had a brain aneurism when my mom was in her teens.

We have this weird carpet runner over our hard wood stairs that's only really attached at the top of the flight but otherwise not fitted or secured to each individual stair, so naturally I step on an air bubble of carpet with my vision obscured by the laundry and fall backwards while bear hugging a bunch of blankets. \n\nI specifically remember thinking \"welp, guess I'm about to die\" while almost airborne with just my big toe left on the carpet when I felt two hands, one on either side of my shoulder blades, give me a firm shove that launched me back up on the step and diagonally against the stair rail. I assumed mom somehow silently came back early without announcing herself and turned around to thank her while still clinging to the railing, but no one was there. I scurried upstairs to put my things down while calling her name and walked the house afterwards to check if any doors were unlocked or if her car was there. I finally resorted to calling her cell where she told me she was hitting up a few more stores. It still feels like there's a presence on that stairwell- like someone's watching but in a protective way rather than sinisterly.\n\nE: thanks for all the awards!

I hadn\u2019t seen her or spoken to her in at least 10 years and had never met her child, except seeing pictures/ posts on Facebook and commenting on them. In my dream I was walking down a street at night and out of nowhere her little girl appears next to me and I asked her, \u201cWhere is your mama? Why are you by yourself?\u201d I remember her taking me to some bushes near a random house on the street and finding my friend in bad shape (beaten up or something) on the ground and I remember running to the door of the random house screaming for help and to call the police. This is all I can recall from the dream but I think there may have been a little more. \n\nThe next day, I wake up and think to myself, man that was weird. Maybe I dreamt of her because we had just spoken a little in comments of a Facebook post, I should send her a message. I go on about my day, go to work, get home later that day and sit on my couch and scroll through Facebook. \n\nBAM. 1000 posts\u2014 Rest In Peace, etc - All of them tagged my friend and her daughter. I thought WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F*CK!?!? At that point there was no information as to what had happened, so I thought it must have been a car accident or something. Over the course of the next few weeks to months, more and more information came out and it was NOT an accident. My friend and her sweet baby had been murdered by some animal (I won\u2019t refer to them as a person). \n\nThis happened about 5 years ago. I still remember the main parts of the dream vividly.

There during the year i knew her whole family, among these was her husband that i'll call Dave.\nSo Dave was a pretty cool guy, just the average elder you would find in any rural town, he liked to drink wine with his friends at the bar, go hunting and he had a lot of good and interesting stories to tell me when i was a kid, and after all these years spent togheter he basically considered me as a grandson. \nNow back when covid hit for the first time in my country i had a dream one night where Mary was coming to my house to clean as every other week, but this time in my living room there was a closed black coffin. When i asked her what was in there she looked at me and said in a sad tone: \"Dave is inside there\". \nNow if that wasn't strange enough i remember waking up later that night and feeling a presence to the side of my bed, and i distinctly remember to have said while still being half asleep: \"Come on Dave let me get back to sleep\".\nNext morning when i woke my parents told me that Mary had called saying that Dave had passed that night due to covid complication, to this day i still haven't told anyone about it and i am still a bit freaked out from the whole story.\nAlso sorry for format and grammar but i'm on mobile and english isn't my first language",

The seats I got were down the 3rd base line about as far away from home plate as you can get and still be in the stadium (important).  \n\nAs the game progresses, she sees foul balls going into the stands and after a while asks if you can keep one if you catch it.

All I had to do was stand up, raise my glove hand to my right ear (I\u2019m a lefty), and that ball smacked perfectly in the webbing. The crowd cheered. \n\n25 years later, I still have the memory of my daughter\u2019s face as I gave it to her.

            "My granddad died when I was 7, but, per his own words, I was his absolute favorite (partially because I am the splitting image of his mother, even into adulthood).\n\nWhen I was 21, I was set to give birth to my first son. I was about to get into the elevator to L&D when a man came in saying that he a volunteer and he'd help me and my husband find our way. The elevator was slow, but we spent the time talking about what a blessing children are and how they grow up so fast. Here's the thing: he looked and sounded exactly like my grandad - same stature, same blue-grey eyes, same faint Scottish-Canadian accent, same khakis, checked shirt, and sky blue cardigan. Even spookier is that the nurses said they don't have any older male volunteers in that particular building.\n\nI don't really believe in ghosts but I am absolutely certain granddad paid me a visit that night.",
            "The only way I can explain this one is \"wishful thinking.\"\n\nMy mom and dad were co-dependent, and they *liked* it that way.  They didn't want other people (other than the kids).  They were completely happy to be just wrapped up in each other.  My dad died the day before his birthday in a hospice centre.  Afterwards, it was like he was still home.  His touch lamp beside his recliner would go on by itself.  The recliner would rock like someone was getting in it.  And sometimes, my mom or my sister would hear my dad saying, \"Honey, fix me a cold drink?\"  That was exactly how he'd ask my mom to fill up his massive mug with Sprite over ice.\n\nMy mother died less than a year and a half later.  After my mother died, there was never another sign of either of them being there.  They've been gone now for close to 14 years now.",
            "When I was going to my families home I got in a suv going down the road. This was in Bangladesh at the time and after taking the suv the next two hours would be a highway going down a forest. I was sitting shotgun and along the highway their was an old man walking down the highway. He was hitch hiking and the driver decided to pick him up. He insisted on sitting in my seat and obliged as he was an older man.\n\n\nAbout an hour down the drive our car collided with a bus and the shot gun seat was mangled up. We all got out and we looked around but we couldn\u2019t find the old man that insisted on taking my seat anywhere. \n\nStories like these aren\u2019t rare but I didn\u2019t believe them. We all know the man sat in my seat and we all saw him. But he was nowhere to be found.\n\nEdit: he just vanished. No blood. He was wearing ethnic attire which isn\u2019t peculiar around that area. He didn\u2019t speak at all, and we didn\u2019t ask him anything either. He just said to drop him off at the market ahead which would be in the town my house was in.\n\nOne thing that was weird was that he spoke in an oldish Bengali. Like a \u201cold Bengali\u201d that we\u2019d see in poetry from the 1800s. I didn\u2019t see it as peculiar cuz he seemed like an ascetic.\n\nSecond edit: I have pics of the collision if you guys were wondering.\n\nThird edit: when I said he didn\u2019t speak at all I meant during the ride, he didn\u2019t say anything other than where he wanted to go and insisting on my seat.",

            "I was about 15 and trying to sleep but having an asthma attack. Late in the night I started hearing a rhythmic breathing from the floor next to the bed. It wasn't scary, more comforting. And it wasn't me, because my breathing sounded way more fucked up than that. It helped me calm down and get to sleep, even though I was still sick (I was able to get my hands on an inhaler in the morning). At the time I thought it was a friendly ghost. I later rationalized that maybe I was hearing a family member through the heating ducts.\n\nWhat I realized years later, when I had a dog, was that it had sounded exactly like a big dog sleeping next to the bed. So now I'm 50/50 on whether a ghost dog came to visit me, or my own dog time traveled back about ten years before she was born to comfort me.",

My grandma was the director and my grandpa was in charge of technical stuff like lights and sound. Well this particular showing was on Elvis Presley\u2019s birthday and they had a little bit at the end where they sang happy birthday in all their costumes.

This isn\u2019t coming from our music\u201d and my grandma just turns around and leaves. Whole song plays and ends when the curtain closes. No one in the crowd really noticed and it seemed normal but still freaks me out. No clue where the music was coming from and we inspected the CD that all the music for the play was on that was currently in the computer playing music throughout the entire performance and sure enough that song was not on it.

            "Very minor, but I still go \"what the fuck?\" when i remember.\n\nWhen i was a kid (around 6) i lived in a very arid area, and a wide field of red dirt was between my house and my bud's. Every day, walking over there, when I got about halfway across, I'd pick up a dirt clod or a small rock, and toss it behind me over my shoulder. About 10 seconds later, it would come flying back over my head and land in front of me. I'd just grin and keep walking.\n\nI remember this really distinctly, even trying to replicate it later in childhood after I'd moved away, and being sad that it didn't \"work\" any more. Didn't question it as a kid, but looking back, just really weird.\n\n\nAlso my job site is haunted but this seems stranger.",
            "Apparently we lived with a benign spirit(?) In our house for three and a half years. This is my mother's account of what happened because my sister and I didn't see anything at the time. Only my brother, his best friend and my mother saw it.\n\nBack when we were living in South Africa we had moved into an apartment which we had bought. The moving in was actually quite eventful because a mother and her son were renting the place before and although they had been notified they decided to stay passed the date that was given to them. I'm not really sure about the details to that as I was around seven or eight. Long story short we moved in and started settling. \n\nAfter putting us to bed my mother decided to stay up and watch TV. My brother was out with his friends. As she's watching whatever show was on at the time she glances to our only plant in the house, which is about a 1.5m tall and sees a man roughly the same height as the plant standing under one of it's leaves. Noping out of that shit she gets up and flicks the lights on. He's not there. Calling it a night she goes to bed.\n\nThe next day (or maybe two days later, I'm not sure on that detail) at breakfast my brother, who was around 16 at the time, picked up a piece of bread, turned around to the plant and said \"Hey Michael! Want some?\" laughing. My mother asks him who Michael is and he says Michael's \"the guy standing under the plant at night\" Mind you my mother didn't say anything to anyone about 'Michael' to not freak us out. My brother's best friend was also over that morning (we had basically unofficially adopted him) and my mother asks him if he sees Michael too and he says yes. She then asks him to describe Michael and he gives a perfect description down to the whites of his eyes.\n\nMichael apparently was a black young man around 1.40/50m in height wearing plain black trousers, a white button down shirt, and a green vest. His skin tone was quite dark with a faint sheen to it. His eyes were also dark in volor and the whites were tinted a bit yellow. He had a permanent smiling expression on his face that didn't reach is eyes. He stayed put where he was, never moving but following you with his eyes.\n\nOne morning my mom woke up to my dad coming home who had bought this in door circulating water thing (I really don't know what they're called). He moved the plant exactly opposite where it was, next to the couch and put that water thing there instead. My mother didn't say anything and that night Michael also moved with the plant. \n\nOf course after hearing this I asked the next logical question that any sane person would ask. Why the fuck didn't she just throw away the plant? She said it never occurred to her *facepalm*\n\nSo yeah, that is the story of Michael the benign smiling spirit that was apart of our family for some time.\n\nED\u0130T: I had drawn the basic layout of our living room but it looked completely fucked up when posted. So I erased it. Oh well.\n\nED\u0130T 2: Just spoke to my mother, she said Michael's eyes weren't dark but a dark honey color. How I forgot such a creepy detail is beyond me. But there you have it.",

Not sorta topple over, but full on suicide yeet off the table. Personally I have witnessed this occur twice, with one of the times being a slower dinner service with nobody seated at the round; but it happened often enough that every server, and even a few customers came to expect it from time to time.\nIm sure there is a logical explanation for it occuring; maybe a really specific vibration from the subway was my best guess? Except the train doesnt go below the historic district.\n\nWhen opening; The building would sometimes sound like many people were in it; even when we knew it was only a few of us there. (Place is Huge, and lots of stairwells dumbwaiters; so I guess its a trick of accoustics?)\n\nWeird icy drafts outta nowhere, shifting furniture, etc. Every haunted house cliche seems to just naturally *occur* in the place\n\nAsk anyone who ever worked there, the place is straight up spooky at times.\n\nSadly, Chef Walter Staib (the last proprietor) had to close the place due to Covid-19 and will not be reopening.

            "In high school, I was getting peer pressured into doing something I didn't want to do, and would've gotten in a lot of trouble had a teacher come by, but I felt I didn't have a choice. I distinctly remember asking in my head 'if I have a guardian angel right now, please fucking pull the fire alarm or something'\n\n**I kid you not at that exact second**, the fire alarm went off. (This NEVER happened at this school. It was so unlikely, I didn't expect it to actually happen. Nearly shit my pants.)\n\nWe immediately went to the assembly area along with the rest of the school, and I got out of the situation. Turns out at that moment someone in the school had accidentally triggered the fire alarm. I spent the rest of the day in shock honestly. Idk if this counts as supernatural but what even are the chances.\n\nThat day introduced me to the idea of guardian angels and I have had many similar occasions since then where just in the nick of time, I've gotten out of potentially extremely bad situations either due to insane luck, or the nudge of something looking out for me.\n\nEdit: The thing I didn't want to do was that my friends wanted to smoke up. I had strict parents and the school had very strict drug policies, immediate expulsion. Also I had never done a drug before and was scared and very uncomfortable. I wish it was something cooler and less lame.",

A friend and myself were in Moab, UT and found a hostel to sleep in for the night.  I had a dream about Gary.  He looked amazing, completely healthy and back lit and  was wearing a multi-colored sweater.  He looked at me with concern in his eyes, pointed backwards and said, \"I'm not doing too good.\" I woke up a bit shaken because it felt SO REAL.  I told my girlfriend about the dream and she asked if I needed to call my mom to see how he was doing.  I told her that it wasn't necessary because I knew they would call me if Gary passed.  That day we drove from Utah to Colorado and stayed in another hotel.  About 5 AM I woke up and my phone was ringing.  I could see that it was my mom and I already knew what she was going to tell me.  She broke the news that Gary had passed and I basically explained to her that Gary came and told me goodbye.

            "Woke up, needed to pee, went back to my room and there was a thing next to my bed. I remember it was very dark and spindly (shaped almost like gollum) and its legs bent backwards and it seemed to have wisps of shadow coming off of it. I just stared at it for a few seconds before a woman's voice told me, \"this isn't for you to see, you should go get a glass of water.\" So I turned my ass around and went to get a glass of water. I was in the kitchen, now awake enough to think it through, and convinced myself that it was our black fluffy cat. But then when I went back to my room and saw that my parents' door was closed, and remembered that they'd taken that cat in with them. I also remembered that I've seen that cat in the darkness before, and it doesn't look like weird gollum, it looks like a bowling ball with stub feet. So then I assumed I just dreamed it. Well, when I got back to my room, the book that I'd been reading before bed and had left on the pillow next to me was sitting in the middle of my bedroom floor.\n\nI've told this story before on Reddit and someone told me that they've seen the gollum critter too. I believe they said it was under their bed and that it had a lot of teeth.",
            "One night I woke to the sound of the tape deck of my grandfather's old stereo going, this woke me right up as it only does that if the buttons are pressed. In front of the stereo I saw the shape of a petite woman with bright red hair in front of it. She looked like my grandma. An hour later I got a text that my grandma passed at the time I saw her. (My sister but not sister had a similar experience that same night, didn't know about it until 10 years later as we never discussed it with anyone.)",

            "When I was around 5 years old and lived with my Mom, we would walk to the grocery store every week as we didn't have a vehicle. The store was on the same street as our house, but on the opposite side so we had to use a crosswalk with blinking lights to cross 4 lanes of traffic. Well one particular day as we approach the crosswalk, I'm being my happy, fun loving self until suddenly I stopped and looked at my mom and said \n\n\"Be very, very careful okay mom?\"\n\nShe was a little freaked out due to the sudden change in demeanor, but we crossed just fine and I was happy as could be once we reached the other side. The next day a pedestrian was struck and killed by a vehicle in that exact spot.",
            "This is a long story. I got my driver's license at 22 years old and was a nervous driver. One summer in 2014, my parents were going to our family's beach house with my at the time toddler son, and I was going to meet them there the following Saturday morning as I had work. At the time I was driving a beat up 2000 Chevy Cavalier with NO air conditioning, and my cigarette lighter was broken so I could not charge my GPS system in the car. I also didn't have a smartphone at the time, so I figured I would charge my GPS overnight and it would survive the hour and a half drive to my family's beach house. What I didn't take into account, due to being a freshly licensed driver, was that Saturday morning traffic on the NJ Garden State Parkway in the summer is a fucking nightmare. I also have an absolutely awful sense of direction and I can get a bit anxious when I get lost.\n\nI left my house around 8 in the morning and texted my parents that I would be at the beach house around 10:00 latest, and that I would take the baby to the beach when I got there. By 10:45 I was sitting in dead stop of traffic, sweating my butt off as there was no breeze. The GPS suggested I take a different exit than I normally would, and I jumped at the chance to get off the parkway. Whatever exit it wanted me to take also brought me to more dead stop traffic. At this point, my GPS was about to die and I had NO idea where I was going. I didn't even have a bottle of water on me.\n\nAround 12:30, I was driving through random towns with no idea where I was, covered in sweat, my GPS had been dead for hours and I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I called my parents, who had no idea where I was and they suggested I stop somewhere to ask for directions, but when I did find a fire station, no one was inside. I went back to my car utterly defeated and burst into tears. I didn't know what to do, and was half afraid I would never find my way home. I thought of my late uncle, who was a limo driver and the namesake of my son. I was sure he probably knew exactly where I was due to taking teenagers down the shore every year after their proms.  I looked up at the ceiling of my car and cried, \"Hey, Uncle C, I'm lost and afraid and I have to get to the baby. Where the hell am I?\" \n\nAll of a sudden, I heard the mechanical voice of the GPS say \"At the stop sign, make a right.\" I looked down at the GPS and saw that it was no longer dead, but it wasn't fully on either. Instead of it showing a map or the main menu, it was just a blank white screen. It repeated to me, \"At the stop sign, make a right.\" I figured I had maybe a minute or so before it died again, so I went to the stop sign and made the right. The GPS directed me for the next half an hour to the front of my family's beach house. As soon as I parked the car, instead of the typical \"You have reached your destination\" that the GPS usually said, it just went, \"Goodbye\" and then died again. I had NEVER heard it say \"goodbye\" to me before that day, and I never heard it say that again. My family and I are convinced that my uncle helped me find my way home through the GPS. And yes, I got a smartphone that same year for Christmas so I would always have access to a GPS lol.",

            "When my dad passed away, my step mom (she's an amazing human) and I were going through some of his things. We found a closed Ouija board. We both reminisced on how my dad believed that women and children were the best clairvoyants that they usually had the gift so not to play with them without caution. We open the box, my dad was notorious for hiding things, and the \"planchette\" was on \"Goodbye.\" We both laugh cried. \n\nOn a funnier note, we were going through more boxes right after and my stepmom found a box of clothes. Her eyes got really big and she said \"oh no.\" I asked her what else did she find and she said \"I donated the wrong box. I donated the box of your dad's porn.\"",

            "My mom had a bad habit of reading while walking to school. One day she was jerked to a stop by someone (she assumed her brother) pulling her ponytail hard enough to pull her back a couple steps. She turned around to yell at whoever pulled her hair and no one was there (for blocks behind her). She turned back to step across the street and just as she was about to walk a car came out of nowhere. If she hadn\u2019t turned to yell at the nonexistent hair puller, she would have been hit and probably killed.",
            "When I was 16 I was driving to school on a two lane road. There were cars in back of me and in front of me on the other side. It was a drizzly gray morning. A car pulled out to pass the cars on the other side. It was heading right toward me. I knew he was going to hit me. Next thing I knew I was stopped on my side of the road, no cars in front or back of me and the sun was shining. I thought wow what happened? I guess I was lifted out of the situation because it wasn\u2019t my time to go yet. I\u2019m 64 now and is stilled burned into my memory. Strange",
            "This happened years ago when I was a teenager, but I remember wanting to sleep in my guest room really badly for a few nights. I chalked it up to it being a bigger bed and a cooler room, which was nice during the hot summer days. But for three straight nights, I would wake up at 3am to a tap on the window and a super bright light pouring in through the blinds, and each night I said \u201cNo, go away, don\u2019t come inside.\u201d And then roll over to sleep. After the second night, I told myself to get up and investigate to see what the light was. But on the third night, I woke up with a powerfully intense feeling like I absolutely need to stay in bed, and repeat that phrase again; however, instead of rolling over to go back to sleep, I stayed still to see what would happen. I then saw the lights wave, like it understood what I said and was waving goodbye, and then the lights disappeared. Never happened again after that. To this day I hate myself for not getting up and looking out the window to see what sort of alien-thing was tapping at my window.",

            "As background, I was a Duty Officer in the White House Situation Room some years ago. [I did an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/97uww5/iama_former_duty_officer_in_the_white_house/) about it a few years ago if you want to read more.\n\nIt's a pretty well-known fact that the White House is haunted. And I know someone who has seen an actual ghost there. No bamboozle.\n\nThere is a hallway that I informally called the \"Lincoln Hallway.\" I'm not sure what its official name is. But I called it that because it has (had?) lots of Lincoln-related stuff like this painting of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, a bust of Lincoln, and a couple of other things.\n\nSo this one night shift, it's about 3am, and my team chief says he is going to go walk around and stretch his legs.\n\nHe leaves and comes back about 10 minutes later, his face completely drained of all color.\n\nBefore I go on, it is important to establish something: this guy had precisely ZERO sense of humor. None. He had gone to a service academy and was as uptight and by-the-book as they come. (Don't get me wrong, he's a good dude -- but extremely serious.)\n\nWe see him and we're like, \"Hey man, you OK? What happened?\" And he just keeps saying, \"I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\nAt this point we're concerned. Like, was he sexually harassed by a Secret Service agent or something? None of this is making any sense. None at all.\n\nAbout an hour goes by and he finally says, \"I saw something.\" We waited and he said, \"I was walking in the hallway, you know, where all the stuff of Lincoln is. And I saw someone.\"\n\nOK...\n\n\"I think it was a kid. He was only probably about 4 feet tall, and he was just there in the hallway, looking at that bust of Lincoln.\"\n\nWe asked what happened then, and he said he kind of looked around to make sure he wasn't crazy, and when he looked back, the boy was gone.\n\n[Willie Lincoln](https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/09/19/Style/Images/Willie%20Lincoln.jpg?uuid=6EXrjOLzEeCKBcEOwQfcZg) was the third son of Abraham Lincoln. He died in the White House in 1862.",
            "So this happened to a friend of mine 11 years ago. Perhaps it was just a coincidence but I think it was more than that. \n\nMy friend was driving to another friends house one night around 2 am. About a mile before his destination he lost control of his car and hit a telephone pole. He staggered out of the vehicle and ended up passing out in somebodies long driveway. \n\nHe had a lacerated aorta and was laying there internally bleeding to death. An ambulance shows up to this house responding to a call. \n\nThe call they were responding to was because a man inside this house was having a heart attack. The ambulance gets there and sees my friend laying in the driveway. Not sure if they assume this was their patient or not but they end up saving his life by taking him to the hospital. They sent another ambulance to get the guy inside who was having a heart attack.",

            "My great-grandmother died when I was 5. About 12 years later, I was visiting her house, where my great-aunt still lived. I went to fetch a jersey from a wardrobe in one of the bedrooms. The wardrobe had a mirror on the door. Opened the door, took the jersey out and closed the door. I saw my great-grandmother's reflection standing next to mine in the mirror. I turned to check if she was really there, and she was. My great-aunt wasn't surprised; apparently she had seen her mother's spirit too.",

            "When I was around 5 years old. I woke up in the middle of the night to what sounded like a coin hitting the vinyl tile floor in our basement. My bedroom was upstairs, on the opposite side of the house. \n&nbsp;\n\nI have always been a heavy sleeper. Around that same time in my life the family cat, Claudia, had a litter of kittens in my bed while I slept. That was a wonderful morning, waking up to a litter of kittens, I think I got to skip school that day. The point being: I slept through just about anything, and yet, at least as I remember it, I was woken up by the sound of metal - a faint *ting* in the middle of the night.\n&nbsp;\n\nI got out of bed and walked through the house, down to the basement, directly to where I thought the sound came from. On the floor, right at the bottom of the stairs at the center of the landing, there was a tiny metal hand, a little smaller than the size of a pea. The thumb stuck out and all the fingers were pressed together as if it was about to shake another\u2019s hand. After I picked it up and inspected it, I felt compelled to show it to my mom right away. I went into my parents\u2019 room at 3:00am or so in the morning and woke her up. She sat up in her waterbed, turned on the bedside lamp, put her glasses on and got a good look at what I had handed to her. \n&nbsp;\n\nShe was gobsmacked.\n\u201cOh.. my god\u2026 Where did you get this??\u201d \n&nbsp;\n\nI told her what happened. She was thrilled, yet bewildered. She explained to me that, years ago, she had lost this tiny little sterling silver hand. It had broken off of 1 of 2 rings that her grandmother had given to her before she passed away and had been missing ever since. Each ring had a hand on it that faced the other. When you wore them together the hands held each other. \n&nbsp;\n\nMy mom still had both rings in her jewelry box, just one without a hand for so many years. She got the ring repaired and has worn it ever since. \n&nbsp;\n\nIf it were only my story, I might question the validity of a memory being recalled from such a young age. However, my mom still remembers this just as vividly as I do and we talk about it every so often. The hand was also found right at the bottom of the stairs. It was a tiny thing, but was in plain sight, impossible to walk by for so long. My mom and I are both convinced that my great grandmother woke me up and lead me right to it. She probably held my hand as she did. \n&nbsp;\n\n\u270b\ud83c\udffb \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTLDR: My deceased grandmother woke me up in the middle of the night and gave me a piece of jewelry that had been missing for years.\n\n&nbsp;\nEdit: grammar",
            "NOT SCARY SUPERNATURAL STORY FOLLOWS: I got a funny one and definitely cannot explain this to this day. I was on vacation in Korea with my then girlfriend (now my wife) and my parents in 2016. We were somewhere in the northeastern part of the country in Seoraksan National Park. Where we stopped at a crowded set of restrooms. I had to do a normal number 2, nothing special, just a little urgent but not too bad. I was the only one that needed to go so both my parents and my girlfriend just waited outside in the crowded area. I waited for an empty stall and got one after maybe a minute of waiting. Sat down and did my business. When it came time to wipe, I look up, and bam, no TP. I sit there for a few extra seconds, maybe a minute or two contemplating when I can try to do the shuffle of shame to the next stall. As I\u2019m waiting I hear my dad unexpectedly call out for me and I answer back. He says something along the lines of \u201cWendy (my gf) heard you yell you were out of TP\u201d then he hands the TP to me over the door of the stall\u2026 I\u2019m blown away. I exit and find everyone and I immediately tell them that I didn\u2019t say a thing and my GF is tripping. She swears she somehow heard me calling through the crowded area/restroom, to them that I needed TP lol. I never said a word. Either this is just extremely coincidental and happened by accident, like what are the odds this would happen by accident. Or it was supernatural BF-GF TP telepathy. lol I\u2019ll choose the latter. I\u2019m now married to GF lol and still can\u2019t explain this.",
            "My life flashed before my eyes as I was contemplating suicide one evening. It started from the present moving backwards in flashes of increasing speed. This induced a panic attack and I started laughing and crying at the same time. Every person id ever cared about had a flash. At the end I realised I've had a good life and I didn't want to kill myself.\n\nThat night I had a dream that my mother was holding my head against my childhood bedroom window and over a dozen dragon flies came out of the darkness and spread their wings against the glass, upside down. \n\nThe following day I went rowing with my girlfriend (we were on a family holiday in the lake District, UK) and while we in the middle of Keswick Lake just admiring the view a dragon fly came and landed on my hand. That's never happened to me before. \n\nLater at dinner I asked my parents, who are both religious and work for the church, what the symbol of the dragonfly meant (they had worn dragonfly pins to work throughout my childhood), and they told me it was a symbol of death and rebirth. \n\nI'm not religious at all and I still struggle to reconcile this experience. My dad told me not to over think about it and just take it as synchronicity, a meaningful coincidence.",

            "As a kid, I used to spend the night at a friend's house (around 12-13). We decided to go out, do some ding dong ditching, and engage in some adolescent angsty debauchery because our parents were not at home. It's around 1 or 2 a.m. when we arrive home. The doorbell rings, and we immediately assume it's the authorities or an enraged neighbor.My friend had a small window on the front porch that you couldn't see into from the street, so we peeked in to see who was calling at such a late hour. An elderly woman dressed in a gown and a small child dressed in a strange newsie attire stood at the door. Because it was the 1990s, they were both dressed EXTREMELY out of period.My acquaintance had never seen any of them before in the neighborhood. We duck because we're a little startled, then look again in less than 10 seconds and they've both vanished. They vanished without a trace, with no one on the street walking away or automobiles driving away. We didn't get much sleep.",

He laughed his ass off said yeah whatever but I was being crazy. \n\n\nLater that night he calls me frantic sounding like he's in tears. Apparently him and some of his friends were going to hit up a local club. Dude pulls up in a little blue Honda. My friend was doing to get in but thought about my call and got an awful feeling. He told them he'd ride with someone else. On the way to the club he watched the Honda get T-boned crossing an intersection, on the back passenger side. Thing was obliterated. Thankfully no one died but they were seriously fucked up. He said he was absolutely sure he'd have fucking died because that's where he would have been sitting. His friend and girlfriend had taken the seats up front and since he was so tall he'd have sat behind the passenger for more leg room.",

            "When I was around 23 I had the urgent feeling to call my ex boyfriend. Yea he was my ex but something kept pulling me to do so. We were together for almost 5 years so there was a bond. I called him and he didn\u2019t answer. I tried to brush it off but my gut feeling kept telling me to keep calling because something was wrong. I called 2 more times and by the 3rd he finally picked up in a panic. I told him I just had this urgency to call him and he told me that his youngest sister got into a really bad car accident and is now brain dead because of the lack of oxygen getting to her brain in the time they we\u2019re waiting for the ambulance. I talked to him to calm him down and cried for him after our conversation. We may not be together but there was something there that told me to just call which I couldn\u2019t ignore. It was definitely strange.\n\nAnother one, when I was around 16 waiting for my trial date to put my sexually abusive step grandpa in jail, I got a phone call from my dad saying that the abuser killed himself.

            "It was a bright afternoon and I was home alone, getting ready for my brother's hockey game. As I was finishing up in the bathroom mirror, I saw something inexplicable to my left in my brother's room. \n\nThe figure of a tall, lanky man- easily 7 ft- appeared at the side of my brother's bed and swiftly walked to the other side of the room, out of my line of sight. I could only perceive the figure's silhouette and identified a wide-brimmed fedora and a long nose. Otherwise, he was completely pitch black. Void of light, the blackest black I have ever perceived.\n\nConfused, I walked into my brother's room, questioning whether I was really home alone. Of course, no one was there. \n\nI felt that sinking feeling in my stomach and asked my brother later that night if he ever saw someone in his room. He said no, but he's not the kind of person to admit to seeing a ghost, to be honest.\n\nMonths later I told a friend about what I saw and she said \"Oh, that's the Hat Man. People all over the world have seen him.\" I looked it up on Google images and yes, it was the Hat Man.\n\nEdit: Bonus story-\n\nI was probably 12-13 and woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. There was snow on the ground and a little bit of moonlight, so I didn't need to turn on the lights to see where I was going. \n\nAs I came back to the door of my room, I froze. I can't quite explain it, but it's like some deep part of my brain was screaming and refused to send the signals to my body to move. I couldn't logic my way out of it, I was just stuck at my doorframe, looking into my room.\n\nOn the other side of the room sitting on my window sill were the two Amish dolls my grandma had given me a few years before. Amish dolls are stuffed soft-cloth dolls in Amish clothing and no faces. My eyes snapped to the female doll and I couldn't look away from her. She was bathed in moonglow and clearly visible, even with the lights off. I have no idea how long I looked at her, frozen- maybe 2 minutes, maybe 45 minutes. Time stopped.\n\nThen, she slowly raised her right arm up above her head... then slowly down, back into its resting position. \n\nWhen I could finally move again, I don't remember if I worked up the courage to go back to my bed or if I slept on the couch- but I did ask my dad to take the dolls away the next day.",
            "I've told these stories on an account I used to have that I can't for the life of me remember how to log into. When I was an older teenager everyone in the house had just gone to sleep. It was around midnight, and me and my sister always slept with our bedroom door open. I had a clear view of the kitchen table from my bedroom since it was the first bedroom leading away from the living room, but all the lights were off and it was pitch black so I couldn't see anything. As I drifted off to sleep, the clear, unmistakable sound of a kitchen chair sliding loudly across the kitchen floor jolted me awake. I was terrified to look into the kitchen from my bed. My dad got up right away and came down the hall in his tighty-whities and turned the lights on to investigate (think hairy, beer belly blue collar redneck), and there was no one in the kitchen. We were all in bed, including the dogs. The sound woke everyone up. All we could really do was go back to sleep and hope the rest of the night was quiet.\n\nAnother time in the same house, I was going into the kitchen (again close to midnight) to put a glass in the sink. There was a window above the sink that had one of those solid, pull-down blind shades. As I got to the sink, the blind suddenly went flying up and rolled up into itself. I flew out of the kitchen at lightning speed. \n\nOnce when my boyfriend was leaving to go home when I was around 20 or 21 (AGAIN, around midnight) we tiptoed to the front door in the darkness and I was telling him bye, and the disk tray in the DVD player in the living room opened and closed a few times by itself while we both stood there wide-eyed and staring at it. He was like \"Welp, gotta go!\" and left, and I sprinted back to my room.\n\nI'm fully convinced the house has something bad in it, and it always felt very evil. I lived there from the time I was 10 until I was 23. I used to have horrific nightmares about something evil being in the walk-in closet of the master bedroom. In my dreams it was always a big black shadow/mass that was trying to drag me into the closet, and I would be frantically trying to escape it in slow motion. Or it would be hovering near the foot of my bed slowly inching towards me. The terror I felt in those dreams was always so real. And I couldn't stand to be in or near that closet for more than a few minutes at a time. I always had the overwhelming feeling to run if I was around it for too long. I had to start sleeping with a lamp on when I got to be around 19 because I was always sleeping in a state of fright, and to this day at 31 I'm scared to sleep alone in complete darkness. But the dreams basically stopped when I moved out.\n\nNeither of my parents could stand to sleep in the master bedroom for longer than a few months at a time. My dad swears that one night while he was sleeping in there alone (my mom had started sleeping in the living room at that point) that he felt the blankets tug on one side of him, so when he rolled over to see what it was he heard a voice in his ear on the other side whisper \"Liar! Liar! Liar!\" He did not spend the rest of the night in there. Years later my parents gave sleeping in there another try for a few months, and my baby niece was living with us. There was a crib for her at the foot of my parents bed, and my dad said he woke up and saw the shape of my niece sitting up in her crib in the darkness, and he went to nudge my mom awake to tell her to get the baby, but my mom had already taken my niece into the living room and neither of them were in the room. My dad basically high-tailed it out of there and the baby-shaped shadow was gone.\n\nMy brother claims that he had a sleep paralysis episode of something sitting on his chest and strangling him. Which was odd to me, because I remember when we first moved into the house I briefly slept in my brother's room, and I had the most peaceful dream at 10 years old that I was in a beautiful, sunny and very green forest, and there was an intense feeling of peace washing over me. And in my dream I had the understanding that God was with me and that everything was ok. I used to hang out in my brother's room and play video games with him, and not once was I ever spooked or afraid in there.\n\nNow only my dad lives in the house (my parents are separated), and he sleeps in the literal diagonal opposite end of the house from the master bedroom closet. He turned the den right by the front door into his bedroom, and his bed is in the farthest corner of the room. He spends all his time at home reading the Bible and making his own ammo. My boyfriend (same one) jokes around every now and then that maybe my dad will give us the house one day, and my response is always \"Heck no! I don't want to live there. It's haunted!\"",
            "I've told this story on here before, but it is still a weird one... Albeit rather minor.\n\nOne time I saw what I thought was a shadow figure dart across the upstairs hallway in my house late one night, and I thought it may be a person, so I jumped up to the landing and went \"gotcha!\" and flipped on the light.\n\nAnd in that moment, the light glowed bright blue and burnt out with a pop. That is probably the most scared I have ever been in my life right there, and I can't really put my finger on why.",
            "I worked third shift in the emergency room. When a baby was born, a little chime would play over the hospital speakers. I think it was rock a bye baby. \n\nOne night a man was driven in by car. It was an OD and he was unconscious. The nurses and docs were doing cpr on the stretcher on the way to the trauma room. Sadly he passed away. \n\nThe second that the doc called time of death all the lights in the emergency room went out, the back up generator came on and rock a bye baby played immediately after the generator kicked in. This all took less than a minute. To this day I still remember the chills I got that night. Whatever it was, it was so freaky!\n\nThe second was when my spouse and I were looking to buy a house. We pulled up with the Realtor and I immediately did not want to go in that house. It felt wrong. Well we went in anyway. The second we got in, I felt like I was trespassing and wanted to leave. \n\nWe walk through the house and the Realtor opens the door to the basement and turned on the light. As soon as the light came on, I saw a black shadow run. We both saw it and thought it was my spouse, so we went down. All the strings that you pull to turn the lights on and off were tied like nooses. It was creepy as all get out. My spouse came down the stairs and I asked them what they were doing upstairs since we both thought they were down in the basement. Spouse said they were in the garage and was not in the basement. \n\nRight as we were leaving the basement, something pushed me. I felt the hand on my back and everything. As soon as we left we both said that house was haunted. \n\nThat night spouse and I both had the same nightmare about an old lady in black and with frizzy hair. The nightmares lasted about a week for both of us. I am not religious, but the only thing that got rid of this old lady was saying the Our Father prayer over and over again. It still scares the crap out of me to this day. I don\u2019t even drive on that street, that is how scared I am of that house.",
            "Yeah, I've got one of these back from when I went on holiday with my (then) wife and young son. We went to this place in Sicily - a small Island just off of Italy. Sicily has got quite a rich history and we stayed in some modernised accommodation around there, but we were told the building was once an older building circa the Muslim years (800/900Ad-ish).\n\nSo my wife wanted to get away a bit because she had been dealing with a very difficult two year old for the past four months and this was her chance to relax. She went off to see the sites, went to some bars etc. My son was fussy so I stayed with him. The hotel we stayed in was eerie and my son could not settle, so we went out for a while. When I got back, my wife was on the bed already changed. I settled my boy and lay down while my wife still sat there. She had drunk quite a bit during the day and I could tell as she swayed. She looked like she had seen a ghost. When I asked her if she was okay, she swears she could hear a faint shuffling and groaning in the hotel. I joked about whether it was a zombie. Then I heard it. Almost like a gasp and faint murmur. It wasn't my son as he was now resting - besides, it was too deep for a toddler to make. My wife was terrified so I went to investigate and the hotel staff told me about the history of war in the area and that sometimes people do hear things in the walls and around the rooms. For the rest of the week, we never heard anything again, but I will always remember that murmur which felt like it was in the room with us. Pretty sure we had an otherworldly experience that day.",
            "My ex gf had a dream about my family members who had all passed on. She never met them and I only mentioned a few things about some of them. She was describing them with some detail and I knew which family member she was talking about. I wanted to believe but she said my dad was there but I told her he was still alive. She was adamant about my dad being there with my other passed on family. I struggled because everything was 100% spot on but my dad wasn't dead. A month later a cousin told me my dad had passed away two months earlier which was a month before my gf's dream.",
            "Till this day I have no idea what happened. \nWhen my son was 2.5 years old, there was a period of time that for like a week he would wake up every single nigh ,excalty at 1:55 am ,screaming, crying and yelling for about a minute before going back to sleep again.\nMe and my wife brushed it off at the beginning, that's  Until we noticed that every single time it happened - it was at the same hour - 1:55. \nSo, naturally, We started to check up on him everytime, but nothing. He was just sleeping pretty peacefuly.\n\n One morning I finally asked him if he remembered waking up screaming and yelling that night. He told me that he, in fact, did remember. \nSo I asked him what's up, and for a moment a glaze of terror flashed his face.\n\"Its because the old, scary gray man, daddy. He has glowing red eyes and he is  trying to grab me while screaming.\" \nHe then processed to eat his banana as if we had a small talk about the weather.\n\nWell, that night, he slept with us. \n\nAnd While my wife and son were sleeping peacefully - I was wide awake, Only to hear, at excalty 1:55 am, what sounded like a loud shouts of an old man. A shout that lasted for about 3 seconds.\nI got up and ran to my son room and found nothing. \nAbout two days later everything got back to normal. \nWas it just nightmares my son had? Maybe. I have no reasonable explanation.\n\n Edit: spelling",

            "My house growing up had a set of stairs. You walked up then they made a 90 degree turn to the left. That lead to our game room. Across the room was the door to my bedroom. \n\nMy bed was positioned right across from my door. So when I was laying in bed at night my doorway looked like a black hole if I had my door open. We also had a baby gate at the bottom of the stairs so my little brother couldn\u2019t climb up. Whenever you tried to step over the gate your foot would tap it because it was pretty tall. \n\nI was laying in bed one night playing on my GBA around 3am. I heard the tap of the baby gate then someone walking up the stairs. I was expecting my mom to come fuss at me for being awake so late, but nothing. I heard the steps coming up the stairs and then they stopped.\n\nI said \u201cmom? Dad?\u201d no response. I then tried my other brothers name (not the toddler obviously) but nothing. \n\nI just kinda sat there sweating, I then jumped up and turned on my lamp. There was no one in the game room. I had no interest in going downstairs to investigate so I shut my door and went to sleep. \n\nI asked my mom the next morning and she said it wasn\u2019t her or my dad. So I went to ask my brother and that\u2019s when I found out he was at a friends house that night. \n\nNever knew what it was and still creeps me out.",

            "My boyfriend and I went to my city\u2019s newest library. It was absolutely massive. So many books they had to build it specifically to hold all their weight. 6 floors and filled with shelves. We were walking around exploring. I remembered that my grandmother who had been dead for a few years has self published a book. She only published a few hundred, mostly for family. I mentioned to my boyfriend and he suggested I look for it. As soon as he mentioned it I turned to my side and it was right there. 1 in a million chance with all the books. I opened it and it was a signed copy. Which she only gave to family. Shivers down my spine. It was definitely her saying hello.",
            "My girlfriends mother has an uncanny knack for predicting births and deaths of family members.  \n  \nWhen someone in the family dies (Parents, aunts, cousins, children etc- not terribly extended) her father shows up in his car in the GF's mom's dream- Her prediction accuracy is uncanny, the dream comes prior to anyone's notification of death, and in some cases before the person actually dies (within 48h). She has no false positives that I'm aware of, and all deaths are in her immediate/extended family. So this isn't a case of \"I had the dream and my neighbor's sister died\", this is \"I had the dream and auntie M died\".  \n  \nBirths aren't quite the same, but they're close. Last year she sent a group text message to the family asking who was pregnant- nobody fessed up immediately. 8 1/2 months later or so there's a new baby in the family. She's done this for 5/5 grandchildren, 2/3 nieces/nephews.",
            "My dog got hit by a car one day. He managed to survive and walked by to our front yard and he laid down and passed away. We buried him some hours later. Later that night, I woke up from my sleep and noticed that I was cold so I reached around for my blanket but could not find it. So then I opened my eyes and looked around for it but could not see it on the bed. I scanned my room and noticed my blanket on the ground in the corner of the room. Above the blanket were a pair of yellow glowing orbs. I (7 years old me) immediately ran out of my room thinking it was a ghost or something. After what seemed like 5 minutes, I decided to poke my head back in and then the orbs turned towards me. I freaked out and just ran outside my house and waited for my parents to come back (they have morning jogs at 4 am). \n\nI followed my parents back into my room and turned on the lights but the orbs were gone. I told them that it was a ghost but they didn't believe me. What still freaks me out today is that the blanket was still in the corner of the room. I have never in my adult life ever kicked my blanket enough in my sleep that it was completely off the bed (let alone to a corner in the room). Till today, I'd like to think that it was my dog that died earlier in the day.",
            "Dont know if this belongs here. But long time ago when I was in 7th grade during class when the teacher was talking I for some reason started to think about what happens when we die, like where do our memories go, is there life after death and if so what is it like. Then all of a sudden after alot of thinking everything got completely black but after what felt like just one second I \"woke up\". But in reality I was \"gone\" for the last 10 minutes of class and I did not pass out, apparently I was sitting up with my eyes still open and sitting normally just listening to the teacher.\n\nIt makes me wonder what the fuck happened and a bit uncomfortable at the same time everytime I remember it.",
            "A friend of mine died when we were in the Navy. The night it happened but before I knew, I had a dream where he walked up to me and said I am not really dead and walked away. I woke up thinking weird. A couple hours later found out he was dead. Or not really dead I guess.",

            "My uncle and closest person I\u2019ve had to a father figure tragically took his own life. The evening of his funeral I understandably cried myself to sleep. I dreamt that he visited me (kneeling next to the couch I was sleeping on), put his hand over mine and told me that he loves me, he\u2019s always loved me and how special I am to him. I was sobbing and begging him not to go. As he left I saw him embracing my grandfather surrounded by a bright warm light. It looked like a bright doorway just for them. Years later my mom and I were up late talking and the topic of my uncles passing came up. I told her about my dream and as I\u2019m talking she starts shaking and her eyes well with tears. That same evening she also cried herself to sleep and my uncle (her little brother) came to her. He told her how much he loves and misses her and that he visited her kids.

It was me, him and his sister. We would take turns holding the camera and asking questions to the potential \"spirits\" in the room.  As we rewatched the footage we noticed at one point none of us were holding the camera, we were all in the shot together and the camera wasnt placed or mounted but was capturing us as if someone else was holding it.",
            "I was housesitting for my parents. In the middle of the night, I wake up with an asthma attack. For some reason, my whole room smelled like cigarette smoke. Like when you visit an old person who has smoked indoors their whole life and didn't want to stop. It was so bad that I thought there was a fire going on somewhere. When I went out to the kitchen everything went back to normal. It was here I noted a man hiding in the bushes looking at the neighbor's house. I know the teen daughter was home alone. Had a bad feeling about it so I called the police. When they court him it turned out he had done some burglaries in another town. One where he assaulted an old man that caught him. Who knows what he would have done to the girl. After all that my room was back to normal.\n\nThe next day the parents came to thank me. They told me that the grandmother had just died and they were packing down her house. I then asked if she was a heavy smoker. They looked at me wired and said yes that is what killed her she died of lung cancer.",

As soon as I entered I heard a noise that sounded as if someone hit the lowest key on a piano. I turned and ran as fast as I could. Caught the whole thing on video. The video is at my moms house but she doesn't have a VCR. My plan is to buy her a VCR converter for Christmas so she can save a digital copy of all our home movies. Hopefully I can watch it again and figure out what it was.",
            "Late to the party but about 12 years ago my step-dad (who I didn't think of as a dad but was fond of since he made my Mom so happy) was really bad off. Mom didn't want to think of him as on his death bed but she was a nurse and couldn't hide the truth over the phone. I was moving from one side of the country to the other with a plan to stop where Mom and my step-dad lived for a week.  I had a bad feeling so I left a day earlier than planned.\n\nI arrived to mu Mom's house and she is a mess. She takes me to the hospital to see my step-dad. He is worse than I thought. The cancer has left him emaciated and struggling just to breathe, though his eyes light up seeing my mother. He struggles and says just one word a few times. \"Home.\"  My mother consoles and comforts him as much as she can but we are made to leave.\n\nMy mom explains she set up home hospice for him, and that they are bringing him tomorrow. No one got much sleep that night. The ambulance arrives the next day, and despite looking a bit worse for the trip the light still comes back into my step-dad's eyes when he sees my mom. There are no words this time, just a small measure of relief. Mom lovingly tucks him into his own blankets and told him she was happy he was home. \n\nA knock on the door was the home hospice coordinating RN there to do intake. After a short greeting he went to take my step-dad's vitals. But there was nothing. My step-dad had passed on.  \n\nMaybe not as paranormal as some other stories, but definitely supernatural to me the way he held on long past when he should have just so he could go home. Mom passed about 4 years later. Hopefully they are happily back together.",

As usual i like to leave the lights off and do readings with my phone light. Suddenly i heard someone walking around frantically at the back of the class and were like hitting the tables as it was walking. It sounded chaotic so i turned around to look who it was and i was shocked cause the sound stopped and there was no one at the back of the class. So i just continued doing my readings as i thought i was hearing things. Then the sounds started again and this time i heard a loud knock on the door and it creaked open and shut loudly at the back of the class. When i heard that, i quickly grab my things and ran out of the class and sat in the students lounge. Its disturbing because the class has only one entrance and i was sitting infront of it.

            "When I was around 9 years old I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of my toilet flushing, because my mom was sleeping on the couch to the right of me and since my sister was asleep next to me. I just naturally assumed it must be my dad. A couple seconds after this realization a bright white light begins emitting from out of the bathroom, which cool because as I said it was the middle of the night and really dark, so it wouldn't surprise me if he had to use his phone flashlight to get around. That was until I saw... It walk out of the bathroom.\n\n I say it because I really do not know how to describe what I saw. It was literally a humanoid being made out of light, it's head was weirdly shaped as well. About the shape of a cylinder and was very big as if it was fat, but yet had no features because it was made out of light. It made loud footsteps as it walked out of my bathroom and walked down the stairs out of my line of sight. At this point all I could see was the glowing light emitting off of it until that faded as well and being 8/9 years old. Of course I fell back asleep. A lot of other freaky shit happened in that house and I truly believe it was haunted.",
            "The thing that happened to me has stuck with me every single night for the past 28 years and happened when I was 5. There has not been *one night* in that amount of time that I haven't thought about it.\n\nMy younger brother and I shared a bunk bed, I was on the top bunk. I woke up one night having to pee, I sit up and throw off my covers (so this wasn't sleep paralysis, I was actively awake and moving). \n\nAt the end of the bed I noticed something standing there. All I see is this \"thing\" staring at me. It's head was very large and spanned the width of the bunk bed, oval in shape with 2 little yellow glowing eyes. I'm guessing it was around 6 feet tall, had dark skin and a thin neck. It was standing there just staring at me. I stared back at it for a few seconds before I did what any little kid would do, hide under the covers. I laid there for I don't know how long, panicking. I could still feel it staring at me and eventually fell back asleep sometime later. In the morning it's the first thing I told my mom and she still remembers me doing that to this day. I had a lot of nightmares about it for a while afterwards. [Here is a drawing I made a few years ago](https://imgur.com/gallery/YfqBEyo)\n\nWhat's funny is that I might have seen another one of these things PRIOR to that when I was 3 or 4. I remember running upstairs to get my \"star shoes\" (Converse) and the hallway light was on, barely illuminating my parents bedroom. As soon as I reach the top of the steps I look over and see half a figure in motion walking into my parents closet. It was tall, lanky and thin, with yellowish skin. Didn't see the head so I couldn't say whether or not it was the same thing.   I ran back downstairs after that.",

I can only imagine she could see his spirit or something and was licking his spirit goodbye. I\u2019ve never seen a dog do that before let alone the coincidental timing of it all. That\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever believed there was something supernatural on this earth.",
            "Dimes were always my mom's thing. She saved them specifically in a jar for years and years. Then she died without being able to spend the hundreds of dollars in dimes she had saved.\n\nDimes make up 19% of the coinage of the United States minted in 2019. And I've seen some math and done some calculations myself that put the odds of a random coin being a dime at slightly less than that, around 17-19%. So basically, if I find a random coin sitting around somewhere or on the ground or in a couch cushion, it should be a dime 20% of the time at most.\n\nAnd yet... When I find a coin, 90+% of the time, sure enough, it is a dime.\n\nIt's kind of mundane and dumb, but to this day, despite being completely non-superstitious, I can't quite explain how many dimes I randomly find.",

Before agreeing to do an endoscopy, the gastro accused me of exaggerating because I was a teen girl and that\u2019s just apparently what young women do, he suggested I was just making up these symptoms for attention, and then asked me point blank if I was lying about my pain level to skip school and suggested I had a mental health issue I was trying to cover for.  I had fucking GERD and severe acid reflux, as confirmed by the endoscopy he reluctantly agreed to perform on me.  Instead of letting it go, the gastro made a point of angrily telling me that I had \u201cthe stomach of a 80 year old man\u201d and must have been intentionally eating in a way to fuck up my stomach.  \n\nI have a family history of stomach problems and GERD.  I don\u2019t understand why it was so implausible that my brother could have acid reflux at a young age, but I must be a hysterical liar when I claim to have the same symptoms in my teens. ",

We had a forty-three year old woman who had a very rare form of cancer that spread incredibly fast to just about everywhere in her body. From diagnosis to death was about twelve weeks. The medications and therapies and the general lack of mobility caused her to become swollen and obese. She was a terribly sweet lady. They took her down to Radiology for a scan and the technician made a bunch of really mean comments about her weight because she was too large for our machines so they had to arrange for a transfer to another hospital for her scans and then have her transferred back. The technician thought that because Miss Jeannie was dying and sick that she was deaf or didn't understand English any longer, and so while they were alone she made so many mean comments. Miss Jeannie waited until she was back in her room waiting for her transfer before she started crying.

Turns out I had bowel obstruction caused by a surgery that took place 37 years earlier.\n\n **Edit:** A few quick things. I wanted to say thanks for the silver; I wasn't expecting anyone to even see this little story of mine.\n\nI made a few responses in the comments but I did want to add a little to the story. My original appendectomy in 1980 became infected which led to a second surgery to remove the infection. This was an 8 hour surgery that left me with a 9 inch scar on my abdomen. The eventual bowel obstruction wasn't always an obstruction -- it was just adhesions on my intestines that were restricting my natural muscular movements and leading to occasional intense pain and constipation. I'm pretty certain the only way this could have been found was with an exploratory laparoscopy, which is exactly what happened once it turned into an obstruction and an emergency room visit. The good news is that I got fixed, I'm a much happier person, and I can poop better than ever before!",

            "Honestly jaded. I was one of those kids who always did well in school so I was always typecast as the \"smart kid.\" This came with the unfortunate side effect that every time we had to do those activities where everyone went around the class and wrote what they liked about people, every time my page would be filled with virtually that and just that. It's not bad as a compliment but when like 95% of the compliments you've ever gotten is that, it puts a lot of pressure on you cause you feel like if you're ever not smart there goes most of the nice shit anyone's said about you.\n\nIt also comes with other expectations as well. Once you're typecast as the \"smart guy\" everyone expects you to go on and have a \"smart guy\" career. Like just being adequate won't do you feel pressured to have to be successful.\n\nBut overall by itself it's still a nice compliment it's just once you've heard it so often while not getting a lot of other compliments it wears on you",
            "The intentions are always good, but it makes me feel a bit...frustrated. the context people usually use when telling me I'm smart is along the lines of \"of course you got into grad school you're so smart\"...\"of  course you did well in your exam, you're so smart\". What people fail to compliment is my *hard work*. I spent months writing letters of intent, gathering references, and spent years working tirelessly to keep my GPA up and make relationships with people who would be my references. I spent hours every single night working for my success but people only were the result, and attribute it to me being \"smart\". Truthfully, there are way smarter people, I just have extremely high/efficient work ethic.

But, for a long time it was pretty much the only compliment I got, and with the message that's sent to young women that you can be pretty or smart, hearing \"you're smart\" at times made me think \"I'm not pretty\". It was just a weird mental thing. That said, now when people say that, I either don't care or am flattered. I enjoy it the most when it's in regards to a subject I'm not as good at (ex. Getting that compliment in regards to something I wrote instead of in regards to a STEM subject).",

There's also so many different topics to be smart about; you can't cover them all, opportunity costs and all. \n\nIf you are in awe of someone's ability to do a specific cognitive task, be specific in your praise. If you find someone's knowledge on a subject impressive say something like, \"Wow! You sure know a lot on interesting facts about the x.\" You can also praise their diversity of knowledge\n\nSmart is a blanket term.

            "Lonely. Hearing it from parents, friends, teachers, etc, used to feel good, something to be prideful of, but growing up I lacked a lot of social skills and always wondered why, if I'm so smart, can I not get other people. People would often tell I'm so smart, but lately it's come to feel like something that sets us apart and it feels lonely, as if I don't fit in with the people giving me these compliments. \n\nLately, I've found myself in a role where I need to learn vast amounts of new things very quickly and I've started feeling a sense of imposter syndrome. It's felt humbling sure, but I can feel the neuroticism creeping in when I can't quite understand or figure something out, so I have to remind myself that no one can know everything. \n\nI look at other, less intelligent yet more successful people and wonder what the point in being smart is if it comes with this feeling. I get called smart and I look at myself and wonder what I have to show for it.\n\nIt's not a compliment I like to receive, but I'll always smile thank the person. I'd prefer to receive compliments for achievements and things that make me feel I earned the praise. And one lesson I'll take away from all of this is, when I have kids of my own, I'll be sure to praise them for their effort and hard work, rather than something they can't control.",

            "Worked in a Chinese restaurant for 3 years, they had Hainanese Chicken Rice (poached chicken) on the menu. We'd prep the chicken in the morning and fridge it. When the orders came in, we would pour chicken stock from a perpetual stock vat into the dish and let it soak then drain, repeat a few more times until the chicken was piping hot. The draining was done by hand so you had to press your palm against the chicken and flip it almost vertically so the stock drains back into the vat.  First round draining was ok because the chicken was cold so the stock came out slightly above warm, second round and third round was just fire. Reason we did it by hand was because the chicken was already cut into presentable form and using a sieve or spider would result in breaking/imprinting the skin or disturbing the presentation. I never managed to desensitize my hands in those 3 years so it was just painful throughout.",

            "Fried dough fritters.\n\nThe twin sticks of fried dough you pull apart before eating, usually with porridge. Mostly an East Asian Cuisine.\n\nThey were first created to send a tyrant and his concubine to hell.\n\nBackstory: \n\nThere was this tyrant, and his concubine (rumored to be a 9-tailed vixen) who were completely mad and cruel. They invented new torture techniques to try on opposing court members and have been known to brutalize civilians for fun. No one could retaliate, so they defaulted to an old superstition.\n\nThat was, apparently by using magic and all, souls could be caught and stuffed into a bottle. If the soul belonged to an evil person and was causing havoc by haunting and tormenting people, the soul would be punished.\n\nHow?  \n\nDeep frying.\n\nThe bottles would be tossed into vats of hot oil. By frying the souls, they experience all the pain of actually being deep fried, this would cause resentment and anger. The resentment would grow so deep that their souls would fall into hell (the 18th level) and can never be reincarnated (because they would be unable to let go of the pain and anger).\n\nThe peasants, not knowing magic, made simple stand-ins of dough and heartfelt wishes of eternal damnation, then fried it. If one person tries and fails, that's ok, because *thousands* of people would do this every morning. Sooner or later, *someone* has to succeed, and send the couple a speedy one-way ticket to hell.\n\nNowadays, fried dough fritters are just nice with hot, thick, congee rice sprinkled with chopped onion greens and slivers of shredded boiled pork.",

            "The birds are caught with nets set during their autumn migratory flight to Africa. They are then kept in covered cages or boxes. The birds react to the dark by gorging themselves on grain, usually millet seed, until they double their bulk. The birds are then thrown into a container of Armagnac, which both drowns and marinates the birds.[13] [14]\n\nThe bird is roasted for eight minutes and then plucked. The consumer then places the bird feet first into their mouth while holding onto the bird's head. The ortolan is then eaten whole, with or without the head, and the consumer spits out the larger bones. The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face with a large napkin or towel while consuming the bird. The purpose of the towel is debated. Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once, others have stated \"Tradition dictates that this is to shield \u2013 from God\u2019s eyes \u2013 the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act\"",

All of them. Apparently everyone I knew was manipulative and/or rude.  I didn\u2019t figure out this was an attempt to isolate me until after we broke up.",

            "I kept having to call the cops to calm down my wife after she became addicted to a slew of prescription drugs.  I told her doctors that opiates for a a ruptured vertebrae, stimulants for ADHD, Ambien most nights to help her sleep and an assortment of others for anxiety and depression, and more to combat side-effects, made her violent.\n\nOne of the times that I called the cops to calm the situation down during a bad episode just made me cry.  All he had to say was that he had already been there, and asked when it would stop.\n\nI thought I\u2019d been holding things together reasonably well.  I had an office job where no one knew what was up, though my work had suffered greatly.  I kept clothes and food in my trunk, just in case I had to stay out for a bit because she had decided I was part of \u2018the conspiracy\u2019.  I had a gym on the way to work I could where I could shower or just have some down time.  I did all of our housework and errands, because she couldn\u2019t work or do much of anything most of the time.  Each time she cut herself she told the hospital it was an accident, and she always tried to go to a different one(we lived in a major metro, between hospitals).\n\nThe cop saw through it.  Being seen like that and knowing that even that lifestyle was running out hurt.   I\u2019m now recovering from the divorce and enjoying the calm.  I still sometimes panic for no reason, and I feel more comfortable with clothes and food stashed in the trunk, but I feel much healthier.  I get more sleep.

            "Wouldn't really call it a relationship as it was only 3 dates, but I had met this girl at a wedding.  She was a friend of a friend and we shared numbers that night. Texted for a while and then had a date. 1st date was probably a big red flag, but I shrugged it off.  We had connected on Facebook and she noticed that she went to college with a girl I went to high school with. No big deal, until I found out she had been messaging that girl and asking her all these questions about me in high school... who did I date, what car I drove, etc. Anyway, third date rolls around I wasn't really sure how long we would be together so typically I wouldn't have taken her to a really nice restaurant so early in a relationship, but I was in the mood for steak so I took her to a pretty high end steakhouse.\n\nI have never been more embarrassed by someone's behavior in public in my life, and I have a 6 and 3 year old at home now.  She sent 3 martinis back because they weren't made correctly while being extremely insulting and rude about it. She ordered a steak medium and then got pissed because she insisted she ordered it medium rare. Both the waiter and I told her she had ordered medium. She was making comments about what other women in the restaurant were wearing, and not very subtly. Then, despite me trying to get out of there without buy her desert, she got a desert menu and expected them to make her something that they didn't have on the menu. They had cheesecake and she wanted chocolate cheesecake. Another outburst at the staff. On the way out the door she made a point to stop and complain to someone loud enough other customers could hear. When we got into my car I was so embarrassed I pretended I had left my credit card on the table so I could go back in. I gave the waiter an extra $20 and apologized, telling him I was dumping her as soon as I got to her place. He laughed and told me he wished he could see it. I didn't really give her a chance to say much.  She called me a loser and stormed off. Havent seen or heard from her since.",

            "I had a very long and toxic relationship with an ex. I had wanted to leave for years, but he would threaten to kill himself and I would end up staying. \n\nI finally got the courage to walk away when I was diagnosed with several benign liver tumors and was told by the doctor that it was very important with this type of tumor to immediately and permanently stop taking hormonal birth control. I researched it on my own and confirmed the single most important thing I could do to avoid further complications was to stop taking hormonal birth control for good.\n\nI told my (then husband) about the appointment and he said, so calmly \"Well that's going to be a problem.\"\n\nI was like, what do you mean? I'll go to the gyno as soon as I can get an appointment and we can just use condoms until then.\n\nNope. Condoms were unacceptable because we were married. And not having sex until I got to the gyno was also unacceptable.\n\nWhat really made my blood run cold though, was when he suggested that I should continue to take birth control as normal and just not tell the doctor. \"He'll never know,\" he said. Then he went on to suggest maybe I could go on and off birth control so I'd be off of it before any follow up appointments with this doctor, to ensure that he'd never know.\n\nI was totally stunned and I just looked at him and said \"You understand this could kill me? This isn't about placating a doctor, this is about my life.\"\n\nHe just shrugged and said he wasn't using condoms and I needed to \"figure it out.\"\n\nI did figure it out. I left him more than a decade ago and have never been happier.",

I walked away when she started threatening to stab me in my sleep. We had already tried several couples therapists and individual therapists, but she refused to consider medication. I called her to meet up and try to find some closure, but she cut me off telling me I wasn't allowed to leave her and as punishment she was sleeping with two other guys. At that point I just ignored her number and filed for divorce. Hope she's doing well, but glad to not be afraid for my life!",

He would then put the boots to me for whatever sins I had committed that day. \n\nShe was the only person I had ever shared this with. She went out of town for work 2 days later and when she came home I was gone and in another state. It was remarkable the amount of abuse I put up with to that point. It dawned on me then that if he had returned to my life I wouldn\u2019t let him hurt me so there was no reason to let her abuse me either.\n\n*Edited to add: Thank you for all the kind words and support, especially the support given to others who shared their similar stories. \n\nPeace, happiness and love to you all.",

Two days later, once she was sobered up, I told her to kick rocks.  We dated for just around 3 months.

I dreamt about traveling to Japan but he said no because at that time I really liked one Japanese actor and he was afraid I could meet him and fall for him. Toxic af.

When I first met him, I got bad vibes, I'd be mid-sentence talking about something I liked and he'd pat my bed and ask me to sit with him. My flatmate told me to \"give him a chance\" so I simply did. In second year, we went for a walk and he spent the whole time insulting my outfit. It was a little different to what I normally wore, but I'd bought a new hat and was excited to wear it. He told me the hat didn't suit me and would suit him more, he took it off my head and wore it instead, and just trashed my outfit. We get to a forest area while on our walk and he tells me something along the lines of \"If somebody assaulted you, you'd be completely defenseless.\" I told him that my chunky shoes would protect me as I could kick them, and he swept my legs out from underneath me to prove that I couldn't defend myself. He said \"Your shoes didn't help you there, did they?\"\n\nLater, while I was back home with my parents, he called me around midnight. He did a lot of fishing for compliments, then he said \"If you could have sex with me, you would.\" I'd told this person about my sexual trauma so this hit pretty hard. I spoke to my mental health advisor at university and he told me that that was sexual harassment and physical assault and I should report him, but he's an RA, he's the person I should be reporting these things to. I just avoid him now.\n\nEdit: Okay, I've read through some comments. I have a meeting with my mental health advisor who works with the university to talk about it more. It was good to hear from other RAs too. There is unfortunately only one other RA currently, a good friend of mine who defended his behaviour in my first year so I'm not comfortable talking to him. We have limited staff on my campus as it's the rural campus for my university, but we do have security so I think I'm going to speak to someone higher up soon.

He said if I couldn't do this, then we could be fuck buddies until he met someone else then he would straight up cut me off. Why was he doing this? Because his kids NEED A MOM and they need stability. I hadn't even met his kids! \n\nI ended up telling him no and I'm glad I did.",
            "This girl had an intense daddy fetish. A fetish that's always turned me off. During passionate moments she wanted me to talk to her like a little girl. I just couldn't do it. And on top of that, during like our second week dating, she got really mad at me cause I guess I wasn't committing to her enough. She wanted me to post on social media that we were a couple, but at this point I thought it was way too soon and there were red flags telling me to leave the relationship. She got abnormally mad about me not doing that. And there was always this undertone of jealousy and paranoia that I was pursuing another girl, which at the time, I wasn't. And I've always been a healthy eater, and she made fun of my healthy eating habits. So yeah, that was a no for me.",

We didn't go out much, he never wanted to do anything when he got home from work but drink and play games.\n\nDespite claiming to support me as a strong woman, his support flew out the window the moment I was finally becoming happy. I tried to bring him with me to the new city, since he hated where he was. I offered him a beautiful life together, and change of pace he desperately deserved, especially for emotionally supporting me through my hardship, but all he gave me back was snarky jealousy of my position, entitlement, demands that I leave my job, negativity toward my new good friends, belittling my success as 'just my first job' (in this career) and refusal to come with me out of pride. He kept using his depression as a shield against taking responsibility for being a jerk, claiming it made him do it, but not doing anything to work on his depression. \n\nI left him 6 months into the new job when he truly didn't understand that I did nothing wrong in my happiness, and he needed to handle his issues without taking them out on me. He admitted in the end that he didnt appreciate me and blamed me for his problems, but still refused to change his behavior. So I explained to him calmly why I could not continue, and left without looking back-- nobody should have a cement block tied to their legs while swimming. I've been incredibly happy since.",

When I got back home, we were both very excited to see each other, so she came over with her dog. \n\nThe dog (a pug) had apparently never been in anyone elses' house. Nor had she ever house trained her dog (I later learned that she had a full empty room in her apartment with pee pads all over the floor for the dog). So the dog is sniffing around my dog's bed and just peeing all over it.\n\nAt first she was embarrassed, and I was a little bit annoyed, but didn't make a big deal about it. I grabbed a towel and tried to wipe it up. After the third time, I said something like, OK, it's time for [dog's name] to go home. So we left to head back to her place.\n\nFast forward a few days, and we're at her place. The dog is just being crazy and so hyper. I offer to take him for a walk, and she rejects it. Instead, he goes into the second bedroom to pee on a pee pad. I'm silently judging the situation, but don't say anything. \n\nWe go to bed and she talks about the idea of getting the dog neutered. I said I thought it was a good idea because it would mellow him out and maybe help his \"marking\" instinct. She exploded in anger, saying that she couldn't believe I was so mad about him peeing on my dog's bed, and that I totally overreacted and just laid into me for a solid 15-20 minutes. I realized then that this person was potentially dangerous. \n\nI jumped out of bed, put my clothes on, and headed towards the door. I said I'm sorry that things didn't work out and was about to leave. Her response was, \"That's it?!\" and then she went back into her room and sulked. I tried to talk to her more, but she continued to yell at me and berate me about the dog and how I was such a shitty person for overreacting. I told her that I really did have to go.

            "Kenyans are all long-distance runners, live in huts, speak no English, and have pet wild animals. Ugh.\n\nSo here goes: The long-distance guys are mainly from one community/ tribe called the Kalenjin that's about 15% of the population. Next, Kenya is still a developing nation with a lot of poverty, but there's a lot of modern architecture. Next, the country is rated 18 out of 100 on the English Proficiency Index. And lastly: you can apply for a special (and rarely-granted) permit for your bobcat named Babou, but keeping wildlife is not at all common. And the Kenya Wildlife Service will conduct regular visits to ensure Babou isn't being kept in Meowschwitz-like conditions.",

            "Woo. Singaporean here.\n\n1) No, we're not part of China. We're not even in the same region. Yes, the population is 60% ethnically Chinese, but that doesn't make us part of China any more than it makes the USA part of Britain. As a matter of fact, there's a problem of racism against mainlander Chinese, since locals tend not to see them as \"true\" Singaporeans. This is exacerbated by the fact that lots of mainlander Chinese are pretty pro-China (human rights violations and all), while the local Chinese don't like China and the CCP very much. We're closer culturally to Taiwan.\n\n2) It is not illegal to be naked inside your own home. You can be starkers while bathing or fucking if you like. You just cannot use \"I am in my own home\" as a defense against streaking or showing everyone your rude bits. 90% of the population live in government apartments and we don't need pervs flashing their dongs through their windows. Incidentally, this law came about because pervs were flashing their dongs through their windows. Singapore used to have a big flasher problem back in the 80s - times were weird.\n\n3) It is not illegal to chew gum, only to import/sell it or bring it onto the trains. This is because dickheads used to literally gum up the train doors and make everyone late for work. The government put up with it for a few months and then said fuck it, no more gum for everyone, this is why we can't have nice things.\n\n4) The government doesn't fine people for every little offence *anymore*. They used to, but enforcement has become lenient in the last two decades. Sadly, this means there's a ton of litter where the streets used to be pristine. Still, you might not want to litter or spit right in front of a police officer.",

            "I\u2019ve told this story before.  I\u2019m an eye doctor and I had a patient come to me with an infected eyelid two other eye doctors tried to treat and failed.  They were dumping all sorts of medicine into it and it wasn\u2019t getting any better.  At this point, it was swollen and painful for weeks with no improvement despite being on tons of meds.  Apparently, neither of them thought to flip the lid upside down (you know that gross trick some kids do with their upper eyelids?).  It was a painful maneuver for her very swollen eyelid, which might explain it.  Anyhow, there appeared to be what looked like a visible abscess inside the tissue with thick gooey material, I thought I\u2019d give it a nudge and saw it move.  This wasn\u2019t an abscess, it was something else.  I managed to remove it quite easily in one whole piece.  It was a fly larva.  The patient told me that she had a bug hit her in the eye a few days before she got this \u201cinfection\u201d.  I removed the larva and within two days the wound closed and she was 100% recovered on basic antibiotic eye drops.  Yes, I do have the photos from this case for those interested.\n\nTLDR: Patient had a bug lay an egg in her eyelid and I removed the larva.",
            "This happened to me. This is from the days when I used to live back home (I used to live in Karachi, Pakistan but now moved to UK).\n\nWe used live very close to a CID (Police Investigation Department aka Pakistani FBI)  building which we all were unaware of and always thought it was just an ordinary government building till on 11th, Nov 2010. On that day I around evening time coming home from work I thought I better hit the gym (because they had a sauna and after being tired from all day work that sounded like a good idea) which was hardly 0.3 miles away so I decided to walk to the gym. I change quickly and leave for the gym and start walking towards the gym. \n\nThis is almost I've hardly walked like 10 minutes and I'm 0.1 miles away roughly and all of a sudden for a nano second I feel that ground is shaking and the next thing I hear is a loudest bang I've ever heard followed by a pressure kick into my chest. Now to let you guys know, my both the ear started bleeding because the bang was so loud and for the reference the kick in the chest was as bad as Big Show wearing military boots and kicking you in the chest straight\n with full force. \n\nNext thing? I'm on the ground covering my ears because they are in agony and covered in dirt trying to figure out what's happening. As I am trying to figure out I can see all the cars alarms have gone off. Anything made up of glass has been shattered in roughly 1-2 miles area. I'm still trying to figure out what has happened and I start smelling gun powder and as if someone is making a BBQ and is being burnt. I will always remember that smell which was something unsettling. Next things rock and dust particle starts landing on me and the surrounding areas which had 1-1.5 inches long of pieces of human skin and flesh. I am not believing that I have another human skin piece stuck to my arm. I brush up my clothes and arms getting up and covering my ear recovering from that pressure kick. \n\nAs I move closer to a spot in a street where I am hearing loads of people screaming and crying I see a few 3-5ft cracks between some walls of the building which have been destroyed by the shockwave of the bang. I see the gap between a wall and move into the area where I see these scenes straight from a Hollywood movie where people are crying, cars on fire and dead bodies on the ground. By this time I'm thinking its a bomb blast and that's what has happened. As I move closer I see a 10ft and 30ft wide crater which has been filled with the water and the building which was a CID building is no longer there. There are hundreds of people lying on the ground crying for help as some of them don't even have legs or limbs or some don't have their complete bottom. I am still in a state of shock looking around and I see a woman crying and hitting herself because she had her husband dead who's legs and torso was missing. I seen that later. I see several people without legs, brains out and no limbs. \n\nOne thing, which haunted me for sure was a 18-20yr old guy who was dead and lying on the floor towards his chest on the floor with his neck turned towards me. I can still remember him looking straight into my eyes. His feet were flipped the other way around. After the police arrived and media arrived I came back home after it got crowded. After I came home after the dusk everyday, I would see that 18-20yr old boy standing and starring into my eyes. I would wake up screaming through out the night and see that guy standing at the door way just staring at me. For two to three weeks I would see this guy regularly during  midnight standing in my hallway staring through my soul. I still remember that guy's face and the shockwave and the sound of the blast.\n\nP.S to this day even the slightest bang or even a loud music drops freaks me out sometimes reminding me of that shockwave. I'm married so sometimes I tell my wife that the bang just reminded me of the shockwave I witnessed in this accident, I don't tell her but inside my heart I pray secretly that God don't ever put anyone through that even in their wildest dreams. \n\n[Photo of the Explosion aftermath ](https://imgur.com/nyOe6df)\n\nEdit: Thank you to whoever gave me my first gold award!

            "My HIV story.\n\nI was on a trip on my first commercial flight (from Sacramento to San Diego) to visit my girlfriend, and I didnt feel well. Once I got off the plane I made it to the hotel and had bouts of nausea and diarrhea for a few days straight and finally decided to go to hospital. After waiting hours I was let into a room and some time later an Asian woman wearing a mask and gloves entered. \"Please leave the room,\" she told my girlfriend (let's call Beatrice). \"No she can stay it's okay,\" I said. The doctor still hadn't looked at me, but looked back to Beatrice. \"I think you should leave.\" I looked to Beatrice and said \"can you please wait outside.\" Right as the door closed the doctor said, \"you have HIV.\" My mind instantly started racing, trying to problem solve. \"I cant have AIDS, I got tested before being with Beatrice and I was clean,\" I said. The doctor again \"you have HIV\" while avoiding eye contact. I looked at my palms and for the first time in my life they were sweating, really sweating. I said again, \"I cant, I've been tested.\" The doctor flipped a page and asked my name, which I responded, and finally the doctors eyes made contact with my own. \"I'm so sorry, I have the wrong chart. You have strep throat and laryngitis.\" I remember the world ending and then the feeling the most relief I've ever experience in my life. When I told Beatrice the whole story she awkwardly laughed and said, \"but you dont have AIDS, right?\" To this day when I tell people what happened a good portion say \"but you dont have AIDS, right?\" Whole lotta fuckin nope!",

Each morning, she would see a man in his trailer taking pictures of her and her friends, it creeped her out so she went to tell her mom (my mother in law) of what this guy was doing and how he would just stand in the window staring at them and taking pictures. So, her mom calls the police and report him; the police didn't do anything.

Well the bus went over a speed bump and the guy fell and ended up getting caught on the back wheel.

He said his whole back was scraped off exposing his spine. I remember driving down that road after the fact, and you could still see a deep red blood stained trail going on for those 5 blocks.\n\nAbsolutely horrifying.",

Lo and behold, I feel something tickling my legs. I dive under to see since its too deep for seaweed to reach this high and I wanted to see fish.\n\nTentacles. Everywhere.

Turns out I'm the victim of a family curse, Schizoaffective disorder.

It was the middle of summer and myself and a girlfriend were hanging around watching the boys play street hockey.\n\nOne of the boys called my name and said a man in the parking lot was looking for me. The parking lot was mostly obscured by the building, but I could see an old 70s style van that hadn't been there earlier.\n\nI was walking over to the van when the mother of one of the other kids showed up looking for her son and asked me what I was doing.

Just wanted to address a few FAQs:\n\nMy parents didn't say they were punishing me, they just kept me close to the house, so I assumed that I was being punished. I lived in a very small, safe \"we don't lock our doors\" town. Kids roamed the streets from sun up until sundown, typically, playing in the old quarries and on railway tracks and on gigantic limestone hills and all kinds of shit we'd never let our kids do now.\n\nA few people were worried about Mrs. Gisbon's son - he was fine. We all were. She had come in from the other entrance to the schoolyard behind us whereas the boys were closer to the parking lot. I barely got within shouting distance of the van before it sped off.\n\nMost kids are unfortunately abducted by people they know, so I have no way of knowing if it was some creep who knew me from all the activities my parents had us in or just some opportunist guy who said to the boy, \"you know that girl over there? can you call her over for me?\"\n\nWe were all taught about stranger danger - shout out to Canadians who remember [Stay Alert!

Every night she would come down and tell her parents and every night her father would tell her the Boogeyman didn't exist and she should go back to bed.\n\nWell, this happened for several nights and the father got tired of it. So that night he walked her back to her bedroom, turned on the light, and said, \"I'll show you there's no Boogeyman\" and went to open the closet door. But something on the other side held it shut. He sent his daughter out of the room and forced the door open to find that a man was inside. He'd been sneaking into their house every night to stand in the girl's closet and watch her (and maybe more).\n\nHe beat the ever-loving shit out of the man and the man went to prison. When I interviewed this woman I looked him up online. He'd recently gotten out on parole and had skipped out on his weekly checks. There was a warrant out for his arrest and nobody knew where he was anymore.\n\nEdit: People are asking for the source.

We saw two people, one of them climbing out of the ditch. When we parked my mom told my dad to go see if they were ok or needed help, my dad said that they looked to be ok and it was probably not a good idea so we all went in and to bed.

            "My mom was stalked by a guy in her chemistry class. This was back in the late seventies, during her first semester at college. They were lab partners, and Mom thought he seemed cute and nice, and was too shy at the time to ask him out, but she said if he\u2019d asked her out, she would\u2019ve went. They were friendly with each other in class, but their paths didn\u2019t cross outside of that since they were in different majors. \n\nAs the semester wore on, however, she noticed he was often waiting for her outside of her other classes, the library, the student union, out in front where her dad picked her up and dropped her off. This continued into the spring semester. Puzzled, but not yet alarmed, she asked him how he always seemed to know where she was. He proudly said, \u201cOh, I asked the registrar\u2019s office for a copy of your schedule!\u201d \n\nMy mom went to complain to the secretary who gave out her schedule, and the secretary blew it off because \u201cyou guys are dating\u201d. Luckily, Mom had already arranged to transfer to a different school for sophomore year, and spent the remaining time left avoiding him. She never saw him after that. But it wasn\u2019t over.\n\nFlash forward to grad school. Mom was at work, and Grandma gets a knock on the door. Since the man at the door was in a naval uniform, and my grandmother was a Navy nurse, she let the man in, because he looked rather sad. He starts off by saying how sorry he is for my mother\u2019s loss, which completely mystified Grandma. \n\n\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, I just got back from overseas, and I found out my friend recently killed himself. He spoke so highly of his fianc\u00e9e, your daughter, and I wanted to meet her.\u201d\n\nMy grandmother told him her daughter didn\u2019t even have a boyfriend at the moment, let alone a fianc\u00e9. It doesn\u2019t take too long to establish the man\u2019s deceased friend in question was in fact Mom\u2019s stalker. The Naval Lieutenant was pretty upset, and my grandmother even more so. She made him leave before Mom got home.\n\nThe weird thing about the stalker\u2019s death is that it was ruled a suicide, but he hanged himself from a very high up tree branch you\u2019d need a ladder to get to, and his hands were tied behind his back. From what my mother later learned, he had a tendency to snoop and generally stick his nose in places they didn\u2019t belong besides the obvious stalking thing, and this didn\u2019t win him too many friends, so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who he might have pissed off. My mom always concludes this story kind of nonchalantly, like, \u201cYeah, back in those days, they didn\u2019t really know much about stalking. They\u2019ve gotten a little better in terms of awareness now.\u201d It gives me the creeps to think what could have happened if he escalated his attempts to follow her after she left that school.",

They stayed a couple days and nothing out of the ordinary happened, and afterwards the uncle drove them to the bus station and they continued on their way.

She had no idea why, but figured it could be a tail light or something, so she pulled over. When the officer approached, he confirmed to her that her tail light was out, and asked for license and registration, so she gave it to him and he disappeared to his car for awhile. \n\nLater, when he came back, he started asking her weirder and weirder questions. They started regularly, \"Where are you going, where did you come from?\", but then they started getting personal. \"Do you have a husband at home? Any children? Any weapons? Any daughters? Any aggressive pets?\"\n\nOnce he started getting concerningly personal, she told him that it was inappropriate to be asking these questions. Then he started getting aggressive. \"I'm a fucking cop! Do you know what that means?!?! It means you shut the fuck up and do what I say. Step out of the car.\"\n\nObviously she was pretty scared at this point. She rolled up the window and started looking through her purse for her phone. At this point, the officer was straight up violent. He was pounding on her window and trying her door yelling crazy shit. \"Get out of the fucking car you bitch! You dirty fucking slut I said out!\" \n\nSo, in a full blown panic, she stepped on the gas and drove away. A chase occured for a short while, but the cop quickly stopped following her as she got closer to the main road. She then called 911, where she learned that there was no officers that were supposed to be in that location.\n\nIn the coming days it turned out that there was a rapist who was posing as a cop in that area. She never even had a broken tail light. But he had her address, her personal info, and even knew about her husband and daughter. She told him she didn't own weapons, so she immediately purchased a pistol. Unfortunately she was forced to live in fear for awhile until they caught the man.",

But then he was released a year later, because there was little DNA evidence to prove this.

I said to him there had been complaints of a woman screaming from this address and he told me that his mrs and him had been arguing about something getting stolen from outside their caravan which was her fault - bullshit story. \nHe was the friendliest man and so nice to deal with. \n\nUnfortunately I wasn\u2019t going to leave without checking on the female as we have to make sure all parties are safe before leaving. \nHe was hesitant at first but then moves out of the doorway and I see her sitting on the bed covered head to toe in clothing and huge sunglasses, which was odd because it was night time - possibility of drugs but I doubted it. \nI asked if she was ok and she nodded her head, she wouldn\u2019t remove her glasses for me and I wasn\u2019t allowed to make her. \nSo I gave them a warning about the arguing and told them to keep it down.\n\nI was still unhappy with the situation as I didn\u2019t have enough evidence to make an arrest so I decided to go next door and ask if they had seen anything. \nThe neighbours told me the woman is covered in bruises and I need to get her to safety. They agreed to be a witness and make statements so I was happy with the evidence for an arrest. \n\nI go back to the caravan and arrest the man and put him in the back of my car.\nI then go over to the woman who immediately collapsed when standing up. We help her back onto the bed and she starts removing the clothes and glasses. She\u2019s covered in bruises, he face is swollen with black eyes. She has fresh blow-torch burns to her legs and stomach. Huge holes all over her body from a screwdriver that were infected. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \n\nThat woman was tied up in that stupid little fucking caravan for weeks being tortured for every minute she was awake. \n\nThe thing that got me though was how nice this monster of a human was. You just don\u2019t know anything about anyone until it\u2019s too late. We put this fucker away for life without bail. We got her help, a new place to live in a recovery house for domestic violence victims and she\u2019s doing well. The saddest part of this whole story.. the female is still in love with him and asks if she will ever see him again. Brainwashed.",
            "I'm not really great at writing sentences or paragraphs but I hope that everyone can read this just fine.\n\nI was walking out of a Walmart one night and this guy caught my attention and asked me if I can get him a ride. I don't know this person and I don't give random strangers a ride. He told me he was a truck driver and he wanted to go back to the to the gas station across the highway literally just within walking distance so he can get to his big rig.\n\nI made up some BS excuse so i wouldn't give him a ride. I suggested to him that there's uber he can contact for help.\n\nHe starts yelling at me saying that its just a ride and that he needs help. At that point, I just said \"I gotta go\" and I quickly turned around and headed to my car. I heard him say \"Okay\".  I got into my car and sped off.  Initially I felt extremely bad for not giving him a ride but the way he yelled at me made it seem justified that I said no.  I don't give strangers rides unless its family or friends.\n\nCut to almost a year later.  I'm at a restaurant eating lunch. I decided to open up Facebook on my phone. What I saw next just spooked me down to my core.\n\nThe article showed a picture of the same guy ,who asked me for a ride that night , in a mugshot. Turns out he was a running fugitive wanted on several murder charges across the state I live in.\n\nOne of the scariest things he did to trick people was that he  would ask for a ride and then when him and his victims were out of sight of everyone he would then kills them by shooting them and he strips them of their money and their clothing. He then would take their vehicle and travel to the next area to find his next victim...\n\nI legit almost choked on my drink when I saw that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: Thank you everyone for the up votes. I'm happy you guys can read this perfectly because honestly I thought it wasn't going to be understood right away. \n\nI'm not going to discourage everyone to not give random people rides. There are good people that do need a little help on road sometimes but i also understand that there are also bad apples out there making things difficult for good Samaritans. \n\nBut if you're going to give people rides be careful especially with COVID going around and infecting everything. It also helps if you are \"carrying\" with a license if you get my meaning. \n\nBe safe everyone!",

We get a lot of feedback, and it was a short transmission, but I was certain it sounded like someone screaming, with a dog barking in the background. It was very short though. I was unsure, but I trusted my gut. \n\nI jogged over to the main treatment building and looked in. No screaming, no panic. Thought I was tripping. Decided to check the \u201cluxury boarding\u201d building, where my boss Gabi was. Silence. \nI decided to trust my gut again, and walk further into the building, despite no one else seeming alarmed here either. \n\nI walked to the end of the hall where my boss would be, and peered through the small plexiglass window in the door.\n\nFirst thing I see is blood, smeared on the walls.\nI freeze for a second, and bust in.

The dogs are locked onto each other, and she\u2019s trying to pull them apart, repeatedly losing her footing from all of the blood on the floor. \n\nI grab the attacking dog from behind by his collar, Gabi grabs the dog being attacked/whining. It doesn\u2019t work. I start radioing for help, maybe 10 seconds straight of screaming for help, before I dropped the radio and had to attend to the fight again. The aggressor unclamps and reclamps on the dogs neck. I\u2019m out of ideas and help isn\u2019t coming, so I look around, and see a ~10 lb. metal food bowl on the counter. I grab it, pause, look at my boss to see if she\u2019s cool with my plan, and she says yes. So I wail on this dog 7-8 times until he lets go, and walks away. I take the wounded dog to treatment, furious, and covered in blood, as they listen to easy-rock w/ their radios off.\n\n\nBonus: A receptionist asks me later that day what \u201call that noise on the radio\u201d was about. I asked her what she meant, and what she heard.  \n\n\u201cI heard someone like screaming and saying there was an emergency, but I was with a client and it was really loud, so I turned it down.\u201d\n\nI of course am tasked with cleaning up all of the blood.\n\nI then quit.",

He hid the barrel in his house for years and none of the various owners opened it due to the weight. Finally one guy decided to dispose of it in the 90s and when he opened it he saw it contained something.

But there was this older girl named Angela next door. She was 14-15. I didn\u2019t know any better and when she asked to hang out all the time, so I did. One day she invited me in to play or something or whatever, and she brought me into her parents room. Her dad was an Army Ranger or special forces or some shit, but there was a disgusting amount of weapons in that room. She picked a shotgun up and joked about killing me and other people. Me being 6 years old just laughed and thought it was cool. So she then loaded this gun in front of me and showed me how it worked, and then pointed it at my face and told me to crawl around her house for literal hours. I crawled around and cried, and she would put the gun in my face and in my mouth, and would spook me with other guns and dry fire them at me. She then told me at one point to get undressed, and I told her I would do it in the bathroom because I was uncomfortable getting undressed in front of people.

A guy I was seeing came (from abroad) to visit me. At the end of his trip I accompanied him to his train home. After that I went back into the metro to go home. It was about 2 PM, very bright and sunny outside. I sat down on a bench near a man. We made eye contact and I said hello, he said hello back. I felt like something was off but tried to ignore it. The metro car came and we both got inside. \n\nIt was crowded. I took a seat, he took one of the only available ones which was right across from me. I started thinking I was overreacting since he started talking to a man near me, seemed like they knew each other. His friend got off after a few stops but he stayed. Once I saw my own stop approaching to change lines I got up. He got up too and was right behind me. I could see his reflection in the metro car window and he was very slowly looking my legs up and down. I started to feel very uneasy. The doors open, we get off. I start walking quickly to the end of the platform then realise he might be following me. There were several entrances/exits around so I suddenly changed direction to go to another exit. He changed course as well. Then I turned around again, he followed. I did this a few times and he changed his path to match mine each time. Fuck. \n\nEventually I knew I had to leave somehow so he wouldn't catch up so I went to the exit I needed to take to change lines and go home. Unfortunately the passageway to the next line was flooded with people so I was slowed down. He caught up with me and started crowding me in, getting closer and closer to me. I was backed up against a wall at this point, him just smiling brightly at me. \n\n\"Hello, how are you?\" He asked me, still inching towards me. I was terrified at this point. No one stopped to even glance at us so I knew unless I did something myself I wouldn't get away from him. I glanced to the right and saw a staircase downwards. \n\nWithout warning I SPRINTED away to the stairs. He was very caught off guard and it took him 2 or 3 seconds to start following me. I flew down the stairs and straight into a metro car. I turned around to see if he was close behind. He was sprinting down the stairs as well. Thankfully, the doors closed before he could get to the bottom and we pulled away. \n\nSurprisingly I had gotten onto the right metro line and direction to go home, not that it mattered much to me at the time.

            "It happened about 12 years ago.\n\nI'm a 39 years old anesthetist from Egypt. 12 years ago I was working in a small hospital in the rural City of Rosetta (if you know Rosetta Stone, this is the city where they found it).\n\nThe hospital is formed of 5 floors. The dormitories are in the 5th floor. The ground floor had the emergency and causality department. Other floors have the wards, the labs and the operative theatre.\n\nAt that time the hospital was under some maintainence. In that particular day I was on duty. There was nothing in the operative theatre that afternoon so I was in my room in the 5th floor surfing the web on my netbook. I heard some knocks on the door. It was the janitor, he told me that some new (beds and wardrobes) would be delivered now. He asked me to stay out of my room till they finish the replacement.\n\nI stayed in the TV room for a while when suddenly the PA system anounced my name to head immediately to ER. Before I move one security man came running and he told me that there was a big road traffic accident that involved a school bus and that every one available is needed down. I rushed to my room, found the new furniture in place so I closed it and ran down to the ER. When I entered the ER department I noticed the new color of the walls, before it was green now it's blue with silver decorations everywhere. While I was helping the children, I asked one nurse when they changed the colors of the ER, would all the hospital have the same pattern. She looked me confused and asked what new color, it was always like that. I got confused myself but I didn't pay attention to that.\n\nThere were many injured children. There's were many doctors, pediatricians, surgeons etc. A lot of them were new faces to me. I was working in this place for several years so I almost knew everyone. I was asking myself when all those new people came. I should be more social and so but I didn't expect anything bad. I was asking the people I know about the new doctors and always I was getting the same answers: you don't know him?! how?! He was here for several years. We meet over lunch or dinner etc. Again I was confused but I didn't pay attention. Thank God nothing was serious. No one was admitted to ICU or went through an emergency surgery.\n\nA couple of hours later, everything is fine and things began to settle down. So I went outside the ER to have some fresh air. I won't forget what I saw. The hospital place is near the Nile (the Western branch, the Rosetta branch) so that's what I usually see when I leave the hospital. But what I saw was simply the Mediterranean.\n\nRosetta City is near the Mediterranean but not that close. I couldn't believe my eyes. I began to look to the surrounding buildings. Some I knew, some I didn't. Now I freaked out, I remembered that I didn't recognize the ER or the new doctors. I ran inside to my colleagues and I asked them about what is out side they told me It's the Mediterranean. I shouted: I know it's but how did it come to here? Every one was confused. I kept asking where am I? And my colleagues started to calm me down and try to understand why the panic. I tried to call my parents (I was single at that time) using my cellphone but they didn't answer. I wanted to call another older anesthetist, I consider him a father and my best friend. I couldn't find his name on my phone. I really freaked out. I asked my colleagues for his phone number, every one told me that they don't recognize the name. I was sure that I wasn't dreaming, I was treating children calculating drug doses my mind was clear enough to know that I wasn't dreaming. I got a mental block, I didn't know what to do. Then I decided that I will leave the hospital at once, I need to see my family.\n\nI ran to the 5th floor to my room to change my clothes and get my things before I leave the place. Once I opened the room, I noticed the usual furniture .. no new furniture no new bed or wardrobe. I stood there for a moment totally lost. Then I heard some one calling me. It was a security guard, he told me that there is a big accident down that involved a lot of children and they needed everyone down there. I kept staring at him without any response. He kept talking that PA is down because of a faulty maintainence and that's\u200b why they are calling the doctors individually. I told him that I will go down ... He asked me If they is any other doctors in the dormitory? I told him that I Don't know so he went to check. I had a look out side the window and here it was the Nile and the usual scene. But I was already lost. I went down to help, the same children, same injuries but I was completely lost, confused and and hands shaking my legs barely carried me. It was easy to manage the children since I knew them already. I knew what kind of injuries we will find.My colleagues (usual daily group - no more new doctors) asked if I was OK and that I was pale.\n\nThe next few days was like hell to me. I had nightmares. I wasn't able to think clearly during my day. Then I took one week off to calm down. I have never experienced anything similar. I wasn't on any medications at that time or under any kind of stress. Everything was clear it wasn't a dream at all. As I said my mind was clear to pay attention to the details of drug doses, scoring of injuries. I'm sure. Till today I still remember the children and what I did to them. I only told this story to this older anesthetist and later to my wife because whenever I remember it, I remember that horrible feelings I had.",
            "1st of all sry for the bad English, this is probably not terrifying but I lived it in first-person and even after 20+ years I still have nightmares.\n\nmy uncle was living in another country and one year he came back to have xmas holidays with us, I was delighted because he was my godfather and he came back home like every 3 years (or more), we had a great family reunion on Dec 31, we were like 30+ ppl it was great, at around 1 am his friends came to pick him up to go to the disco, it was pretty far from the city, and there weren't much lights in that street, so it was a pitch-black night, a camion without lights came from the opposite direction at full speed and collided with the car my uncle was in, the 2 men in the front died instantly, one in the back died in the hospital the same day, my uncle survived... he couldn't remember who he was, he had metal bars in all of his limbs, scars all over his body, you couldn't recognise his face, he was convinced that he was the one driving and that he was responsible... it took him a year to start moving again, and a few months later he took his life, I was the one to find his body with a knife on the chest when I went to bring him breakfast, I was living with my grandma, I was 9yo.\n\napparently, the other guy was a truck driver and that night he was stealing stuff from the company he was working for or some shit like that, can't remember very well, back then and the adults didn't want me to hear that stuff.",

Betty said that she saw Jane shaking and babbling, but her eyes were closed,  so Betty thought that Jane was having a bad dream.  Betty went and took a shower.

It got to a point where I just couldn't do it anymore. \n\nBut this guy saved me from poverty, fed me, all the shit you can think of. And I stayed because I felt I owed him.\n\nOne thing is, once you're in, you're in, there is no going back. \n\nOne night I told him I wanted out. I was tired and im only sticking around because I owed him. But I felt my debt was repaid already. \n\nLater that night he came to pick me up. I told him I didn't wanna go out. I felt sick. But he insisted. He was with 3 other people. I sat in the back middle, one person on each side, he was driving, and another guy i didnt know was in the passenger side. \n\nThe whole time im shitting bricks. He's talking about how we met, how good he was to me. And we pulled over into an alley. He looked at me and asked me if I still wanted to leave. \n\nAs scared as I was I said yea. I heard the other guy open the glove compartment. \n\nMy buddy told me to get out, we both got out and talked.  He told me he was gonna miss me, and at this point I started crying. I figured I was gonna die. He hugged me and told me to run. Don't look back, don't come back, throw away my phone, don't go back to my apartment, don't contact anyone. He gave me a rolled up wad of cash and turned around.\n\nI just stood there. He got back to the car and everyone else got out, he screamed at them to get back in. Then he told me to start fucking running.\n\nI ran, im not a runner. Im 5\"9 160.lbs and I cant even run a quarter mile. But that night, with tears streaming down my face I ran the farthest I ever ran. I ended up running to a truckstop, sweat pouring down my face, I was soaked. \n\nI vomited for s good 5 minutes in the bathroom, when I got out, an old man laughed at me and asked if I had too much to drink, I said I dont drink, he asked what was i coming down from, cause he wanted some. I dont know why, but I sat next to him and started crying again. \n\nHe patted my back, i asked if he could drive me to the nearest bus station. I brought a greyhound ticket that night.\n\nA year or so ago, out of curiosity, I looked alot of those people I hung out with up. My buddy, the main guy, went missing about a week after I left.

            "I was surfing in Cape Town with a friend who had been staying in CT longer than me, and he told me about a crime that had occurred at the same spot a little while before. A guy was surfing, came out of the water and went to his car. A local came over with a gun and told him to hand over his money. The guy had no money, so the local told him to drive him to the nearest atm and empty his card. Somewhere in the middle of the carjacking the surfer tried to fight back, got shot in the gut and was stuffed in the trunk by the carjacker, who proceeded to drive to a local neighbourhood and pick up a pair of girls he was friendly with. They drove around joyriding for a bit until the guy in the trunk apparently woke up and began making a lot of noise. The girls got spooked and the carjacker let them out, drove to a field nearby, doused the injured surfer in petrol and burnt him alive.\n\nThey never caught the guy. The first girl made an initial testimony to the police and then mysteriously died in police custody. The second girl disappeared.\n\nThat story really spooked me because I had the sudden realisation that I was a long way from home in a dangerous place, and nothing but luck was keeping me from a similar fate to that surfer. And if somehow I escaped from a situation like that, the police would offer me no help.",
            "Probably gonna get buried but it's a good one, I promise.\n\nAn old co-worker of mine grew up in the USSR in its final days.she was an orphan and lived in an orphanage and would often sneak out. She was about five or so. One time she came across a guy who convinced her to come along with him. They ended up in some kind of distant area somewhere. A lake edge or something?\n\nAnyway, I asked her why she had gone with him and she had said he was just super friendly and she hadn't really met anyone who had been kind to her. And he played her some guitar, they had a fire, she sang and laughed and danced with this guy.\n\nEventually some police or authorities of some kind showed up and arrested him. Turns out the guy was a serial killer and rapist of children. She was there when they asked him why he hadn't done anything yet. He was known to be really brutal.\n\nApparently it was the first time a kid hadn't been scared of him. The fear is what would help compel him to commit his actions and he got off on that, but she wasn't really afraid at all and it was one of the first times he'd been able to really interact with a target. And they had been having fun so he didn't want to end it too quickly.\n\nFrom what I understand she ended up back in the orphanage after, and after the collapse of the USSR had made her way overseas to Canada when she was older.\n\nSo yeah.

It takes about 20 mins to convince the driver, this 19 year old kid, that yes, they're from the US army and no, they're not going to shoot him.\n\nApparently, this Bradley was part of a vehicle convoy and got hit by an IED. The convoy stops, puts the Bradley in a different spot in the line, and continues on. At which point it gets hit by another IED. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe fifth IED is so bad that it knocks out the comms and navigation, and the driver gets knocked out. The other guys in the vehicle with him take one look at him, think \"yep he's dead\", and fuck off with the rest of the convoy, leaving the car and the kid in the middle of nowhere.\n\nSeveral hours later, the kid wakes up in the middle of the night, concussed, with no idea where he is and the rest of his squad gone. He can't call anyone because comms are out, he has no idea where he is, because his nav is out, so he does the only thing he can do, which is drive up and down the road looking for the rest of the convoy, at which point the scouts find him. The whole thing apparently gave him such bad PTSD that he had to be sent home.\n\nI know the story itself isn't particularly scary, but whenever I think about it I always imagine that kid, scared out of his mind, frantically searching for his squad because they wouldn't just leave him behind, right? Right? The thought of being in that situation terrifies me.",

            "Hope you all are ready for my real life lifetime movie!  This was over the course of maybe 6 months. The scariest part is at the end. \n\nSo I grew up in a really close knit neighborhood, we would watch each other's houses and feed each other's animals whenever someone would go on vacation. Well fast forward to me being an adult, a new neighbor moved in behind me by my horse area. I introduced myself to the lady, she said her grandson would be moving in with their horses soon. Being the nice neighbor that I am, I gave her my number and let her know to call me if she needed anything.\n\nHer grandson moves in, and this guy is strange to say the least. First he started by jumping my fence and trying to ride my horse, next he set a chair up and started watchng me whenever I went to work or feed my horse. Then one evening he starts texting me, probably like 50 messages without a response (I work nights and was sleeping). I wake up to him telling me my fence is 3 feet over his land and saying a bunch of other stuff that didn't make sense. I look out my window and see him pacing the fence, waiting for me to feed my horse. I called my brother in law, he comes over so I don't have to go alone and the guy basically threatens to burn us alive. We call the cops and they come out, but can't do anything about it.\n\nThat same night, I went to work and start getting some scary messages from the guy, telling me I fucked up and all of this stuff. I get home from work in the morning and my fence was cut down in three spots and this fucker caution taped off \"his section\" Cops once again come out and can't do anything for me.\n\nEverytime I ever called the police for help, he would hide in his house and not come out, since everything he was doing was misdemeanors, they couldn't do anything.\n\nSo I get a restraining order. (little did that fucking help.) Now this guy starts messing with my next door neighbors as well. He is the kind of guy who only messes with women and elders. So he starts telling them that he owns the easement between my house and theirs, which he didn't, it's grandfathered in that they were granted access, that's it. One day I go outside to his grandma's car parked diagnal, blocking the next door neighbors in so they called the police to have it towed.\n\nAfter the car was towed I left for the day and came home after dark. I live on a private road with only one way in/out where everyone has long driveways, nobody parks on the street. As I'm driving up the road I notice taillights near my driveway. When I pass, it's him, sitting in his car, waiting for me. I instantly got a horrible feeling and decided to leave. I tried to make a uturn, but didn't make it. As I put my car in reverse, I hear him floor it. He t-boned my little car with his big truck and he didn't let off the gas. He literally pushed my car, then drove up his driveway.\n\nI was in complete shock, called 911 and texted my sister and BIL telling them what happened. 911 dispatch told me to leave, but I couldn't. My sister and BIL were there within minutes, unfortunately the police took like 45 minutes to get there. While we were waiting, he came down on foot and began telling me how much he wanted to feel his knife \"popping through my skin and feel my warm blood between his fingers\". He ends up rushing me, grabbing me by my upper bicepts/shoulders, lifting me in the air and slamming my head into my car over and over, knocking me out. My BIL drew his gun on him, the neighbor dropped me and turned his back then ran home.\n\nThe police arrived and finally got him. The scariest part to me is I'm glad he wasn't thinking straight, because the gate by my horse was cut down still. If he was thinking straight, he would have waited for me by my horse and I would have been alone. If it weren't for my family, he would have killed me that night.\n\nOh, and he is out of jail already. If you're ever in a shitty situation, do NOT settle for a court appointed DA. They sucked, he had a great lawyer who was able to get the attempted murder charges dropped so all he got was felony hit and run, served one year and now has 4 years of probation.",

My mom was gone for a couple of days, and my brother was simply out at the moment. I was about to take a shower, but was sitting on the toilet on my phone, while the water was running. The toilet was right next to the door, and the bathroom was in a back part of the house, near the back door\n\nI heard the closet next to the bathroom open, and someone walk out of it. I texted my brother that someone was in the house, briefly described the situation, and told him to call 911. I didn\u2019t want to get up, or do anything, in fear of the intruder thinking I was aware of their presence. The intruder was clearly in the kitchen, which was right next to the bathroom. I heard him walk to the kitchen, and stop there. \n\nTears rolling down my cheeks, I was thinking about three things at once: My life, possible weapons, how could I escape. In reality I was only considering thinking about the last two, and was mentally and physically frozen. \n\nLuckily within 10 minutes a bunch of police came and took the guy by surprise. What terrified second most was who he actually was. My neighbour from 4 houses down, who was discovered to be a rapist of not only adult men+women but also children. I hadn\u2019t ever meet him, but he and my mom occasionally talked. At the moment he had a knife in his possession.\n\nThe scariest part came a few moments after I heard the police come. They knocked on the bathroom door, after arresting the guy, calling out my name(which my brother must\u2019ve told them) and told me to come out. I went to unlock the bathroom door, and exit, after putting my clothes on, but discovered something which gave me nightmares for years to come. I had forgot to lock the bathroom door\n\nFor the next 2 years I sought weekly therapy sessions, and had PTSD.

            "So clearly I was too young to remember myself, but this is a story that has been told to me 100 times by my parents and the babysitter that night. They waited until I was about 11 to tell me but I still cried all night in fear after I found out.\nMy mom and dad lived in an old prewar apartment in NY when I was a baby. They experienced a lot of weird supernatural events that could also be explained away by the old building - to an extent. \n\nLike my mother had a battle over a window with it. It seemed every time she opened it, the next time she would come into the room the window would be shut. You figure old house, maybe the window is just sliding out of place, right? This goes on for a long time, her opening the window to find it shut the next time she saw it, until she shoved a stick under the window to keep it up. When she went back to the kitchen she heard the sound of shattering glass, came back and the window was just broken to pieces, she says with glass inside and outside the building. Couldn\u2019t find anything that could have done it.\n\nThings start to escalate, and my parents tell me after that, the \u2018thing\u2019 was fixated on me. Suddenly it was the window in the nursery that wouldn\u2019t stay open. Then the door to the nursery would swing open. My dad swears he keeps seeing my mom go in there when she\u2019s not on that side of the apartment.\n\nLater my mom and dad go to the movies and leave my aunt to babysit. They\u2019ve been telling her what they\u2019ve been seeing and she doesn\u2019t believe it/ wants to see for herself. \n\nIt\u2019s cool for the first part of the evening, until she puts me to bed for the night, and she sees the shadow, and the open door. Sneaks up with whatever she could grab thinking it was an intruder, but nothing. She takes me from the crib and I sleep in her arms because she\u2019s too paranoid to take her eyes off me until she hears the front door unlocking and the chatter of my parents in the kitchen. She meets them relieved, she needs to get out of this apt cause she\u2019s scared - only to find that NO ONE IS THERE! My parents weren\u2019t home for an hour but she swears it was their voices - she knows her brothers voice, and my mom was her best friend. She never babysat me again lol",

            "My dad has too many true ones that really freak me out. Some of these sound ridiculous, but I swear that they're real. I'll tell the summed up versions to try and keep it short. \n\nOne of my uncle's is mentally disabled. As a kid in the 70s, he went missing. Everyone in the neighborhood was out looking for him. They checked his favorite places, like the park, near friends houses, by the school, and just couldn't find him. My dad (one of eight kids btw) was with another one of his brothers when they found him. He was at his favorite park that they'd already checked twice that was tucked away in a wooded area. He was sitting on one of those springy horses you rock back and forth on as it started getting dark outside. No one knows where he went for sure. \n\nMy dad would read to his blind neighbor after school when he was about ten years old. She lived with her son and was well into her 90s, but loved having my dad's company. She fell down and broke her hip one day, so he couldn't see her for a long time. When he did go see her,cage was sitting in her soiled diaper, looked fragile, and was covered in bruises. Her son was abusing her. One day there was an ambulance in front of her house and she was taken away. Her son had been sexually abusing her as well, but the reason she was taken was because he grabbed her forearm during a struggle and degloved her. She survived for a while longer and my dad got to see her with her bandaged arm and talk to her one last time. Rest her soul. \n\nMy dad was a teenager and was offered some money to rough up some kids with his brother. The neighbor wanted them to give the kids messing with his lawn a tough time, so he took the money and they gave them a beating. My dad regrets this of course because they were just kids and even though they didn't really hurt them, he knows he shouldn't have done it. That doesn't excuse his behavior by any means. He knows it was the WRONG thing to do. He was a kid himself, but there are no excused for it. Once they're nearly done messing with these kids (two brothers) they hear sirens. My dad and uncle take off and hide in the bushes. It was an ambulance and it pulled up in front of those kids house. The cops and firefighters followed closely behind, but it was too late. They watched as they eventually took away a body covered in a white sheet. The brothers my dad and uncle brat up lost their mother that day. She died of heart failure on the toilet. That has to be the worse day of their lives. So yeah, not really scary in the traditional sense, but horrifying and really shows you that you should always do the right thing and definitely not beat up kids for money because life has worse things to offer everyone and it's free to be kind.",
            "At the hospital I work at they had this big room that was like a giant dish washer for tables and stuff like that. The door was broken so they had propped it open with a board.  When a young employee was put a table in there to be cleaned the board slipped and it shut while she was in there and started the scolding hot water.  A few minutes passed and finally someone found her banging on the door to get out.  Her entire body was that dark pinkred like a lobster.  \n\nShe was conscious for a bit in the trauma room saying she had just got home from her honeymoon before they put her on a breathing vent.  She died later that night.  Hospital got big ass fines and I'm sure a very substantial settlement to the husband \n\nSame Hospital years apart a young woman was getting into an elevator and the door closed on her half in and out. Then the elevator started going up with her like that. She wasn't ripped in half or anything but it broke some bones and organs.

I wasn't there (thank god) but my house mate had to deal with everything alone. \n\nIt was midnight on a Friday and she was expecting her boyfriend, so when the door bell went she ran to open it. Thankfully when she got to the door, she could hear a group of men talking so paused, but she had alerted them to being home. \n\nShe went back to her room to get a look out the window and there was about 4 men at the door. They started knocking violently and demanding to be let in. One of them revealed their identity as being the previous owner and wanted to come in. \n\nThey were persistent and she really thought they were going to get in. They even got in the back yard and tried getting in the back door. She wouldn't call the police as knew her partner and his dad (really tough guys) were due any time and would probably be quicker. \n\nThe most freaky thing about this is they had a key! she could hear them use a key for both doors. Thankfully we had changed the locks, but imagine if we hadn't. The house was in a remote location with no neighbours, anything could have happened to her. We all moved out not long later as didn't feel safe. \n\nA police report was filed but nothing ever came off it. I always change the locks in a new property now",
            "One time my girlfriend at the time (soon to be wife) and I were driving back to my house when we were in high-school after a date night. My road is a dead end road with a lot of woods behind my house and a large field in front of it. Just before the large field is a small area of woods thats about 100 meters from my house (on the left). We were probably about 30m from the wooded outcropping when a seemingly solid black bi-pedal creature comes darting across the road (to the right). The weird part was how fast it moved. Before we could get close it had traveled all the way across my yard to the woods behind it which is about 200 meters without stopping. Every time we visit my parents at night  we both shudder when driving past. The way it moved was so unreal.\n\nEdit: Wow! Lots of responses. Glad to get this out there because its an experience we both like to share when discussing stuff like this. Some of you are saying wild boar or bear. The area I live in has neither of those animals. The thing moved so quickly on seemingly two legs, I just don't see it feasibly being an animal that usually travels on four legs. As far as the meth man goes...highly plausible for this area lmao.",

I think it did this two or three times. \n\nMy father was touring it with some other dealers and the job foreman. Dad was at the back of the line, the foreman at the front. They were in the attics, having just completed a long section. The foreman turns the corner to the short, and as he turns to the next section, stops dead in his track and says \"That is SO wrong.\" \n\nDad takes a minute to get there, by that time all the other dealers were staring down this long attic.

She sat on her bed and began reading a book as she waited for the bottle to heat up & suddenly fell asleep.

My mom wakes up after hearing the fire department inside, they got her out and she told them to go back inside because her baby was in there. They brought me out with the oxygen mask on and everything.

She thinks he was planning on murdering her. Luckily she had her backpack still with her and the dude wasnt very good in chaining her, so she escaped from the chains, took her laptop, send facebook messages to people she met in australia that she was captured etc. She chained herself back up, but she knew one of her friends calledthe police. Police found her, she's safe but fucking traumatized of course. \n\n2: another friend of mine had a really bad traffic accident. He was riding his bike in the bike lane, next to a big truck. He was in the bind spot of the truck, fell under the truck, was dragged 600m down with the truck, his face scraped on the asphalt, lost his eye, lost a lot of skin from his arms (so much one needed to be amputated and the other only the fingers were amputated) but what makes it extra scary is just that he was FULLY CONSCIOUS the whole time. Like having your face being scraped away on the asphalt fully conscious. He made it tho. He lost an eye, an arm and some fingers, but mentally he is okay. Its a miracle\n\nEdit: wow thanks for the award :o",

The main river near where I live has a really scary, but kind of cool feature... there is an underground channel that runs directly below the river for about a quarter of a mile, with both ends opening to the river floor. The only reason anyone even knows it exists is because during the right tides, you can see a whirlpool on one end, and a huge boil of water on the other.\n\nMy buddy and I went to our local university and spoke with a geological surveyor, and found that they had a detailed map of the tunnel, taken by video and ultrasound. The narrowest is got was around 5 feet, and it was smooth bedrock along the walls.\n\nWe decided this was too cool to pass up,, and decided to give it a shot. We had a crew in a boat topside with safety ropes and emergency O2 tanks, and left right at the beginning of slack tide before it started coming back in. That way, worst case we would have almost no current against us if we needed to head back out.\n\nWe headed down i to the tunnel, and about 200 yards in, saw a wedged tree limb with a bunch of garbage stuck to it. When we got closer, we saw that garbage was 2 small skeletons.\n\nOur adventurous spirit led us to find the missing bodies of 2 10 years olds that had gone missing 4 years prior.",

Now they were at a place where there was some sort of a cliff/chasm, maybe a view of some sort.. The older boy was probably just being a kid, I'm not sure how exactly it happened, but in an unguarded moment he somehow stumbled over the edge. The dad immediately reached over to grab him and pull him back up, and as he was leaning over, the backpack he had his other son in threw him off balance and he tipped over... They all fell to their deaths, father and his two sons; mother was left completely alone.\n\nIt's the most horrifying story I've ever heard. Just writing it makes my stomach curl.

            "Shadowing a paramedic one time we picked up a guy that fell off a skate ramp and hit his head. When we got there he was kinda out of it but talking/walking, pupils were okay, and starting to get a good black eye/bruised forehead and mild concussion we thought. He almost refused the ride to the hospital and was well enough at that moment (or so it seemed) to do so. Luckily we convinced him to get checked out just in case. On the approximately 10 minute ride to the hospital things changed a smidge. We noticed his blood pressure dropping fast, then he started throwing up large amounts of blood, breathing got sketchy and he needed to be intubated, then he started losing consciousness and was barely breathing by the time we got to the ER.\n\nTurned out we made a big error in the initial assessment, normally you'd press on his forehead and cheek to see if there was pain or anything amiss, we didn't because it was obviously banged up and would have caused a lot of pain...had we done that we would have known to get him to the hospital asap because we would have felt a bunch of squishiness where his forehead and eye socket were, they were crushed into pieces. Normally you'd expect a ton of blood for a head injury like that, but instead of an obvious wound, it had all been draining down his throat and into his stomach.\n\nAfter emergency surgery and several more surgeries he made a full recovery. Interestingly they found and removed a tumor in his brain, so in a way it was good he fell because it might have been too late by the time it started causing problems. Crazy thing is had he been wearing a helmet it likely would have been just a mild concussion.",

            "*I posted this comment once on an askreddit about the best \u201cfuck it I\u2019ll do it myself\u201d moment in history, but I think the tale of the Agent Garbo, the double agent whose real name was Juan Pujol Garcia, applies here too. He trolled Hitler and the Nazi regime so fucking hard it boggles the mind, and he didn\u2019t merely get away with it - he was given an Iron Cross by them.*\n\nOkay, so it\u2019s time for me to talk about Juan Pujol Garcia.\n\nA hotel clerk and former unsuccessful chicken farmer was frustrated with the fascist government of spain. And Germany\u2019s warmongering was getting scary - France had fallen, the USSR and USA were both neutral so far, and only Britain was left to stand against the nazis.\n\nAs he said years later, he believed he had to do something for the good of humanity. Even though, by all accounts, he was a nobody - just a hotel clerk and failed chicken farmer, who\u2019d briefly served on both sides of the spanish civil war, leaving with a dislike of Fascism and Communism both.\n\nSo Juan, naturally, decided to become a spy, and fuck over Hitler as hard as he could. Logical career move for a hotel clerk, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. But the british, who he wanted to help, weren\u2019t interested - he\u2019d asked to help at the embassy in madrid several times. The brits were all like \u201cwho are you? Actually never mind we don\u2019t care you can\u2019t do shit to help us and we don\u2019t really trust you, so scram.\u201d\n\nJuan, of course, was undeterred. He decided that the nazis had to be destroyed, and he figured if would be easier to do so from within. So he reinvents himself as a fanatically fascist government official and applies to \u201chelp\u201d the germans spy on the brits, claiming he has a way to actually get undercover to britain to spy on them. All of this is utter bullshit, of course.\n\nThe germans say \u201cuh sure we could use the help,\u201d and hire him. Since he can\u2019t get to britain, he goes to lisbon portugal, frequenting the library to learn about britain so he can convincingly just Make Shit Up. He sends the German navy on a wild goose chase for a nonexistent naval convoy at the Mediterranean island of Malta. The germans are convinced he\u2019s the best spy they have in britain. After all, the rest of them keep getting captured, except for the ones Garcia is recruiting. Or, rather, inventing. His recruits were as real as the maltese convoy, which is to say, not even a little real. They did make good fall guys to blame when his \u201cintel\u201d was off.\n\nThe brits meanwhile are looking for him, since the german codes they were breaking showed the germans allegedly had a spy setting up a spy ring in britain. But then they read his messages - Juan allegedly had a scottish contact who \u201cwould do anything for a litre of wine\u201d\n\nThat tipped the brits off that someone was just fucking with German intel. I mean, metric system, anyone? A scotsman who drinks WINE?! unrealistic.\n\nSo eventually the lisbon british embassy tipped off MI6 that this guy in lisbon was trying to tell them he was literally a german intelligence agent and would like to help fight the nazis please.\n\nSo they brought him to britain, and gave him the codename Agent Garbo. He teamed up with mI6 where he continued to bullshit the nazis with a combination of pure lies, true but useless intel, and useful intel that arrived just a bit too late to help the germans at all.\n\nHe convinced the germans D-Day was a feint, not the main allied invasion. That would come farther east at Calais, he convinced the germans. The First US Army Group led by General Patton would lead it.\n\nThe first US army group was made of divisions that didn\u2019t exist, in an empty base, with inflated fake tanks and airplanes to convince german planes flying above dover think it was legit.\n\nThe Germans kept a large number of troops and tank divisions back at calais, to repel an invasion force which never landed. These troops could have stopped the allied landings at Normandy. Instead they sat at Calais, doing nothing.\n\nThe Germans gave Pujol the Iron Cross 2nd class for his essential aid to the nazi regime. The British government soon after made him a Member of the Order of the British empire.\n\nHis German spy handler gave him his iron cross in person after the war, apologizing profusely for failing to win the war he\u2019d helped them so much with.\n\nI imagine it was difficult to keep a straight face for that conversation.\n\nTLDR: failed chicken farmer from spain wages personal war of lies against nazi germany and wins.",

            "\uf90a\u6cf0\u5ec9 or Kim Tae Yum. This ancient  histtoric Korean conman only shows up in Japanese history books for he was not an important man in Korean history at the time. After almost century after Korean unification under Shilla, Japan and Korea had strained relationship due to Shilla kingdom destroying Japan's ally Bakjae. In March of 752 it is written that Kim and his entourage of 300 ppl came over by Kyushu claiming that he is a prince.3 months later  he has an audience with Empress in Nara claiming Shilla wants to forge an relationship with Japan and he has brought gifts for the Empress and the rest of court. He compared the Empress' status to that of Tang emperor and did a lot of lip service to please Japanese government. He claimed that he was a royal servant of Japan and according to customs Empress had to pay the Koreans their lodgings... But here was the catch: he did not present them with emissary letter containing Shilla's seal. Of course the Japanese get little suspicious but after assuring them he will show the official seal next year... Kim left Japan on July. Believing Kim's false promises the Empress brought emissary on Feburary of 753 who were denied access to the palace. Matter of fact many historians assume that Korean monarch at the time was in early 30s making almost impossible to have a grown up son!   Enraged at amount of money they have spent on the conman and the fact they were duped Japanese ppl threw that Empress out of her throne and attempted to attack Korea in 732. This probably will be hidden in flood of comments but I thought it was something interesting to share lol\n\nEdit: I am not sure if this man is in English wikipedia but when copy and pasting his name in Google yields a lot of Japanese and Korean primary resources.\n\nEdit 2: I made a serious typo lol.They planned invasion in 762 not 732",

About thirty seconds later the rest of the men hear a single rifle shot. \"Bloody hell, he's done it\" said the instructor.\n\nAnother thirty seconds pass then the soldier reappears back from behind the shed and tells the instructor \"I tried to shoot myself Sarge but I only went and missed again.\"",

She shows me what love is. \n\nAbout 12 years ago my father was deported and left behind 5 kids. I being 12, was the oldest... With both parents being immigrants it wasn\u2019t always easy to find houses to live in or find jobs. My father was they only source of income so when he got deported we really did not know what to expect. I saw a side of my mom I never knew existed. She started selling tamales and working a few jobs here and there just to make ends meet. We had to live in a garage, we had to live in a single room, try putting 6 people in a single room. Through it all my mother never complained and I never saw her cry. We suffered for years and still do, but not as much compared to back then. I work and help out as much as I can and now 2 of my siblings work and help her out. But regardless she is still working 6 days a week and so am I. \nThis is what having a loving parent is like. A parent who will go through hell just to make ends meet. Always showing us love no matter how hard it got.",

            "I feel bad because from the phraseology of this question it sounds like you don't, but I'm not going to lie to you, it's incredible.\n\nI was born to two loving parents who waited until they were well-off financially to have children. The only struggle I've ever had in my life is with depression (genetic/hereditary, nothing I can really do about it). I'm in college now, my parents pay for my expensive university with all their heart, they go out of their way to do little things to make me happy. My mom will surprise me with take out from my favorite restaurant, my dad will surprise me with basketball tickets or take me to see a movie. We have \"arguments\" but its 99% of the time over little things that we don't remember 10 minutes later, and it rarely happens. We operate as a family, make decisions as a family. Like every important decision I make is not all on me, its as a family, so it's low risk, high reward. A big part of parents being loving is parents being responsible, and my parents have always been responsible adults. I think its a special kind of cruel when a child loses the strong image of parents, or they never had it in the first place. I view my parents as strong figures, anchors. They have their moments of weakness but overwhelmingly are always strong.  \n\nI only hope to continue this and be an even better parent to my eventual kids.",

She's a 3rd generation Italian immigrant and grew up on The Hill, St. Louis's Italian neighborhood. She kept us (my brother, sister and I) in line and was never very sentimental, but she always cared for us and stuck up for us.\n\nMy dad is one of 6 siblings. He's the second oldest. He is a very caring, sentimental guy. He's 62 and retired now, but he worked as an information technology project manager for Anheuser Busch and made good money.\n\nThey both provided well for us, gave us what we needed and were fair in their discipline when they needed to be. I realize at my age now that they sacrificed a lot along the way - taking us to soccer and baseball games, dropping us off and picking us up from school every day, dealing with our being whiny and annoying, all kinds of stuff. I suppose I really did have the sort of classic, American dream childhood and I think I've always taken it for granted.\n\nWhat was it like, OP asks? It was nice. It was comfortable when it needed to be and challenging when appropriate. I live on my own now and I'm going over to see them for Father's Day today. I may mention a word of thanks for giving me a pretty nice life.",

I grew up in a quite racist household with parents that only did things that were interesting to them, even though I repeatedly said I did not want to do them. My father for the majority of my life made a \"joke\" that he was out of town, whenever anything related to me came up, good, bad, or neutral. I have no interest in speaking to either of my parents, although my mom calls about once every couple of weeks and tells me, that I am not being fair to them and that I need to let the past go.  I have come to dislike my parents and cannot remember a time when I felt mutual respect.\n\nSO's parents are not perfect, there are several times that there have been disagreements but I have never not felt mutual respect. They are willing to ask for their childs, and my, help when needed, they try to plan outings that include all of us and make significant effort to understand. I have found in her parents what I always wanted from mine.",

            "The feeling of acceptance, understanding, and security.\nAlso the immense knowing that they will do anything for you, even if it means that they go through hell.\n\nMy father and mother escaped from communist countries (Poland and Vietnam), and nearly died during it. Upon arriving they worked many jobs and went through hell in order to give us a good upbringing. My father owns a pizza shop, and in its early days he worked from 8am-3am, usually not being able to sleep beacuse of the stress of knowing that if something goes wrong, his family will starve. At the worst of it (that I know of), he had to set up a mattress at the back of the store, and slept there so he knew that it would be okay.\n\nMy parents have been through hell and back for us, and will in the future if they need to, nevertheless they gave us enough attension and love.\n\nOne of the biggest thing for me is trust, I trust them, and they do trust me. We have a mutual respect.",
            "My parents are very understanding of the fact that teens needed to be able to be teens. My friends and I make a lot of dirty jokes and in general tend to be really loud. We like to play games like CAH (typical teen stuff). I\u2019m always afraid that my parents will judge me or overhear us talking about these things, but they never mind. During my birthday party I went back upstairs to bring down some drinks and apologized to my dad for the noise. He looked at me, with the kindest look I\u2019ve ever seen him give and said, \u201cdon\u2019t apologize, you\u2019re fine.\u201d Later my mom started talking about how teens just needed a place to be teens, and they told me after the party that they had been cracking up at some of the stuff they had overheard from the basement. I appreciate this so much in them. The level of trust that they have in me is great. I couldn\u2019t be more thankful to have such understanding parents.",

It took me 6 years to get my degree because I was working full time. Mum and dad would come over during exam weeks and cook me dinner or do my washing, just because they knew how stressed I was. When I had a miscarriage (ectopic so I had to stay in hospital a little while), they dropped in daily with food, toiletries, etc for both my husband and I. They have supported me financially over the years (they are in no way \u201cwell off\u201d) like when my washing machine broke, they bought me a second hand one even though they actually needed a new machine themselves.

            "Being a child development major your parents really affect your attachment. Having loving parents make you more secure in not having to search for love and acceptance in all the wrong places. Growing up with loving parents just means that you can value yourself and love yourself. Chances are it means you have better relationships with other people in your life. Why? Because loving parents aren\u2019t perfect but they probably know how to apologize and make amends, and thus you learn from them. They\u2019re loving so as a child when you make mistakes although their can be consequences they still love you and show you that it\u2019s not you (the child) who is bad it\u2019s the mistake you made that was bad so don\u2019t worry you\u2019re still loved immensely. When you grow up you\u2019re able to make mistakes and know that you did something wrong but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there\u2019s anything wrong with you. Also having loving parents means you have less of a chance to stay in toxic/abusive relationships because you know what Love is because you\u2019ve shared it with your parents. When a parent  who is supposed to love you mistreats you, you may know that you\u2019re being mistreated but you still haven\u2019t experienced love and you might not be able to distinguish it in future relationships (romantic or platonic) as a child and an adult. \n\nMy personal thoughts/experiences about this is having or not having loving parents is deeply rooted in emotion. I believe that those who grow up with loving parents are typically more mature in how they communicate their emotions compared to those who don\u2019t. In college I\u2019ve been told that in times of stress we revert back to what \u201cwe know\u201d (meaning our parents). So in my opinion children with loving parents have a higher chance of not lashing out or having meltdowns when they have to communicate their emotions. Those \u201cI statements.\u201d \u201cI felt sad when I heard you say that,\u201d vs. \u201cWTF is wrong with you.\u201d Granted in the moment people may react differently but after everything sinks in and you calm down are you able to simply state what that horrible thing that happened made you feel like? Or do you blow up again and become accusatory, do you shut down and have to leave, so you want to never speak of it again and forget it ever happened and move on? Because you still haven\u2019t said what it is that you felt. I think loving parents promote communication and expressing how you feel and I don\u2019t know that many loving parents necessarily allow that. And because of that I don\u2019t see how you could obtain that skill of discussing your emotions properly if you grew up not being allowed to really do so/do properly.",

            "It\u2019s like being on a team for life. \n\nWhatever decisions I make, I know I have their support 100%. They genuinely only want for you to be happy. They never push you into anything, but always discuss the options with you and are ready to help you with whatever choice you make. \n\nI\u2019ve always felt respected and listened to. I\u2019m never dismissed or belittled or mocked. I know I have their support for life. It\u2019s like a security blanket. \n\nOne thing that really shows it to me was after a fight. When I was a kid and we had a fight and yelled, it would end in apologising to each other for yelling, and them explaining their reasoning. I\u2019ve never been made to feel like my feelings aren\u2019t valid or don\u2019t matter, and that\u2019s something incredibly important to me now. I think parents often can be dismissive of their kids because they\u2019re just kids, and they don\u2019t realise how much that can undermine somebody\u2019s confidence and communication skills for life.",

If she ever doubted my ability to succeed at something, she never let me know. This is something I took for granted before having friends and partners who did not get that kind of support at home. I can\u2019t imagine how shitty it would be to get your dreams crushed by your parents, or to feel that you can\u2019t live up to their expectations.",
            "Honestly, I wouldn't know. Growing up, I realized my family was very different. My parents were divorced, and my mom was mentally ill but functional. My dad remarried. My mom ended up having lots of boyfriends. \n\nWe weren't high priority for either parent and were supposed to fit into their lives at their convenience and on top of that, both parents tried to turn us against the other parent. Basically, we were only valuable as pawns or targets, whatever suited at the time.\n\nNeither parent wanted to actually parent us. We were the cast offs from a failed bitter relationship and that's pretty much how we were treated.\n\nSo as an adult, I ended up with a severe mental illness related to being able to form attachments to people and it's taken years and years of therapy and medication changes to get to where I am now. \n\nNeither of my parents acknowledged their part regarding my severe mental illness and swore they didn't remember. They remember how much they spent on us and that's good enough for them.\n\nI stopped talking to my parents years ago. \n\nSo here's to me: happy father's day, self!

            "My dad gave me a piece of furniture one time. When I got it home, a post-it note which had been stuck to the bottom floated down to the floor. I picked it up, and in my dad's unmistakable handwriting were various notes about gay personal ads he'd been responding to -- details about the other guys. Their names and ages and sexual interests, the status of their conversations, etc. My dad was, at least I thought, very straight. I put two and two together and realized this piece of furniture was from an apartment he kept briefly while he and my stepmom were on the outs for about a year. None of this bothered me one bit, but I got the distinct impression that my stepmom (an older, very conservative lady) would have NOT been cool with any of this... I let him go to his grave without ever telling him.",

He stepped outside a bar one night on a rainy day to get more smokes from his car (this was back when you could smoke inside) and saw one guy kneeling on the ground holding another dude face down in a pothole puddle and the other guy thrashing wildly. He said that instinct took over and he just ran up and kicked the attacker in the head as hard as he could, knocking him out. He sat with the victim until he left to make sure the dude was ok and didn't try to murder the now unconscious attacker. Then he made an anonymous 911 call so that someone would tend to the unconscious guy and left.\n\nHe said it was the creepiest thing he ever just walked in on and he never went back to that bar again.",

I get to his house and before I get a chance to knock, I can hear people having sex. It was so ridiculously over the top, I thought it was his dad watching porn. I could hear the woman saying stupid shit like \"fuck my ass with your huge cock\". Just screaming. The dude was like \"yeaahhh. Take it baby. Whooooee.\" It was hilarious. Anyway, I figured his dad was watching porn, so instead of knocking, I waited in my car for a bit. My buddy shows up and asks what I'm waiting for. I told him I think his dad is jerking off in the living room because I can hear the porn. He's like ffs.

It was about a coup some of the directors were organizing against the CEO and owner of the business to remove them from their positions.\n\nI found out 9 months before it became public knowledge when the owner sent out an email stating he was leaving. What i didnt know when i read the original email was that the coup caused a rift in one of the interstate offices that resulted in 60% of the staff to leave in that office.\n\nThen of course last year I got sent an email with everyone's salaries on it. Found out I was severely getting underpaid so will use it for my upcoming performance review.",

            "My mom was going through severe menstrual bleeding most of my childhood. I would find blood-soaked pads under the beds because she never got any privacy and bled so much, she had to change them every hour. As she worked two jobs and held a family of five together. Eventually, a neighbor who was a doctor suggested to my dad that my mom was not \u201cfair\u201d (a positive attribute in my culture) but pale and possibly dying. She had a hysterectomy the following month but dad left his mom to look after her. Grandma shooed my brother and I out of the bedroom where we were playing next to mom but we sneaked to the window above. Seeing the bandages and the blood and the pain she was in took all the childhood out of both of us. We have never spoken of it since.",

We found out that there is this really cool feature that lets you see all your orders from the past. We went through some of our early orders, which included some books I got for Christmas as a kid, a kindle, the elf on the shelf we had, my elementry math books, ect. It was so cool to go down memory lane.... and then.... we found out about the archive feature. Intrigued as to what we possibly could have archived on amazon, we clicked it. There was only one item, a 1 star rated pocket pu\\*\\*y in october of 2019, right before our family vacation to Disney. My dad is the only male in our family, so there is no questioning who bought the toy, nor its intended purpose.",

            "About a decade ago someone placed a hidden camera in the living room of an apartment occupied by two middle-aged gents. Everytime one of them moved around the camera took a picture and sent it to MY email. To this day I have no idea who these men were. I used my 1998 pinging skills and determined they were somewhere in France (I live in US). For a while I felt scared to interfere, maybe it was a mafia thing? or something I didn't want to be involved in!\n\nThe camera was hidden in some type of clock and I think it was logitech. I think it may have been sitting on a mantle because it overlooked the living room and a wall with three doors. Two of the door were these mens bedrooms and the other one was the bathroom. Many pictures were sent to me of them getting up to take a piss in their whitie tighties in the middle of the night. Others were of them drinking red wine and watching TV. \n\nI waiting a couple days, thinking at some point maybe the person who set up the camera would figure out they weren't getting their emails and change the email. Nope. Eventually I called the company and made them stop sending the pictures.\n\nThe men never did anything but sleep, eat, drink wine, and watch TV.\n\nEverything else is a mystery.",
            "As a teenager, I volunteered at the hospital. Free food plus scholarship money, and a foot in the door if I later wanted a job there during college. I had a few jobs: prepare paperwork for triage, get paperwork from the fileroom to the ER, and give that paperwork to whoever was in charge.\n\nWe wore these goofy yellow vests, and we would run to the file room, get the xrays or their medical history, and run it back. Needless to say, this was before the internet. They were starting to install a pneumatic tube system, but for the time, I was a runner.\n\nWe got a call that there were 2 inbound in critical condition. We got the names and info. I took one, and my partner took the other. We got to the file room around the same time, and that's when I noticed I had a kid. Like 8 years old kid.\n\nFuck.\n\nI run mine back as they are arriving. When I get back to the ER, I see on the board that she arrived and was in a room. Of course there was a lot going on in that room, so I tried to get in and out. I went in right as they called \"code blue\".\n\nThis meant 2 things: her heart stopped, and the doors were closed. It was supposed to limit distractions I think, and if you wanted out, you had to enter a code (which I didn't have as a volunteer). So, as a 15 year old kid, I watched her die.\n\nI watched the nurse do CPR, I watched the doc use the defibrillator, and I heard him say the time of death. \n\nI wasn't supposed to be in there, it was a fluke. I was just a \"paper jocky\". \n\nThe drunk driver that hit her family's car was a few rooms over. He made it. \n\nThat was my last day."

We were on day 3 of our drive back from Yellowstone and had been on the road for almost two weeks in total. Funds were low, there was nothing left for another hotel that night. It was 11am, our calculations (pre-gps) had us home at about 1am. We looked at the map, saw the upcoming highway split and were debating between heading straight for I-80, or staying on I-90. 'Well, the last sign said 90 minutes to Chicago, may as well have a deep dish pizza for lunch. Plus, it looks like a more direct route.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMistakes were made.\n\nAt 3pm we had admitted defeat. There would be no lunch. The infinite traffic wouldn't allow for it. By 4pm my will was broken, I pulled the e-brake, opened my door, and walked from the middle lane to the ditch just after a bridge to relieve the pressure in my bladder. Shortly after we would say 'fuck this, lets just get off here', that too was a mistake. The signs were in Spanish, the route back to the highway eluded us, we weren't even sure what time zone we were in. We asked a guy at the corner at a red light, 'hey man, what time is it?'.

            "It was a secret until recently my mom told me. When she and my dad got divorced, things were very, very messy, and my dad would do shitty things to dodge paying for my care. He ended up owing my mom a couple thousand dollars, and my mom was ready to sue. But instead of getting the lawyers involved, and because she knew my dad was not a healthy person to be in my life, she offered him a deal- keep the money, but relinquish custody officially. I'd still get to see him if and when I wanted, but he would give up all legal rights as a guardian. Because he hated paying my mom THAT MUCH, he took 2k over me. Not a life-changing earth shattering secret, it's just revealing to know my dad values money more than me.\n\nBefore anybody casts judgement on my mom, my dad was (and probably is) a piece of human garbage who abused me and allowed me to be abused a few years after this, so I'm 1000% fine with my mom's decision.

We developed something resembling a positive relationship before he died. When he passed it absolutely destroyed me. I still remember the funeral. I had to be dragged kicking and screaming out of the car because I didn't want to see it. In his will he left me his car - a Camaro, that I was supposed to get when I turned 16. His parents fought tooth and nail to keep it from me (they were really shitty people, his entire side of the family was), and we eventually just told them to fuck off and keep the damn thing.\n\nFast-forward about 15 years. I find out the guy that died was not actually my dad - he was my brothers' dad. My real, biological dad has been living in the next town over, twenty minutes from my house, my entire life. My entire family knew about it, except for me. It was why my \"grandparents\" fought to keep the car - they knew I was not his son (I still don't know if HE knew or not, but I assume so).\n\nMy maternal grandmother has met him several times in my life. My mom said she never thought it was anything worth digging up. Said she intended for me to never find out.\n\nI've still never spoken to him. I know a name and an approximation of where he lives (as of about ten years ago). Beyond that, I know jack about the guy. Grandma said if I ever want to meet him, she would help me contact him. Dunno if I ever will.\n\nEdit 1: after laying all this out, and thinking more about it, there's no possible way the dead \"dad\" did not know I was not his kid.\n\nEdit 2: for everyone asking me about the lady asking if I'm her husband: no, I am not married.",

Turns out it was my half sister from bio dad. She and I are now FB friends but haven\u2019t met in person. I have no desire to meet bio. My actual dad that raised me is literally amazing. I could not have custom ordered a better father. My mom left him when I was 16 after cheating on him with a woman.

I don\u2019t know why but a paternity test was never done (or maybe it was and I\u2019ve never been told) but it explained why I felt so distant with my dad for the first 10 years of my life.

            "Not a parent but my parents held this secret away from me for a long time. When I was 3-4, my dad volunteered at a baseball park to shuttle people back and forth on a golf cart. Well one night he didn't come home til really late and I went to hi but stopped to see that he looked scared and distraught. He is normally a rough and tough kind of guy and has a big heart. So I asked him what was wrong, but he said nothing and that he was fine. I believed him and went to bed. I woke up the next morning to see that our cousin (who doubles has our babysitter) was at our house but neither of my parents were. I asked where they went and she said they went to the morning service of church and not the afternoon service. Again I believed her and never questioned any of it. Flash forward 10 years my mom told me what really happened. He was shuttling some guy back to the parking lot when the guy put a knife to my dads neck. He then proceeded to take my dad behind a dumpster and raped him. So when he got home he waited for everyone to go to sleep and then tried to kill himself by overdosing on painkillers. My mom woke up in the middle of the night, realizing that he wasn't in bed. She found him in the bathroom on the floor motionless and called 911 where was sent to the hospital where was treated. He is thankfully still doing strong. I don't know where I would've been without him.\n\n\nEdit: 1st, thanks for my 1st silver kind stranger\n2nd, thank you all for the support, he is doing a hell of a lot better and is back to is former self. I make sure to cherish my memories with him a lot more like hunting and fishing. Again thanks y'all, never expected this to blow up.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for my 1st gold as well kind stranger  \nFor those of you wondering, they never caught the rapist unfortunately.

He broke my nose, cheek, three teeth, four ribs, my damn soul. Months after, I found out I was pregnant by this. I have an unusual family dynamic. Call it \"close but distant.\" I was so far down in the depths of despair. I lost my job. I avoided everyone. When I found out about the pregnancy, I was encouraged to terminate. I gave it serious consideration. I personally don't believe in abortion, but there I was contemplating it...\n\nI couldn't do it. I decided to carry to term and put the baby up for adoption. So, the time came, and I delivered a baby girl - completely alone. She was born a month early and spent some time in the NICU. In that time I worked closely with an adoption agency and signed them custody so that if she were released she'd go to one of their foster homes until I made my final decision on a family for an open adoption...\n\nI couldn't do it. It was love at first sight. Caught a glimpse of her while recovering from the C-section. Now she is playing on the floor beside me as I write this with tears stinging my cheeks. I broke down and told my sister-in-law a week after I gave birth and realized I didn't want to just let her go. My sister-in-law helped me break the news to my folks and helped to provide essentials to welcome her home. My daughter didn't ask for this any more than I did. I had all of these irrational fears: that I'd resent her. That I'd look at her and not see her face, but his. That I would not be able to bond with her or even love her. Well, I've had some extremely trying days. Mostly in the very beginning. I still have doubts about whether or not I am the best equipped for this, but I've been seeing a PTSD/trauma specialist and that's helped me to cope.\n\nAs I mentioned, she\u2019s almost three now and she is the most beautiful little girl with such a good disposition. A true joy to be with. She's the best thing I've ever done and probably saved my life. We're getting by, us against the world. I think I\u2019ll eventually tell her but just thinking about it brings so much anxiety. All I can say, is that I chose love. I chose her despite the circumstances and I was blessed with a tiny miracle - a light in a very dark abyss. So, only a few family and select couple of friends know about her and even fewer know the circumstances. It\u2019s very cathartic to let it all out after holding it in for so long. The biggest challenge is making peace. I\u2019ve wished a million times over it didn\u2019t happen to me but if it didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have her.",

            "When I was a child, maybe 7 or 8, my brother and I had to go to a child psych doctor. The doctor asked questions about if we had been touched here or there. I wasn't sure what was happening but I knew something terrible had happened but couldn't put it together at 7 or 8. Later on when I was about 18 or 19 I was talking to my aunt about the weird memory and she told me that my cousin had been caught with a bunch of child porn, he was probably 16 or 17 at the time we went. My aunt told me my couson had molested my little brother and his brother. This incendent has never been brought up, just the one time my aunt told me. My brother hasnt told me and I wont ask him. It's just there, lingering in the background of our family. Crazy though, that cousin used to baby sit us all the time and my mother is close to him and still let him come around us after the incident.",
            "One of my teachers told our class a story that absolutely blew everyone's mind. Growing up he had an older sister, and two parents, pretty standard family situation. One thing that he said confused him as a kid was how much older his sister was (I think it was like 16+ years older than him) so when he was in high school, he straight up asked his parents if he was a mistake. If im remembering the story right, his parents told him he wasn't meant to happen and that was that. Didn't really effect him at all considering he was old enough to understand and knew his parents loved him anyway. Fast forward to his adult life (about 35-40 at this point) both of his parents passed away and his sister lived across the country. One year his sister came to visit him and his wife for a week. They went around doing various things that were representative of where he lived, landmarks, well known towns, restaurants, etc. He said they had a great time. Near the end of his sister's trip, she told my teacher and his wife that she needed to tell them something important. He said she seemed pretty distraught in saying this and as a result he thought she was going to tell them she had some serious illness or something along those lines. It was tense for a few minutes, the sister couldn't get out what she was trying to say. This just made my teacher and his wife more concerned. Finally she told them: \"I'm not actually your sister, I'm your mother.\" Turns out his \"parents\" were actually his grandparents and his sister had him very young (16-17) with some guy she met. In order to give him and his mother (\"sister\") a normal life, his grandparents (\"parents\") just treated him as their son and raised him themselves. He mentioned being very grateful that they did this for him as he did have a normal childhood and his mother was able to live without having the stress of being a young mother. To this day, him and his mother have a very positive relationship and this reveal to him didn't change anything. Not really a \"fucked up secret\" but I thought it was a cool story that fit this theme :)",

She knows I was engaged but did not get married until I met her.  She doesn't know I made a baby girl with that former fiance though, and I'll never tell.  Just like I'll never tell anyone that the baby died of a fever after just six weeks of her beautiful life.  This is the part of my story where my wife believes that \"it just didn't work out\" and that \"she got really crazy.\"  The truth is, we were both destroyed as people and neither of us could continue our lives together.  We quickly grew to resent and hate each other and lashed out against the world and ourselves in horrible fashion.\n\nNoone from that past still has a connection with me, barring my brother who has faithfully kept my secret for twenty years.  My parents passed on before they really got to know my wife.  My friends and the rest of my family from that time have all long since been separated geographically and by time.  The former fiance hasn't spoken to me since and now lives in a different hemisphere.  To my knowledge, she has never dated again, but she did finish school and start a career.  I hope she is happy.\n\nMy kids don't need to know they have a half-sister in a little grave in a town 1900kms away.  They don't need to know that their father sees her face in theirs every day.

You all know those words don\u2019t really do anything. But I am sorry. It\u2019s an awful thing to lose a parent. A word of advice. Remember everything. Don\u2019t make them out to be a saint. My dad was an angry guy, he fucked up sometimes, he snapped too fast, he made mistakes. But that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t love me any less or that he wasn\u2019t a great dad. It means that he was human. Every mistake he made was a lesson for me then or a lesson for the future if I ever have my own kids. Appreciate the good and the bad.

            "I wish I could say I'd phrase out investing in bitcoin like others, but ultimately I'd tell myself\n\nFloor, call 911.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom was asleep on the couch when I was 16, I woke up in the middle of the night and she had fallen off the couch and onto the floor.  I woke my sister up and we thought nothing of it - so we helped her back up and she fell back to sleep.  My sister woke up at like 7am and my mom was essentially unresponsive on the couch, pulse, etc. but unresponsive.  Turns out she had a stroke in her sleep due to an aneurysm.  She was paralyzed on the entire left-side of her body and had to relearn basically everything from scratch.  - her life was never the same and she suffered from a myriad of health issues for the next 25 years of her life and ultimately succumbed to cancer two years ago.   While it's not about me, my life essentially completely changed from that moment forward and has shaped who I am today (spiteful, vengeful, complete nutcase, etc.).  Anyways, I'd try and tell my younger self to call 911 and maybe things would be different for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Holy crap everyone, thanks for the all the love, awards, comments, etc. you lovable internet strangers!  Didn't think my comment would get so much attention!  I'm so sorry for all those that have or are experiencing things of the same nature.   While there is the logical side of my brain that understands that even going back to that moment, even calling 911 wouldn't make much of a different, but there's always going to be that illogical side of my brain that refuses to believe any of that and will always blame myself (hence heaps and loads and years of therapy, etc.).

            "Talk about drowning.\n\nWhen I was 12, I almost died in a rip tide on a trip with a friends family. The family I was with told my parents it was nothing (afraid of lawsuit perhaps). And told me that they had told them the whole story. Basically, the lifeguard saved me at the last minute, and the rip tides were so bad the beach was shut down for days afterwards. But my parents never knew a life guard had to save and were told I got scared and over reacted. The ptsd from almost dying (I had given up and was dying when the lifeguard reached me) led to depression and drug use as a teen. If my parents had known I truly gave up and thought I was dying and was ok with it, they would have gotten me therapy and my whole life would have been different.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m simply answering the question asked- what would you say to a younger version of your self and why? I don\u2019t dwell on this. I figured it out in my twenties, talked to my parents (they were shocked about the real story), talked to a therapist and am doing great. I lost some formative years there but came out ok. \n\nThank you to everyone who has shared their own stories. I\u2019ve read them all and given the updoot.

            "This is a long one, few people will read it, and of those that will, few people will care, but since I\u2019m anonymous, and reddit \u201cglory\u201d is pretty useless, I don\u2019t mind saying it. What I\u2019m going to say will sound bitter. It is, but it\u2019s also the truth.\n\nWhen I was young, and knew nothing, I always wanted to be a \u201chero\u201d. What that meant, I wasn\u2019t sure, but I knew a hero was just and kind and willing to do bold things. When you try to adopt a \u201cheroic\u201d mindset, it may start with the conscious desire to do good... That will fade... As you foster it, and make it a part of your identity, it will become a compulsion. You won\u2019t think of the reasons, eventually there won\u2019t be any. You\u2019ll sacrifice every comfort for others, you\u2019ll never receive the same treatment. You\u2019ll be satisfied with never receiving the same treatment. As a result, others will see your actions not as virtuous, but as expectations. You\u2019ll be fine with that too... you expect it from yourself anyway...\n\nBut the more you look, and the more you do, you\u2019ll see more apathy. You\u2019ll see more selfishness. You\u2019ll see very few people like yourself, they are elusive, they don\u2019t connect with others easily. Being the change you want to see inevitably pits you against seemingly impossible odds, but compulsions don\u2019t weigh the odds, compulsions act.\n\nIt is a lonely, lonely existence... and a very heavy burden. There\u2019s no heroic fanfare for the sacrifices you make. It isn\u2019t a movie. There\u2019s no sudden realization from others about how valuable you may be. You will be forgotten, until there is a need. There is... a lot of hate... I feel as though I\u2019ve sacrificed a lot for people, and was willing to sacrifice much more that, thankfully, I never ended up having to... I believe you should do good things because they are good, and for no other reason... but it hurts. It hurts a lot.\n\nEdit: I expected this to get 35 tops. Instead this became my most popular comment of all time. Thanks for the kind words and gold, now there is extrapolation in order.\n\nA lot of people are arguing about what heroism is. That\u2019s good. When I was small, my hero was Hulk Hogan. He said his prayers and are his vitamins... and that didn\u2019t age well, did it? The concept of heroism is a window into someone\u2019s own heart, not an ironclad concept. This is why I didn\u2019t mention specific deeds or even rationalities, everyone\u2019s idea will be different. Spreading those ideas is good. I value the concept of sacrifice above all others. Some may value other qualities. That\u2019s fine.\n\nI knew there would be several people that went on about how \u201ccringe it is.\u201d I thought about preemptively mentioning it, because a great deal of people on reddit love berating people for being honest and kicking them when they are down, but didn\u2019t think it very important. They can be safely ignored. Relating people on reddit, an anonymous forum, to people that they meet in real life that rant to anyone that will listen, just seems incredibly nonsensical to me. What I wasn\u2019t expecting was relations to r/niceguys... I was fairly certain that had to do with people that were angry about being rejected romantically, and I don\u2019t really have those problems. If anything, I\u2019m extremely picky in that regard.\n\nJust because you believe you should do good for goodness sake, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always going to leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Sometimes you do good for people you absolutely loathe, and for no other reason than that it is right. \u201cDeserving\u201d isn\u2019t a concept I care to acknowledge. But I think it\u2019s rather despicable  for someone to deny the pain of others and call them entitled for feeling wounded, yet doing what is right anyway. Ignore these people, you only need to look in their own posts to invalidate them. For instance, people that work in the medical field. A lot of people idolize them, and rightly so. It\u2019s a field that requires calm in unimaginable scenarios (for me at least), that goes against our basic instincts and often do \u201charm\u201d toward a greater end (resolving a medical issue). Something like that requires an ironclad will, and I believe that deserves recognition. To others that work in that field, I can see how it can become the norm, just their \u201cjob\u201d. But I don\u2019t scorn people that feel they aren\u2019t getting the recognition they deserve. Some might say that mentality is toxic, but I say it only becomes toxic when people decide to withdrawal their good deeds because of it.\n\n\nLastly, and I know this is long, and I apologize, this was specifically fashioned to NOT put me on a glorified pedestal. I am not proclaiming myself a hero. I\u2019m not listing my deeds. I am saying I take concepts that *I* would find heroic, and apply them. You don\u2019t have to agree, and I am aware of my faults. I am opinionated, I am disagreeable, and I enjoy my solitude to a certain extent. I am looking to express myself, NOT to gain anyone\u2019s praise. What I think is worth mentioning, though, is that for every famous person that spends a little of their time doing something undeniably good, or putting coin into something which is relatively a pittance by comparison to them, while they receive MASSIVE notoriety for it... there are thousands of people that put everything they have into others and are entirely unsung. I believe it\u2019s worth pondering.",

People run over and start helping them as we stare in disbelief. There was already to many people trying to help so we went on and got the alcohol and came back outside and see two sets of paramedics attempting CPR. People are screaming I could see one set of paramedics get up and you could tell by there body language the person was dead, not sure about the other person but I believe they both shared the same fate.

Other cars are stopping and we pull the bike off him while I'm trying to get an ambulance.  His hand was completely fucked.  His foot was pinned under his bike, his shoe came off, and it was shaved down to the bone.  He took off his helmet, and we saw he was probably close to 80.  He was chewing on a toothpick and it went through his lip. We wrapped a belt around his leg to stop the bleeding.  The ambulance arrived, they took him, and I never heard what happened to him.

He had severe burns covering his entire lower body, front to back, and ankles to waist; testicles, penis, and all. Swimming in unclean water after something like this is a recipe for disaster.  He was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and had recently undergone a surgical debridement of his lower body, and the nurses and neighbors in the ICU were constantly complaining of the odor coming from his room due to the necrotic skin he had.\n\nHe was a pretty pleasant guy in a bad situation, but he had the most frustratingly loud and abnoxious, huge and trashy girlfriend that was constantly harassing the nurses and medical staff. \n\nMy buddy, a physical therapist assistant, walked into the patients room to get him moving for the day and wasn\u2019t really paying attention to the sounds behind the door/curtain into the patients room. He pulled back the curtains to see the very large trashy girlfriend riding the patient. In the process they had managed to remove all of the patients lower body dressings, which my buddy stated were heavily saturated with bloody drainage, and draping off of either side of the bed. He said he remembered being hit by the smell first, but his jaw dropped when he saw her butt covered in slimy drainage and clotting blood. \n\nFrom what he remembered that guy died a week later from infection related complications.

We gave the girl some water and got her coherent enough to admit that she didn't know this guy and had never met him before. We took down his info, but campus PD said we couldn't prove anything about his intent and we also couldn't prove that something physical had happened, so it was up to the student to press charges.

He ate it, skeleton and all. \n\nThey gave us some heavy duty meds to administer for about a month, and they ended up having to do *something* to, well, his shite pipe, because it was torn up from shitting out bones. \n\nThe cleanup took about 16 hours over two days. \n\nDoggo is nine now, doing just fine, and hasn't eaten another corpse since!

            "When I was in college, in Texas, I lived in an apartment style dorm. Had two bedrooms on each side that shared a bathroom and a shared living room and kitchen. Me and a friend were walking back from our class that got cancelled and we walked in on my roommate jerking it on the couch in the living room to some old school VHS porno on the tv. It gets better. He had his cowboy hat on, cowboy boots on and had his leg hiked up in the air and was grabbing his dick from under his thigh, like reaching back to front and jerking it that way. Also, he was probably close to 300 pounds. \n\nNever sat on that couch again and changed rooms at the end of the semester. \n\nEdit: for those asking, he paused and me and my friend just turned around and walked out. No clue what he did after we left. \n\nSecond edit: thank you kind stranger for my first gold",

            "Walking in the ER where my 15 month old daughter was being reanimated. After I just arrived at the hospital and my wife already being there.\n \nShe din\u2019t make it and it was honestly the most traumatic hour of my life. :(\n\nEdit: people have been asking what happened.\nThe short story is:\nShe wasn't well that day (it was late march so we thought a common cold) she din't drink all day so my wife (she was at home with the kids, I was at work) wen't to the doctor later during the afternoon because she was starting to get afraid of dehydration.\n\nDuring the examination the doctor din't trust it and told her she'd better go to the hospital to have her checked out. So eventually when the doctor at the hospital did a checkup she went bad and needed reanimation. Basically a few minutes after that happening I walked in (I had brought our eldest daughter to her grandparents)\n\nSo after months and months of hospital visits and genetic research the cause became clear.\nMy wife and I carry both carry some super rare genetic flaw, which basically means nothing until you both have it and the child receives both flaws. (The chance of people both having this flaw and the transferred to the child is 1 to 64 million)\nThis genetic flaw leads to all kinds of problems, in her case severe cardiac problems.\nSo she died that evening because her hard couldn't function anymore.\nThis disease is incurable and only gets worse as you age.\n\nedit2: perhaps the word disease is poorly chosen (sorry, not a native English speaker)\nWhat happens is: she had a defect in her genes which basically resulted in her cells (mitochondria) being unable to produce a certain protein. This results in problems with the growth and development of several organs. In her case she developed a severe cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart).\nWe learned from the few other studies available in the EU about this subject that these organ development problems only get worse and more wide spread when you get older.",

I\u2019ve only ever met his parents so I was super nervous to meet the rest of his family because I want to make a good impression. His parents have a pretty big house so some of the family members who were there from out of town were staying with them, us included. The first night we were there I couldn\u2019t really sleep because of the time zone difference so I get up at like 4 am to go get a glass of water. I hear something in the living room but didn\u2019t think anything of it because he mentioned his mom has insomnia and is always up at odd hours. I figured I\u2019d just get the glass of water and talk to her for a bit before going back to bed. I walk into the living room expecting to see my mother in law but instead I see his uncle on the couch and his wife sucking him off. She was really going at it. I panicked and froze and so did they. They don\u2019t speak English and I could barely speak any Swahili at the time so we can\u2019t say shit to each other. I just turned around and went back up stairs.

            "Literally shit. I was working as a Zamboni Driver/Custodian at a decent sized arena but wore a lot of hats. One summer weekend, our entire facility got rented out for a club team tournament. That's fantastic for the arena as summer is our slow season.  \nIf you've never been to an event like this, here's how it goes. About two hundred players plus assorted wives, kids and spectators arrive on Friday. Games start Friday night and run through Sunday afternoon. Event staff has about fifteen minutes between games to cut ice and clean locker rooms, which means that everything slowly deteriorates over the course of the weekend as we can't do much more than empty trash and mop up the vomit in between games.  \nThe most important thing to know about hockey players is that they can drink. If these guys aren't on the ice they are out in the parking lot tailgating. I can't fathom how these guys play hockey while being moderately to heavily drunk for three days straight.   \nSo the weekend wraps up, and I'm mentally preparing myself for a long night doing a deep clean of the locker rooms that haven't gotten much attention for three days. I walk into the very first locker room, and immidiatly the smell hits me. In the showers, someone had just spread their cheeks against the wall and unloaded three days of alcohol and fast food fueled diarrhea in a grotesque parody of Jackson Pollock. It was on the wall, in the grout, in the drains. It is the closest I've ever come to saying \"Fuck this, I dont get paid enough for this shit\". Unfortunately, at the time the only other employee in the building was my manager, who in addition to being an angel, was also six months pregnant. So I cleaned up that disaster zone and went home that night with no shoes or socks in borrowed gym shorts because I had to toss the ones I was wearing. ",

            "I was at a Halloween party a few years ago that was taking place in a giant brownstone in Brooklyn.  It was one of those multi-family units (a duplex maybe?) but a bunch of artists all lived there together.  I was only vaguely acquainted with one of the hosts and other than him and the friend who brought me I did not know a soul.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe party was absolutely WILD.  One of the most fun nights I've ever had and needless to say I got pretty wrecked. Somewhere along the line I lost my friend.  The party was dying down and I didn't want to be that weirdo who was still hanging out not knowing anyone but I didn't live in Brooklyn, had plans to crash at my friend's (who was not responding to my texts), and did not have a smart phone (it was 2011). Someone told me that they thought they saw him going to the room all of our coats were in so I began drunkenly tearing through each room in the house looking for the coat room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI opened the door and looked to my left and...SUCCESS! COATS!  Immediately after, I looked to my right and saw two guys having very expressive anal sex.  My friend was not one of them unfortunately. I apologized profusely, grabbed my coat, and GTFO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat in and of itself is not a big deal, as I'd wager that roughly 70 percent of the attendees were queer.  Unfortunately I was so drunk that I could not find my way out of the house as it had a very confusing layout and some doors were locked, some weren't, and none of the opened ones seemed to lead to the staircase.  So there I was, lost, wasted, confused, going up and down stairs, room to room, not just looking for my friend, but now looking for the exit.  In my mad dash to find a way out of this labyrinthine artists' lair I walked in on the dudes boning like 3 or 4 more times.  Each time apologizing profusely while I interrupted was sounded like wild gorillas fighting for territory. They were not very amused by the 3rd or 4th time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, I wandered into a room where I found some stragglers passing a joint.  I tried to explain that I lost my friend and had no idea where I was and interrupted their friends having sex so many times that I was afraid to keep trying to find my way out and worried that I'd just have to live there. They thought it was hilarious and were kind and passed me the joint and I got to talking with one of the girls and we ended up having sex.  So all in all everything ended okay.  On my way out the next morning, one of the dudes whose boning I interrupted saw me and tilted his head to the side like \"You still haven't figured out how to get the fuck out of here?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I worked for a company, and that company was contracted by a very wealthy man who had a very serious problem with skaters and homeless people on his property. Of course, his property was in an area that had a very large homeless population. This specific man didn't even want skaters or the homeless on the sidewalk, and he had enough pull in the city to where he could do that - despite the fact that people on the sidewalk are well within their legal right to be there. The police backed us up on this.   \n   \nNeedless to say, most of my interactions were with homeless people. One day I got a call about a vagrant rifling through the trash. I went to check it out and run him off, and the dude was actually quite together and didn't look like he had been homeless long. He tried to bond with me, which was something I kind of avoided - I tried not to dehumanize him, but I was also there to do a specific job. Well, I kept running into this specific individual. And we were cool, we both understood what it was and there was no hostility. We both knew what the other had to do. Neither of us were dickheads about it.   \n\n\nSo, me and this guy built a repertoire with one another. I'd been seeing him for months and we laughed and joked. One day I saw the guy and he was out of his mind drunk and possibly on drugs. He'd mentioned earlier he had a toothache, and this day I saw him, he was drenched in blood and had pulled his front teeth out with a pair of pliers. That was when I knew shit was about to get weird.   \n   \nSo about a week later, I'm on an overnight and I get a call on the radio to go to one of our buildings. They didn't say what the problem was, and when I asked, they wouldn't elaborate, so I had no idea what I was walking into. The building was an apartment building I was familiar with, and they told me the problem was downstairs in the fitness center. So I go into the building and go downstairs. I didn't hear any noise, so I assumed it was some sort of false alarm. I walk into the fitness center and hit the light, and this same person was on a weight lifting bench having sex with another homeless man. When I hit the lights, they panicked, and you know those sliding glass doors that usually lead to backyards in homes? They panicked so hard, the dude jumped up and crashed through one of those and kept going. Blood EVERYWHERE. That was the last time I saw that individual.   \n   \nI quit that job shortly after that. ",
            "This walked into me. Used to manage a gas station. Small inside, not a lot of space. This older lady comes in to grab a soda or what have you. As she comes up to pay, another lady comes in to the store in a huff, clearly not happy. She is storming around a bit when her boyfriend/husband comes in and they start screaming at each other like mad people. The poor elderly lady is at the counter looking at me with the most petrified look in her face. After the shock of the couple yelling at the top of their lungs at each other (bitch this, asshole that etc) she pays and bolts out the door. A few more seconds of these two shouting goes by and I try to calm the situation down. Now that the store is empty except for these two. \n\nNo luck. The lady picks up a glass commemorative mug we were selling and swings at the guys head but misses. And she was seriously gunning at his head with this mug. He, to his credit, mostly kept his shit together and didn\u2019t advance on her.  I ran back to the counter to call the cops. The screaming continues. \n\n911 on the phone, them yelling in the background,  it\u2019s a fun night. Eventually it boils up and she swings again and connects with the side of his head. Mug shatters. He goes down. She looks stunned for a moment, drops the glass handle on the ground and walks out of the store and sits in their car. He is surprisingly not bleeding and is recovering in the floor. Doesn\u2019t say much. Finally the cops show up, an inter takes place, and they are taken away and I\u2019m stuck cleaning up glass from the floor and all the candy bar boxes. Luckily, no blood. \n\nNext day their car wasn\u2019t in the parking lot anymore so one of them must have been released from custody. Never found out what they were fighting about or what the end result was. \n\nTL;DR man and woman gets into fight in my gas station, she smashes a glass mug over his head and walks back out to the car to wait for the cops.

            "Was in the Army in 1998 in Korea.  We had a really bad flood and all evacuated upstairs.   \nAfter about a half hour of increased flood waters we decide we need to check on the other barracks across the motor pool.  I am the first one down the stairs as I am the CO's driver and have a Humvee out front. \n\nI come downstairs into about 6 feet of pure human shit and piss mixed with the floodwaters. It was disgusting.  I crawled/swam through it out the front door, only to realize my Humvee was washed away. \n\nWhen the waters receded we spent the next two or so months cleaning up.\n\n[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9808/10/skorea.floods.01/index.html](http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9808/10/skorea.floods.01/index.html)",

            "At a party when I was 16, drinking and lots of people were smoking weed. Then out came the pills. Many pills were taken (not by me) and the mood changed. Lights, music, etc. Saw a 17 year old pregnant girl take her top off and dance on a table while her jaw flew around her face***\n\nWent to the takeaway for respite and chips. Came back and it had quietened down a lot. Heard some people upstairs. Went to investigate and found a room of 14-18 year olds topless laying around, half of then with needles in their arms and the other half smoking fuck knows what. In the middle was the pregnant girl, now fully naked with legs spread as if to demonstrate just how she became pregnant.\n\nNoped out of there almost immediately. Wish I had a camera phone back then.\n\n***Edit: Gurning, grinding teeth etc. ",
            "It was my third day as an electrician, I was working on a construction site that would become a H&M store in Walnut Creek, CA. I was always at least 30 minutes early since I was paranoid I would get there late and be fired. Anyways while I am waiting for the crew to show up, my stomach begins rumbling something fierce from the large coffee I drank. I beeline it down to the port-a-pottys, and knew they had been cleaned yesturday so figuered I would take a nice pre work dump in a decent smelling port-a-potty. Since it was 5:30 or so in the morning it was pretty dark out, and as I was in a hurry  and had to GO did not think to check the seat...well I sat in shit. I didn't know what it was at first, I go huh?! Then push my work light on my hardhat and see that the port a potty is covered in disgusting smelling dark shit. All over my ass and legs. I start to gag but cant do anything since I am shitting like no ones business..I go to grab some toilet paper, only to discover that somehow there was shit smeared there too. My left hand is now covered in shit. I have shit all over me and am gagging but cant do anything about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I walk out pants down, get into the next portapotty. It is thankfully shitless and take close to an hour wiping myself. I walk in, late, and walk up to my glaring foreman and tell him about my situation. He laughs, shakes his head and tells me he will give me 8 hours and to go home. That sucked"

            "Whilst driving from Morelia to Ciudad Hidalgo, in Mexico,  back in the 80's we had two ways to get to Ciudad Hidalgo which was the national road or the old national road which was called Mil Cumbres.  Mil cumbres basically means 1,000 curves. That stretch of road literally had 1,000 curves so a lot of people would get motion sickness when on that road. One evening on our way back to my grandparents, who lived in Ciudad Hidalgo, my grandfather was driving and he loved taking Mil Cumbres because it had really nice views and he just really loved driving that road but since we had the new national road, not a lot of people used that road anymore so it was kind of desolate with the exception of passing one or two little towns. It was dusk so soon that meant that being on such a desolate road in the moutains, we would be in complete darkness on the road with no many other cars on the same stretch of road. It took 2 hours to get to the town on that road so maybe 45 mins into the drive it had already gotten really dark and as we were driving my grandfather started slowing down. I was sitting in the back seat because my grandmother was in the front with my grandfather so I kind of stood over the front chairs to see why he was slowing down. That's when I saw a hug tree log blocking the road. My grandfather came to a stop and immediately started going in reverse to turn around and get out of the immediately. After we turned, my grandfather stepped on the gas pedal and I was sort of thrown back into the back seat. I immediately turned around to see if I could anything and as we were speeding away, I could see men, very dimly since it the light from the tail lights from the car were starting to get dimmer and dimmer, coming from out of the adjacent trees next to tree log on the road, with flashlights and guns.\n\nWe were about to get robbed and thanks to my grandfather's quick thinking and taking action immediately, we avoided it. That was the last time I was ever on that road.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://www.dangerousroads.org/north-america/mexico/6130-mil-cumbres.html](https://www.dangerousroads.org/north-america/mexico/6130-mil-cumbres.html)",

Fueling up I noticed a couple of attractive women pumping gas, on the other side of the pump was the man in his late 40s, just staring at these young women without notice of anything else going on around him. I walk inside to go grab some food for the next few hours of driving, when I come out I see both the younger women's car and the older man's truck are gone. I decided to hang out at the gas station for the next hour to catch a little sleep before hitting the road again. \n\nAfter driving for a few hours (I was speeding heavy) I pull over at yet another gas station, the young women are there getting gas and eating some food on a picnic table. Looked like they had been there for a while. I didn't see any sign or the man in the truck but can't say I was looking very hard for it. Well here is where it got creepy as hell....\n\nCan't say I didn't stare at them a bit, I mean they were good looking women. As I am watching them leave I see in the next parking lot over some headlights turn on and it's the same man as before.... He leaves when the women leave once again. Okay that's a bit weird but could just be a coincidence as there weren't many places to pull over. I leave a few minutes later and catch up to them...now this guy is riding there ass with his high beams on. \n\nI decided to slow down and stay a distance behind the truck. 10 minutes or so later the women pull over once again to most likely get this guy off their ass... With a sign of relief the truck keeps going and I continue on my way. About 1 mile down the road the guy just pulls off to the side of the highway.... So I pull off a mile or so down the road again. Sure enough the women drive by and the guy is still following them. At this point we are out in the middle of nowhere and too many coincidences have happened. I called the cops to alert them and about 15 minutes the cops pulled the guy over. \n\nI could have just seen too many horror movies that started like this and over reacted but ya never know. Better safe than sorry.",

            "   This is a story about something that was really scary at the time, but kind of funny in retrospect.\n\n   Once I was driving through an unfamiliar stretch of desert and mountains on my way to a campground in Utah.  The sun had set and it was pitch black outside. We hadn't seen a town for a long time, which was fine because we didn't need fuel, but it's worth noting here that before it had gotten dark, the last several exits that had been marked on the map didn't appear to have any people at them. There weren't many other cars on the road that we could see, but eventually this vehicle came up behind me, clearly going much faster than I was. He passed me on the left and as he went around me I could see that it was a pickup truck with a lift kit.\n\n   The pickup got back into my lane in front of me. He stayed there for a few seconds, then suddenly swerved to the left and slammed on his brakes. He then cut back over into my lane so he was behind me and switched on his brights. He followed me like this for some time, getting right on my rear and flashing his brights repeatedly. I started getting nervous at this bizarre and aggressive behavior. I told my wife to help me find a populated exit.\n\n  The road began to spiral down a steep mountainous slope. What followed next was a progression of increasingly alarming road signs that seemed like they belonged in a Looney Toons cartoon where a character is about to careen off a cliff.  These signs said things like: \"Watch for Wildlife\", \"Frequent Wildlife Crossing- Next 20 Miles\", \"Watch for Ice\", \"Watch for Falling Rock\", etc. None of them would have been scary on their own, or maybe in the daylight, but at night, in a situation where I was starting to panic, they seemed alarming and it seemed like they were ridiculously increasing in severity. At one point, a sign popped up that said \"Road Damage\". Since I was in panic mode, I remember exclaiming, \"Why don't they just fix the damage instead of putting up a sign!?\"\n\n  Eventually, we found a town with lots of lights and I promptly exited. I was terrified the guy would follow us, but he went on past me. I pulled into a gas station and that's when I figured what I probably should have realized a long time before. I had my brights on.",

I tended to pull the solo night shift, because I would walk out the door at 1:05 AM and the kitchen was stocked, clean, and perfect.\n\nIt was a long night. Stupid FoH kept sending back food orders after 1:00 AM, I didn't leave till 2:00 AM. 30 minute drive home, and I was exceptionally tired.\n\nI lived in the boonies of Wisconsin, at the time. A good 5km outside of town, which was 500 people, 2 churches, and 9 bars. I hit the little 24/7 truckstop just at the edge of that town for some munchies and smokes, and made the final treck home.\n\nEncountering deer was not uncommon out there, so I was going slow. When what appeared before me, to my tired eyes, was a monster.\n\nIt had a huge, round body. This crazy long neck, a pointy head, and only 2 legs. Right in the middle of the road. Scared the ever loving fuck out of me in that state.\n\nThankfully, it stood there for a second. Brain re-engaged. It's an ostrich. Ok, not a monster, heh, just... an... \n\nWhat the fuck is an ostrich doing wandering around in Central Wisconsin?!?\n\nI looked at it, it looked at me. I blinked. Nope, still there. Pretty sure it's real. Finally, it trundled off into the forest.\n\nWhat.\n\nI grabbed my cellphone, and called the tiny little police station in town (non-emergency number).\n\n\"So... I'm really tired, so please laugh at me and tell me to go home and sleep and ignore the call... but I'm pretty sure I just saw an ostrich on Highway xx just outside $town.\"\n\nShe started laughing hysterically, then assured me that:\n\n* No, I'm not hallucinating.\n* There's an ostrich and emu farm on the other side of town, guy raises them for the kitch places in town for meat.\n* Some drunk driver felt that \"turns are for pussies\", went up, over the berm, through the fence, and through most of the barn.\n* There's still 4 animals, including the one I just spotted, unaccounted for.\n* Where are you exactly, and which way did it go so we can round it up?\n\nI gave her the info, finished the last few miles home, and died in bed.

Nothing above ground level to catch the light. \n\n\nAs I'm barreling along I start to see shadowy figures running alongside my truck out of the corners of my eyes, on two legs and four.

Where did you go?\" Like the baby just goes for midnight strolls. Not a thank you or good bye or anything, they just took the baby in the house and continued drinking and laughing.

I like to drive at night since there are less people on the road and I can take my time. At around 3am or so we are making good time. I had stopped at a gas station and picked up some coffee for us and we were due in in about an hour. GF was sleeping soundly and I'm listening to a quiet radio humming away. I start getting a little drowsy and take a sip. Road was just as my coffee, no cars in sight except for a spotted few on the side of the road here and there. In the distance I can make out what looks like a hitch hiker, or what I think is one, but can't really tell due to such low light. As I get closer I start to notice other things, like how the person is kinda thin and tall and completely, for the most part, apparently brown. I'm right up on this thing now, and at about 20 feet it turns around and locks eyes with me as I pass by.\n\nThis was no person. And it is the most terrifying thing I have ever seen in my life.\n\nIt was a deer.\n\nOr I tell myself it was.\n\nI have seen deer stand on their hind legs to fight, but they still have deer posture when they do. not only that, but I was watching this thing walk for about 30 seconds from first seeing it in the distance to passing it.\n\nThe posture it had was human. Standard biped stance. Arms back, chin down.\n\nBut the worst part was the eyes, or lack thereof. In their place were two large black pits, almost black-holish. I'll never forget the stare down it gave me.\n\nThe instant I passed it I had the only panic attack I've ever had in my life. I had to wake up my gf to keep calm enough to get to an exit with a large gas station a few miles away. Like hell I was going off a ramp close to that thing. After we pulled into the station I had a complete meltdown. I started crying harder than I ever thought I could. I couldn't talk, breath, or do anything but want to curl into a ball and cry. After around 30 minutes or so, she finally gets me to calm down enough to tell her what happened. While I don't think she believed what I think I saw, she knew that I was convinced and legitimately scared to death.\n\nEvery once in a blue moon I will dream about it and wake up crying or in a cold sweat, and she will tease me about it or roll over and ignore me instead of comforting me about the one thing that I've ever been terrified of.

It was around 1 or 2 in the morning and I was in the final stretch of the trip. Driving down a totally deserted highway, only 2 lanes with no shoulder so the speed limit was 55. I was tired and having not seen anyone for at least an hour I kept kicking up my speed up to 80. I was flying down the road.\n\nAs I crested a hill I spotted head light atop a couple hills down. I didn't think much of it. Reduced my speed a bit and got read to turn off the brights over the next hill. But I didn't see any more headlights. I figured they must have turned off down a gravel road. Could have been for any number of reasons. They lived that way, maybe coming home after a night at the bar and didn't want to risk getting pulled over on the highway, but at first I didn't think it was weird.\n\nUntil boom, a black car hauled ass past me in the direction that car had been heading, with their lights off. I still wasn't too freaked out until I saw break lights and then headlights behind me. I fucking hauled ass. I called my grandparents as soon as I noticed the person was gaining on me. I gave them a heads up and my grandpa said he'd be at the end of their 1/2 mile driveway with his shot gun and rifle waiting for me.\n\nI still had another 10 miles to go until the nearest town, then about 20 miles on gravel to get to their house.

That's when the person turned back around.\n\nI always wonder wtf they were doing. Like were they just fucking with me? Did they want something? I'll never know",
            "Me and some friends were going out one night. We're driving down a pretty big city street with about 2 lanes on each side 45 mph speed limit. This dude was riding a bike against traffic, my friend tried to swerve and the guy swerved the same direction as us. He gets hit and does a faceplant right into the windshield on the passenger side where I was sitting. He flips over the car and is just lying in the middle of the road. Don't know if the guy died but it didn't look good. They landed a helicopter in the middle of the road and took him to the hospital. Witnesses stopped and waited with us verifying that it wasn't our fault and cops let us go on our way.  Crazy night.",

            "This is the onlyexperience I have ever had like this. Nothing else has come close:\nSome friends and I (5 of us) we're driving around some rural roads waiting for a friend to arrive to his girlfriend's house. We were just kind of wasting time, cruising down some dirt roads around 20 miles an hour, talking. My friend who is driving Slams on his brakes and I, in the passenger seat, looked up and there was this thing. I had never seen anything like it before. We stopped the car and watched as this thing, which didn't have a perceivable head, moved slowly across the road about 15 ft in front of us. It was creepy to say the least. It was approximately 4 ft tall and we could see its joints moving as it walked slowly with a gait similar to a giraffe. It had very skinny, long legs. Its body was about 1.5 ft round. If it had hair it was pretty short, but the thing was Brown. We were all screaming, \"what the fuck is that?!\" We could not see any perceivable head and it was walking perpendicular to us. We watched as it slowly walked through these people's yard and behind their house. Needless to say we were freaking out about it. When we got to my friends house we all drew pictures of it separately and showed each other at the same time when we were done to verify that we all saw what we saw. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen and I have not found any satisfactory explanation to this day, 20 years later.",

I've never shat myself so fast and hard before,  I tell you I will never go back to Kansas in a Subaru outback, if I go back it's gonna be in a tank.",
            "After seeing The Ring 2 with friends late one night, I had just dropped off one of them at their house in the middle of nowhere. I was driving down a dark rural road through trees and I turned a corner going fairly fast and there were like 5 deer in the middle of the road. I was able to stop before hitting them but I couldn't go anywhere until they moved so i sat there until they finished crossing the road.  If anyone remembers the terrible movie that was The Ring 2 there is [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8nl157SWM) where they get stopped by a deer then the deer attacks. That was all I could think about as I waited for the deer to cross. realistically it probably took less than a minute, but man did it feel like an hour. Eventually though they all pranced across and I kept driving. But to this day I still remember it and it still comes up in my nightmares sometimes.",

            "I was driving home at like 10pm (still light out) down a road that\u2019s famous for deer running across and dying. I went past a group of deer, a couple of them were watching me, and a couple of them were running along side the road. When I looked out my window at the ones running alongside the road, there was one that looked starved and it\u2019s ribs were all visible through it\u2019s skin, but it\u2019s skin was also rotting and you could see the flesh and muscles underneath. I am very squeamish person and this almost had me throwing up in my car. Look out for the zombie deer in NKY, it\u2019s been spotted by some classmates too.\n\nUpdate: The deer doesn\u2019t have CWD, they have already gotten reports about it and they found the deer. According to Fish and Wildlife the deer just has some really really bad warts. I really don\u2019t believe it, but maybe that deers warts eat away at it\u2019s skin or it got mangled when it got hit by a car.",
            "I told this story before, but one time I was driving with my girlfriend through Wisconsin on the way back home. It was really late, like 2 or 3 in the morning and I stopped at a gas station to fill up. My GPS ended up putting me on a small highway instead of the expressway right away after leaving there, but I didn't want to complicate things more, so I just followed it.\n\nMy girlfriend was sleeping, so I had the radio off and drove in silence on this really dark, creepy highway. There were deer crossing signs, so I was driving extra cautious because a family friend had recently hit a deer in their truck, which did quite a number on it and also caused her to break her arm from the impact. I saw there was a pretty sharp curve coming up, so I slowed down to make it carefully and as I'm turning I see a figure exiting the darkness of woods.\n\nIt's a large mountain lion, with blood stained all over the front of its face. Scared the fuck out of me. I pulled up just after the turn and tried to wake my girlfriend up. I could see it's large shadow make it way across the road in my rearview mirror, but by the time my girlfriend woke up it was gone. She had lived in Wisconsin most of her life and immediately dismissed my claims that it was a mountain lion because they are not really from that area. I told her I know what I saw, but she insisted that I was seeing things. I acted like she was probably right and continued the trip back, but I know what I saw.",

It's frustrating but I'll pass at the next passing zone.   Next thing I know he goes even slower, down to 20 mph.   I think maybe he feels me to close to him, so I back off his bumper and he speeds up to 45. \n\n Soon he slows back down agian..\n\nThen speeds back up.. \n\nThen slows agian.   But this time he comes to a stop.  In the middle of the road.   No one else around.   No stop sign.   I decide fuck this and slowly start going around him.  And I remember wanting to look over but as I was going by him I start accelerating.  \n\nThen he lays on his horn and starts accelerating to.  So I put the peddle down even more trying to pass him.  He is still laying on his horn. I am freaking out, so I just accelerating harder  Finally we are up to 80 mph me in the opposite lane before he slows off.   I keep going wanting to put some distance on us.\n\nComing to the end of the road is a inter with traffic lights.   Light turns red.   Guy is still behind me.  I grab a ice scraper from the backseat to get ready for him to get out and come to my truck.  \n\nThankfully nothing happens.  I turned at the intersection and he keeps going.

            "Not at night but at 4:00 in the morning when it was pitch black. I was driving to my college orientation by myself, and I was still a rather inexperienced driver when it came to driving outside of my county.

Nothing but trees on either side. There are no cars on the road but me, and I was thinking about how spooky it was, but I always blast my music so I don\u2019t get paranoid about that shit. I go around a curve, and instantly have to slam on the brakes and swerve to avoid a giant piece of metal blocking only my lane. I crossed the double yellow, but I could see nobody was coming and I did it safely. \n\nShaken up, I kept driving towards the roundabout. It was about another minute. I turn around, still scared about what just happened, and I know to slow down in case there\u2019s a car in my lane going around the object on my way back. As I approach the spot, with absolutely no cars in sight, and nothing but trees around the road, I see a man in a black hoodie and black pants hunched next to the piece of metal in the road, like he was rearranging it in a better spot. I floored it and went 60 down that tiny road until I found the interstate again and got back on.",

            "Not scary but kinda fits. \n\nWas driving on route 27, a Costa Rican highway from Pacific coast to the capital. It was about midnight, the street had a curve so we could not see far away. The windows were down so we were able to hear a big boom and tires screeching. After the curve there was a big straight bit, far into it we could see a big seafood truck going really fast. 10 seconds later we see a broken bike, then I realize just ahead is a ripped human leg laying on the street. Called 911 Knowing I was about to find the rest of the body somewhere, I park and get some light reflectors out so nobody would run over the leg and cause another accident. As soon as I do it, I hear moaning coming from the bushes on the side of the road. When I get there I see an old man, laying face down, around 60-70 y/o, blood everywhere. He was trying to say something while dying but all I could make out was \"esposa\" which means wife but also could mean handcuff depending on context. Now, I dont get disgusted by bood or a lot of things so knowing he was gonna die either way I try turn him grabbing from his shoulder to lay him with his face up. This failed since his abdomen skin had been ripped open and all his guts slid out. Between the smell that came off and the scene I had just seen I could not resist the nausea and puked more than I had eaten in a month. Shortly after the police came and declared him dead on scene. Then the ambulance came and took him away. I stayed since I was curious and got asked to be witness. A lot of people had gathered around by this point and we started looking for parts of the car, helping the police. A guy found a piece of the bumper with the number plate. An officer told me he car had been reported stolen, but I found it weird since... who would wanna steal a car full of fish??? So I checked the time I called 911 and showed the officer and funny to be told, the car had been reported stolen 8 minutes after I called 911. Months after a friend told me the guy that died was found with alcohol in his system and the driver was charged only for filing a false stolen car.",

            "I had a weird and somewhat frightening experience one night years ago while on a long dark road one night. I was in the Navy at the time, and I was on a training trip to Groton, CT. I was quite the partier in younger days, and I would wander damn near anywhere wherever I thought there was some music, dancing and action (wink wink).  One night I decided to wander somewhere north of the New London / Groton area to see what else was out there. Well I didn't see anything worth mentioning, so I said screw it and finally turned my rental car around to head back to the base.\n\nNow let me set the scene as it really was. I was just driving along this long, dark highway when I spotted a white guy just standing there in the pitch darkness alone and alongside the road. There was no car or anything there... it was just him. As a southerner, my first impulse was to ask if he was OK... that is until I looked into his eyes. This man looked me right in the eye, and his stare sent a damn chill through me as I drove by. He actually had the look of something between a spirit and an outright ax murderer. I mean like this dude didn't even look REAL! He didn't say a word to me, and he made no physical gesture. He just stared at me with this evil, weird and ghostly look in his eyes. Bottom line is this: He scared the shit out of me, so I kept my Black ass moving and got the fuck out of there as fast as possible. I was even afraid that I was going to have bad dreams that night. THAT'S just how evil and weird this cat looked! This incident happened about 35 years ago, and I never forgot about it, so I hope this puts the story into a better perspective in terms of the \"Jason\" effect this dude had on me.\n\nPeace",

            "Hopefully this doesn't get buried, but once when I was around 20 (36 now), I was driving to meet up with some friends. It was a Saturday morning, around 1:00ish, so there wan't too many cars out. as I make a left at the end of my street, a car had made a left from the main road onto the road I was on, so we are on a straight path to pass each other. As the car was coming up, I noticed the driver had an unusually white head, as in white, not  white person. As we passed each other, we were both driving slower, and as I got up next to the car, it was a skull. At first I thought it was a mask, but the skull turned and looked at me. When he did, his eyes were wide open and then he opened his mouth at me. At the time, it scared the living hell out of me, but looking back at it now, it had to be some top of the line mask the driver was wearing. It would probably still scare me though if I wasn't expecting it.",

            "1978 or '79.  I was the lead singer/guitarist of a punk band called The Nads.  Punk was new to Vermont and roundly hated in an era of overblown bands issuing albums of overly instumented 14 minute pieces.  We were three poor kids with secondhand equipment and few gigs.  We were also the owner of an ancient \"Thames\" van which had previously served a plumber.  His name was still faintly visible on the sides despite many scrubbings.  Anyway, we travelled up and down Vermont and also made trips to New Hampshire and Maine playing where we could.  We got a gig playing at a basement bar in Portland, Maine but the pay would cover not much more than the gas.  We gassed up, packed two days worth of sandwiches and a change of underwear and off we went.  Just over the border in Maine we blew a tire (or \"tyre\" since it was a Thames).  It was still afternoon and there was a garage/gas station nearby so we took the tire off and walked it over to see if they could repair it.  The spare was bald as hell and probably wouldn't have got us home. The road was narrow and in pretty rough shape and we walked along in our all-black attired and our unfortunate haircuts.  The reaction we got from the locals at the station was shock but we had cash and away we drove.  About 20 miles further the same tire flattened again and we figured that we had been had.  We were in an even more rural area and this was the time before cell phones so we were fucked.  Night closed in.  We had food to eat and plenty of forest to pee in so we just waited for a good Samarian or at least daybreak.  Sorry, bar that took a chance on us.  We lounged around inside the van and played around a bit on a new song we were writing. then ate and tried to sleep.  Deep in the night we heard the screeching of metal being dragged along asphalt and we bolted upright and peered out the windshield.  There a snowmobile was racing along the (June) road shooting off sparks behind it like a comet.  One guy was driving and another guy was...well...\"surfing\" behind it on something which looked like a piece of farm machinery while he clung desperately to a rope tow line.  The \"comet\" lingered in our eyes as the two disappeared around a wooded corner.

There was a moose in the middle of the left lane. We put our hazards on and passed it going about 40. As we were passing it, a Saab came up going about 75-80 and hit the moose. The moose was literally ripped in half. Its head and torso on the left and it's rear in the middle of the road. The Saab then veered off into the woods. We stopped to help and as we were running to the car, we saw the driver get out and start walking toward us. Luckily his only injuries were a few minor cuts on his face from his windshield.",

            "Driving home from work at about 3am, along country roads in Wiltshire, England. Missed my turn, went along to the next one and looking at the sat nav it connected to the main road I was heading for so I took it. \n\nIt was a single track road, so I was driving slowly. I saw something smallish in the middle of the road, and as I got closer I saw it was a bird, a pigeon. It was dead, and had blood on it so I assumed it had been run over but as I looked I realised the blood was on it\u2019s chest, and it didn\u2019t seem squashed. I drove past it swerving the wheels so as not to squish it, and carried on a short way before I saw another pigeon in the road. Same deal - dead, bloodied, not squashed, like it had been shot with an air gun or similar. \n\nFurther up the road more pigeons, all dead, small piles of two or three of them, all in the middle of the road. I slowed down and had my lights on full beam staring at a pile of dead birds when suddenly a bird smashed against the windscreen, then another, and another against the side window. I freaked, and floored it, hammered up the road through several more piles of birds whilst my wipers smeared blood all over the windscreen. A bird was lodged at the bottom of the windscreen and when I got to the main road I had to pull over and remove it... not before I\u2019d put a few miles between myself and the person who was apparently killing pigeons and throwing them at me in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere. \n\nI guess some kind of Hot Fuzz style cult or Masonic ritual involving local landowners impregnating animals and sacrificing kids etc. I didn\u2019t hang around to find out though.",

I remember early on a Sunday my mother getting a phone call and telling us that an elderly neighbour had passed away in the night. We all said the usual stuff, that it was sad and we'd have to call down to the wake the next day, etc etc. \n\nLater that evening, we went to visit my grandmother and stayed until it was pretty late. We drive home in pitch black darkness. This was in rural Ireland, so silent, windy little roads through woodland, a house only every 4 or 5 miles. We're almost home when we see something in the headlights in front of us. For a minute, we couldn't make out it out but eventually the outline of figure walking towards us emerged: The elderly neighbour who had died the night before. \n\nWe all went silent. He tipped his hat to us and I just remember my dad putting the foot down to get home faster. \n\nTurns out it was a different feckin neighbour that had died. Scared the shit out of us until we found that out the next morning though.",

We take our exit and as we are heading up the ramp we see the shadow of a figure walking across the road. The lights from the road ahead projected his shadow into the fog on the road in front of us before we saw him. He was stumbling with his arms in front of him across the exit ramp. Much like a zombie in a horror movie. We barely missed him. \n\nWe called 911 to report a man stumbling across the exit ramp heading toward the freeway. Turns out it was a drunk driver who crashed his car into the ditch and he was on the run.",
            "When I was 18, I was driving my boyfriend home around 2 am when we came up on a pickup truck on fire. The driver had crashed head-on into a massive tree, and the driver\u2019s door was crushed against a fence. \nI called 911 and we started trying to get him out, but the front of the truck was completely smashed. The engine was basically on his knees and his legs were completely trapped. \n\nI remember climbing into the cab of the truck and reaching for him, and there was so much fire I couldn\u2019t even see his face, just an arm in a red and white striped hoodie. He must\u2019ve been unconscious when we got there but when I started screaming so did he. I regret it now, because I wish he\u2019d stayed unconscious as he died. \n\nA guy in a suit pulled me out of the cab, and then suddenly there were first responders and other people everywhere. I didn\u2019t look when the firefighters pulled the body out, but my boyfriend said it was a head and torso, then just nothing below. \n\nI used to take that street to work every day but I quit for years. I moved to another city for 4 years, and when I moved back and drove down that street for the first time I could still see the burn damage on the tree he\u2019d hit. \n\nI never managed to find out any information about the guy, but I looked for months afterward. I still think about it almost every day, almost 10 years later. I wish I could\u2019ve saved his life.",

I had gone over to a possible Tinder hook up's house and ultimately things didn't work out well enough for me to spend the night. I ended up driving home around 3am that night and was doing my absolute best to keep my eyes open in the dark Maine woods.   \nI remember fiddling around with the radio stations for a few minutes trying to find a good station on the FM and having no luck. For whatever reason I started exploring the frequencies and somehow came across what must have been an amateur radio station. Crackling through static and the buzz of the radio came a creepy high pitched halting voice repeating the words \"I'm the trash man, I'm the trashman, and I'm on your radio. I'm on youuurr radioooo\" over and over with a strange accompanying beat. After the song ended the  same voice would go into reading numbers and various words backwards in his strange halting style. This broadcast mixed with the twisting dark roads of the back woods was way too much for me to handle but for whatever reason I couldn't change the station. For about 15 minutes I was in the range of this radio station and I probably spent the whole time with goosebumps."

It smelled very nice, which I had not expected. Most of the tropical plants were fake plastic plants, so I figured the water in the bath was normal swming pool water and the smell was coming from something else. The bath was surrounded with a small aromatic herb garden which didn't look fake. I sneakily took a sample from a thyme plant that felt surprisingly real. But because the air was filled with all the different aromas and a hint of chlorine I couldn't smell anything different when I tried to smell the thyme. I figured the only place where my sense of smell couldn't be fooled by any fakery was underwater. For 5 seconds I actually felt pretty smart. Untill I tried.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for the awards and upvotes, this makes my day! \n\nI wish I could awnser the question about the smell underwater, but I found out it doesn't work like that. As soon as the water entered my nose I noticed the flaw in my plan and the irony of it all. My head came up immediately, all while laughing (because I felt so smart with my waterproof plan a second ago) and coughing, which only made it worse and resulted in another gulp of water going in the opposite direction. No physical damage indeed, some people described how this works in the comments and as others said, it hurts a bit, but not too long. \n\nGlad to see some of you also tried to experiment with their airways underwater, even though our results probably never will lead to a scientific breakthrough. \n\nLet us never be dumber than that again.",

My mom always said, \u201cif you\u2019re old enough to ask the question, you\u2019re old enough to hear the answer\u201d Well, I am just a super curious person so of course I would ask a variety of questions about sex and where babies came from during my elementary school years. My parents kind of revealed parts of it to me over time, of course, telling me the most basic things first that I could really understand. So, i knew that the sperm from a man, which came from penis, would go inside the woman\u2019s vagina and fertilize an egg, which would grow into a fetus. Cool! How did the sperm get in there? Well, I truly though it just flew through the air, like little birds or perhaps a butterfly, up and into the woman\u2019s vagina. \n\nI did realize the logistical problems with this though - how does the sperm get through your clothes? And does the woman have to wear a dress? \nWell, I had questions - mom had answers. \n\nWhen I asked her how the sperm managed to float magically from the man\u2019s penis and somehow find its way into a woman\u2019s vagina, my mom gave me the most horrified look. She realized she left out the part about intercourse, I think (I\u2019d love to ask her now if she remembers this, sadly she died in 2016). \n\nI\u2019ll never forget sitting in the bottom of the stairs with my mom, her looking down at me saying, \u201cUm, Brantly... you don\u2019t know how the sperm actually gets into the vagina?\u201d \n\n\u201cwhat? No? They fly?\u201d \n\u201cNo... the boy and girl have to have sex...\u201d \n\n\u201cokay...\u201d \n\n\u201cThe penis has to go in the vagina\u201d\n\nQueue my world exploding.

You can see where this is going, right?\n\nOne day my boyfriend (now husband) was hanging out with me, and my dad came in late as usual and greeted us. After my dad went upstairs, my boyfriend asked me why my dad always gets home so late and I told him he goes to the gym after work. \n\nHe looked at me like I was an idiot (rightfully so) and said, \u201cHe\u2019s at the gym from 5PM - 11PM?

I remember crying at the top of the stairs thinking about that and then asking my mom and dad later why they were getting divorced. My dad got so mad at me, he yelled at me and accused me of lying. I was maybe...6 years old at the time and I remember feeling so confused and hurt and that maybe I was crazy and made it all up. \n\nThen there was the whole \u201cgoing to the gym\u201d thing three nights a week for 6 hours at a time...\n\nAlso, my dad always liked to make himself look like the victim whenever my parents would argue  (and they did so constantly.)

My relationship with my mom wasn\u2019t the best for a long time...I loved her, but I didn\u2019t see her pain, I just saw her anger, her mean streak, her craziness. And my dad used that whenever they would fight, he would act so damn innocent and make my mom out to be the villain every time. \n\nI actually think that was what hurt me the most when I found out, knowing how much my mom had suffered alone and how my dad used against my mom in arguments so we would always take his side.\n\nMy mom was not innocent in this though. She was an adult, she made a choice to stay and endure and that broke her.

She knows me, so I wasn\u2019t punished, and she was kinda just... sad? I guess? That her kid could be so gullible?\n\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t even learn my lesson there. In 6th grade science class, a kid was able to convince me that those Black Pearl erasers were called that because they were made with black pearl. Not only this, but they were so rare that teachers had a list of kids who owned one so that they could keep it quiet and track it down if one got stolen. I took this to one of the teachers I trusted, who thankfully was very kind about it and introduced me to the website Snopes, saying it probably wasn\u2019t true and that I should look up any further mysteries I encounter there. \n\n\nThank you Miss Yager for making me open my dumbass eyeballs :("

            "I suppose I was an incel from 23-27 after leaving the military. I was depressed, underweight, socially isolated... I never got fat or super into gaming as is stereotypical, just worked a lot, hung out with my dog, smoked way too much weed, and just sort of forgot how to interact with women. Which was probably for the best, most of my relationships prior to 23 were unhealthy at worst, meaningless at best.\n\nEnding that era of my life was a long struggle that took concerted effort towards trying to be more positive and social. \n\nOne big event was buying and learning to ride a motorcycle at 27- sort of shocked me out of my routine, opened my eyes to the fact that life was not a downhill slide from the adrenaline filled days of 18-22, that new experiences were waiting to be had. \n\nEventually I met a woman that I just couldnt bear to have the usual \"flirt until I awkwardly distance myself\" experience with. I *forced* myself to not to my mind wander when we talked, I powered through all anxiety to call and text her daily, I even eventually would do crazy stuff like *get dressed up nice and go to dinner with her* -not something I could have ever seen myself doing at one point. \n\nSo I'm married now, still have some issues, but very happy. So I'd say nothing to me, just gotta live through it kid.",
            "I was raised by incredibly cruel people, my aunt and grandmother. \n\nThey had me absolutely convinced that I was very ugly, pathetic, and just a total loser. They even hinted that I\u2019d be better off gay (as if it\u2019s a choice) because I didn\u2019t have a shot with women. They also made me feel that as an imigrant I was considered \u201cweird\u201d and strange and women would consider me less of a \u201ccatch\u201d because I was a foreigner. \n\nSince I believed all of that, I had a real resentment toward women and like many young people I protected my pain with anger. \n\nEventually I discovered that I was not ugly at all and in fact was considered quite attractive by many (which I never *fully* could wrap my head around). And guess what, turns out women *like* guys with exotic accents and viewed my foreign-ness as interesting and even exciting. \n\nI\u2019m just glad I realized all of that before I had become too entrenched in my anger or wasted too much time.",
            "I remember when I first found the incel community, it was actually a pretty helpful place.  It was more of a support group for people who were unattractive, socially awkward, ect. There wasn't any of this nice guy, give sex bull shit. Everyone knew why they were involuntarily celibate, and just wanted to vent frustrations and get support. It was really good for my confidence. Then the toxic masculinity started to creep in and took right over, as everyone knows. \n\nI fell on the incel line of being not unattractive, but personality wise, all I did was play videogames. I didn't have anything interesting about my life, and so women just weren't interested in me, and I never put myself into situations to meet people.\n\nNew job with great people, I started to do different things. Played hockey for the first time at thirty. Joined the group for a couple of travelling tournaments where we got absolutely Vegas type plastered for weekends in different cities. Job is very much a hang out and chat type job (security), so talking with the women on the team on the regular starts removing the air of mystique I had built around them.  Got my motorcycle licence, and did a solo trip across the states from Canada to the Mexican border, and back that same year. Started doing tough mudders, buying a season pass and traveling to any of the ones I could drive to. \n\nThen I got tinder and just started going on dates. Had a few good, few bad, and then met my wife.\n\nAll and all, I ultimately blame a world of warcraft addiction that held me back in my early twenties to my late twenties and just missed out on those socially formitive years.",
            "I used to be the creepy ass weirdo who, by the time I graduated, had asked every single girl out. I literally had no idea what I was doing wrong, I was practicing all the classic \"Southern Gentlemen\" things that I was supposed to yet having no luck (think \"M'Lady\", but only slightly less cringey). It wasn't until I got to college and went on a period of self discovery that I knew the error of my ways.\n\nThe first, and most important, concept that I learned was that women aren't sex dispensaries that you deposit \"nice coins\" into and get pusspuss in return. They have to choose you. I still kept doing nice things for girls because that's the way I was raised, but I removed my expectations for getting anything in return.\n\nThe second concept was making myself attractive, and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. A nice basic buzzcut suddenly turned my oily mop of hair into a clean, presentable style. Went clean shaven on facial hair too, because all I could grow was a piddly \"pubic hair\" lookin' ass beard. Got a benzoyl peroxide solution to start working on the acne. Marching band was my form of exercise to stay fit and avoid the \"freshmen 15\". \n\nIt's amazing how the problems we create for ourselves can get in our own way.",
            "Oh god, high school me wore fedoras and believed my \"superior intellect and science-based social theories\" were too much for everyone and that I was really a James Bond type with my knowledge of various fields. \n\nTurns out I was gay as fuck but so deep in the closet my zip code was in Narnia, not really that smart in anything but too ADHD to focus past basic knowledge of anything and in a desperate need of a new wardrobe.",
            "I was a being of pure hatred. I always thought it was someone else's fault. Even though I have had sex since that time, I think it's important to know that having sex isn't what vindicates you. Inceldom is a state of mind which requires strength and sometimes outside guidance to overcome. One of my friends essentially gave me a proverbial slap to the face on the subject and told me exactly what to do and how to become a more better person. \n\nIn conclusion, I look back with regret and sorrow, for all the people I hurt and made uncomfortable, because I know there are many.\n\nEdit: thanks so much for the positive response! I've received many questions about what my friend did to help me. \n\nMy friend was and is someone I looked up to so I suppose that is an influence but basically the thing that I needed to understand was that the fact the girls who I was constantly being rejected by were just people living their best life and me whining about it wouldn't change their preferences so instead I worked on being happy without needing a gf and just letting it happen when it happens.\n\nThere's always something to be said for talking to your friends, taking the time out of your day to listen to their troubles and offering advice. It really helped me so I encourage you to do the same!",
            "I was involuntarily celibate in that I wanted to have sexual relationships, but never met anyone interested. I didn't put any effort in, so it was kinda my fault. My lifestyle just didn't lend itself to meeting people, so it was hard.  \n\nWhen I finally did get out there and start having relationships it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. I realised that I had previously felt like an incomplete person because of my inability to connect with anyone, and that was holding me back from other things in life. Like I thought nothing else was worth pursuing because I hadn't properly entered adulthood yet. I kinda wish I'd just got on with it and persued my other interests a bit more. I don't know why I had to wait. Maybe it was depression relating to me being lonely.  \n\nEdit: thinking about it a bit more, I put off dating for a long time because I thought I had to have my life in order first, which was why I waited until I hit some other life milestones. Once I hit those, I realised I had no excuse and finally started online dating. First one ghosted me, which hit me pretty hard after doing something positive for myself. Second one we really hit it off, and that's when I turned into a different person. It's worth the effort.",
            "Finally my time to shine, not sure if I should be proud of that.\n\nI found my first incel forum at 13, even tho it didn't have that name. But the idologies were the same.\nI was miserable back then, didn't have many friends, my grades were shit and I got bullied a lot.\nThis made me spend most of my time inside playing video games and hating life.\nI hated everyone because all of my experiences with people where being bullied, I started being bullied at 4 and it didn't stop until the middle of highschool.\nThe forums where full of people thinking the same, it made me feel secure, like I was _right_. \nI didn't have to walk the hard way to improve myself, they told me I could just let go. Nobody will ever love you so why try? You are a social reject so why try?\n\nSo I stopped showering, stopped eating, stopped caring for myself. I let myself go because these groups told me no matter how hard you try, you will fail.\nI became jelous of people being more popular then me, jelous of my sister because she was so pretty and accepted herself.\nShe had a boyfriend, but all girls hated me.\nAt the time I didn't see that would I have just showered girls wouldn't have been disgusted by me.\nI hated immigrants, gay people, women, handsome guys.\nEveryone I saw as more accomplished then me.\n\nIt was a hard time getting out of this mindset, but eventually I made it. Turned my grades around, made some friends and went to therapy. \nI even have a boyfriend now, oh the irony. \nWhen I see incels or people like that I just can't hate them, they are in pain and struggeling and need help.\nDepression is one hell of beast and some people lash out in anger. \n\nSo when I look back at my old self, I really just want to give him a hug and tell him everything is going to be ok.\n\nEdit: sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, do feel free to point them out! I'm dyslexic.",
            "You know, I don't know if this'll be buried but I can actually share something valuable here. TLDR, I was, it comes down to a lack of respect and ignorance to self awareness.\n\nI did consider myself mostly an incel. Maybe, more of a \"nice guy\", but to my core I believed that girls were only after the Chads and douchebags. It was from the ages of 12-18, so a lot through my formative years.\n\nHere's the mindset: you've never had any awareness of the fact that girls don't indeed chase douchebags, **because that's all you've ever looked for**. Whenever you see a pretty girl who says she is in a relationship, you immediately assume that her boyfriend is a terrible person. Though, **not because he is**, but because you yourself assume that you would just be *so* much better off with her than any other person. You don't/won't see your own flaws, so you'll assume the worst of the guy.\n\nThe truth is, it comes down to **major insecurity issues** and a l**ack of any male relationships.** If you don't have many different male friends, you're going to assume that only the cocky guys get the girls. In reality, they are displaying charisma and confidence - something that is very attractive. Everyone knows this.\n\nIt's a lack of awareness. It's easier to say that you yourself are too short, too ugly, too untalented, etc. than to admit that you have a crappy personality with little to no charisma. **You won't find a happy, charming incel.**\n\nIf I could have gone back to myself and say: Here's the deal. Girls don't look for one particular thing in a dude. They don't just want a \"tall dude\", or a \"wide jaw\" dude.  \nThey want someone to be comfortable around. They don't want you to praise them as some higher being, they want to be treated with respect. But most importantly **- they don't exist to have sex with you.** ***They don't even exist to be your friend.*** They don't owe you anything - no one does. **Just because you like them, doesn't mean they have to like you.** Don't try to sleep with girls by being their friend. Be grateful that someone sees any quality in your person for them to want to be around you at all. Be grateful that someone wants to be your friend. You are shallow and you only care about looks - you saying it's about personality is all bullshit.\n\nThat's it.\n\nI was a young, angry kid. I'm glad I'm the man I am today; I've had a lot of confidence issues which went away as I grew older. I went through many edgy phases, and it took all of these mistakes to learn them. So I feel empathy for incels because they don't know any better. They don't know just how wrong they are, because admitting fault and self-improvement takes time and effort; blaming and hating girls does not. Instead of hating girls, my only wish is that I started on self-improvement sooner.  \n\n\n**EDIT**: I am thankful that this struck a chord with a lot of people. Many are asking what \"self-improvement\" means in this context. I believe it is subjective, but to me, it meant physical, mental, and emotional. TLDR, hit the gym, get hobbies, make female friends for the sake of friendship, and do real kind things for the sake of goodness and kindness.  \n\n\nMore specifically, I started going to the gym after youtubing a lot of which exercises are the most important. A very helpful community like r/AskMen is a wonderful community full of great advice. Whenever a post pops up asking how to gain confidence, the top answers are always \"Hit the Gym\" - for good reason. So I did. I'd have to say that losing upwards of 25kg (55lbs) does change your own mental image. Suddenly, you feel like \"attractivity\" isn't as unattainable. Plus, you develop discipline and a much healthier lifestyle. That doesn't work for everyone, so I suggest investing time into a physical hobby. Cooking, learning an instrument, hiking, volunteering, dog walking - the list is endless. Seek personal improvement in something. Set goals and strive for them.  \n\n\nWith mental improvement (mostly towards women), it took a lot of self-reflection to get anywhere. It did help that I grew up with 4 sisters, so I saw how much each one of those \"handsome chads\" broke their hearts after being used. Suddenly, wanting to be \"Alpha\" wasn't as appealing. Having sisters taught me how to behave around girls, but not everyone has that privilege. For that, I heavily recommend r/AskWomen. It in a way humanises women/girls as it gave me perspective on their insight. **They're real people with real struggles, too.** Imagine just wanting to exist and to go on about your own thing, and some helpful guy comes along. He's thoughtful and mindful, might even be a little funny. Then out of nowhere, he wants to spend more time with you, intimately. However, you are just trying to figure this whole life thing out, and sinking a lot of time and energy into a relationship isn't something you're looking for right now. You don't want to lead him on, so you politely decline his courtship. Too bad, you're a slut now. Also a whore. Also, you're now too fat for him, and that pussy probably loose anyway from all those douchebags you've been fucking, instead of those caring, nice guys. Have a dickpic, bitch.   \n\\^ That's a good case scenario. Bad/worst case, they get violent and either stalk you/assault you.  \nThese stories are a dime a dozen both on r/AskWomen and r/niceguys.  \nIt also did help tremendously having female friends. The attraction may still be present, but friends you just want to exist with. Hanging out with them, seeing their struggles made me see that they didn't exist for my benefit. \n\nWith emotional improvement, this is the toughest that is hard to come back from. You need to be quite mindful and self-aware. I was such an edgy kid - I'm talking dying my hair black and straightening it, creeping people out purely for their reaction, using a thesaurus wherever possible, had the \"girls are sluts chasing tall chads\" mentality. I think doing good things for people as much as possible helped the most here. Whether it was being a pair of ears to vent to, helping family out with anything, filling in instrument roles for other peoples performances in music class - it all taught me what **real kindness** was. **Real kindness does not mean being a basic, civil human being.** To me, it means going out of your way to help someone **with the expectation of nothing in return**. Suddenly, annoying girls by calling them \"pretty\", and \"pure\", then getting mad when they don't compliment you back doesn't sound that kind anymore. \"Nice guys\" are actually unadjusted children currently incapable of self-reflection, rejection, and growth. All I can say is just focus on you. Don't focus on what you think people want out of you. \n\n\nI'm only 23 so I have a long way to go. Of course, I'm still human - I'm still capable of being an asshole. However, humans are also capable of many selfless acts. Feel empathy and sorry for the incel whose only explanation to their terrible perspective on reality is blamed away on other people.  \nI'm happy to talk to anyone further on self-improvement, my dms are open.",

            "I'm good friends with a guy who used be a part of a popular incel website, and he used to post on reddit, that's actually how we \"met.\"\n\nHe is still growing a lot as a person. He was incredibly angry. He blamed being \"ugly\" for his failure with women, and nothing anyone said could convince him that it wasn't that, it was that he thought that he would only be happy with a \"really hot\" girl.\n\nWe hung out once and were talking about how he wanted to approach women out with us - we were at a very nice place and the neighborhood had plenty of high-maintenance women, you know the kind wearing expensive athleisure and who spent their entire lives dieting and doing spinning classes. Expensive hair and nails, all that. Women who were REALLY dedicated to looking good. There were also the girls that worked there, and a few other customers about our age. He literally only saw the \"hot\" ladies. He was upset they'd never date anyone like him - someone who has pretty much no career ambition, doesn't want to \"conform\" by dressing or eating like they do, etc. And the average women in there just...weren't women to him. It was really dehumanizing, because I saw him as an equal, and although he was sort of my friend, he didn't see me as human as he saw the \"hot\" ladies in lululemon.\n\nHe eventually saw a therapist. Actually, a few therapists. It was mostly to tell people he'd done it, but he stuck with it. Saw a few until one worked. And he started working on himself. We texted, emailed, etc. Hung out a few times, but honestly he wasn't working too hard on making friends, because he'd constantly say stuff that was belittling or mean just to hurt me or women in general, because he could. He also had spent TOO MUCH time in \"black pill\" subreddits, because he brought it up on the one time I invited him out with my trivia team.\n\nA few months ago before I had some major health issues and the pandemic kicked off, he got back in touch. He sent me a long email that was actually okay(ish?). He had briefly dated a woman, they had slept together, and then he realized he still actually hated women and her too, because she wasn't living up to his fantasy. And that no one could. He realized he had a lot of conflicting ideas, that women shouldn't depend on men for money, but they also shouldn't be too career focused, etc. Just, a lot of bad stuff all rolled up into one. He had included a bunch of stuff I absolutely hated, like the fact that he still feels that women our age are \"past their prime\" and have \"cellulite.\"\n\nI basically didn't have a ton of energy to reply other than to tell him I hoped he kept working at it and wasn't dating anyone else until he got over actively hating women.\n\nedited to add: I definitely didn't think so many people would read and comment on this. First, the reason I reached out to him was that he described himself as around my age, living in my town, and I could see he was getting pretty radicalized, and he admitted he was seeing the attraction in a lot of the stuff that was just straight up fascist (interest in \"trad wives,\" and white nationalism, supporting Christian dominion-type stuff despite being an atheist, etc). He also really, really internalized stuff from porn. He started watching it very early in life, growing up he thought he'd be able to have women that looked like that, and they'd want sex that was like that, etc. That's what the email included, that he felt \"disappointed\" he wouldn't get the fantasy. He knew it was fucked up. He knew it was really bad, he just felt trapped into this gradual slide of his beliefs, and it was enabled by the internet (especially reddit and youtube).\n\nSecond edit: Yooooo, I'm not going to respond to PMs to \"debate\" you about incels, or incel-related topics. There are plenty of good resources out there, you need to seek them out.",
            "I am SOOOO glad I had my teenage years in the late eighties & early nineties before the internet, let alone social media.  Back then I couldn\u2019t get a date, let alone a girlfriend.  I was, to be fair, hardly a catch, suffering from persistent depressive disorder (form an orderly queue ladies!) and just generally having problems adapting.  I was acknowledged to be a bit weird.  I kind of accepted that it was my \u201cfault\u201d - which was bad for me short term but probably good (in the long term) for everyone concerned.  Ultimately I had to sort myself out.  But if I had had access to the sort of Incel shite online around today, I fear I would have lapped it up with a spoon.  A very large group of like minded people telling me it isn\u2019t my fault?!?! I can stop moping and start hating?  Fantastic!  I\u2019m in!  I would have been able to celebrate my status instead of reflecting on it and changing it.  I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have been more than tempted.\n\nSocial media has eroded, even destroyed, the concepts of privacy Gen X and before took for granted.  For us to be an outsider, to be weird, was something you could do alone and grow out of - if you wanted to of course.  For the later millennials and beyond, even in quarantine, there is no alone, no solitude to reflect.  Everything seems to be out there looking for likes and other forms of validation my addled mid 40s brain can\u2019t comprehend.  Incels are a form of social validation that could not really have existed before social media.  To get a network like that going would have been logistically and technically impossible on a scale beyond small outsider cliques in secondary schools.  Now they are a movement.  I somewhat pity Incels because,  but for 20 or so years, I could have been one of them.",
            "I never really considered myself an Incel at the time (mostly because I'd never heard the phrase) but I was very incelly in highschool, I was the type of person who would hold a door open and then wonder why girls weren't falling into my lap.\n\nTurns out highschool me wasn't that attractive and \"nice\" isn't a personality. I fell very much into the Chad's n stacey's frame of mind for a while.\n\nA lot of things changed really, but mostly I just grew up. It's a super childish view of things and just doesn't take into account that the people around you are...well people.\n\nIf someone held a door open for you, you wouldn't throw yourself at them. It's about the maturity in relationships.\n\n\nBut seriously Fuck highschool me, proper cunt",
            "I think I was maybe just a \u2018late bloomer\u2019. I had lots of female friends and was a bit geeky (before it was cool). When I went to Uni I realised that rejection wasn\u2019t as bad if I could laugh about it with my mates after. When I lost my V, it wasn\u2019t the big deal I thought it would be. Once that barrier was broken though, I really came into my own and never looked back.",

I used to, not hate women, but just wouldn't really bother with the pursuit because in my mind, I'd already summed up the result (rejection). I was also, like, super fucking thirsty which nobody ever wants and yeah it was a bad look all around. Eventually becam0e depressed, worked through some things with hallucinogens, yadda yadda yadda, and now here I am, a little wiser and a little less annoying a person.\n\nTl;dr: I matured and old me was a dickhead.\n\nDONT DO DRUGS.

            "I see my younger self as in severe need of help, help I never got. Although I did get plenty of criticism, criticism that was about as useful to me as an instruction manual written in Chinese.",
            "I had a span of self-induced loathing in my early 20\u2019s that had me in the same mindset as incels. Minus the whole urge to kill and harass, but I blamed women for them not wanting to talk to me. For rejecting me. I believe someone up above talked about maturity and who they were in High School. I, too, was a D bag. Decent looking guy but shit person. Shallow is a perfect adjective for my High School self. That whole viewpoint or self-importance carried into my early 20\u2019s and it didn\u2019t work out well. It wasn\u2019t until I was 27/28 and started getting into Philosophy while getting stoned off my ass because I was escaping my problems. \n\nPhilosophy changed me. It made me self reflect and force me to be honest with myself. To hold myself accountable and also to forgive myself for all the mistakes I have made and to realize I have the power to change/improve myself. That\u2019s when my \u201cINCEL/Women Blaming\u201d ended. I\u2019m glad I survived that period of my life. \n\nI think a lot of what goes on is how relationships in our society are portrayed. Speaking for myself, a guy that grew up in the 90\u2019s, it always seemed that every movie the woman was the one needing saving and the way to a woman\u2019s heart was to be a gentleman. This whimsical fairy tale taught to us at an early age sets people up for false expectations of both roles in a relationship. There really is no teaching about how hard relationships are and that no relationship should be the reason you are happy. \n\nIf I was taught that growing up maybe things would have been different for me. But that was a big personal problem for me. Trying to validate my happiness through a relationship. Left me wide open to get taken advantage of and pushed further into that toxic mindset. \n\n\nBut, looking back I\u2019m glad I went through it. I finally found the love I\u2019ve always wanted and I couldn\u2019t be happier. My relationships feel more real now and that I have a new realization and perspective on my relationships. I DEFINITELY look at women a lot differently now and have made multiple reach outs to some classmates from high school to apologize for how much of a pig I was. Cunt is the perfect high school nickname for me. \n\nBut yea \u201cINCEL\u201d mentality seems to come from the self-hatred/denial of one\u2019s own faults/flaws. Women are not sexual objects. You don\u2019t deserve their attention. They are human beings and deserve that respect. \n\nOnce, those moronic INCELs  realize they wasted the best parts of their lives blaming others for their own failures instead of making changes that will be their greatest regret in life. \n\nKnowing ,that all along, they had the power to change their situation. \n\n\n\nPS - If you made it this far, wow, I\u2019m impressed. Thanks for taking the time reading my comment. If anyone wants to chat DM me. I know during these troubling times, lack of connection/social interactions can strain mental health. If you need/want someone to talk to or just vent to. Hit me up. I have nothing better to do, but chat it up and make friends. Alright. Cheers :).\n\nEdit: Holy Shit! Thank you kind stranger for the Gold! My first Gold! Unreal :)",
            "I never blamed women for the fact I couldn\u2019t get a  date when I was younger. But I definitely felt like something was very wrong with me back then. From my POV I was doing all the same things my dumber and meaner friends were and yet they had lots of girlfriends and I had none. \n\nI also had the mindset that was normal back then of \u201cif you like a girl you can get her to like you\u201d that most movies, advice from other people, or \u201cyou can get any girl you want bro\u201d type of guys would have you believe. So I spent pretty much all of my grade and high school years trying to get a handful of girls I really liked to like me back. Which I think made me think dating was mission impossible. I also suffered from the \u201cgirls like x\u201d type of advice that makes you think becoming x makes girls like you. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was older that I asked myself \u201cwhat could a girl you don\u2019t like do to make you like her\u201d and realized that all the beliefs and advice I had was bullshit that my POV changed. \n\nYes i would think it was unfair that all these girls I liked ignored me until I realized I was doing the same thing to the few girls that did like me. \n\nI used to think dating wasn\u2019t fair. And although I still think some people have a much easier time than others I\u2019ve since realized we\u2019re all pretty much trying to do the same thing. And behaviors that I saw as unfair towards me I was guilty of myself. \n\nSo my expectations were off. The advice around me was god awful. I did have flaws, lots of them, but mostly I was to worried about my weaknesses rather than playing my strengths. \n\nLooking back I spent a lot of those years hurt because although I didn\u2019t know what I was doing I didn\u2019t realize everyone around me didn\u2019t know what they were doing either. \n\nIf it\u2019s any advice I have for younger people is this, realize your dating someone equally new to this so don\u2019t take all the fuck ups personally.",
            "In high school I was 300 pounds and my only conversations were about video games. Specifically World of Warcraft. I was nice to lots of girls. Thought I was the perfect gentleman like my mom taught me to be. I had female friends. However, I never could get a girlfriend or a girl interested in me except for one time a girl dated me a 4 hours as a dare and then publicly dumped me in the lunch room.\n\nThis caused me to start to despise women. Eventually, I learned it was my terrible hygiene and excessive weight that was causing girls to not like me. I started going to the gym and got into great shape. Lost 110 pounds, got a new style, started dressing and smelling good. All the sudden girls couldn\u2019t get enough of me when I went to college. \nDue to all the rejection I had in middle/high school, I actually developed an addiction. I would date a different girl every month and was notorious for one night stands. I looked at women as a game to fill my missing void. I couldn\u2019t get enough. This went on for years until I realized I had a problem. Now years later I am married and in decent shape but not gym obsessed like before. I still see myself as both people. The guy obsessed with video games and food and then the guy who loves working out and partying.  As I type this it is odd reflecting on how I lived two different lives over 15 years.",
            "I had this exact mentality a long time ago before incel was a word, before chad/stacy was a thing online.  I'm talking early 2000s.  My friends refer it as my \"I'm a piece of shit phase\", because I would always call myself a piece of shit, ugly, etc..  Never understood why I couldn't get girls (despite reaffirming that I'm a good guy \\[lol niceguys amirite\\]), but looking back, I'm must have come across as a creepy nice guy.  Whenever I read up on the incel movement/subculture, the memes, all that shit, I just sadly chuckle and think \"damn.  That was exactly it.\".  I hate how I relate to that stuff, I was in the blackest, darkest depression possible, and believed sex to be only worth of man.  All of the associated emotions: anger, envy to my friends.  It was bad.\n\nAnyways, to answer your question, cringe, lots of cringe, and profound regret at lots of wasted time in anger during my younger years.",
            "I despise that guy. He\u2019s an embarrassment to me.\n\nSomehow, it never occurred to me until I had sex that women are literally just normal people like you or I. They laugh, they swear, they fart, they shit, they even (gasp) *enjoy sex*!",
            "I dated a dude earlier that was pretty much an incel although he did use escorts for sex. He called himself a feminist but he hated girls who he would think were 'Staceys'. He thought woman didn't like him because he was ugly. \n\nHe did have alot of issues with depression etc. He couldn't wrap his head around that the reason girls didn't like him is that he didn't take care of himself he was lazy and just played games all day (i had to force him to shower), he had a job but would call in sick almost everyday, his mum was a helicopter mum i went over to his house for the first time and his mum was frantically changing sheets on his bed, he just got nasty at the end he would tell me my spiritual beliefs were wrong and laugh at me. That was 2 months of my life I will never get back and I've been off the dating scene since as I am exhausted and disgusted I let myself into that situation.\n\nI really hope he ends up realising hes the problem and not everyone around him.",
            "So I lost my virginity at 23. Around 19 to 21 I floated on the edge of incel circles. I had friends on Tumblr that would go on to become Incels, I followed people who spoke of misogyny as if it was justified by the way women treated them. I browsed red pill sites and even read a few articles from Return of Kings while nodding my head. \n\nAt the time, I viewed relationships and sex as a transactional experience. An experience that I would never be able to engage in because I was ugly, I had trouble connecting with people, I lived paycheck to paycheck and was still at my parents place. There was no way anyone could ever be attracted to me because from a transactional point of view I had nothing to offer. \n\nI had never had a whole lot of women in my life. Most didn't talk to me, at the time I thought it was because I was boring and ugly. Nowadays I know it's because I was a rude little shit who wouldn't make eye contact. My only major contact with women had been with my mother and my sister and both of them for dumber than nails.sub human trailer trash. (My mother is a lovely lady and I regret ever viewing her this way. My sister could still probably make for a good episode of Jerry Springer though.) \n\nIt got to the point where I had surrounded myself with people who had an underlying disdain for women. We talked a lot about social power structures and how they were designed to keep people like us down. We talked about how we thought it should be, creating scenarios where women existed to please us, not the other way around. We acted entitled and like we were cheated by life with our bad looks and lack ambition. We used dramatic examples of male death such as war to prove to ourselves how much worse men have it than women.\n\nSometimes horrifyingly sexist comments were made but we would ignore them as someone just venting. Jimmy didn't really want to drug and take advantage of his roommates girlfriend. Hes just saying that because he wants to be loved by his roommate's girlfriend and he sees no other way to make that happen. We thought of these as harmless fantasies.\n\nAround 23 I tried LSD for the first time with a guy who I knew from highschool but had never been close with. We started hanging out more and I started spending a lot of time at his place with him and his girlfriend. I got pretty close with his girlfriend on a platonic level and she was probably the first woman I ever fully viewed as human. Not an object of my fantasies who should cater to my every whim but a human being with dreams and goals and self disappointments. \n\nI met a girl online around this time as well. We started sleeping together. She was a disaster of human being. She had gone through a lot growing up and now she was so deep in a depression than she would abandon people who treated her well to spend time with people she hated because she thought that was what she deserved. It was a feeling I understood well and I began feeling for her as a human being. What we had was not healthy but it was an important learning experience. In a lot of ways she confirmed all the horrible things me and my friends had thought about women, but having gotten to know her I had back story as to why. \n\nHaving these two women in my life, very different women mind you, got me to start seeing them as people. I started arguing back when my friends would say sexist things because now they were talking about people that I respected and cared about. I cut off contact with those people.\n\nLife went on. I no longer speak with either of the girls in question but am in a ridiculously happy relationship. Occasionally I go lurk on my old friends, less so nowadays, and check out my old internet stomping grounds. They are a cesspit of misogyny and that weird \"us versus them\" mentality that permeates the worse parts of humanity. Bitter men in their 50s take advantage of young lost boys in their teens to convince them that the male/female dynamic is.weighed against them. Radicalize them enough and maybe you end up with another Elliot Rodgers. \n\nI'm convinced what those young boys need more than anything is a couple of female (I feel weird using this word due to the disdain it was often said with among my old friends) friends and some perspective. Maybe that's a personal bias because it turned out that's all I needed.",
            "I wasn't really an uncle as I started having sex after high school but man I had no idea my tendencies were so bad and why I couldnt ever get a girl. I was such an idiot.

            "Not a dude, or an incel, I know I know BUT I have intimate knowledge to the creation of one! \n\nSo I dated this dude that was probably a bit autistic (no issue on the surface, I get that) his behaviors were bizarre. I was coming out of a highly abusive relationship (only other one I'd ever had) so I saw him as quirky rather than someone who clearly needed help. He wasn't good with women because he would get super focused on topics and use the same jokes/phrases OVER and OVER. Which didn't bother me, I'm pretty chill. Well we dated a couple years and his best friend's wife left him. The dude started going to MGTOW and shit. Telling my boyfriend things like virgins are the way to go and to get a woman young, like 18 (we were in our 30's!). Well my boyfriend listens to this and starts acting weird-er. He tries to veto my clothing when we go out, tells me I'm less valuable since I've had kids, pulls a gun on me because I didn't listen, insists I quit my job so I can take care of him. And that's just a few. Of course, I'm unintentionally plotting my escape. I make friends outside the house (ones that he follows me to without telling to \"make sure no dudes try anything with you\"), I meet another man. We become good friends. He's a cool guy and just lets me talk sometimes. The boyfriend decides I'm cheating, says we are going to have an open relationship ok cool. I fuck this dude friend, he goes to a party but doesn't bring anyone home and no one wants to be around him too much because his incel shit. He finds out I fucked this guy and loses. His. Mind. \n\nHe throws a fit, breaks a bunch of my stuff, threatens to kill me and I flee to my new friend. He starts saying I was a cheating slut and he did nothing wrong. That he was devoted and took care of me etc...He still hasn't found anyone and is lonely and bitchy\n\nI ain't even mad tho, because the support and kindness my friend gave me led to us getting married last year.

            "I always had \"more like a friend\" relationships with girls (and then women) until I found someone with who things just went naturally. It's at this moment that I realised how bad I was acting all those years.\n\nI used to find somebody and become kinda obsessed over them. Thinking about what it could be like to have a relationship with them when I went to sleep, dreaming about them. So in my mind, we knew each other VERY well. In reality... Not so much. I was so surprised when I was getting rejected or so-called \"friend-zoned\" because I thought we were a perfect fit! As I once read, before a person \"friend-zones\" you, you girlfriend/boyfriend-zoned her/him first. \n\nAt least I didn't discover the term Incel at that time. Old me was a piece of shit and full of hormones.",
            "I knew a guy who was involuntarily celibate but not what I'd call an \"incel\". He was my husband's roommate/best friend from college and eventually became my roommate. He was a virgin at 24 (not that there's anything wrong with that) and had also never dated. He definitely felt sorry for himself that nobody liked him etc etc. He was overweight and didn't take care of himself very much and was socially awkward. \n\nWell, he went to the doctors and discovered he had low testosterone. After giving himself shots on the regular, he actually started to really blossom. He started working out, took care of himself and actually became confident enough to approach women. This was almost 10 years ago. His wedding was last fall.",
            "I used to be horrible, but I was living in an abusive home so I thought that was the only way I was gonna find anything. I wanted so much to find someone to \"save\" me as in I have an excuse to leave the toxic shit that's going on at home and never look back. I cared so much what people thought of me I became extremely desperate to find someone who just showed me any basic form of human decency which is something that I lacked in my life. Anyone who showed any attention I immediately got attached to.\n\nGot out of the abusive home and started experimenting with psychedelics, dropped some acid, and had a mini spirit journey where I took a good hard look at myself and was ashamed of what I was. Nothing will make you change faster than being ashamed of yourself every time you trip. And boy did I overdo it on the acid, learn when to stop kids.\n\nDecided that I should live my life how I want to and not how I think I need to, stopped obsessing about finding someone that would save me and just started living life, and eventually, I started to find people and actually got a few relationships out of it, they didn't last but it was better than what I was doing before. I learned that if you try to force something then it won't happen, that's true about all relationships, friends, family, lovers, and whatever else.\n\nAfter all that I started focusing on me, in a good healthy way. I started eating better, exercising, and going to therapy when I could afford it. Eventually, I went form 400 pounds of meat that showered once a month to a solid 260 pounds of kinda muscle that showers every day. And I feel so much better with the change of lifestyle, not only has my physical health improved but also my mental health, for once I'm actually happy being me which was something I had never felt before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR- Got out of an abusive home, dropped acid, had a spirit journey, and changed my lifestyle, lost a bunch of weight, shower regularly, and am finally happy.",
            "TIL what this trending word means",
            "When I was in 8-9th grade I had glasses, braces and not a lot of self esteem. At one point for some reason I stopped washing or trying anything with my hair, yeah idk either. I definitely looked at the super popular kids who were also rich and just disliked them for whatever reason I came up with. I would hate on girls even the ones that talked to me a lot, I was a piece of shit for a solid year. My saving grace was I got paired up with a very popular boy in my school and he was the nicest person I had ever met. I went to his house to work on a project, multiple popular girls who I had crushes on came by cause they lived in the same neighborhood and again very nice to me. I remember very specifically one of them asked me why I wore that same hoodie all the time, gave me some advice on dressing better. I went home that night and asked my mom if we could go shopping for different clothes. Now I didnt become the best of friends with all of them, but they gave the confidence to put myself out into other circles until I found some great friends, and then eventually some great girlfriends. Sometimes the lesson is: hey maybe if I dislike everyone and am always mad, maybe other people arent the problem.",
            "I can add my experience to this thread. \n\nI was never very successful with women growing up (no girlfriends in school, first gf I was 19), I never had any flings and had just two short term gfs in my life, at 19 and 26 (I also first had sex at 26). I never knew exactly why I couldn't seem to attract anyone, as I always had good jobs, was responsible with money, not bad looking, was fit and active, dressed well, didn't view women as objects or hate them, and was a good hearted guy. The women I met and developed feelings for just happened to not feel the same way apart from the two I dated briefly, and as hard as that always is to deal with, I couldn't feel mad at them; they didn't owe me their feelings just because I liked them. I was not one for going out to clubs and trying to hook up either.\n\nI was effectlively celibate for 11 years until this past December. Now although I never was resentful of women or felt that I was entitled to sex by any means, I also knew I was straying dangerously close to incel territory, just by how alone I was and how unnattractive I seemed to be. It would frustrate me seeing genuinely awful, toxic men get to be with women and effectively ruin their lives. Having said that, I also knew that the whole 'women love a bad boy' trope was not exactly legit (it's more a case of a guy being super charming and sweet and lowering the girl's guard, then once they're together and she has strong feelings he starts to reveal the shitty behaviour. Because she's emotionally invested, he knows she'll put up with it. It's just textbook manipulation). \n\nMy being alone led to me developing depression, which I suffered with for about 11 years. That obviously made me even more attractive. I fell for a girl I worked with during those dark years, and it was just awful; my broken mind had no healthy way of processing those feelings, and I just imploded. I ended up having a nervous breakdown at work and had to get signed off. \n\nAnyway. Fast forward 5 years and after countless unsuccessful Tinder dates, my good friend is telling me about his new gf and how amazing she is. Now, they like to swing, and have threesomes/foursomes with other couples. He said after telling her about my history, she said she couldn't understand why I've found it so difficult to even hook up with someone, let alone find a relationship. He then told me she said she'd fuck me. I was like, thanks mate, that's kind of her to say. No, no, he replied; she will actually fuck you. With me. Help me fuck her? So, loooong story short, the next week my 11 year drought was ended by a threesome with my best friend and his girlfriend. And it was fucking glorious. \n\n(if anyone wants that story, I'll happily tell you. It was the most wholesome threesome you could imagine, full of respect, asking for/receiving consent, and giggles)\n\nCouple weeks after that, he says he has a friend who is looking for some fun, if I'd be interested. Sure, I say, and gives her my number. Week after she messages me and then comes round and we have a fun night. And with that, I go from feeling like an absolute freak to a completely normal person.\n\nLooking back, I can only think my problem was confidence. Low self-esteem, which must've been obvious. I didn't know how to make that step and make a move on someone I liked, I was just too subtle and held back. I always felt that just one sexual experience was all I needed to 'sort myself out', and I now that I've had several, I was right. I'm a completely different person. My confidence is restored, I feel normal, my anxiety has gone, and I'm just more relaxed and happy within myself. The barrier has been broken; now I know I am sexually attractive to women, meeting someone is not an impossible mountain to climb. I know I'll meet someone and have a fulfilling relationship now, it's just a matter of finding the right person.\n\nSorry for the essay, it's literally the first time I've talked about my journey (FUCK I apologise for using that term)!",
            "I have a buddy who's 37 and never had sex. Idk if he's even kissed a lady. But from listening to him he seems to believe that he's not good enough for a good girl to want him. He also talks about it being special and all that but has unreasonable high standards. Like there was a lady at his work who I thought was interested in him but he just sets himself up to fail by being too shy and finding outs for himself. Oh no she's got kids oh she's not thin enough for me and on and on. It doesn't help that he's really awkward normally but I honestly think if he just tried to be real with them and lower his high ass standards just a little bit he could find a nice woman to be with.",
            "I just, grew up. I was a fucking asshole and made this girl\u2019s life miserable. Basically bullied this girl back then. All just because she wouldn\u2019t be my girlfriend. I thought  I was entitled to her because we were good friends. \n\nI was so embarassed last year that I texted her and apologized. She said it was cool. We talk sometimes.\n\nI\u2019m 19 now; I think I grew out of it maybe 2-3 years ago. Had sex for the first time a year and a half ago. It really made me feel like shit (and made me cringe) to realize all the creepy and mean shit i did in the beginning of high school. Sad stuff.",

            "Can I poke my head in as someone who identified as incel until I realized what-all kind of baggage that label came with? Because JFC, was I unaware of the online culture about that sort of garbage at the time.\n\nSince I became aware, I kind of threw that label away and just said \"yeah, I'm not trying very hard, and maybe my standards are too high in a town of less than 10,000 people.\"\n\nStill haven't had any successful romantic endeavors since then, but I feel a lot better about myself having decided that: 1. It's at least partly up to me, and 2. If I'm not getting any, I can pursue other endeavors and wait for better opportunities.",
            "It's a bit like empirical science. A lot of useless speculations disappear like morning mist in the sun, when you apply 'try and fail again and again until you have some degree of success'. It takes practice to be a human being, and some people postpone their practicing indefinitely.\n  A big problem is that some people believe what THEY think other people think of them, ie they live in a prison built and maintained by themselves."

Unfortunately my job both requires me to be physically active outside and take client meetings in a quasi-white collar environment, so I can't wear full face masks. All the movement makes my scarf shift down after a while, wearing a mask is just easier against wind exposure.",

I have allergies and masks help with it and masks also mean I don't need to wear makeup on a daily basis (I'm not comfortable with my own skin), but I really really miss wearing bright lipstick and smiling at people (and having visible facial expressions in general).
