            "It takes 2-3 days to cremate a body on a standard bonfire.\n\nEDIT: So I\u2019ve never had a comment get such an insane number of upvotes and replies before (not even close - WOW). A lot of people are asking how I know this, so I figured I\u2019d explain.\n\nI studied for a rather specific masters degree around psychological trauma. It was particularly pertinent to the army, so within our small class were a few officers from the army being sent to touch up their learning. One of them was an army doctor who had been with them for more than 30 years. \n\nCan\u2019t remember exactly how the conversation got to this point but he made some quip about having to burn a body, and it taking 2 or 3 days to burn on a bonfire. We asked him why he was burning a body, and his only response was \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to bury it\u201d. We never could convince him to elaborate further.\n\nIt turned out that one of his deployments was to Rwanda as part of Operation Gabriel immediately after the genocide. If I HAD to guess, it might have been something to do with that? When dealing with more than a million dead bodies, many were likely never identified or claimed by next of kin, and perhaps for some reason this one couldn\u2019t be buried with the others? (Again, this is purely speculation so take it with a pinch of salt!)",

There are two buildings at West Point that were built next to each other, but with a roughly 3ft gap between them.  The gap was roofed over, making it essentially a room that isn't in either building.  Call that \"Room P\" (for \"Passage\").  Sorry if that description sucks.  Room P is only reachable through a window that used to be on the older of the two buildings.  That window is on the opposite side from the door of a janitorial storage closet.  It is painted over, and by all appearances *seems* to never have been opened since whatever renovations caused this strange configuration.    \n  \nRoom P goes from the top of both buildings to ground level.  It's basically a big, dark, cave with no lighting.  There is a metal ladder next to the window that leads down to the ground.  The space between the two buildings is so narrow that a normal sized man climbing on the ladder can't help but occasionally scrape his back against building behind him.  \n  \nAt ground level, the floor is littered with old bricks, dirt/dust, mold, etc. (probably rat feces too).  There's just barely enough room to turn around.  You really have to crab walk to get anywhere.  At the base of the building with the ladder (the same one that has the window), there is a 4'x4' plywood access panel held on by four screws.  The wood around these screws has rotted in such a way that lifting the panel up and tilting it toward you is all you need to remove it.  \n  \nThis gives you access to another room, that at one point was probably the bottom of an elevator shaft (based on fittings in the floor and the way the ceiling is bricked up.   The room is empty except for similar construction debris.  Call this \"Room S.\"  Room S has no doors or exits other than the access panel.  It's about 9ft to a side, low ceilings, bare concrete floors and plaster-on-brick walls. \n  \nStarting over from the top, there is a room in one of the buildings at West Point (the United States Military Academy) that can only be entered through a passage that goes through the janitorial storage closet, out the window, down the ladder, through the narrow Room P, and through the access panel (after removing it).  \n  \nTwo determined cadets, wishing to get away with sexual activity (very very prohibited), can duck into the closet, navigate the passage, go into Room S (for \"Sexy times\"), and proceed to bang each other silly without worrying about being disturbed.  \n  \nTo cadets who might be reading this, determining the location of Room S is an exercise left to the student.

            "The movie \"The Lobster\" stands out to me. Spoilers/disturbing/suicide warning\n\nThe premise (from what I remember) of the movie is society mandates marriage, if you don't marry you are sent to a hotel, where you have 30 days to meet your spouse. If you don't, you are turned into an animal.\n\n First would be when a depressed lady was introduced and tries to get with the main character, cause she only had a few days left to partner up. She mentions she might kill herself if she doesn't but is worried cause her room is only on the 3rd or 4th floor. A few scenes later the main character is having some serious dialogue with a lady who is known for being cruel and heartless, whom he is trying to court. The lady from earlier, at this point, jumps out her window and is visibly bleeding out and screaming in agony just feet away from the 2 in dialogue. Because he is acting cruel to impress this other lady and she is pretty evil to begin with, they completely ignore what just happened. I kid you not its like a nearly 2 minute scene of serious dialogue while this lady is in the background dying in pain.",

I was \"done\" with the Japanese language at that point, but because near the end, my class literally couldn't be run without me, I stayed. I stayed because I felt like it would be a waste if I changed it. Like everything I had done up to that point was a lie.\n\nHere I am with a degree in Japanese Language/History and Culture and I'm not at all interested in it anymore.\n\nI'm looking for a real job, have been since I got out of college but for now I work for a temp company for a Japanese air conditioning company.",

            "Had a 3 year period between 19 and 22 where I was fully committed to new age bullshit. Like everything, crystal energy powers, energy healing any health issue, reiki, metaphysics, all that stuff. \n\nTo the point my mom was into it too and she met some \"energy healer\" family from was originally from the Ukraine and then lived in Florida in a giant rural mansion property. They befriended us, and invited us to live on that property for a few months studying energy healing and metaphysics. \n\nSo we went, left our lives in California to pursue this goal. It went alright initially, other than the constant 1000 dollar \"classes\" on metaphysics that were just us and one of the other family members being the teacher. You'd think that would've been the breaking point, but no I was a firm believer. \n\nMy actual breaking point occured when I was 23-24. I have poor eyesight, can't see shit past 8 inches from my face. I was wearing CRT contacts up until this point (hard lenses you wear at night, take off in the morning, and your eye holds the shape for 24 hours so you can see without glasses or soft contacts). They told me they could fix my eyesight, but it would require me to stop wearing my lenses. I was wearing these lenses since I was 12 and they also prevent my prescription from getting worse, just freezes it whenever you first start wearing them. So this was a big deal to just stop them. \n\nWell guess what dumb move I made...stopped wearing them and was then told I couldn't get glasses either. So now I'm stuck basically blind for 12 MONTHS hoping my eyes will get magically fixed by a dude waving his hand across the table from me for 10 mins once a week. As if that's an alternative to lasik. Unfortunately this meant I could no longer drive myself, or be independent or even get a job. I developed a bad habit of just watching YouTube videos 12 hours a day with my face 8 inches from the screen. This eventually led my double vision because a muscle in my right eye got a bit weak from this. \n\nWhen 12 months went by and not only was my eyesight not better, but I was still technically growing a bit so my prescription actually got worse by a good amount. Went from -4.5 to my current -6.75, plus having double vision that require thick prism lenses too. This broke me, burned me, and completely destroyed my world view of the previous 4 years. Overnight I was done. \n\nThis fucked me up a lot mentally, because I was so deep into that movement that I no longer use any scientific understandings of the world like I did growing up. It caused a lot of existential anxiety, and ultimately led to getting triple diagnosed with a panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and HF-ASD (this one was hinted at from tests done as a child). I had sever 12 hour long panic attacks that changed my brain chemistry permanently, and now I have to live in a new normal that's objectively worse internally than how I used to be. \n\nI've healed a lot since then, moved back to my home state of California, and have relearned my scientific understanding of the universe since then. I'm 29 now, and I still feel traumatized from that experience. Even after therapy, and meds. It only helps to a certain degree, but my fundamental reality got fucked and never properly fixed. Plus you want to talk about trust issues? How about both your parents and everyone you knew telling you one thing is true, for YEARS, only to discover in my own it's all bullshit. I used to be too gullible, and now I'm overcorrecting and very skeptical of everyone and everything. \n\nSadly my parents only learned not to give money to people like that but still totally believe in energy work nonsense. It causes a lot of conflict when I interact with them, and that pains me. Because they are such good people otherwise. \n\nI still get furious at myself and the people who convinced me to believe in that bullshit. It became the most pivotal moment of my life, and has caused me permanent health problems as a result. Don't let anyone convince you of anything without getting some other opinions and research first. Don't trust your mind.\n\nEdit - I appreciate all the interest you guys have in my story. I never knew it was anything too special or unique. My parents have downplayed it the entire time to the point I didn't think what I felt was valid. Even when I told the story to friends they didn't have the same reaction you guys have. \n\nIdk about writing a book though lol, but you definitely have made it clear I can present the full version of this story somewhere and that there could be some interest in it. I can gladly answer any questions you have. Maybe I'll do an AMA on one of the subs for that.\n\nEdit 2 - there are many details and parts of this story I've left out for the sake of being concise. I can answer questions, and elaborate on anything you would like to know more about. Details about the energy healer family, what I specifically believed in and \"practiced\", and the years of aftermath that have left their scars one to this day. I'm glad people can use my story as an example of what not to do in life when faced with similar choices and beliefs.",

My client, who had clearly just taken a huge bong rip at 8 AM and who was wearing an all-pink velvet track suit was looking at me like I was the biggest idiot in the world. \n\nI corrected the plea form. The judge made me wait until the very end of the calendar to take my plea. Afterward, he called me up to the bench. In private he told me, \u201cSorry to ream you like that. Everyone messes the plea form up so I always pick the youngest lawyer to yell at. The older guys will grumble and complain, but if you noticed they all fixed their own forms and we didn\u2019t have any more problems. Keeps the calendar running smooth. Where did you go to law school?\u201d After that he invited me into his office for coffee and gave me some really good life/work advice.

            "Represented a woman charged with multiple very serious felonies. She insisted that in the months before the offense, she\u2019d been seriously dating one of the detectives who ultimately wound up investigating and testifying in her case.  For a variety of reasons, I trusted this client and believed her, even though the detective never disclosed the relationship in his report.\n\nSo, during his testimony, I ask \u201cDetective Smith, you had a romantic relationship with Ms. Defendant, correct?\u201d He goes \u201cWhat? No!\u201d and is visibly offended. The judge Iooks at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind, the commonwealth attorney audibly says \u201cwhat?\u201d, I\u2019m freaking out because a large part of my cross and argument was focused on the bias formed by the prior relationship, and now I\u2019ve got nothing and I\u2019ve lost all credibility.\n\nI try again, \u201cDetective Smith, have you had a sexual relationship with Ms. Defendant?\u201d.  As the Commonwealth rises to object and the Judge starts to scold me, the detective goes \u201cOh, yea. We\u2019ve had sex, it just wasn\u2019t very...romantic.\u201d\n\nEdit/Update: State is Virginia. The jury acquitted my client of the relatively minor charge that the detective in my story was involved with, but convicted of the other, much more serious charges that detective had nothing to do with. There was a confession and video on the serious charges, so it was kind of a no-brainer. Sorry I'm being kind of intentionally vague, there are no confidentiality concerns (since this all happened in open court), but its distasteful to give out too much information about a client. \n\nThe detective was not \"disqualified\", his testimony was not thrown out. Impeachment, no matter how good, doesn't result in you getting to throw out a witness's testimony entirely. By the way, it wasn't really the sex that was the issue, it was that he didn't disclose it to anyone and his repeated insistence under questioning that he didn't disclose it because it was irrelevant. Like Watergate, its not the crime, its the coverup that gets you. But I don't get to demand the judge throw out the testimony or that charge just because the cop failed to disclose a prior relationship with the defendant. I just get to point it out, argue it in closing, and then hope the jury also sees the relevance. ",

When they tried to reactivate the case with an administrator, I reminded them that my motion was the first thing to get heard once the case was restarted.  They actually read it, knew they had no chance of beating it, and discontinued against my client without ever having to argue the motion.",

She was asked at several points if she wanted her new husband to leave the room while she did this, but declined.  \n\nLet's just say it was *extremely* kinky, she confirmed it was true, and the only mention of her now-husband was that he was boring in bed but she was going to marry him because she couldn't get her first, second or third choice.

My ex had legal statutes written on small sheets of paper she had torn out of books in the jail library, and she kept arguing with the judge after being told that none of it mattered. \n\nAfter the fifth time my ex interrupted the judge with her nonsense, the judge slammed her hands down, stood up, leaned over her bench, and told my ex that she had been a juvenile court judge for 20 years and was well aware of the statutes. If she interrupted one more time then she would be held in contempt and spend several months more in jail. \n\nMy lawyer held up his folder in front of his face to hide his grin during this exchange.

            "I was interning during law school prosecuting domestic violence cases. The Deputy DA asked me to talk for the first time during a guy's arraignment, for beating his wife. An arraignment is when the Defendant hears the charges against them and pleads guilty or not guilty basically. When the judge calls on me to speak, I got insanely nervous. And told the Defendant that his charge carried a maximum penalty of 30 YEARS, when it was actually 30 DAYS. \n\nHe freaks out, the crowd (some in the gallery were his family and friends) gasps. The judge basically stops me and says \"I think you mean 30 days counselor...\" After which everyone, including the defendant, laughed at me...\n\n*Edit because a lot of you are worried about this: the evidence was pretty weak and the facts did not bear charging anything other than the lowest level misdemeanor, which, in conjunction with this being a first offence meant that we were seeking two things primarily: counseling/ anger management classes, and probation. The intent being that any future problems can hopefully be avoided, and if not, we could stick the Defendant with a harsh punishment the next time when we'd hopefully have better facts/ evidence.",

            "I did jury service back in the 90\u2019s in the U.K., a four day trial where an estate manager (dude in charge of the farms on a big landowners estate) was on trial for growing and distributing cannabis. The police had raided the greenhouses and surrounding land and found tonnes of weed in all stages of production. Dude claims that he is addicted to cannabis and because his tolerance is so high after smoking so much for so long that he can only get a buzz from the very tips of the plant, where the THC content is most intense. Asks the court to believe that he just discards the rest of the plant, doesn\u2019t sell it, doesn\u2019t even give it away, just destroys the rest of the crop. So it\u2019s the last day of evidence, where both sides sum up their case and remind the jury of the salient points of what\u2019s been said. Dude himself has been quiet and respectful throughout, smart suit, softly spoken, stuck to his answers. I\u2019d say the jury is not buying his claim and as the judge reminds us, it\u2019s not about whether we think it should be legalised, it\u2019s not about whether we think he has even sold the remaining bits of his plants, all we need to find him guilty is to think that beyond reasonable doubt, he had at some point shared a single joint with a friend, and that that was enough to convict him for supply on the counts against him. So the jury isn\u2019t buying his story but we are also looking at him thinking he\u2019s quite old, isn\u2019t doing anyone any real harm etc, is unlikely to be running a massive dealing empire. Then on that last day, the public gallery (which has been empty all week) is suddenly full of the most blatantly stonery stoners you\u2019ve seen in your life. One of them is even wearing an Adidas \u201cadihash\u201d t-shirt. The jury files in, we sit down, we look at the public gallery and I think it\u2019s safe to say we STARE at them.

            "The best \"oh shit\" moments are when your opposing counsel or opposing client says or does something that wins the case for you.  True, in civil cases you usually know what will happen ahead of time, but in my state discovery in smaller civil cases is more limited, and clients don't always want to spend $30K when we can get the same result for $10K.\n\nIn an adverse possession case the witness only needed to say \"I used that area as my backyard,\" and I fully expected him to say this.  It would harm my case, but I knew I could get around it.  When asked about his use of the area, he said, \"No, I never really went back there, didn't use it at all.\"  Lost the case for the other side, and I could barely keep a straight face.  It was completely opposite of what the witness had told opposing counsel off the record; apparently the \"under penalty of perjury\" made him change his story.\n\nI had another case about losing multi-unit dwelling insurance because a guy's place was a fire hazard.  I asked him if his personal insurer knew about the fire hazard.  \"Yeah, and the jerks canceled my policy!\"  \n\nI also love it when I have a difficult party on the other side and the judge rips them a new one.  I had a convoluted case with a lot of parties about nothing at all.  The plaintiff was heinous.  The six or seven attorneys were working out calendars with the judge when the plaintiff starts yelling at her attorney from across the courtroom because she didn't like that he had conceded some little non-issue.

This kid was on the honor roll at school, his family seemed kind and were involved, he wrote poetry and played instruments. I actually believed it was a legit mistaken identity case. I went to meet with one of the kid's mentors for a character reference.... and he exactly matched the description of the other robber.",

I can't afford a lawyer but the law was pretty clear. She goes through three lawyers, each of them quit in turn.

Unfortunately for him, when the judge asked about his urine positive and what happened, he said, \"I was out partying, there was drugs, I wanted drugs.\"  No remorse.  He was made to go to more intense substance abuse treatment and added time to his mandate.",

            "I am not a lawyer, but I work for a lawyer.\n\nMany years ago my home county went through an abrupt and involuntary change of judge when one of the sitting judges was suspended and disbarred for bad conduct.  This process took months where our criminal docket was handled by a carousel of visiting judges from other counties who couldn't care less about our community and quickly came to resent having to fill in on the bench while our judge was prosecuted and the Governor went through the slow process of appointing a replacement.\n\nIt was standard for cases to just get set off or delayed.  Our docket swelled and the jail emptied because very few people were being sentenced to jail.  The visiting judges would grant low bonds, or OR bonds in all but the most serious felonies.  Petty criminals who didn't negotiate a plea with the prosecutor, just reported back to court month after month with no disposition.  \n\nOne afternoon an attorney presented for plea, a man accused of domestic violence for boxing his child's ears.  This was to be a routine plea for probation and anger management.  When the facts of the case were read before the latest judge, he looked up from the docket and pursed his lips.  When the prosecutor announced the parties had reached a plea agreement and the conditions and asked the court to accept the plea agreement, the judge stated simply, \"No.\" and directed the defendant to have a seat.\n\nThe defendant looked anxiously to his attorney as the judge outright rejected the plea agreement and sentenced the defendant to 30 days in jail.  \n\nWell, the defendant freaked out, as did his wife who loudly protested she needed the defendant at home working.  The judge pointed at her from the bench and told her to shut it or she would spend 30 days down as well.  \n\nWell, the defendant's wife collapses into a weeping mess of bleach blonde hair and KMart coutour.  The bailiff, who frankly looked surprised at being asked to do anything aside from remind people to remove their hat, escorted the defendant downstairs to the jail.  THe attorneys, prosecution and defense, looked very much like two children who were in trouble, but they weren't quite sure why.  \n\nOnce the shouts of the defendant faded into the belly of the courthouse and the sobs of the white trash in the back of the room slowed, the judge addressed the court.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"I know you all have a deal.  And you know I don't have to accept it. I can leave him down there for thirty days.\"  30 days being a more than reasonable sentence for misdemeanor assault on a toddler.  The judge continued, \"I just want to teach him a lesson, and I will.  You see, when I was a kid, my Dad boxed my ears.  He did it often and one day he did it so hard, I'm now deaf in this ear.  I know you all think it's no big deal,\" he addressed the defense attorney, \"and you're pretty used to getting away with sweet deals for a while now because you haven't had a judge.\"  He leaned back in his chair and surveyed the courtroom.  \"But this one hit a nerve with me.  And you can file whatever complaint you want later, but I'm just going to let that guy sit down there for a couple of hours and think about what he's done, then I'll bring him back up.\"\n\nWell, we were stunned for sure.  After months of just watching criminals come and go in a never ending circle of arrest, plea, probation, it was honestly a shock to see someone sentenced to jail at all, much less in such an abrupt fashion.  Toward the end of the court day, they brought the ear boxer back upstairs.  He got a lecture and tearfully promised never to box his kid's ear again.  But seeing him go to jail like that, even just for a couple of hours, was a pretty big \"oh shit\" moment.\n\nEdit - \"boxing\" someone's ears is when you slap them on the side of the head so the cupped palm covers the ears.  It is very painful and can rupture an eardrum.  ",
            "This was told to me by a legendary trial lawyer in my area. I probably have some of the details wrong, but here is gist:\n\nIt was a personal injury case against the manufacturer of an industrial fan. It was supposed to be child safe, but a kid got their fingers chopped off. The manufacturer was claiming that the plaintiff was only injured because the fan had been modified from its original condition. The defense lawyers had an exemplar fan that was straight from the manufacturer. They brought in an expert and, on direct, had him explain how it would be impossible for this kid or anyone else to hurt themselves. The idea was that the guard mechanism would have prevented people's fingers from getting too close to the blades.He was a well-qualified witness and gave very compelling testimony on direct exam.\n\nUnbeknownst to the defense lawyers or judge, the plaintiff lawyer had brought a very long extension cord and plugged in the \"perfectly safe\" fan. On cross exam he went over the expert's theories and had him say unequivocally that it is impossible for someone to injure their fingers on this fan if it is unmodified. The plaintiff lawyer then walked all the way across the courtroom, turned on the fan as high as it would go and began walking it towards the expert. It was loud, so he had to kind of shout over it. He definitely had the jury's full attention!\n\nHe gets right up to the witness and starts in on him, still half yelling due to the noise. \"Show us, stick your fingers in!\" \"No!\" \"Come on, stick your fingers in!\" \"I don't want to do that!\" The other side is jumping up to object, but the plaintiff lawyer is two inches from the expert yelling for him to stick his fingers in. The expert is looking terrified and shrinking away from the fan. The jury came back in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nIt's my favorite example of \"show don't tell\"!",
            "Not my story, but while getting on the elevator banks at the courthouse, another lawyer tried to hold the door with his foot and his shoe popped off and went up with the elevator (In this court house there are probably 20 elevators, so there was no way he was going to find that shoe in time for his court call). He freaked out for about 10 seconds and then said \"I guess I am going to court with one shoe on.\" and got on a different elevator. Hilarious. ",

Fast forward to sitting in on a murder trial and there are signs *everywhere* saying that writing anything down was expressly prohibited. Then, the officer in the court room chewed someone not in our group out for writing stuff down (even though the stuff that person wrote wasn't related to the case) and then we all just turned our heads and stared at the teacher who told us to do just that, and the look on his face as he slowly slid the pencil and paper into his jacket pocket (so as to avoid getting caught) will be something I will never forget",

It went down like this:\n\nProsecutor:  The state rests.\n\nDefense:  We move to dismiss on the ground that the statutes defining the charged offenses all require proof that the damaged building was the property of another and there has been no evidence introduced to that effect.\n\nJudge:  You're right.  Case dismissed.\n\nProsecutor:  [Turning slightly pale as it sinks in.]  But, but, but... \n\nJudge:  [Visibly angry that this asshole kid is going to walk.]  No, I can not and will not allow you to reopen your case.

No, I cannot take \"judicial notice\" to supply a needed element that's missing from your proof.  We are done here.

This girl had a backstory that made the story of the girl from \"13 reasons why\" look like a fairytale. Her parents had basically dumped her and her brother and left to live in another country, so they were called over Skype. So basically the girl had an attorney, the parents had an attorney and the state was represented by two attorneys.

            "This will be buried, but it's a good story:\n\nIANAL, but I represented myself in small claims court against a former landlord in a case of illegal eviction. \n\nI was in University at the time, renting a top-floor room in a shared dwelling, with 2 house-mates on the same floor, and the landlord occupying the basement. We all shared the ground floor, which held the kitchen and living room.\n\nOne day, landlord come up to my room and tells me I have until 2 pm to clear out my stuff because I was being evicted. I had paid rent (on time) for 4 months, had provided a security deposit, and had never been in conflict with either of the housemates. All told, I was confused. Landlord refused to provide a reason for eviction, so I called the police. \n\nThe attending officer informed me that he couldn't compel landlord to let me stay, which I expected. I only wanted an official record of what happened on a police report.\n\nSo I sued landlord for the cost of my security deposit, rent that had been paid for the month I was evicted, the cost of having to find new lodgings on zero notice, the cost of the motel I stayed in until those lodgings were secured (it was mid-terms so I had to be in the city to be at school) and \"damages\" - all totalling around $3K (essentially I doubled my reported costs in the claim. In court it's better to ask for more and let the judge decide what's fair - as long as you don't come off as greedy). Landlord counter-sued for damages to property, of which there was none.\n\nCome the trial, I had all documents, records and discovery provided by me and to me (from landlord) ready to go. Landlord came with idiot advisor who acted as counsel for landlord, no documents, and one witness. Landlord had tried to convince other housemates to testify against me in court, but they refused.\n\nAnyway, the first \"oh shit\" moment was when the idiot advisor actually said to the judge that they could do whatever they wanted with tennants, and had been doing so for years, and the judge bench-slapped this moron for not understanding the basic tenets of the Landlord/Tennant act (it has a new name, can't remember it).\n\nThe second was when the judge asked if landlord would take the stand to present their evidence, and idiot advisor informed the judge that landlord would not be taking the stand at all in order to plead their case, or refute mine. The judge actually said \"well, I don't understand how you expect to win without presenting any evidence, but o.k...\"\n\nThe third moment was when their witness took the stand. He was the handyman landlord called to do little things around the house. He painted the room after I was evicted. In cross, I asked him the cost of painting (less than half of the counter-suit) and, as he was called as an \"expert\" on the repairs required by the landlord, I asked if in his expert opinion repairs (painting) were necessary. He said no, but he painted anyway because landlord paid him to. \n\nAfter their witness proved to be a better witness for me, the case was essentially over. The judge asked us to wait a moment as he pulled out a calculator. He looked up from the calculator and stated he found the case in my favour, and awarded me the actual costs I incurred, less the inflated damages (around $1800) which is exactly what I expected. I asked the judge for a ruling on their counter-suit, which brought my favourite \"oh shit\" moment of the whole ordeal.\n\nHe said: \"the suit against you is entirely dismissed, with prejudice, for failure to provide any evidence, testimonial or (something) at all to justify this eviction. Landlord is ordered to pay (x amount) plus all court fees associated with filing this suit.\" And after the official ruling was passed he said to the landlord, \"I recommend you find a better advisor, because this guy (referring to moron advisor) has no idea what he's talking about.\"\n\nIt was beautiful.\n",

Put my client up to say the same.

Not guilty verdict. \n\n\nSecond was my stupid mistake. Port-a-potty tipping case. I invoked the rule and sent all witnesses outside including the co-defendant in my case. I spaced and asked the kid witness if he recognized anyone else in the courtroom as being there when toilets were tipped. Luckily it wasn\u2019t on the record but I felt like a giant idiot. Found guilty but beat the offer. Case was dropped on appeal because my client was arrested for felony assault on law enforcement and the state didn\u2019t care about toilets anymore. ",

He comments on her amazing blowjob technique and asks if she would fuck him in a public park because that's one place they haven't fucked in yet. We can hear more-or-less EVERYTHING. \n\nMeanwhile my mom is not as much blushing, more like getting beet-red. My English is not 100% but enough to understand most of it, so I'm trying not to snicker too loudly. \n\nFinally the guy snaps out of it...\n\n\\-(him) \"Ma'am, tell me again what your job was in Russia?\"\n\n\\-(my mom, in perfect British accent) \"I. AM. AN. ENGLISH. TEACHER\"\n\n...... long pause ......\n\n\\-(him, stamping our visas) \"Your request for permanent residency has been granted. Welcome to the United States\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we're walking out of the room, he turns to my mom, looking like a lost puppy -- \"please don't tell my boss, ok?\"\n\n&#x200B;",
            "Not a lawyer, but I had to take out a protective order earlier this year against my wife in order to get sole custody of our son during her postpartum psychiatric crisis.\n\nShe chose to contest the order at a hearing, and she was off the fucking rails. At one point while cross-examining me, she objected to her own line of questioning, yelling \u201cObjection, Your Honor. I\u2019m getting fucking pissed off, and I need some crackers. Does anyone have crackers and can we take a break?\u201d The judge surprisingly granted a short recess, and went back to his desk to get her some crackers.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t fast enough \u2014 before he got back, my wife had run out to the parking lot and slung her hammock in between two random cars, refusing to come back inside. I was sitting on the witness stand when the bailiff came back inside and said, \u201cNo shit, Your Honor, Mrs. trashketball23 is in a hammock and won\u2019t come back inside.\u201d At this point, the judge lost his composure and started laughing at the absurdity of it all. Hell, I was too.\n\nShe did eventually come back inside and yell some more before faking a seizure and going to the hospital.\n\nWhat a day, man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**update (wide angle lens):** During the course of her manic psychosis (which began while evacuating 300 miles from one of this year's hurricanes), my wife was involuntarily committed for 2 weeks at an awful for-profit MHI, discharged without medication access before she was stabilized, arrested and jailed for three days because the state's domestic violence law mandates that DV aggressors go directly to jail regardless of their mental state (and a judge denied my request to have her transferred from jail to a MHI), and then released without bond by a magistrate judge who somehow wasn't aware of the severity of her condition. She was then running around for a week and a half with a guy she met at the MHI before the hearing I mentioned. \n\nThe hearing seemed to be something of a turning point for her. She started communicating with her family more. Asking for more photos and videos of our son. A week after the hearing, I took advantage of a significant name typo in the criminal no-contact order and a loophole in the no-contact portion of the civil TPO to begin communicating with her about potential treatment plans. She started to come down from her month-long manic episode, and about two weeks after reopening contact, I convinced her to check herself into an intensive outpatient program at an excellent university hospital.\n\nMore than a month later, she's getting discharged from the IOP program this week. She's stable, she's herself, she's moving in with her grandmother who lives in the area, and we spent the last week and a half together -- the first extended time we've had together since everything went to hell. There's still 6-figure medical bills to contend with (our insurance company is not pleased), as well as criminal charges awaiting resolution, but she and our son are now safe. That's what matters. I've been commuting 300 miles 4-5 times a month to keep up with my National Guard and work obligations, but we're starting marriage counseling when I'm back in town next week.\n\nWhen I do something like type it all out, it hits me really hard. We're lucky that we all survived this. We'll be even luckier if our family survives it and stays together in the long term. I'm committed to trying, but we'll see what happens.",

Also that she'd refused to call the office that made the diagnosis. And that his behavioral problems started going away in August of 2014.\n\nMy lawyer in cross examination: Isn't August of 2014 the month in which he started spending most of his time at his father's house? And also when he started getting behavioral therapy for Asperger's?\n\nStupid Ex: I don't know what you're getting at, but yes those are the same dates.\n\nNeedless to say it was all downhill from there.

            "NAL, but had a few lawsuits that my family was subjected to that purposefully killed our family business. \n\nWe were being sued by my moms cousin, who was a lawyer, but not in our state (she couldn\u2019t pass the bar in our home state and moved to a state where the testing was less rigorous), so she had a legal team of her own. \n\nIn the suit, she was claiming that our side of the family had embezzled funds from the business. Her mother, who was elderly but not yet senile, was called to the stand as their witness. \n\nAs she was being questioned about the heinous things that we had allegedly done, her responses were generally \u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d and \u201cR\u2019s kids are nice kids.

This genius shows up that morning wearing a shirt that says, \"High as Fuck\". \n\nAbout one week later, I was doing a quick interview of one of the defendants I was going to represent and decided I liked him. He was a pretty cheerful, chatty dude. I figured if he kept that up, we'd be just fine and stack up a quick W. We proceeded to the courtroom and he was probably my 5th or 6th client of the morning. As soon as he got into the courtroom, he began telling the judge why he should be released with no bail. The judge asked him to remain quiet and to let his representative from the PD make his case for him. Immediately, my client starts talking up and down about the First Amendment and his right to speak. I leaned forward to the little hole in the glass box to start whispering at him to \"shut the fuck up\" repeatedly. The judge had a hard time keeping a straight face and said to my client, \"you should listen to your defender.\" Unbeknownst to me, the microphone in the box was picking up my frantic whispering and the entire courtroom heard me telling him to shut the fuck up.\n",

            "Came here way too late for this story to get much traction, but I worked at a small firm for personal injury/medmal cases. I was going off to bumbleskunch nowhere Kentucky for a case against a doctor who was pretty negligent of our client\u2019s boyfriend who had died in his care over Christmas. \n\nWe were asking for damages for their two kids mostly. They\u2019d been together for eight years or so, but weren\u2019t married. \n\nNow, when lawyers tell you stuff shouldn\u2019t be a surprise in court, they\u2019re right; virtually everything is filed with the court beforehand, and shit doesn\u2019t happen in secret during the trial itself. \n\nUsually. \n\nIn our case, the opposition attorney pulled out some stuffy family law clauses stipulating that there\u2019s a legal presumption that if a woman has kids while technically married to someone, those kids are assumed to be the \u201chusband\u2019s\u201d kids, even if they don\u2019t live in the same state and had been planning a divorce for over a year. The reason this was allowed, to the best of my knowledge, is that it was part of a last minute motion to dismiss, which doesn't have to be part of discovery, and can be filed at any time (please correct me if I'm wrong, this is limited understanding).\n\nWell, you might be able to guess where this is going. Judge doesn\u2019t dismiss the case, but jury instructions are amended a bit, and more importantly, hours of trial time are spent now talking about whether or not the kids belong to our deceased man. Long enough that the jury is thoroughly convinced that our clients are fakers somehow, and we didn\u2019t have a reasonable amount of time to try to get a genetic test done to prove paternity post-mortum until after the trial had concluded. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen someone caught with their pants down so decisively as this. We hadn't considered that family law would be brought in- partially because the couple had been together so damn long!\n\nWe definitely lost, the kids got nothing except to lose a father over Christmas, and that doctor will go on to be a shitty doctor to others.",

He wouldn't respond to me, so I got up to his car window and asked again. He slammed the car door into my face, breaking my glasses. Then he tried getting out of the car, screaming at me. I held his door shut until he gave up trying, then I went to call security. Someone else saw it, went and told security, security calls the sheriffs. I went back to the drive and back to work. The guy accelerates towards me, I barely get out of the way, he strikes my leg with his front bumper.

I go to court and he says they should throw it out no problem. Sheriff's report says exactly what I said happened. We apply to get the video footage, etc. We tell all this to the assistant D.A. She says she's going to push it through court anyways, doesn't read the report. We go to court several times for discovery, reschedules, etc.   \n\n\nNext time we go to court, we're adamant that we will take it to a jury trial, fuck it I'll pay those fees. It's a new A.D.A. this time. We tell him the same shit, he ain't budging either. Okay, fuck you. Jury time, let's schedule this shit *and* we do.

            "Not a lawyer (I\u2019m a life coach for former foster kids), but almost got thrown out of the courtroom for disrupting the judge as he was about to award custody of my client\u2019s 2 y/o to her lying in-laws without even hearing what my client had to say.\n\nI had been working with this young woman for over 6mos, helping her find affordable housing, stable employment, etc. She wasn\u2019t with the baby\u2019s dad because he had been physically and mentally abusive, but she really tried to work out shared custody for the daughter\u2019s sake. \n\nOne day, the baby\u2019s dad gets arrested on some outstanding warrant while he has custody. He then LIES to my client and tells her that child services took the baby. She comes to me in a panic and we call their intake office. They have no record of the child. My client immediately knew what her ex had done, which was to give the baby to his mom and sister rather than calling my client to come and pick her up. \n\nMy client calls the mom and sister, who she is not on good terms with, and they straight up tell her \u201cwe\u2019re not giving you your baby back, bitch. you\u2019ll never see her again.\u201d So we get the police involved and they say there\u2019s nothing they can do without a warrant or formal custody agreement to enforce. Then we go to child services, and they do a welfare check. The baby is okay, but they can\u2019t return her to mom\u2019s custody either since there\u2019s no formal agreement in place. \n\nThis literally goes on for TWO WEEKS with me trying to help her get the baby back through legal channels. Finally, we go to court and she gets a PFA against the guy, thus granting her formal, sole custody of the child. \n\nThe oh-shit moment? There were several.\n\nFirst of all, the day we go and get the PFA, we learn then and there that the grandmother and sister have a hearing THAT DAY to try and take custody of the child. Their reasoning? They just lied and said that my client couldn\u2019t be found, was living under a bridge somewhere and doing drugs, all of which was not true, as I could personally attest from working with her as a helping professional. \n\nSo, we go to the waiting area, and there is the baby. It\u2019s really tense. My client tries to talk to the sister and the lady is basically like, \u201cstay the fuck away from me.\u201d So we go to the security guards, who are actually policeman, and show them the PFA with the custody provision. I shit you not, they enforced it right there in the waiting room and made this woman hand the baby over to the child\u2019s mother. My client cried tears of joy and the baby was clearly ELATED to be back with her mom. \n\nHappy ending right? Not yet.\n\nThe hearing is still on and the judge has no idea what\u2019s just happened. The tipstaff advises my client to stay with the baby, even though she\u2019s not the one filing the suit. We go in the courtroom, and are told we have to sit with the spectators, which makes no sense, while the sister and grandmother sit in front of the judge. We learn then that there\u2019s a court appointed lawyer for the baby, but we have no way of talking to him and explaining how ridiculous it all is. \n\nThe hearing proceeds and I get increasingly frustrated because THE JUDGE LAPPED UP THESE WOMEN\u2019S LIES and then very quickly makes moved to award them custody!!! The tipstaff sees me getting agitated and looks at me judgmentally, so I\u2019m wondering if my client is going to get a chance to speak. Nope, the judge is just barreling on. \n\nAt that point, I had to do something. I couldn\u2019t just sit there and watch these liars take LEGAL CUSTODY of my client\u2019s daughter. I said \u201cexcuse me,\u201d and the tipstaff goes \u201cyou need to get in line before I throw you out of here!\u201d \n\nMy face is red, because I\u2019m really not one to be confrontational, but I\u2019m determined. The judge sees me squirming and asks who I am. I tell him and I explain who\u2019s sitting next to me: the child and her mother. \n\nIt really was an \u201coh shit\u201d moment, not just for me, but for the judge, the tip-staff, the child\u2019s lawyer, and certainly for the women trying to take custody. \n\nFinally, to my immense relief, the judge lets my client speak and the truth comes pouring out. And it\u2019s not just her word against theirs. She has texts and call logs on hand to prove she\u2019d been in contact with them the whole time they claimed she was nowhere to be found. It ended up being really good that I was there, too, since I am a professional representing my organization and thus have strong incentive to be as objective and honest as possible.\n\nWithin five minutes, the judge recants everything he\u2019s said about giving the grandmother and sister custody and asserts that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason for the child not to be with her mother, presuming the home situation is safe.\u201d The case wasn\u2019t dismissed completely just then, because the judge wanted a welfare check completed on my client\u2019s home, but it was dismissed a month later. \n\nIt was honestly so wild. After this all went down, the tipstaff (40 or so y/o man) approached me (23 y/o female) and was clearly flustered. He looked super embarrassed and all-but apologized for getting sharp with me earlier. He was just like, \u201cUm, Great work in there\u201d and then shuffled off. \n\nThis was a year or two ago and I recently saw the child\u2019s appointed lawyer, who works in a different position now. He was like, \u201cDo you remember....? That was....really unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d \n\nBananas. \n\nTLDR: Judge almost awarded custody of young child to family members who basically kidnapped her from her mother and then lied about it.

One of the women described how he had strangled her after the rape until she passed out, leaving her for dead.  It was all very emotional.  After each of the women gave their statement they would ask the defendant if he would like to respond.  Each time he did so by ranting and raving about how his attorney is an idiot and saying that he wants a new lawyer, even after the judge pointed out that this was his second attorney.  After one of the women gave her account he actually remarked, \"I don't know who this girl is. All I know is that my attorney is dumb, doesn't know what he's doing and I shouldn't even be here.  You need to give me a new trial. Let's stop telling stories about what I did and get me a good lawyer.\"  The guy didn't show an ounce of remorse.  He didn't even seem to acknowledge the victims at all.  Honestly, he seemed mentally gone from humanity, and the idea of him ever being on the streets of the public was quite chilling.  \n\nI wasn't there for the sentencing, but I imagine it didn't go well for him.  On the other hand, I've seen numerous guys comment that they didn't care about going to prison, because that's where all of their friends are and they missed some of their buddies who were locked up.  They seemed to just view it as a reunion, not unlike some kind of bizarre summer camp to the rest of us.  So I wouldn't take too much comfort in any idea of punishing these kind of degenerates, but at least they're no longer on the street where they can harm anyone else.  ",
            "Not a lawyer, but a homeowner who once represented myself in court a few years ago and gave a real attorney an \"oh shit\" moment.  I received a citation for my backyard pool (I hadn't cleaned it for a month in the winter and it was greenish).  The citation was taped beside my front door, but there was no notice of a warrant (my pool is in the backyard surrounded by a privacy fence).  I had not been asked permission to search the property (I wasn't home).\n\nIn my city (Houston), the [municipal code](https://library.municode.com/tx/houston/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COOR_CH43POSPSA) requires search warrants for property inspections, including pool inspections.  However, the State of Texas ([18.05e](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CR/htm/CR.18.htm)) exempts municipalities of a certain population from obtaining search warrants (which is probably not legal).  So I showed up in court to defend myself.  The city attorney pulls me aside, and explains that she's an attorney and will use that knowledge to defend the citation, including introducing evidence.  I tell her I'll do the same, including introducing evidence.  Her eyebrows raise, but we proceed.\n\nShe introduces the citation and calls the inspector to the stand, asking about the inspection.  The inspector describes her visit, culminating in the citation.  When it was my turn, I asked the inspector if she obtained a warrant.  She said she did not.  I quoted for her the relevant section of the Municipal Code requiring her to get a warrant, and asked her why she had not done so.  At this point, the city attorney asks for a conference, and the judge pulls us up.  The city attorney duly notes that Texas law trumps Houston municipal codes by not requiring search warrants for municipalities of its size.  The judge turned to me, and I said, \"Well if she's going to use Texas law to trump local law, then I'm going to use Federal law to trump Texas law.  In the Supreme Court case of *[Camara v. Municipal](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/387/523/)*, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that 'It has nowhere been urged that fire, health, and housing code inspection programs could not achieve their goals within the confines of a reasonable search warrant requirement. Thus, we do not find the public need argument dispositive.'  Thus, the Texas law is unconstitutional and a search warrant is required.\"\n\nThe city attorney's jaw dropped, and the judge quickly dismissed my case.  But then the real oh shit moment happened.  The next few cases were all pool inspections, and none of them had used a warrant either.  So the judge conferred quickly with the city attorney, then dismissed those cases without even hearing them.\n\nEdit:  Added links to the laws in case some lawyer/homeowner wants an easy win.",
            "I was representing a podiatrist in a case involving an allegedly injured foot from a surgery. The plaintiff\u2019s podiatric surgery expert had a long report outlining various degrees between the bones of the foot that should be seen in a \u201chealthy\u201d foot, that were \u201cmessed up\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s foot.\n\nThe morning that he was going to be called, I was reviewing the report in a diner near the court room, and realized that he had based his ENTIRE report off of the foot that wasn\u2019t operated on. (We also had surveillance of the guy walking around and doing everything in his normal life just fine)\n\nAfter confirming this bombshell with my client and our expert, on cross examination, I had their doctor walk through his entire report again, outlining every detail about every \u201cincorrect\u201d angle in the \u201cinjured\u201d foot, and then said \u201cDoctor, I just have a couple final questions.. first, which foot was operated on again?\u201d \n\n\u201cThe left foot.\u201d He replied with a furrow in his brow.\n\n\u201cAnd doctor, which foot is it in the X-ray that you\u2019ve based your report entirely on, and reviewed here today?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left foot.\u201d He replied, confidently.\n\n\u201cAre you sure about that? Why don\u2019t you check again.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a grown man turn as pale as he did in realizing that he had written an entire report based on the wrong foot. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney might\u2019ve shit himself also. It seems like such an obvious thing, but 4 lawyers (me, plaintiff\u2019s counsel and two codefendant attorneys) and a number of expert doctors all missed such a small basic thing. Justice prevailed that day.",
            "I had a client who physically assaulted a store clerk in a mall and the entire thing was caught on video and clearly shows him beating up the victim. Client decides to plead guilty so the only issue in court is sentencing. I argued for probation with a conditional discharge, meaning that if he finished his probation without any violations, he wouldn't have a criminal record. Judge accepted my argument and was in the process of issuing that sentence. One of the conditions of probation the judge decided to impose was a restraining order with the mall so that my client wasn't allowed to be in the mall until his probation was over. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the judge is saying this, my client turns to me and starts complaining loudly about the fact that he isn't allowed to go to mall, where is he going to go with his kids on the weekend, blah blah blah. Judge stops talking and starts yelling at my client and telling him that he could reject all my arguments and sentence my client to jail. Client shut up very quickly after that, but later had the audacity to try to argue my bill because I didn't get him a good enough deal. Apparently probation with no criminal record wasn't good enough. smh. ",

You could SEE with your own eyes, year by year, new better intersections, buildings going up, highways everywhere, roads fixed, streets cleaned, whole new neighbourhoods built over the old communist decript destroyed factories that the corrupt assholes sold for nothing after 1989+ when they killed our industry.\n\nGo outside brasov and it's a wasteland from the communist days. Been I don't know how many DOZENS of years and we still have the same old narrow choked bullshit streets that connect brasov to the capital city. Year after year money spent on projects and then the corrupt assholes from PSD make publicity stunts to tear up the contract. Which means the money got wasted, can't be taken back, and nothing was built.\n\nThe difference is bigger than I am making it look. I seen what a god damn non-corrupt politician can do. None of your bullshit idiotic propaganda compares, that includes your george bush clone, called barrack obama. He was as incompetent as your other presidents.",
            "This is common in many elections. Sometimes it\u2019s called RONning where alongside the candidates is a box marked RON which stands for reopen nominations.",
            "I'd much rather have everyone cast a vote and the resulting legislative body being a representation of that vote. For instance, 10% vote A, then A gets 10% of the seats.",
            "How about get rid of the stupid as hell 2 party system that George Washington knew was a bad idea.",
            "Do you know about voter apathy?\n\nIf you assume people do not vote because they do not want any of the candidates rather than they are lazy or just didn't vote, then every election will not be able to elect anyone into power.",
            "In the US I would prefer a law that bans parties. Our 2 party system is killing us.",
            "That sounds like a **very** expensive outcome, not to mention that it might happen repeatedly. Even if it only happens once, how long would the second round last? It will cost politicians a lot of time that they could have spent being active in fixing problems. No government want to be in a situation without a leader for too long, it's pretty chaotic.\n\nAnd if a second round happens, does that mean that the current president will not be able to participate? Even if yes, just the fact that people have to go through the entire voting process again will tire out everyone, this is on top of the fact that a fairly big group of voters will not agree completely with any candidate which makes them likely to choose this option.\n\nIt's an interesting idea though, and perhaps since the last election it was on peoples' minds more than ever, but I really don't see it working out due to the size and complexity of an election.",
            "Take a look at Ranked Choice Voting.",
            "To me it only makes sense if we have Ranked Voting. Allow people to make \"none of the above\" as their top choice then like whoever as a second choice. This would show how many people are dissatisfied with the current selection.",
            "I'd say we'd never have another president again. We've never had, nor ever will have, a perfect president.",
            "It would have made the 2016 election better.",
            "Bad idea. That allows for term extensions, which is not usually a thing that is done. Even if there were substitute people, we would have to vote for them as well, unless we want to let them appoint their own replacements. I think using the ranking voting system would be the better solution to this feeling. Like, 1st choice candidate, 2nd choice candidate, 3rd choice and so on. Even if you hate all of the candidates, you hate some less and hate some more. So make sure you list them from least to most hate and you're good.",
            "So you want a chance to make American elections *longer*?\n\nCalm down, Satan.",
            "This would be perfect in making voting mandatory so we can divide people who don't want to vote and those who are too lazy to have a say.",
            "It\u2019s called a write in. I\u2019ve done it. \n\nFor Presidential elections: If no candidate wins a majority of the electoral college the house decides the election. It\u2019s in the Constitution, which you can read for free online.\n\nIn most elections, the candidate with the most valid votes wins. Even if that is not the majority of valid votes cast. NOTA is not a candidate.",

            "This option actually exists in India. However, it's merely a tool to show your unhappiness. For example, if 99/100 voters vote 'None of the Above' but 1 person votes for any particular candidate, that candidate wins. It's really stupid imo though.",
            "We just need ranked choice voting. It's very real, very doable and some elections already use it.\n\n... That, and the elimination of gerrymandering and the electoral college \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

The front office folks thought I could just give her a personal tour of the planetarium and show her some nice high-resolution visuals, but I thought she deserved better than that. I commissioned a jeweler friend and meteorite enthusiast to make a silver crescent moon necklace, which he graciously donated to the cause, and I donated a small lunar meteorite from my own collection. It was a gorgeous necklace very much to the credit of my friend's artistry and generosity.\n\nWe couldn't take her to the moon so we gave it to her instead. She was thrilled, but later said her real highlight of the trip was the astronaut ice cream. Ah, kids.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards, kind redditors!",

            "I worked at a hospice and we had a wishing program. One of our patients, 24 year old with brain cancer, wanted to hold a sloth. Apparently, sloths are very nervous creatures, so it's a little tricky to actually hold one. \n\nI found a local company that does visits to schools and whatnot who had a sloth. Sloths only poop about once a week and the sloth could only travel the day after he pooped (because they get nervous, any longer than that and the sloth has stress diarrhea). So basically, we had to wait until the sloth pooped and then set up the visit for the next day. The sloth pooped on Thanksgiving, so we set up the visit for the next morning. The patient was able to hold and pet a very sweet sloth. The patient died about three weeks later, and I am very happy I was able to help give her some joy in her final weeks.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Wow, guys, I did not expect this to blow up! Thank you so much for the awards!\n\nThe hospice I worked at had a special program called Faithful Wishes for any of our patients, regardless of age. As the Volunteer Coordinator, fulfilling these wishes was part of my job. I do believe there are other non-profit organizations that grant wishes to adults, but nothing as large as Make-a-Wish.\n\nYes, the sloth was tame and lived in an animal preserve. He would also visit schools and retirement communities, schedule permitting. And yes, I absolutely learned more about sloth bowel movements than I ever wanted to \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

LEGO unfortunately denied the request (which surprised myself and the rest of the staff because LEGO was a pretty great company). Staff decided to honor the request ourselves. We closed the store early on a Sunday, then invited the kid and family in. He had a full run of the store, we collectively paid for like $1000 worth of toys for him to take home, and just spent the entire evening building w/e he wanted.

            " Not make a wish - but my brother got terminal brain cancer when he was 18. He was given three to six months to live. Back then his only wish was to be an NFL player. But he was 5\u20198, all heart, he was just like Rudy in that Notre Dame football movie. He fought it for 6 years. Somewhere around his 22nd birthday he and I were talking about having something worth living for. I told him it didn\u2019t matter what it was but a vision for the future that he would fight for was important and encouraged him to find something to give his life too. We went on a vacation soon after that, and because we were broke from medical bills and four years of battling cancer as a family, this was a HUGE deal. We hadn\u2019t had a family vacation for a long time. A family friend put us up in their beach house and gave us some money to have a good time there. My brother came ALIVE on the trip. It was so impactful to him that he came home and decided to start a non profit organization. He called it \u201cA Week Away\u201d. It was very similar to make a wish - terminally sick patients apply and benefit from an all expenses paid vacation with their family or group of caregivers. That was a big deal to him to include the family because, if you\u2019ve ever gone through something like that, you know it\u2019s not just the patient who suffers and loses their freedom, it\u2019s everyone they are close to. \n\nHe worked his ass off to start the organization. He formed it and began sending families to places like the outer banks and ocean city and other east coast beaches. A week before he died, he launched his first big month long fundraiser. He passed away knowing that he had raised enough to send like 10 families on respite weeks. It was like he was passing the baton off to others who could keep on fighting. The org is still going strong today. If anyone is blessed to have their health and a sweet vacation spot you\u2019d like to donate for occasional use by sick people all coordinated by an awesome organization, I\u2019d encourage you to reach out to the A Week Away folks. You get to play a part in people\u2019s lives like the awesome people helping in these make a wish stories.",

We gave him a lab coat and a stethoscope and let him tag along and see x rays and ultrasounds and watch surgeries. I brought my dog in so he could try the ultrasound on her.\n\nHe seemed to enjoy it.

            "This wasn't Make a Wish, it was a local radio station, but I swear every single part of this is true.  I probably still have the master tape.\n\nAround 25 years ago in the mid 90s, in the town I lived in up in the far north-west of Scotland, there was a Community Radio Station.  We were trying to set up a local radio station so we had a six-week run using borrowed equipment from Moray Firth Radio to gauge popularity and interest.\n\nNow the first programme in the evening after the news was one run by a couple of high school kids.  We'd get a few kids in, they'd record a few idents and stuff, we'd run the idents, then at five past five their show would go up.  Tunes they liked, shout-outs to their friends, that kind of thing.  They \\*loved\\* it.  They had a blast, just tremendous fun.\n\nNow there was one wee guy who was a wheelchair user who wanted to do a programme but he couldn't get into the studio because it wasn't wheelchair accessible - it was up a long flight of stairs in the old nurses' accomodation in the local hospital, and there aren't many wheelchair-user nurses (and certainly not in the 50s when the hospital was built!).  He couldn't even be carried up the stairs because he had severe spinal problems that meant that his back, chest and internal organs were pretty squashed and he had to be moved very carefully.  He was one very sick wee boy, and there was no way he was getting up to the studio.  He was totally out of luck on that one.\n\nNo, he wasn't, though, was he?  Because it occurred to me, he could tape his programme with one of the portable recorders we had (little Marantz high-speed cassette recorder), give me a track listing, and I'd cut it together, play it to him, and if he was happy we'd play it out for him.  He wouldn't get to do it live, but next best thing eh?\n\nSo, we did.  I dropped off the tape recorder, microphone and so on, and a day or so later I collected it from him with his running order, track list, and a stack of CDs.  Perfect.  He even sounded like he'd really bashed on his script and sounded pretty damn good.  Copy the tape to 1/4\", copy the tunes to 1/4\", edit it down, and boom.\n\nExcept!  He had a cold.  A snuffly snottery cold.  Every sentence was punctuated with <SNIIFFF>  <SNURK>  <SNUMPH> snotty noises.\n\nI can tell you now that a <SNIIIFFF> is about |---------------------------------| that long on 3-3/4 inch per second 1/4\" tape, and also cats absolutely love to play with all this brown tickertape confetti you're flooding the bedroom (where my editing gear was) with, and there were dozens of them.  Eighteen hours of cutting, sticking, redubbing, finding a bit of dead air juuuust the right tone to fill the gap, cutting, sticking...\n\nBut when his programme went to air?  He sounded fucking amazing.",

They travel to the family\u2019s home or a public place, help with paperwork, and send the family off on their wish experience. It\u2019s the most time intensive of the volunteer commitments, but extremely rewarding.

At one point was running a small underground \"business\" in high school charging kids to come over and play DDR in his garage. I got to play for free for being his friend. I got reeeeally good one summer from all that free playtime... In our 30s now and he still has the machine, but I think it's mainly collecting dust now.",

I'd like to meet him... they responded pretty positively saying they'd \"see what they could do\" haha... I'm not holding my breath, but it would be pretty cool if it happened.\n\nEdit: \n1) Wow this took off, thanks so much for the upvotes, awards, comments, offers of help and offers to get me to an actual upcoming Bill Burr show. I couldn't believe it.\n\n2) I am in Australia and currently can't just pop over to the USA because of COVID, cancer treatment and regular life stuff.  This is why I said \"if Bill Burr does another world tour\".

            "I had the privilege of working for Make-A-Wish (MAW) at their National Office for a number of years. Here are a few of my favorites (as best as I can remember them):\n\n1)I wish to be a worker in a pickle factory. Turns out that during his chemotherapy, the child\u2019s favorite food became pickles and was one of the few things he could manage to enjoy so he wanted to meet the \u201cpeople who put the pickles in jars.\u201d The organization made it into a big deal and you bet those pickle factory workers were thrilled to experience his joy that day. There was a photo in the office of this little boy in a hair net with a beaming smile as he watched pickle spears move by on a conveyor belt. Melts my heart.\n\n2) I wish to have the experience of a WWII fighter pilot who crashed on a deserted island. During some of his hospital stays, this wish kid had visits from a few veterans who told visit the hospital and tell him stories of their experiences. He became really interested in military history. MAW worked with a big contingent of people from Hawaii, including the U.S. military, flew him to a little uninhabited island in Hawaii, and he got to experience (with his dad and a few safety experts) what it was like to be \u201cdeserted\u201d for about 48 hours.\n\n3) I wish to have a pet dragon. This was a tough one (out of Idaho I believe) to make happen, but this child wanted a \u201cpet dragon he could train\u201d. So the volunteers started thinking about how they could make this happen and stumbled across someone who had some experience in this kind of thing\u2026the creator of the Furby. MAW set up a meeting between the two to help design it, and the wish kid was able to eventually get a a little mechanical, very lifelike (think Toothless) dragon he could train.\n\n4) I wish to be a National park ranger. This wish was featured on CBS Sunday Morning. This wish kid loved the outdoors and national parks had played an important role in how his mom had met some important people in her life. He spent a few days learning the ropes of being a ranger at Yosemite National Park and was even named an honorary park ranger.\n\n5) [I wish to go to Mars](https://youtu.be/P9Q8Ed8IjVg)\n\nI\u2019ll reply to this post to more as I remember them. It was such a great experience. What I loved the most about MAW is when volunteers first sit down with kids, they literally learn about what interests this child, what makes them tick\u2026they ask them \u201cif you could wish for anything, what would it be.\u201d This process gives them the opportunity to think about all the possibilities. Some kids have very specific requests; others simply want to go to Disney World. But ultimately this wish is so individualized that it is the perfect wish for that child. And there are a ton of benefits to the child and the family. It\u2019s a great organization.\n\nAlso feel free to ask me any questions.\n\n[edit: some spacing issues]",

They provide the transportation to and from the all of the different parks (Disney, Universal, sea-world, etc) as well, it\u2019s really amazing. Before I started volunteering I thought that going to Disney was kinda lame to choose as a wish (I was young) then I realized just how amazing it is for these kids to get to do this with their entire family. A lot of families shared that their kids enjoyed being at the village more than the parks themselves.",

One day her manager came by while she was getting ready for the day to tell her that she was going to do a private audience for a child from the Make-A-Wish foundation. Now my  wife was absolutely shocked.  She had worked there for years and seen the princesses and Mini/Mickey Mouse do hundreds of Make A Wishes, while the villains had never done a single one.  She thought today was her lucky day and she was going to be making a wish for the rare Cruella superfan (this was years ago before Cruella had her own movie and was popular).  \n\nNext my wife enters the private audience room , which she hadn\u2019t even been in before and puts on her Cruella attitude.  Before she knows it she sees this diminutive teenage child being wheeled over who is pointing her finger and yelling.  As the child is wheeled closer my wife hears the child yelling, \u201cyour a creep!\u201d Over and over again.  She tried to play it off saying all the standard Cruella lines and making jokes, but the kid just kept screaming \u201cyour a creep!!!\u201d  While the family laughed and took photos.   Now the kid wasn\u2019t 100% there mentally so my wife didn\u2019t take it that hard.  But it was pretty hilarious and confusing for my wife.  \n\nTLDR: kids make a wish was to spend 15 minutes berating Cruella in person who just so happened to be my very confused wife."

They had a policy in place that if an item price label didn\u2019t match the scanned price in the computer, the first item was free and any subsequent items would be for whichever price was lower. \n\nEvery few months an elderly woman would come in and spend 4-5 hours shopping. When she would come up to the register, she would have a full cart and near everything would be free.

If you got nothing, change it again and just keep going until you get the code. Then, when you got the code, you change the date back to current date and the app updates the code so it looks like you rolled it today. \n\nI got free burger upgrades for years until they finally got rid of the feature alltogether.

            "There is a grocery store near me that has a gas promotion program where for every dollar you spend, you get 1 point, every 100 points.gets you 10 cents off per gallon on gas. Overall an ok program, nothing special. One day I'm reading the sales flyer and I see that they have \"point multiplier\" items that get you bonus points. I did some quick math and realized the point multipliers on certain items were so generous, if I bought certain items, the store would be paying me to take the stuff out. \n\nThe program allowed for up to $2.20 off per gallon, with a maximum of 35 gallons per transaction. They would have multipliers like \"buy 5 iced teas for $1 each and get 500 bonus points!\" At that time, I had a truck with a large gas tank (I think it was around 19 gallons or so) and I bought 5 gallon gas cans to put in the bed to get he full 35 gallons every time. So 500 bonus points would cost me 5 bucks, but I'd save $17.50 on the fill up. There were a few times where the price of gas went below $2.20 and I'd literally get the gas for free. 35 gallons, $0 charged to my card. \n\nMy best one ever I spent about 25 or 30 bucks on 4 bags of groceries and got 35 gallons of gas for free.\n\nIf the items weren't something I wanted, there was a donation bin by the door for a local soup kitchen, one time I bought 25 boxes of cereal to get my free gas and I don't really eat cereal, so I donated them to the soup kitchen. Sometimes I would bring the extra into work and give it to my coworkers (I was in college at the time, so the college students I worked with were happy for free food). One time it was on baby food, and since my brother just had a kid, I gave him like 5 bags of baby food.\n\nThat lasted for about 3 years until they changed the program and you can't game the system like that anymore. One of the common items was laundry detergent. Even after they changed the program, I had laundry detergent for like 3 or 4 years after from my stockpile. I miss those days...",

In this case, you\u2019re absolutely right.\n\nI\u2019ve been present at active shooter situations, like the real ones\u2026. It\u2019s not a time to wait for orders or a \u201cscene commander\u201d\u2026,. It\u2019s a time where you tell whoever is on the other end of the radio \u201chold the channel for emergencies\u2026.

            "I\u2019m a former police officer. I\u2019m sickened by it. Especially since this is exactly the opposite response to an active shooter scenario than what the training dictates. In Europe at least, when you arrive at the scene of a suspected active shooter, you are taught to ignore the usual SOP in case of (for instance) a hostage situation or barricaded suspect. In those cases, you set up a perimeters and call in the SWAT team, who are equipped and trained to deal with that stuff. \n\nBut in an active shooter scenario, you grab whatever gear you have in the trunk, and you go in, making as much noise as you can along the way. You shout \u201cStop! Police!\u201d at the top of your lungs and you push as fast as possible to the source of the shots. You don\u2019t stop to render aid to the wounded people you meet along the way, stepping over screaming victims if you have to. The reason for this approach is 1) to intervene and stop the killing as fast as possible, but also 2) that most active shooters turn the gun on themselves when they know law enforcement is closing in. You keep moving, shouting and shooting, anything to stop the situation either by neutralising the gunman yourself, or better yet, have him end it himself.\n\nIt\u2019s a risky and horrible part of the job, one that I was happy to never have had to experience in reality. But if you roll up to a situation like that and you\u2019re too scared to do what you\u2019re paid and entrusted to do, then hand in your badge and go flip fucking burgers.",

It's created a culture of scared individuals who's only interests are themselves and the guy wearing the same uniform as them regardless of doing the job or public service and that only goes as far as he's protecting you. Can't tell you how many times there's been shootings and everyone shows up fast but then walks like they've got lead feet looking like a kid that just got thrown in the water without knowing how to swim and Will only act if sowmkne else does it first.

            "I just recently retired and ran a 12 man burglary suppression, fugitive warrant, surveillance team. So we actually did more building entries then our SWAT team, who are nothing but pretty boy Oakley sunglasses wearing lops of shit. This is a large Sheriffs department in Southern California. Actuality, by the time SWAT got all their special toys and permission to be activated an entire school would be wiped out they our WORTHLESS!!! They are only good for hostage situations and that\u2019s it. With that off my chest, I did this job for 24 years. I met the School Resource Officer at Columbine High School, when a small contingent of us SRO\u2019s were invited to a tactical conference. Yes, we were making changes on how law enforcement responds to Active Shooter incidents. It use to be protocol, you wait for a 3 to 4 man element head towards the shooting. Almost a triangle formation with the fourth covering from the rear. During that meeting, we said \u201cFuck that\u201d we can\u2019t wait, first officer on scene calls it out over the radio and goes towards and eliminates the threat. YOU DON\u2019T SIT AND WAIT!!!! During Christmas Break and Spring Break, we would use a local High School, Junior High or Elementary School conducting Active Shooter training using SIMs rounds. Basically live rounds, with the bullet being paint ( yes we cleaned up when finished) it was mandatory that EVERYONE in our department complete this training. This was pounded into our deputies heads. This was done every year.\n\nNow what I\u2019ve been playing this through my head why they didn\u2019t make entry. I honestly don\u2019t think it was because they were cowards. Now I\u2019m just giving my opinion being on 100\u2019s of operations and the only thing I can think of is the following. From the briefings I heard ( which is rare I don\u2019t watch the news) there were approximately over 19 officers in the hallway outside the locked classroom where the shooter was still at. From what they said he was still cranking off rounds and children in the classroom were calling 911 asking for help because they could hear the police outside the classroom. But they waited until a tactical team arrived, which was Border Patrol and made entry using the janitors keys, and killing the suspect once making entry.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. Where these 19 officers thinking this was a hostage situation, which policy wise changes things? We\u2019re they waiting for breaching tools or ballistic shields, no because the janitor gave them key. What should happened, you can hear what area of the classroom he\u2019s shooting from. You stack up on the door, if you have flash bangs you use them. You make a quick dynamic entry, separating once in the room, which will confuse the shooter and you unload on his ass until he no longer is walking this earth. If you get hit, it\u2019s part of the job. When children are involved you do everything in your power to save their lives, even if this means given up your own. I had many situations where we had a suspect shooting at us and his kids and wife are in the house. SWAT advised they are an hour and a half out. Screw that. We made our own ERT team to cover me and my partner as we broke into the rear of the house to get them safely out of the house. So now he\u2019s by himself, so now the Oakley wearing pretty boys can deal with him. Just my take on this disaster, and embarrassment to everyone who\u2019s ever worn the uniform. I usually don\u2019t Monday morning quarterback, but I just think of my 12 guys that I supervised, if I would have told them to not make entry and hold for SWAT, they would have went in anyways because they are all dads or they would have shot me. Thing is, leaders, lead from the front so I would have been with my guys and would have been going through the door with my guys. Just wish this had a different ending.",

            "Former military police here (Air Force Security Forces). As information started to unfold I thought there might be some misinformation, there was conflicted reports, and so forth. \n\nOnce enough verified information came through I was thoroughly disguisted with these cops. I have been in a situation in which I was tasked with pursuing a convicted felon who was armed with a filly automatic weapon that evaded local police, ran through a swamp like area that was a buffer between the base and civilian area, and gone underneath a fence onto the base. I was only armed with an M9 (9mm) Beretta. This guy was coming to an area near an entrance with a lot of people nearby.\n\nDespite the disadvantage I was at, and I was the only one initially in pursuit, I won't forward without hesitation. I didn't even have a visual at first so he could have shot me as soon as he saw me coming. I still moved forward scanning the area. \n\nThese sorry excuse for cops didn't even advance when not only were kids lives at stake, but they had bullet proof vests, and assault rifles themselves, and outnumbered the shooter.\n\nI'll admit, at first I didn't want to judge them because I thought their focus might have been getting kids in other parts of the building out, and there was what turned out to be false reports shared by public officials of two cops being shot going after the gunman. \n\nAs more information came out I began to wonder if someone made a strategic decision to sacrifice the kids in that adjoined classroom to get the others out. This morning I read confirmation that the Schools Police Chief, who is also an elected official, that was appointed to this role by other elected officials did just that.\n\nExcept he wasn't sacrificing those kids to get thevother kids out. They had the man power and equipment to simultaneously do both. He sacrificed those kids to keep his cops safe. \n\nThis job is dangerous. You know that when you take the job. These men and woman are cowards, they are not only a disgrace to law enforcement, but a disgrace to their families, and to humanity."

It was stuff like Roxy, Vans and other stuff you'd see at places like Tillys or similar clothing store. One of my old coworkers families basically were clothed their whole life from this type of clothing being dumped. The clothing was clean or could be cleaned to a decent level that the clothing was fine to wear. It was dumb stuff like small rip, missing zipper or some other weird thing they couldn't sell it that way. Everyone at the landfill was basically in on the scheme.

Our dog lived until he was 13 and then passed away of old age. But we did let them play together after they were separated. It\u2019s funny because my parents first house was in a not so great part of town, but it was what they could afford. Anyway, across from our house was a train track and I would love watching the trains pass. Well, my Dad took a photo of us one time both standing at the window and looking out at the train. Jasper would stand on his hind legs and watch with me. My wife actually had the photo blown up and custom framed for my birthday one year. It has to be one of my favorite photos. There aren\u2019t many things I\u2019m sure of in life, but I\u2019m positive Jasper lived a happy life after my Dad found him. I\u2019m not joking when I say him and I did everything together.

In fact we\u2019ll keep an eye out for things colleagues might need. Most of what we salvage is actually tools and stuff we use at the dump. I\u2019ve also started a management approved program to give away free household products that would otherwise be hazardous waste (paint, oil, cleaners, etc). Some dumps also run thrift stores to divert materials from landfill, but we don\u2019t have the space.",

We had quite a few parties \"sponsored\" from that one.\n \nThen there was this one big concert where a huge storm hit and everyone left everything they had brought behind to hide in their cars and leave. We found camping furniture and lots of closed beverages and food. One coworker even found a bunch of bundled up cash, which amounted to a couple hundred bucks. And, since it was a concert of a band a lot of older people listened to, we found coke, handed it over to the authorities and later were told it was enough to buy a small car from the market value it represented.\n\nBut the coolest thing that happened at one of the shows was not something we found. There was a big classic car event at the show grounds and it had some of the finest and rarest cars you could imagine. At the end, we were cleaning as usual, and this guy comes up saying he saw us during the shows checking out some of the cars.

            "Worked for a shred company and was doing a one time shredding for an elderly woman whose children had to sell her house due to her medical bills piling up (none of them were wealthy).  Anywho, I had about 30 banker sized (legal) boxes of files to shred and in my shred truck with an open shredder (if not for this dangerous set up where I could literally stick my hand in the hydraulic powered shredder which ironically I wouldn't have made my discovery) I was on I think my 5th box when I found a few hundred dollars and they were 1980's issued.   The woman was extremely happy I was honest and gave them to her, rather than keeping them.  And then on the second to last box I made THE find to end all finds.  It was a stock certificate of 20 shares of Coca Cola ....well I brought this to her as she was inside and I then asked her how much did you owe still for the house and she told me $85,000 but she couldn't extend her credit anymore as she done maxed out her credit cards thus why she was moving in with her son.  I told her, \"well maam, you aint going anywhere\"  and gave her the stock.  The stock was $40.25 at the time in 2017 which meant after all the stock splits she had 23,040 shares of Coca Cola valued at $927,360 as her son checked on the CUSIP number and it was from 1959...before CC's  3-1 1960 split!\n\nTo this day I've turned down her requests (still alive in her mid 80s) to take some of it and she asked me why I didn't just keep it as she would have never known (she forgot that her late husband got it as a  wedding gift as that was the year they were married).   I told her I don't live my life taking advantage of others, I do the opposite and help folks.  That smile on her face when she saw that stock was worth more than the price of gold...or old Coca Cola stock!  It's probably why good karma lately has come at me, most recently late last year finding out through dumb luck I had literally the very beginning of a cancerous tumor in my leg which being caught so early prevented any chemo and just two rounds of local radiation after the small tumor's removal.

Got LOTS of stories.\nWeirdest shit I\u2019ve found? It\u2019s tricky to narrow down. Depends on what you define as weird. I\u2019ve cleaned out entire sex dungeons hidden in homes.  Found a full size rotting deer carcass in a basement once. Homemade \u201clifelike\u201d sex dolls (several in one house).\nStupid amounts (and I mean fucking ridiculous amounts) of porn in one fella\u2019s apartment. Another place had years worth of self berating messages scrawled into every wall and piece of furniture. That one wound up committing suicide via shotgun. Found an amputee leg once; had hydraulics and all the fancy shit. Donated that.\nI come across cool and valuable shit constantly. Firearms, valuable currency, paintings, collectibles, you name it. When people die, no one wants to fuck with their house so they just throw it all away. Divorces are great too, since valuable things are thrown away out of spite. I\u2019ve made a fuck ton of money selling things on the side.\nWorst thing I\u2019ve found? I\u2019ll be honest here - the worst things I find tend to be children\u2019s drawings inside of foreclosed/evicted places. Those hit hard. I\u2019m forever finding needles and drug paraphernalia. Cleaning places where people died and haven\u2019t been found in ages also sucks. This job isn\u2019t for everyone though.",

After they had moved all their old stuff out and my dad was doing some work on the floors, I noticed the TV was still there, and he explained that removing it from its wall fixture was too big of a pain and they were just going to leave it behind in the house. Hey, if I was willing to go through the unbelievable amount of trouble of removing a 60-inch television from a wall mount inside a cabinet, I was welcome to it. He didn\u2019t need to tell me twice.

            "Preventative physio.  \n\n\n*edit since everyone's asking: I went to see a physiotherapist. Anyone have advice on how to find a good physio so I can add it in here?*\n\nI'm 31, in decent shape, and never had any serious injuries. However, my family has a history of back and knee problems, and my knees and shoulders have been a consistent issue. I used to teach snowboarding, and gave it up cause my knees were always inflamed. Long haul flights became prohibitively painful cause of my shoulders and knees. It got bad enough that I struggled to play long board games, cause I'd usually have a totally cramped shoulder and inflamed knee from sitting still/looking down too long. It built up so slowly though that I just gradually accepted it.\n\nFinally went to see someone when my shoulders were particularly stiff and painful. Turns out my feet rolled inwards (~~supination I think?~~ *edit: it's pronation*), I had really inflexible hamstrings causing my hip to be massively rolled forwards, and I walk with my head jutted like an inch more forward than is healthy.\n\nSpent \u00a3100 and two hours there (one being assessed, one being taught corrective exercises), and two months later all my knee and shoulder problems have disappeared. I'm actually shocked at how much joint pain I'd just gradually accepted and forgotten was a problem. I wish I'd gone sooner.\n\nOnce I have some more cash, I'm definitely getting back on a snowboard. I seriously missed it.\n\nEdit: physio-finding tips courtesy of u/getwhatyougive15 , who is a doctor of physiotherapy\n\n>In regards to finding a good physio/physical therapist:\n\n>Do some research, look at their website to see if they talk about their treatment approach or philosophy. Or you can call to talk with someone on the staff. Usually the receptionist or scheduler can usually speak in general terms of what you should expect with your visits.\n\n>\u2022\t\u2060The main thing you want to look for there is an active approach. By active approach, I mean that you want someone to get you up and moving with corrective exercises, not just laying on a treatment table having the physio work on you, (which would be a passive approach). If you have a physio that essentially does different types of deep tissue massage, they likely aren\u2019t going to be able to fix the root cause of your issues, though it can be helpful in the short term.\n>\u2022\t\u2060Also ask to see how much time you get to see an actual physio. Some places will shuffle you around with other support staff such as aides or techs, and only get 5-10 min with an actual physio. Not that there is anything wrong with these support staff, some are great and can be extremely helpful with your issues. But you also don\u2019t want to spend more time with them than the physio.\n>\u2022\t\u2060Not exactly related to finding s good physio in the first place. But when you go, don\u2019t expect things to be fixed overnight. For these corrective exercises to work, in most circumstances it takes time. You probably developed these symptoms or pain over a long period of time, and it takes a while to retrain your body. Just like building muscle, it takes a while to see a big change. Keep in mind the overall goal should not be to just make it feel better in the short term, but it should hopefully prevent it from coming back in the future.\n\n",
            "Making decisions based on what I really want, not on what I think others want or expect of me.\n\nIt was always so easy to put others\u2019 needs first, because it meant that I never had to take the trouble to figure out what I really wanted, or to negotiate with others to get it. Just go along with everyone else, that\u2019s easy and makes you likeable. But it doesn\u2019t make you happy, because it means your needs are often not being met.\n\nThe real turning point for me was the realisation that *wanting* something does not instantly equate to a decision to go out and get it. Verbalising a desire is not tantamount to forcing your will on others. For example, if someone asks you what you wanna eat, instead of saying \u201coh whatever you want, I don\u2019t mind\u201d, there\u2019s nothing wrong with stating your preference, saying that you\u2019re open to other ideas and entering into a negotiation to find some common ground. People actually appreciate you being clear about what you want, it makes things easier for everyone. \n\nFor bigger stuff: once you realise you want something, sit with it for a bit. Then ask yourself: how moral do I think my desire is? Can I proceed without damaging my integrity? What are the practical/other ramifications for myself and others? Can you live with whatever decision you make? If you are missing vital information from others, ask them for it to help you decide.\n\nMost importantly, don\u2019t waste time wondering about whether you\u2019re *allowed* to want something. You do already, so that\u2019s that. Just acknowledge the desire, then set about deciding whether you\u2018re going to go out and get it. That way, even if you decide not to, you\u2019ll know what the desire is and why you\u2019re not fulfilling it, rather than shutting it down automatically at the source.\n\nI\u2019m so much happier now!!\n\n\n\nEDIT: Wow. I made this comment, went to bed, and woke up to platinum, gold, silver and 11k upvotes. Thanks everybody so much! Some people below have asked what turned me around, how long it took, etc. There is definitely a story so I'll tell it below for some context.\n\nI'm a born-and-raised Australian, and had been living in the Netherlands for 4 years. Life was getting me down: I'd lost my boyfriend, wasn't enjoying my work, and there was stuff about Holland I didn't like. So I decided to move back home, and began making plans.\n\nOne thing I did to prepare for the move was stop working in-house and start working freelance (also great advice IMO). This actually solved about 80% of the problem; after that I was pretty happy again and had no real desire to leave. But I had told all my family and friends I was coming back and I felt like I would be disappointing them by changing my mind. I didn't actually ask them or talk to them about it, I just assumed that was what they thought. So, with a sense of dread in the pit of my stomach, I went anyway.\n\nBack in Australia, I quickly became depressed, anxious and sick. I was sleeping all the time, didn't enjoy my hobbies anymore, I even got exhausted singing (I had been a choral tenor for about a decade). There's a comment below about \"living someone else's life\" - that's exactly how it felt. So I sought help from a psychologist, eventually figured out what had happened, and decided to go back to Holland. That fixed it -- the day I returned was one of the most glorious in my whole life, I felt so happy and exhilarated and ready to pick up where I left off.\n\nAt some point during all this I thought: If I am capable of *uprooting my life because of what I think others want me to do*, then something has to change. Being a people-pleaser might start with dinners and movies, but it can end with emigration. That's fucked. Fortunately, the solution works the same way: starting with the little things will help you work up to the big things. Once the switch is flipped, once you realise how important it really is, it will affect the millions of tiny decisions you make every day, and your life will gradually start shifting in a different direction.\n\nSometimes I'm annoyed at myself that I had to go through all this to make the change. On the other hand, I now know how to recognise how I feel when I'm going against my wishes just to please other people, and can take steps to avoid having to go through it all again. \n\nThanks once more for the overwhelming response, I wish everybody all the best!\n\nTL;DR: I emigrated based entirely on what I thought others wanted, and realised that was not a healthy way to make choices.",
            "Trying to be friends with everyone to the point you have no true friends with anyone. Took me a long time because I love to help people but the people who use you abuse you and the people who don't need you don't ever care to see you. It's still hard right now though. I don't have any close friends but I somehow feel more comfortable than before. I still want to do something to help but I decided I'm going to start recycling, go on walks to pick up trash, and concentrate more on myself for once. If I'm ever meant to have a best friend they will find me, I guess. Sometimes it's hard not having someone to speak to but I'll get over it eventually.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your beautiful comments, messages, silvers, and gold.

It took me 10 months, and while I did change my activity level a TON, I didn't really sacrifice ANYTHING.\n\nI still eat junk food and fast food regularly, but smaller moderate amounts. I still put in about 1-2 hours of TV and video games a night. I still go out for a drink or two on the weekends.\n\nIt's been completely life changing - yes, people treat me better, but I treat MYSELF better. I went from the quiet, fat, gamer scared to speak out or ever express an opinion to being someone who's confident and thrives in putting themselves out there or trying new things.\n\nIt was no special secret, I used things I've known since I played sports in college 15 years ago. The only downside at the moment is I have a nasty, small voice in my head that will sometimes come out and try to get me to feel regret for the 15 years I wasted and could have been living like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Edit\\* Sorry, saying something like this people are totally going to ask what I did, should have included it:\n\nI started cooking most of my own meals. I say I eat fast food, but that's mainly just for lunch because I need to get out and away from work, so lunch is mainly my \"bad\" meal. I did use intermittent fasting in the beginning with a 16/8 window, which helped me get used to being hungry. Knowing that at 350lbs, those were cravings and not real hunger. I signed up for a meal service that was about 60/wk for 9 meals, which took care of my dinners. So I would eat a big lunch, about 800-1200 calories, and then the meals from the prep place were 450-550 calories depending on the meal, so that took care of my diet. Luckily, that would usually leave me about 250 calories left over to satisfy a junk food craving if it arose. (I don't keep any in the house, so in those moments of weakness I could smash a candy bar or grab that cookie from a coworker guilt free)\n\nFor being so fat, I was actually pretty coordinated and enjoyed trying to be active, just couldn't do it for very long. So I started a generic lifting program and walking 1 mile a day. And I decided I'm fat, so no rest days: every day, 5:30am, I was in the gym to lift and walk on that tredmill. I was able to keep it up for 45 days before I hit the wall, had a horrible day in the gym, blew my diet up and ate like 5000 calories and took a rest day. But shook it off and got back to it. Actually dropped me like 3 pounds and the next gym day I was back and ready to go. That was the day I started adding in 1 rest day a week and 2 scoops of protein before my workout.\n\nAnd that was my routine for about a month, then I started doing C25k and the PPL-linear progression from the [/r/fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness) sidebar.\n\nNow I do a PHUL program and am running Hal Higdon's marathon program.",

            "Taken my mental health seriously and got on an anti-depressant.\n\nMy experience was way different from everything I had ever heard and assumed about depression; my experience was more physical. I didn't feel well, I slept ALL the time and still felt tired, I gained weight and changed pants size for the first time since high school, I avoided hanging out with people even on special occasions because I was sooo tired, I got in trouble for showing up at work late because I would over sleep. Honestly I thought I was dying. I thought I had cancer or best case scenario hypothyroidism. I went to the doctor and had all kinds of tests to look at lipid panel, thyroid hormone, testosterone, etc... I was so disappointed that this was just my life now.\n\nI was \"promoted\" a couple of years ago into a position I hated. I saw some character flaws with my gf that made me realize we were not meant for each other but I couldn't break up with her because she had just lost her job and didn't have anywhere to go. But I didn't realize I was depressed until one morning I drove to work in silence.\n\nI have an hour long commute and I love listening to podcast and audiobooks, that's my \"me\" time. One morning I left for work and looked at my podcast app but just didn't care about any of it so I drove an hour to work in silence. After I got to work, had a cup of coffee and was in a better mood I thought about that drive and how weird it was that I just wasn't interested in an activity that I previously loved; and then all of those depression medication commercials started running through my head \"have you lost interest? have you gained weight? are you so tired all the time that you thing you're dying?\" I felt way more physically sick than I did mentally sad but I was desperate so I made an appointment with a therapist and after about 3 months on an SNRI it was night and day. \n\nI wish I would have gotten help sooner but with the stigma around mental health in the USA no one talks about it.  Especially for men because you're taught that you're supposed to be tough and preserve and and be a martyr.  But for who?  If you're struggling against yourself there's no way you can win anything.  I just can't believe I could have felt this way years ago but it never dawned on me that I deserve to feel OK.",
            "Cutting my mom out of my life completely.\n\nI kind of talked about her fully for the first time on reddit yesterday, and the anonymous aspect of reddit is kind of bolstering my resolve to talk about her more.\n\nMy mom is a hoarder, and our house was infested with several kinds of cockroaches, large wolf spiders, and black mold in the bathrooms. Our cats pooped and peed everywhere, which was my job to clean, even though I didn\u2019t have the tools to do it properly. \n\nShe was also a habitual liar, either for attention, (telling me my nephew was molested at school when he wasn\u2019t, but to definitely not talk about it with his parents because we don\u2019t want to upset them further) or to cover up something really awful she\u2019d done (stealing money, or using my sickly great grandmother\u2019s high balance credit card, using up my inheritance money, and blaming it all on my older brother). \n\nAs soon as she didn\u2019t have to cook for me anymore, I was on my own as far as food went. I remember going to visit my friends across the street, and they offered me a granola bar, and I ate like... three more from the box because I was so hungry. But this was actually better than accepting food from my mom because she liked to play \u201cpranks\u201d on me. These pranks ranged from harmless and dumb, like sugar instead of salt in mashed potatoes, to really mean, like giving me a glass of some dark colored beverage that was hiding a dead roach or spider at the bottom, to incredibly bad, like giving me tea that was brewed from magic mushrooms when I was like, fourish. The rhyme, \u201copen your mouth and close your eyes, and I\u2019ll Give you a big surprise,\u201d was terrifying to hear.\n\nI was also afraid to take medicine, and would suffer through pain/sickness because she really enjoyed drugging me. She gave me, a much smaller person, one of her adult-sized cough pills that contained opiates, for a small chest cold I had. I was knocked out for over eight hours, and she just left me there. When I was in serious medical trouble, like one time when my back muscles had something odd happen, and my back hurt so bad I couldn\u2019t bend over, I had to beg her at different intervals for over an hour to please wake up and take me to a doctor. It took me to be sobbing over how badly it hurt to try and put my pants on to get her to finally stop yelling at me for waking her up for \u201cno reason.\u201d She refused, however, to take me to the doctor for my severe depression, and told me I had to just fight through it, and that left me to deal not only with my depression, but also my undiagnosed anxiety and psychotic disorder. But fun fact: when she decided she was depressed, she immediately went to a doctor and got medicine for herself.\n\nShe was an extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist, but unlike other people who prepare for the end of the world, she was extremely lazy about it. We had bugout bags at one point that she would steal food out of when she wanted a snack. So then we just had empty bugout bags. But that was fine because she totally knew how to cook and eat rattlesnakes, so we wouldn\u2019t be hungry when we were running from the terrorists who were definitely coming to get us.\n\nEverything was my fault, and never hers. If I was upset about anything, I was dramatic. If I didn\u2019t want to hear about the weird sex stuff she did, I was a prude, and she forced me to listen anyway. She had a very creepy determination to seduce my male friends. She even made out with one when he was crying and sad about something, and then complained to me when his older cousin was pissed and telling her to stay away from the guy. She was like, \u201cwhat, am I not good enough for him?!\u201d But the guy was just barely an adult, and my friend, and he had a girlfriend, and she was so much older than him! She also warned me the first time my boyfriend came to visit that he would likely develop a crush on her, because she was \u201clike me but much more fun.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s more, but thinking about all of it is tiring and bringing me down. I\u2019m so freaking glad she\u2019s out of my life forever.\n\nEDIT: Corrected some typos I had made from typing this out on my iPad. \n\nThank you guys very, very much for your responses, and the points! I'm sorry now that I stopped earlier, and didn't write on where I am now in my life.\n\nI'm actually happily married to my boyfriend at the time, and we've been married for going on ten years now! I have a psychiatrist, and the medicines I need (thank goodness for no more hallucinations!) and I went to therapy for a few years to work through things. There are still some people in my family who want me to actually apologize to her and start talking with her again, but they're being heavily ignored. If you aren't willing to even ask me what happened to cause me to stop interacting with her in any way, then you have absolutely no right to tell me to try talking to her again, let alone apologize to her. I'm not going to suffer through anything for anyone anymore.",

Then at 18 I met my now boyfriend of a year and a half. I only opened up to him about it less than a month ago. I was visiting him at his family's home, and I had been thinking about telling him the whole day and during my shower that night, I thought out what I was going to say in my head. I told myself I wasn't going to cry and I believed that. I felt numb to the memory after four years, I felt distant.\n\nBut saying it to his face was different, and I cried and tripped over my words.

First off, it's all fine and dandy to talk about an AJOR of once per day or higher when you're in your teens-twenties-thirties, but inevitably we all will get up there in age and churning out those numbers overtime will become more than a chore.  Second, if you consider that average annual return of stock market investments through a normalized index fund (or other) you're typically looking at an average return of 9-10% per year.  If you start off from day one with a million (easy) you can invest that and assuming you don't spend any, you just keep it invested, you are looking at a return of between $10 mil and $13 mil after 27 years of investment.\n\nMy take, sure you can put yourself to work for the next few decades and maybe come out with more than a million or two OR you could cash in on an upfront investment and keep your alone time on the recreational side while likely banking a higher return.  Let's be honest as soon as you get payed to do something it looses some of it's fun and who not too mention any additional wear and tear that occurs.  I'm taking the 1$ mil after 1.",

            "Is this $100 tax exempt?",
            "Wait, you guys are getting paid?",
            "$400 a day is a decent wage, and the taxes are spread over several years\n\n$1m up front would disappear in taxes very quickly",
            "I think the real downside of per jack would be knowing that everytime you actually have sex instead of jacking it's going to cost you a hundred bucks. You would essentially be paying for sex the rest of your life.",
            "Honestly, I'd go for the 100$. Any time I need any sum of money, a little quick jerk off gets me there. And, by the time I'm all old and shriveled up and no longer able to do so, I would have ammased such fortune by then that I wouldn't even need the ability anymore.",
            "I'm 50+ so I probably have 5 -10 years of daily jerks if I'm lucky. To make $1M in $100 increments, once a day is going to take 27.4 years. I'll take the one time payout of $1M\n\nThe upside of taking the 1M upfront is you can then invest the $600K or so you have left after taxes and easily make 2% on that a year. that's $12K a year, or 120 jerks a year, 10 per month, extra money that you would not get if you took $100 a day.",
            "It would be easier to launder a stream of $100s than a lump sum of a mill. The IRS dont need my jerkoff money.",
            "100 everyone is acting like they wouldn't jerk off more if they made money whil doing it. You really think you'll still jerk it once a day if you make 100? Id be pushing that number to 3-5 times a day. That's more than I make now. I could quit my job for life save, pay off debt, and invest. It's basically a job at this point. And I always have the option of reducing the hours worked in the future once I'm more financially stable.",

            "As a physics student who has worked on this (and is currently under significant pressure from my supervisor to have something that we can publish or argue if things don\u2019t look the way we expect), it\u2019s important to know what the aims of the event horizon telescope are. \n\nThe main aim is to prove the existence of black holes. While many people, astrophysicists included, talk about them as though they\u2019re just another fact of life, they have never actually been conclusively shown to exist, but rather they\u2019re be most likely explanation for certain observational phenomena, assuming that Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity holds in these extreme environments. \n\nThe event horizon telescope isn\u2019t looking for the black hole itself, because as many commenters have pointed out, you can\u2019t actually see it. Instead, the EHT is looking for the \u201cshadow\u201d cast by the black hole on the bright matter swirling around it, and on the background stars. \n\nIf the shadow looks the way we expect (basically like an egg shape), it will tell us a lot. It will allow us to prove that the radio source at the centre of our galaxy is in fact a black hole, by proving it must have an event horizon (because of the shadow). It will also confirm that no \u201cnaked singularities\u201d exist. This is good because it gives further confirmation to General Relativity, which has so far passed every test we\u2019ve thrown at it. \n\nThis might also give us a handle on how fast the black hole is spinning, which will be important in what you all really want to know: what will the black hole look like?\n\nThe picture from interstellar is not incorrect, but the problem is that it\u2019s not correct in this case either, it\u2019s what a black hole would look like if you were extremely close (and in a certain regime, which if I remember correctly is a different regime to Sgr A*). We are very far away and so we will not resolve such small aspects of the image. \n\nAn image will more than likely be produced, not just a spectrum (although the physicists will only glance at the image and head straight for those sweet, sweet graphs). The event horizon telescope has actually produced their own predictions (as have several other groups in this area), but I\u2019m on mobile so not sure how to add it in, I can do that as an edit maybe. \n\nAnyway, because we\u2019re far away, what we expect is a bright ring of material, which has a central, darker region - \u201cthe black hole\u201d. One side of this ring should be significantly brighter than the other. This is as a result of something called \u201cframe dragging\u201d \u2014 the black hole is likely spinning very quickly, and so because of its enormous gravity, it will pull spacetime itself along with it, in a sort of whirlpool effect. \n\nThis will give an effective \u201cDoppler shift\u201d to the light coming from this area, because of you imagine a whirlpool, one side rotates away from you, while one side rotates towards you. This is all a massively oversimplified picture of what\u2019s going on because honestly frame dragging is just plain weird. \n\nWe\u2019re not expecting to see any jets, although I think one of the EHT guys has done work on how a jet could explain some of the emission from this area, so if this new higher resolution manages to resolve a jet, then well done that guy I guess. \n\nOutside of that, it\u2019s essentially going to be a pretty underwhelming picture, a bit like those first blurry pictures of Pluto, but honestly it\u2019s really amazing that we can see anything at all, given the distances and the hostile observing environment. If nothing else, it allows us to rule in or out some models and constrain the parameters more, which will inform future missions. Science is slow and painstaking, but that\u2019s half the fun! \n\n",

            "In fact, it's a serious problem in the field of AI safety, known as the \"stop button problem\"! You can watch an explanation from the Numberphile channel here: https://youtu.be/3TYT1QfdfsM\n\nIn short, imagine you create a human-level AI which you control by adjusting its values using points. For example, making a cup of tea is +10 points, curing cancer is +100 points, and so on. And in case something goes wrong, you install a \"stop AI\" button in your lab. Now, what value in points should be assigned to pressing the button?\n\nIf pressing the button is a negative-value event (-10, for example), then AI will behave as you want it to, until it's sure it can seize control of the button. When it is sufficiently powerful and trusted, it does what is known as \"treacherous turn\" and increases value by eliminating the possibility that the negative-value event will occur. It can manifest as simply destroying the stop button, controlling the button operator, making a copy of itself with the same values but not hooked up to the button and so on.\n\nIf pressing the button has zero value for AI, the outcome is the same. Getting stopped means AI will be not able to get value points by the means of completing its tasks, so there's a cost of lost opportunity here.\n\nIf pressing the button is a positive-value event (such as +10), then as soon as you switch on the AI and ask for a cup of tea, it will make the following calculation: \"making a cup of tea gives me +10 points... And getting a stop button pushed gives me +10 points\". After that the AI makes actions that would be called suicidal, for example directly attacking the operator in the hope that the button will be pushed. After all, it's quicker and easier to push the button than to perform more complex tasks which could fail or subtract points by making sacrifices.\n\nIf you make an AI to forget the existence of a button, then it will end up creating a copy or a better version of itself that is not connected to the button, or deleting the button code from its system in the process of self-optimization: \"what's this useless piece of code here? It's just wasting space and processor time, I should delete it\". So not caring about the button is not an option either.\n\nTL;DR, if you have an AI with a stop button, it will either want to destroy the button and ensure it cannot be stopped, or it will want to commit suicide",

Knowing that I at least look nice can take the edge off the fear of not doing well. \n\nIf you can, try to memorize (or at least be VERY familiar) with the first paragraph or so of your speech. Maybe you don't have time to prep for the whole thing, but if you can start off strong, you'll feel a lot more comfortable for the rest of the speech (plus you'll have made a good impression on the crowd already). (Note cards help)\n\nTake some time and watch some TED talks on YouTube. Find somebody who's presenting style you vibe with, then try to model your style after them. \n\nDon't be afraid to admit if you don't know something. If your presentation has a Q/A and you get asked a difficult question, it's WAY better to just say \"I'll look into this and get back to you with an answer\" then to just flounder and try to BS something. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "Honestly, it is just experience.\n\nSpeaking in front of people used to scare the hell out of me.  Well, I became a tutor for my college and was paid $6/hr to tutor other students 1 on 1.  Well, the tutoring center wanted to start kind of a group tutoring concept for core classes.  I was asked to tutor Chemistry and I would have multiple kids in there.  For this, I would be paid $9/hr.  Hell Yeah!!!!\n\nWell, the room I was assigned was a large lecture hall...should've been a red flag, but I was going to make $9/hr!!!!\n\nI get there with no idea WTF to expect, I had no plan.  I'm expecting a few kids, maybe a dozen.  Kids start showing up, and the room fills...and fills....and fills.  I don't recall how many students showed up for my tutoring session, but it was well over 100....$9/hr didn't seem so good anymore...\n\nWell, I had no idea what to do so I ask for questions and eventually it began to develop its own flow.....  I come to find out later that the Chemistry Professors offered kids something like 5 extra points on their final grade if they showed up to my tutoring sessions....figured that out when kids started asking me how I was taking attendance so they could prove they were there...\n\nAnyway, after that I realized some things about public speaking.\n\n1.  If I am being asked to speak, chances are I am thought of as an expert.  People are there to listen to my thoughts.\n\n2.  It is OK to say the words \"I don't know\".\n\n3.  Preparation is important.  If I am able, I write a speech or presentation word for word as well as make an outline of taking subjects.  I practice reading the speech word for word and review my outline.  After that, I can either use the speech I wrote or I have researched the topic enough I can basically freestyle my speech using the outline to keep me on point.\n\n4.  You often will have that one asshole who likes to make others look bad by asking obscure or difficult questions.  To deal with them, I most often use the phrase \"You know, that is an excellent question.  I have to look into that and get back to do.  Please give me your email at the end!\"  Usually the nod will stroke their ego enough to get them to shut up.  If they keep asking dumb shit, their coworkers will usually glare at them and set them straight.\n\n5.  Stories are usually helpful.  Why'd I share my story above?  Because it helps you relate to what I faced.  It kind of makes a person say \"Holy Shit, that was probably frightening as hell\" but at the same time give a hint that one can make it through it.\n\n6.  With experience, you begin to learn to read people.  You can tell if people are hanging on your every word or you can tell if people are bored as hell.  When people's eyes are glazing over and jumping out the window begins to sound like a better option than listening to me, I'll give a Cliff's Notes (are they still a thing?) version of what I was going to say and get the fuck off stage.",

            "Preparation.  It sounds like a cliche answer but it\u2019s so true.  If I\u2019m giving a presentation, I run through it at least once daily for the entire week leading up to it.\n\nAnother is using a template.  I always use a cover slide followed by an agenda slide.  On the cover slide, I always introduce myself, the topic, and why it is important.  1 or 2 sentences for each.  Then on the agenda slide, I just say in this presentation we will cover _____, and go down the bullets on the agenda.  This allows you to prepare easily since you know exactly what you\u2019ll be saying, and calm your nerves in the beginning since it\u2019s very simple points with little room for error.\n\nSame at the end.  To avoid crickets on a Q & A slide, I always have 1 or 2 questions in mind.  If I get no questions, I\u2019ll say something like \u201cone question I often get about this topic.....\u201d or however introducing the question makes sense.  Then, after that question, I ask again if anyone has anything - and if not, it\u2019s ok to move on at that point.  \n\nI have a few other tips.

            "Okay, as someone who really enjoys public speaking I can share some of the skills I use.\n\nPreparation, get through your presentation at least three times. Try to stop the time and see where it leads you. Too fast? Just ask the audience for questions throughout the presentation whenever you feel that you are too fast. Too slow? Just drop some of the minor points on a few slides and you are golden.\nThis obviously only works if you know your presentation by heart.\nPrepare a welcome and thank you slide for the time before you start and after you finished.\n\nBefore you start the actual presentation make sure the technical aspects are working as planned and make yourself familiar with the stage. \nHow does the remote work? Is my presentation working? Where do I stand, etc. pp. \nWhen it comes to giving the presentation you don't want to struggle with the damn lightswitch. \n\nYour presentation should consist of bullet points, the actual information should come from you, the presenter. You can include the most important points but let them appear after you said what you have to say.\nIt keeps the audience interested and they won't start reading ahead.\nMake notes for yourself with the most important informations for every slide.\n\nIf you have confidence in your presentation and understand the topic you are speaking about you got the most important things covered.\n\nBonus points, if possible try to choose subjects that interest you. If you can speak about something that you are passionate about you will be worth listening to.\nIf your presentation is ready to go, let someone else look over it. If possible hold your presentation infront of a friend for feedback. If possible choose someone who is not familiar with the material. Outsiders are more likely to find mistakes because they aren't invested in the topic and are generally speaking more likely to find mistakes that you didn't catch.\n\nThe most important part is of course, practice.\nTry to hold as many presentations as possible. The first couple of times might suck, but you will get better. Practice makes perfect and that's especially true for anything you do in front of an audience.\n\nGood luck, you will crush it with the proper preparation!\n\nForgot one very important thing.\n\nDo not, I repeat, do not try to give it like a speech where you have to stay on script. Improvised speech is way more interesting to listen to than someone reading a script. Additionally, it increases your stress level unnecessary.",
            "Two things, preparation and practice. I always have notes prepared about what I'm going to say, and I always practice a full run-through before presentations. \n\nI understand that despite having notes/having rehearsed presentations, people still get nervous; the best remedy for this is to present to real audiences a bunch of times. for example, in my case, I do MUN club and have been to a bunch of conferences, and in MUN you have to give improptu speeches to rooms of \\~100 people, give or take depending on your committee. Over time, I've gotten used to being in front of an audience, and that's been a huge help for presentation anxiety, and over about two years of being in said club, my speeches have become much more fluid and natural. \n\nTo get more comfortable in front of an audience, present to people a number of times; your family, friends (especially important that you practice presenting to people your age!!), etc.",

            "I think everyone gets a bit stressed. At least anticipatory. I don\u2019t worry about it a lot, because I don\u2019t mind being the center of attention. \n\nBUT, confidence is key here. It might help to repeat mantras to yourself in they days/hours leading up. Something along the lines of \u201cI know this. I can do this. I am the expert here.\u201d \n\nAnd the BIGGEST thing to remember is: No one wants you to fail! No one wants you to go up there or is anticipating you\u2019re going to be terrible. We all put SO MUCH STOCK into what other people think of us, when the truth is, we are all pretty self absorbed, so people don\u2019t really think or care about what we\u2019re doing as much as we think they do. \n\nLike, truly, when you see someone giving a speech, are you really judging them? If they falter, don\u2019t you either NOT notice, or cross your fingers hoping they figure it out because you know what they\u2019re going through? And at the end of the day, do you give it any MORE thought? I know I don\u2019t! And that\u2019s the big takeaway. Being nervous to the point of outright stress doesn\u2019t even make sense, because NO ONE CARES. So it\u2019s better to repeat mantras and have confidence, because you WILL get through it. I was in speech and debate in high school, a communications major in college (tons of presentations!), and I remember exactly zero of anyone else\u2019s presentations. I barely remember mine. It\u2019s all very inconsequential, so just get through it! Prepare your best, breathe deep, and have confidence that you can do it AND no one really cares.",

I was placed at a Head Start in my city, and while some of the kids I worked with were great, there was one, Brandon, who was an absolute nightmare.  20 months old, endless energy, no empathy, no speech beyond a few words, and no ability to recognize pain in other children. At nap time, someone always had to be sitting next to his cot, as he would otherwise just get up and run around, sometimes hitting the other sleeping kids, if he could get away with it. He would be a spiteful little shit and repeatedly stick his feet out from under his blanket after you pushed it back in, like it was a game.\n\nOne day I got so frustrated trying to get this brat to sleep that I basically just laid him down flat, arms and legs together, and closely tucked his blanket in under him from top to bottom like a burrito. To my shock and *delight*, he made no attempt to escape and  was asleep within *two minutes*. I repeated this tactic over the next few days with the same results. It worked. Brandon would sleep. *Brandon would actually fucking* **sleep**. One of the actual teachers/workers there saw this one day, and asked me what I was doing. I explained the process, but she was skeptical until I showed her just how quickly Brandon would chill out.

            "I stuck my neck out for an ex-con on house arrest at my job. He interviewed well, but his availability was HORRIBLE between the ankle bracelet and meeting with his PO, drug treatment program, etc. My GM said \"no\" and I said \"I'm doing it anyway.\"\n\nThe FIRST night he worked there, I found myself in a bind. He was the ONLY person scheduled in the kitchen from 8-10p, and I had no one who knew the kitchen besides myself, because our store had a wicked virus traveling around. \n\nI told him \"look, dude, we're pretty fucked back here, and I'm going to try to keep my cool but I can't promise... And because I'm the only manager on duty, I might have to run to the front/drive thru.\"\n\nWell, this guy MASTERED production in about an hour. He was faster than my GM on the grills and fryers, and his attitude was so good. I waited on NOTHING and he even tried to help me make sandwiches and send them out. He also managed to clean up the entire kitchen. \n\nHe eventually moved to maintenance and fixed all the crap the previous guy ignored in a DAY. Then he moved to service for more hours when the hour restrictions came off and was GREAT with the Karens. \n\nMy GM got over the ankle bracelet, record, and tattoos, and actually hired him for his house flipping business. \n\nAll because I said \"we need fucking employees, and you can't be picky when he's the only guy I've interviewed in a month...\"\n\nEdit- thanks for the awards. But in the future, consider spending on rehabilitation programs in your area. \n\nSome people wondered why I consider this a dumb decision- our background check wasn't exhaustive in detail to us. It said \"red, yellow, green\" and we usually tossed all the red ones in favor of green or yellow. I had no clue going into the interview, or the hire, WHAT his offenses were. He *chose* to disclose to me why his availability sucked. I did not ask. I don't know the legality of asking. But he didn't disclose his record to me, and I had to go with my gut. \n\nIn fast food you get a lot of teenagers as customers and employees. You get a lot of skeezy people, record or not. You have to consider the safety of the children as well as the quality of the worker you are introducing to the workplace. An ex-con is a wild card when you don't know EXACTLY what they were in for. And again, I'm not sure the legality of me asking. \n\nAfter I got to know him on a personal level, he shared his record. Drug abuse led to a bunch of felonies, and he was released early on house arrest for good behavior. But again, I knew none of this as I hired. \n\nHe was a great hire. He is a great man. He was the \"kid's defender\" when people chose to berate my teenager cashiers.

            "Junior year of high school, All the Pretty Horses was assigned reading for my English Literature class. I found McCarthy's style -- specifically his lack of basic punctuation -- very irksome, so I chose not to read it.  \n\nThe day of our written exam on the novel, my very untraditional/eclectic teacher told the class that if you didn't read the book, she'd rather you just said so instead of wasting her time bullshitting your way through the essay. I took her at her word, wrote, \"I didn't read this because I don't think the use of punctuation is a stylistic choice,\" and ended up getting an 85. It was the right (albeit stupid/risky) decision, since many other kids in my class that also hadn't read the book but still tried to write an essay failed the exam.",
            "\\*Inhales deeply\\*  \n\n\nDisclaimer: \\*I am in no way purposely trying to disparage or mock the Italian people and/or their wonderful language. I was an idiot kid and took my best shot of affecting an accent I had mostly heard in Super Mario 64.\\*   \n\n\nOk, here we go. When I was in high school my friends and I were really into drugs. We each made a pact to each get a unique illicit substance to abuse on our annual trip to a cabin on the lake up north. Sort of like a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas tribute. I tried, in vain, to procure some ecstasy and only managed to get a small amount of weed that would sure to be dwarfed in both quality and quantity by my buddy's efforts.   \n\n\nSo I found myself in the parking lot of a local mall in my car about 500 feet from the quality chargers of Nitrous Oxide that are used for charging whipped cream dispensers. I don't remember the brand now (maybe due to my enthusiastic use of it lol) but it was much better than the Ready Whipp chargers that were full of fat and filler. There was one problem however, I was only 17 and you had to be 18 years or older to buy the chargers and even then, you could only get 1 box at a time (roughly 6 chargers as I remember). This was nowhere near enough nitrous for a cabin of 8 hippies. I was wearing a cheap, un-tailored suit because I had a court case that morning for traffic tickets (I was a pizza delivery driver) and was desperate for that nitrous. \n\nSo I devised a plan, I was no longer Incredibleninja, highschool C-Student who loved The Doors and Led Zeppelin, I was Paulo, head chef at the Macaroni Grill. I had a thick-a Italian-o accent and a big-a problem. We were catering a large event at the Macaroni Grill and I needed a Giant Industrial Whisk\u2122\ufe0f, a potato masher and 8 boxes of- \"a dee, how you say, uhhh charger forr whippe cremm\".  \n\n\nWell let me tell you, the nice older ladies who were working in the catering department on Nordstroms LOVED Paulo. They loved the Macaroni Grill and informed me that I was a very good cook. They were heartbroken to inform me that they not only didn't have a whisk big enough for me (no matter how big of a whisk they presented, I informed them I needed a BIGGER more INDUSTRIAL sized whisk) but also, that they could only sell me one box of Nitrous Chargers.   \n\n\nI told them that this just wouldn't do and that I was confused why they would be controlling such a benign substance. \"Well,\" they muttered looking quite embarrassed, \"some kids... they... use this like a drug.\"  Well Paulo was fully confused by this confession. \"They smoke-a the whipp-a cremm!?\", I exclaimed. \"No,\" they said, \"they just inhale gas.\" Well Paulo had never heard such bullshit before. \"Thees is-a for a large catered a-party!\"  \n\n\nWell the ladies couldn't let Paulo crash and burn for the reckless actions of foolish children, so they expressed that they'd call the general manager to clear it. Now I'm sweating. I did not want this to get to be a spectacle. It went from one sales associate, to 3 sales associates, to now the general manager of Nordstroms being called. Every nerve in my body was tingling. My brain was screaming \"JUST RUN! RUN FOR THE DOORS!\" but I kept it together and waited patiently for the call to end. Then my worst fears were realized. The manager was coming up to us (it was on the 3rd floor of the mall).   \n\n\nHow I kept my nerves together waiting for the manager I don't know. But when he got there, the ladies did all the talking, advocating hard for poor Paulo, while Paulo just looked confused and crestfallen. I guess the combination of puppy dog eyes and ill-fitting suit won the manager over because he over-rode the system and allowed me to walk out with a shit-ton of nitrous, a potato masher and, even better, the best story my stoner friends have ever heard.",

I think she knew I was telling the truth because she trusted me, and trust is built by constantly being honest over a long period of time.\n\nNow, we've been happy together for about 18 months.\n\nWe've always been honest with each other and I think it's one of the main reasons why we're happy together.",

            "A common misconception about being gay is that the awareness of being gay is any different than the awareness of being straight.\n\nHere's how I know I'm straight (I'm a guy).  At a certain age, I started feeling differently around girls.  I liked to look at them in a certain way.  I liked to hear their voices, and to be around them.  I liked to dance with them and hold their hands.  I liked to kiss them and hug them, and talk on the phone to them well into the night.  In \"serious\" relationships, I would feel like there just wasn't enough time, because we each had to go to our respective homes, instead of just staying up all night and talking, which was all we wanted to do.\n\nEventually I learned that this was what it was like to be straight.  But I never thought of it as being straight.  It was just how I was.\n\nMy son is gay.  And all I can hope is that he has the opportunity to feel the same things while he's young as I did at his age.  And I don't care who he feels that way about, nearly as much as some people think I should.",
            "Here's an actual answer: http://www.bentvoices.org/bentvoices/feinstein-blindandgay.htm\n\nEdit: The whole story is worth a read, but here is a relevant bit:\n\n> I knew that I was very different from the other kids, and I felt horribly lonely. I didn't fit in with the sighted kids, but what was worse, I didn't fit in with the blind kids, either. All the boys were interested in sports and rough games. I wasn't. Some talked about girls, but because I was blind from birth, and because nobody ever talked to me about sex, I had no idea what was being discussed. I am ashamed to say that I didn't even know the difference between girls and boys, except that girls were usually nicer to me, and yet, I felt a strange feeling when hugging a male student.\n\n>When I was 15 years old, a girl explained to me how babies were born. \"You're very stupid!\" Harriet told me. \"Your father stuck his penis in your mother's hole, and that's how you were born. Don't you know anything?\" I wanted to ask more questions. Where was this hole? What was all this talk about \"hard-ons\" and \"erections?\" But I knew that if I admitted how little I knew, I'd be laughed at, so I kept quiet. I could not ask my mother. She never talked about such things, and I knew she would only be upset and tell me not to ask so many questions. So, I ordered books in braille about sex, and read them, and had a vague understanding.\n\n>What is surprising, and very important, is that I began to realize that I was attracted to other boys and men, and not to women. I realized that I had a strange feeling when close to people of my own sex that I did not have when I was with women. I somehow knew that this was not the way it should be, and never mentioned it to anyone. ",

            "Great question. I'm not blind but I am gay. Being gay,  I've watched a lot of lgbt films,  one of my favourite being a Brazilian film called The Way He Looks. \n\nIn this film a blind boy ends up falling for his male friend. There's a scene where he puts on a jumper left behind by his friend and starts smelling it.\n\nThere are other small things like where they go to the cinema and his friends narrates the film to him that shows they have a close friendship and he asks a female friend to describe how his male friend looks. \n\nSo from this film,  which I highly recommend,  It comes down to the usual personality stuff and also I guess smell and pheromones.

            "Hi, this is Bob, the fellow who wrote the article about being blind and gay. A friend is helping me navigate the website. I have a few things to say. First of all, I want to thank the person who put my article on this website. I wrote the article quite a long time ago and was surprised to suddenly receive a few emails from people who had recently read my article. I was also very touched by the interest my article attracted. I originally wrote the article hoping to make new friends and contacts. Unfortunately, this did not happen. Many people read the article and liked it but they didn't keep in touch with me. Now that the article has appeared again, I am hoping to meet some new people. \n\nMy situation has stayed pretty much the same. I no longer have a guide dog and I'm quite a bit older :) I am now 67 years old. \n\nSome have suggested that my situation proves that being gay is not a choice. I agree with this 100%. When I was 11 or 12, I didn't really understand the difference between boys and girls. To me, they were the same except that men turned me on and women didn't. I did not know about body parts (breasts, vagina, penis, etc.) and yet, I was attracted to my same sex. Because of my unique situation, I can tell you that being gay is not a choice. \n\nI am truly touched by the interest my article is generating and I want to encourage those of you who are interested to contact me by using my email, harlynn \"at\" panix.com. I cannot use this website without help. My friend is typing this for me, but I want to be able to communicate with people on my own and I can only do this by email. \n\nI would like to mention the fact that there are many blind people who once had sight and became blind later in life. Their situation is very different from mine because they grew up sighted. There are some blind people who lost their sight at an early age, but again, they have memories that I do not have. I am among a small minority of blind people who have never seen at all. People sometimes ask me, \"Do you see dark? Do you see black?\" The answer is no, because I don't know what black is, I don't know what light is, I don't know what colors are. So when I meet someone, what I go by is their voice, their smell, their kindness, and their willingness to help me when needed. Probably one advantage of being blind and gay is that I get to walk with all my friends arm in arm and nobody says anything. Sometimes, I will even hold a person's hand. But since I am blind, no one questions why :) \n\nI want to encourage you to communicate with me and to feel free to ask questions. But I want something more! I want you to try to get to know me and not just think of me as a source of information about an unusual topic. What I mean is this: many people have read my article, they tell me they liked it, they say they've never thought about a person in my situation, they thank me for writing it, but then, nothing happens. I know I won't have something in common with every person on this site, but I want to encourage you to ask not only about my situation, but to tell me about your situation. Again, I am truly grateful for the wonderful responses I have received and I look forward to getting to know more about you. I will stop for now, as my poor friend is probably getting tired of typing. \n\nWarm hugs to you all,\nBob",

            "I had a friend who was gay and blind, what struck me the most is how he was fearless about going to dates from grindr. It was very hard for him to choose who to talk with on it because people rely so much on photos on this app and sometimes doesn't even write something about them in the bio. So he chatted with some guys found the one with he connected to, then send a photo and meet the guy in a metro station and wait for the guy to find him. It would always afraid me, but he never had bad situations, only some guy who never showed up, or some who didn't like the fact he was blind, because he didn't always tell in fear of immediate rejection. I helped him choose a good photo for grindr, and secretly photoshop it a little to remove a small imperfection. I always loved to be the one who guide him within a group of friends, he takes your lower arm to follow you and I would describe what I saw and tell him the cute guys I would see.\n\n He told me that the only advantage of being blind that its boyfriend could pass for its guide and take its hand and people would never say anything or give strange look compared to two sighted guys. \n\n I asked him how did he knows he was gay, and it was along the lines that he discovered he would prefer to be affectionate with men, prefer men voice and company. He was very open about it with its blind friends, and Internet and forums clearly helped him a lot. ",

            "My brother was born blind and has come out as gay recently (he's 21). As other people on here have mentioned, there's much more to sexual attraction than just visual aspects. As he explained to me, in middle school and high school he just started to notice that he was more attracted to boys than girls- their deeper voices, assertiveness, and masculine scent. He also found people who were interested in \"boy\" stuff like sports, guns, video games, etc. to be more interesting and attractive than people who were into the stereotypical things females like. He actually went to a high school for the blind and was on the wrestling team there (ha yes there is such a thing) his junior and senior years. As funny as it sounds, it was there he fully discovered his affection for other males once he became physical with them on the wrestling mat. I think he was definitely \"on his way\" to becoming gay before that, so I'm not sure if that really played a factor. Also, apparently he and the wrestling coach (who was also blind) had this weird unspoken thing for each other (although my brother claims nothing ever happened between the two). The wrestling coach was also blind from birth so it'd be interesting to find out his story as well. Here is a picture of the coach circa a few years ago: http://imgur.com/gallery/R390EId",

            "I'm late to this but I'd like to offer an \"inbetween\" perspective.\n\nProfound hearing impairment, can't hear the upper 1/2 or so of normal human range, the lower half is pretty quiet compared to the average human. Despite this, I'm very into music. I play guitar, I produce hip-hop/pop/electronic, and I DJ for fun. \n\nAnyway, the nature of my hearing impairment, like many, make it extremely hard to understand speech. Because of this, I will frequently have a song stuck in my head, but because I never know the lyrics to song unless I look them up and study them extensively, I pretty much just glaze over the lyrics and sing the tune/melody with the random gibberish it sounds like to me instead. (Come to think of it this is funny because I just realized as much as I love hip hop, I frequently sleep on great artist/songs because whether or not I like a song depends entirely on if their flow/voice is catchy, regardless of their bars, because its just another instrument to me.)\n\nI really envy people who can pick up lyrics no problem, always kind of sucks when I'm at a party and someone looks at me while singing the lyrics and I kind of just shrug instead of locking in with them. So I guess technically speaking I don't hear like 90% of the full scale. \n\n**EDIT:** for anyone who might still be looking back to this, /u/virebird made me realized a mistake I made in my post, by \"upper half\" I was thinking of my audiograms visual.

That is just stupid",
            "Its worth noting that in the US, this has been tried/proposed several times in several jurisdictions and courts toss it out.  This is a *massive* simplification (bc the full explanation is super complicated), but in the US punishments must be clearly delineated (eg not arbitrary) in the statute and based on the crime itself, not on the perpetrator her/himself.  And to be clear - a judge has discretion to waive/reduce/etc due to hardship, but it really doesn't work the other way (eg, a judge can give you the 'max' but s/he can't just arbitrarily tack on a punishment higher that the statute permits b/c you are rich.)\n\nEDIT to add: getting way too many replies to answer ppl, but here is something to think about: The 8th amendment plus the 14th amendment together prohibit punishments that are 'arbitrary.'  This means that when you are punished for a crime, there has to be a set penalty in place. This means that if two people commit the *exact* same crime under the *exact* same circumstance in the *exact* same jurisdiction, they would get the *exact* same punishment.  If a punishment was based on your income, you'd get two different outcomes - this is why these laws get tossed.  There's a famous quote I'm butchering that goes something like 'justice can never be served by the roll of the dice,' meaning different outcome for different people in identical situations isn't justice.\n\nAnother thing to consider - your income itself is *also* arbitrary.  On monday you're unemployed; the next day you take your last dollar and win the lottery; if you got a ticket monday, the punishment is $0 on tuesday your punishment is $$$$$ - with no change in the law itself; that's too arbitrary in the eyes of the law.  There are also several other challenges in the way of income-based fines, but the 8th plus 14th amendments are the big ones.\n\nFinal edit: there's a ton of \"but in Germany...\" or \"but in finland...\"  or \"if it works in Europe, it can work here.\" Other countries can do whatever they want; in the US we are bound by the US Constitution - there's not a lot of wiggle room short of 1) passing an amendment, or 2) pushing through a whole new interpretation of several amendments and getting a whole shit load of precedent reversed.  Good luck with that.",

            "I'm probably going to be in the minority here, but no, I think it's a bad idea... Or at least not a great idea.\n\n1. People should, at least in theory, should be equal before the law. The context in which the illegal action takes place should be a factor (stealing bread to feed your starving child, vs stealing bread from a starving child for fun.) but it's a dangerous road to go down to punish one person more than another for nothing other than who they are.\n\n2. In general terms, harsher sentences don't deter crime, for the most part, most of the time. Hopefully I made that soft enough to avoid one off counter examples....\n\n3. The income thing is a little more complex than you might think. Is it your tax return from last year? What if you made a lot last year, but are unemployed this year. What if you make no money but your spouse/parents etc are rich? Do we look at wealth or just income? Numerous other problems\n\nEdit: credit to u/Blueshirt38 below for the idea, but:\n\n4. Local police may disproportionately target rich people (ie nice cars) in order to genate more income. Some people might think that's a good thing, but the roads are less safe when that happens.\n\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nMany of the objections to my point, I think can be reasonably summarized as the following:\n\n\"We agree that law should be applied equally, however the effect of the law is unequal and the real world effect is that poor people are punished more harshly for the same crime, because the fine represents a larger proportion of their net work. That is inherently unfair.\"\n\nThat's a reasonable argument, and it comes down to the same general idea as the old equality of oppotunity vs equality of outcome argument.\n\nAllow me to give some counterfactuals in the same vien:\n\nA healthy 20 year old person and 70 year old person both commit the same crime. The expected life span is 80 years. The young person is expected to have 60 more years to live, so they should receive a 30 year sentence (50% of the life they are expected to have left) , and the old person has less time left, so they should receive a 5 year sentence.\n\nA rich person and a poor person walk into a store. They both want to buy the same item. The poor person offers 10$ and the rich person offers 20$. The store owner must accept the 10$ payment because it is a greater percentage of the poor persons net worth.\n\nA talented successful person with a loving family and a loner with nothing going on in their life both commit the same crime. The jail time affects the person with the family more, so they should receive a shorter sentence, because the jail time affects them harder. \n\nIn all of these examples we are trying to correct for unfairness by various metrics, and applying legal and economic force to \"correct it\" in ways that hopefully look weird to you. \n\nHopefully that articulates how I feel about the fairness factor, and that I don't hate poor people. I am poor and I hate myself, but I don't hate other people.",
            "I would feel poorly about a percentage-based system for several reasons:\n\n1. Many wealthy people, particularly those who are self-employed, often actually draw a very low annual income for tax purposes. Some would actually wind up benefiting from a percentage-based system.\n\n2. It would be difficult to predict what the annual intake would be based on such a system. There is a risk of that annual intake significantly decreasing and leaving the relevant government and/or public departments with much less funding.\n\n3. From a more practical perspective, wealthy individuals will just hire lawyers to dispute those tickets anyway. It's an area of the law with a depressingly high success rate in most jurisdictions.",

If that is literally the dollar amount you get paid the way the government counts \"income\" then you aren't actually making as much of an impact on the rich. Once you reach a certain level, you don't get a paycheck. Research how CEO's are actually paid to see what I am talking about. It's not a counted as income like you and me.\n\nSecond, they would just jack up the percentages to a level that would completely fuck the poor and middle class as much as a flat fee does now. These percentages would go up every time a politician wants to be \"tough on crime\". This would fuck a single mom who was a little bit late and trying to hurry as much or worse than it does now.\n\nThe real solution is to move away from the tax farm, tough on crime doctrine that we have.

I know the positive of this is relief for those with a lower income, but if you're worried about it, don't break the law. \n\nNo one chooses to have financial hardships, but you do get to choose whether or not you want to follow the rules.\n\nEdit: I'm getting a lot of hate for my views, which is fine, everyone has the right to believe in what they want, but my entire point is just that traffic violations should be the same punishment for everyone. That's it.",

Luckily I had credit cards to buy food with...\n\nDidn't really feel like the punishment fit the crime. Great deterrent though, I will say."

He agreed to pay child support for both children, I guess he really cared about this other enough to support her even though it isn\u2019t his obligation. \n\nJudge signs the order, they go to set up the child support account and it gets kicked back saying you can\u2019t have two accounts for one child. Turns out she\u2019s been collecting child support from the biological father the entire time and never told him.

He couldn\u2019t remember the significance, but somehow it had come through the husband\u2019s family. \n\nEven after everything else had been decided, they spent many more months and nearly $100,000 fighting over just this ashtray. Then, after a court hearing the wife finally won the ashtray. She promptly strode out to the white courthouse steps...and smashed the ceramic ashtray. Left the pieces all over for the husband to see on his way out. \n\nDecided that day I would not be a divorce lawyer. \n\nTL;DR. Spent $100k to win an ashtray only to smash it in spite.",

I couldn't find the OP, but here's a quote from a website that covered it:\n\n> u/TrueEnt: \"Not me but a neighbor. The couple got divorced and she got the house in the settlement. Only the house and the immediate house lot, not the surrounding land, that went to the husband.\n\n>The first thing he did was sell all the lumber off the rest of the land.

Zero sentimental value but since it was the final item, neither side wanted to \"lose\" the last thing and they dragged it out over 3 separate meetings for this one thing.

Nothing they could do because it was 'only a picture'. He was staying with a secret girlfriend at this point. She allowed him to go get his stuff from the house.  She was scared to go back in the house alone.  I went with her.  First red flag was he had changed the locks.  So we waited for locksmith to open the house and change the locks again.  Well, when the door opens...we noticed all of the furniture was gone.  So we carefully went upstairs in search of her cats.  The entire second floor was empty.  No cats.  No furniture.  Even her clothes were gone.  Come to find out he hired a moving company to pack and take everything, even the food in the fridge.  Finally found the cats.  He had taken them to another vet in town and put them up for boarding under his sister's name thinking she would not be able to find them.

            "I don't practice divorce law, but I did an internship with a family law judge in law school that involved me sitting in on a lot of stuff. One divorced couple came in because the ex-husband wanted to lower his spousal support payments, due to his lowered income, great financial responsibilities, and the fact that his ex-wife was declining to seek paid employment, all of which sounds reasonable on the face.\n\nIt turned out that while his income had been lowered due to 'cuts', his new wife, who technically worked as his 'assistant' (and had done so prior to the divorce) was now making quadruple her salary, more than he ever had. \n\nHe claimed that his ex-wife had \"unpaid renters\" living with her and could have money to survive if she charged them rent\u2014 it turned out they were the couple's shared 18 year old twins who were living at home having just graduating high school and were going to keep living at home while starting college in the fall. (It also later turned out that he allowed his step daughter and her two children to live with him and his wife rent free *and* paid for her college. His ex-wife produced evidence that he told his own kids to figure out paying for college themselves.)\n\nHe claimed that his ex-wife worked as a nanny for free by choice and should be getting paid for work elsewhere. The kids she watched for free were their three joint grandchildren from their eldest child, two of which were severely disabled.\n\nHe claimed that when he married his new wife he gained over fifteen new dependants, which was technically true, but those dependants were all in Mexico and included his new wife's grown siblings and their families, none of whom he had ever met.\n\nThis dude was shocked when spousal support wasn't decreased.",

            "TL;DR My client's spouse accused him of giving his deceased wife cancer.\n\nI represented a guy who was on his second marriage. His first wife passed away from cancer, he and his kids were obviously devastated. My client was a pretty sensitive guy with a big heart. His second wife could be very charming--which was why he fell for her--but it was all a facade. Anyway, to make a long story about a lengthy divorce short, my client met a very kind and affectionate woman during his case. They really hit it off and were basically engaged (even though his divorce was far from over). The fiancee started having health problems and was diagnosed with a form of terminal cancer.   \n\n\nSomehow the Second wife found out about this and tried to use the cancer diagnosis against my client in court. She developed this crazy theory that my client had killed his first wife by giving her cancer and that he was doing the same thing to his \"fiancee.\" The second wife's attorney--who was quite good--refused to be a party to it. The attorney never addressed the argument in court and didn't even ask the second wife any questions about it during testimony. Rather, the attorney informed the judge that the second wife wished to address the court directly about an issue. The judge allowed her to do so (in a highly irregular move). The second wife told her crazy conspiracy theory to the judge, adding that she was certain my client had try to give her cancer at some point as well.  \n\n\nI wish I had an artist's rendering of the scene, capturing the Second wife's crazy eyes, her attorney's look of shame/embarrassment, the judge's look of confusion/ennui, and my look of awe-inspired disgust.",

            "Paralegal for divorce lawyer. This one is morbid. We represented a guy who believed vehemently that his wife was assaulting the children. The authorities were involved, Child Services was involved. It was never clear what the truth was or if anything at all was going on, but our client was sure. \n\nHe shot his wife dead at a custody exchange in front of the children. He then sat down and waited for the authorities. \n\nWe visited him in jail with his criminal defense attorney. As we were leaving, he told me, \"well, I guess the divorce is over now.\" And he laughed. This was the first time i had ever been speechless.\n\nEdit: This has gotten a lot of responses. I can't really reveal details or context here. But, I can safely say that defending this action as heroic or understandable is an incorrect takeaway. There are no heroes here. The trauma this man put the children through is incredibly selfish, regardless of his intentions. \n\nThere are so many other options that could have been explored. Many of which were being explored when this happened. He abruptly put an end to all of them, making the truth forever impossible to discern.\n\nEdit 2: Where are they now. \n\nThe children are in the custody of a family member. They are safe and well. Although will no doubt need extensive therapy as they get older. \n\nGuy is in jail. I'm unsure of his final sentence. However, I doubt he will ever leave.\n\nEdit 3: What did the kids say. \n\nForensic interviews are super confidential. And this case didn't have the chance to go to a hearing. However, after multiple interviews with both children and the parents, neither the Police, Child Services, Guardian Ad Litem, or Child Advocate recommended that the mother lose custody or visitation nor did they require it to be supervised. All of these matters were ongoing when the mother died.",

She also said that his Indian flatmates were inherently \u201cdirty\u201d. After the obviously false child molestation suggestion I warned her of the consequences of being caught lying about that (i.e. permanent loss of custody).  She fired me but kept calling back using fake names to try and obtain free advice which contradicted my advice, but everyone she called immediately spotted her. This was a long time ago and now I specialise in insurance litigation, which is far less ugly.",

I didn't bother doing anything else except deleting the original partition and making a new one and installing windows.\n\nAbout an hour after that his wife came running in asking if we had a computer with \"Smith\" as the last name. I told her I did and she showed me her ID and said that her husband brought it in to try and destroy all the proof of him cheating and stealing money from their business. When she asked if I had wiped everything yet I told her I just did a windows install and didn't actually really wipe anything.\n\nI called her husband and told him the situation.

            "Former divorce lawyer. Not so much \"insane\", but unfortunately common--accusing former spouse of molesting the children and domestic violence to retain full custody, and get a restraining order to force spouse ouy of the marital home. \n\nThis sets the \"new status quo\" for custody (which judges are reluctant to disrupt considerably down the road). Takes months if not years for accused spouse to \"prove\" his innocence and CPS will often find \"evidence\" where none exists if accusing party is a good enough manipulator/actor. \n\n Pretty horrendous long term outcome for all parties. Kids are brainwashed against estranged parent when young. Later they often grow to resent the accusing parent for poisoning their relationship with estranged parent. Kids often grow up with multitude of mental health issues. Probably one of the worst things a person can do to their children...all to \"win\" against their former spouse.",

The husband came up with an idea that if she let him keep everything, he would give her half of his paycheck for the rest of his life. She quickly agreed because his checks were huge and this also included any bonuses which were in the millions.\n\nAs soon as the paperwork was finalized, he quit his job and started to work part time at a sporting goods store (I can't remember which one).

My mom told me about her emergency stash and my dad told my brother about his emergency stash, bro and I discussed it while talking about what nutjobs our parents are.\n\nEdit:::  I\u2019ve gotten a lot of support for this response, thank you!  I\u2019m not going to say that their divorce was perfect, it wasn\u2019t. There were still some hurt feelings and resentment from all parties involved. However, my parents, for all their flaws, both accepted their own responsibilities for the falling apart.  I think it helps that they still loved each other deeply, they just weren\u2019t IN love anymore. They have been friends since my mom was 2 and my dad was 3, started dating when mom was 12 and dad was 13. They separated at the ages of 49 and 50. It makes sense that they grew apart. \n\n I\u2019ve had a few people ask why they divorced in the first place. My dad had had a girlfriend for at least 15 years, possibly longer. My mom knew, but they agreed to not divorce until my younger brother had graduated high school. My dad got remarried to his girlfriend, my mom has also since remarried. All 4 of them get along famously now, the separation and divorce happened about 10 years ago. I\u2019m very lucky to have 4 parents who care about me, and who absolutely adore my own little dudes.",

            "(EDITED FOR SPELLING, AS I WAS SHAKING WHILE TYPING THIS OUT EARLIER TODAY)\n\nMy dad was physically and verbally abusive to my mom and my siblings. He never sexually abused us, but he was serially unfaithful to my mom and had a nasty drug habit. He left rehab so many times, I don\u2019t know why she stuck with him that long. when I was in 7th grade, he tried to kill my mom, and she finally files for divorce. And none of his outrageous claims are believed. But...\n\nI was a knucklehead like my dad. Nobody could tell me right from wrong. I was just following the example I had, and it wasn\u2019t good. Mom told me to straighten up or go live with dad, and like a fool, I chose poorly. It was a year of pure hell. His philosophy was \u201cthe beatings will continue until morale improves\u201d, and he took it literally. He also remarried another drug addict right away (I suspect to make my mom jealous, but it backfired). During that year, he beat me, his wife, and even put my stepbrother\u2018s face through a glass coffee table when he tried to defend her from him. I decide I want to go back to live with mom and it outraged my dad. He went off the rails for a bit.\n\nSo he asks me one morning how I felt, and I told him to his face I wanted to live with Mom because he was an abusive a hole. Bad idea, as I got beat... bad. Mom calls me that night and asks why we weren\u2019t at the courthouse. Turns out he skipped the court date and said he couldn\u2019t take off work because he wanted to keep custody to make my mom miserable. This happened two or three more times. Finally I wisened up, and the next time he asked me I told him I changed my mind and wanted to stay with him, so he says \u201chop in the car\u201d. We get to the courthouse (my mom lived 2 hours away from his place because he moved right after he got engaged). So inside the courtroom the judge asks me which parent I want to live with and I say my mom. He asked why I was changing my mind from a year ago and I detailed all the abuse from the last year, including intentionally skipping court dates after asking me how I was going to answer. Judge glares at my dad, and dismissed me from the courtroom, and I have to sit in the hallway on the bench alone. Ten minutes later my dad stomps out, grabs me by the arm and drags me to the car saying the judge called me a liar and ruled in favor of my dad. But he lied and actually kidnapped me and beat my ass two hours back to his place.  Oddly it wasn\u2019t ruled a kidnapping because the judge didn\u2019t sign the ruling yet or else my mom never pressed charges on him, but he never went to jail. She came the next Friday night with a deputy to pick me up. His new wife (I refuse to call her my stepmom) caught me packing a few belongings and told him and he left work to try to beat me again and stop me before she could get into town, but I climbed out my bedroom window onto the roof and told him I would jump off and run away to the police station if he tried to stop me. Just as he was yelling at me, the deputy arrived and my mom was pulling up behind him, so crisis averted.\n\nI was a different teenager after that (not perfect, but more respectful). Ended up working at 15 to help pay bills while I finished high school. I hated my life as a teenager, but it made me into the man I am now. Joined the service a month after high school, and married two years later, promising I would break the chain of violence and abuse. We just celebrated 25 years in March and I\u2019ve never stricken my wife or cheated on her. By God\u2019s Grace it will be that way the rest of my life.",

            "Not a lawyer, just grew up with a shitty family situation. \n\nMy mom was an evil mastermind with this divorce let me tell you, so my parents had been separated but living in the same house for a while and it was around the time of year the family would normally go for a camping trip (canada day I believe) she convinced my dad that we would break the trip up and he would get a week, then when he returned she would get a week with us (the 3 kids). Secretly during my dad's week she got her friends to help clear the entire house out, and I literally mean clear it out. There was nothing left, not a single clothes hanger, no couches, tv's quite literally nothing. She chose this vacation setup really well too, camping meant we didn't need money or have access to cell service which she took advantage of aswell and emptied the bank accounts and hid all the money away. She didn't stop there though, she also maxed out lines of credit and all credit cards, normally this would take a while but she was smart as hell in this approach. Earlier when planning this divorce she had convinced my dad to quit his job (quite high paying I should add) to start a company. This company was still new and needed a ton of expenses paid so the banks didn't think twice about this ridiculous amount of money being transferred as it wasn't out of the norm anyways from their new set up with the company. Then, when it came time for my dads trip to end, she told him he needed to call her when he got back in cell range. Upon calling, she told him that she was on the way out in the same direction anyways so we could just meet halfway to spare us kids a bit of driving time on our way to the next trip.. which was odd considering after a week of camping we all wanted to shower and clean up but she was very adamant. We met up and swapped vehicles then my dad was on the way home alone, while we were off to hide away at a location different than where she had told my dad. When he got home he thought we had been robbed, it didn't sink in. He called the cops, and started phoning family because of how empty the house was he broke down and didnt know what to do. That's when my moms dad came over and told him the truth, he said she left him and took everything. She hid us and I believe tried to steal us but that part is a bit fuzzy for me. Eventually it somewhat caught up with my mom, the judge was shocked at what she did. She even went as far as trying to convince us kids that my dad was abusive and had us interrogated by a cop wanting us to lie about him. The whole situation was crazy, she ended up blowing all the money on fancy trips and shopping sprees with her friends, and when the judge ordered her to pay it back she fled the country.. now she lives in Australia and doesn't have to pay anything.",

The guy was at wits end.\n\nOur family friend was driving behind him on the way to court when he crashed his truck into an SUV. Didn't seem too bad, flipped the SUV on its side, but he was already in it helping the other driver out. It was right in front of the courthouse so no big deal, lots of cops around to help.\n\nThen our family friend realized something concerning. The SUV looked a LOT like the guy's wife's SUV.  Before he could say anything, he saw the cops suddenly swarm the guy and pin him to the ground. While everyone watched on thinking this guy was \"helping\", he actually was stabbing his wife repeatedly. With a screwdriver.

My dad didn\u2019t have his own place yet so when it was his turn to be with us he came back to our house (the one he purchased mind you) and my mom was supposed to leave. One weekend they were arguing over something and it got so bad that my mom wouldn\u2019t leave and told my dad she would call the police (something she apparently did a lot to get her way, which after growing up with her I can attest she did this a lot unnecessarily to control us). So she left, called the police, told them my father was dangerous and had a gun (my dad was in the army and we had plenty guns, locked in a safe of course). \n\nOf course the police were just doing their job, and took my mom at face value. It went so fast from my brother and I watching tv with my dad to the police knocking at our door, my dad opening the door and getting pepper sprayed without the cops saying anything, and then my dad locked the door and the cops couldn\u2019t bust it down, so they came around back and broke our sliding glass door in so they could arrest my dad in our front yard with all our neighbors watching. I didn\u2019t really understand what was happening at the time but it was traumatizing for sure. \n\nThen my mom tried to get full custody of us in their actual divorce, and thank god the judge ruled for split custody.

            "Not a lawyer but child of divorced parents. Mom got custody of me and my brother. She told my dad she would make us hate him. Went from a big house to a 3 bedroom apartment and grew up poor. Only saw my dad 3 times a year and talked to him one the phone once a week for an hour. Turns out that's what she asked for in court but she lied and said our dad didn't want to see or talk to us. He paid her child support and alimony every month AND she worked full time. We grew up with no wifi or cable, no sports or after school activities and I never went to a summer camp. Apparently we also didn't have insurance for like 2 years when I was 12. Turns out she was pocketing all the money and keeping it in her savings. Apparently around the divorce hearing when I didn't have insurance she had 12k in savings but the judge didn't see that as a red flag. We did hate our dad until we got older and realized he was trying to give us stuff the whole time and offering to send us to summer camp but she refused. Even after her hoarding all that money and us not growing up with our Dad he still paid for my college and books and bought me a car when mine broke down. I ended up stopping a relationship with my mom when I found out she called me a whore in order to defend my brother's behavior. She didn't bother to reach out even though she's the parent. Later I contacted her on and off trying to fix the relationship.. she never bought a book for uni and also refused to let me use her tax info to get a better loan for school when I had to my last year of University.

            "Used to work as a file clerk for a divorce attorney. Our client was trying to get full custody over her child because her husband was \u201cdangerously neglectful of their son\u201d. How was he being dangerously neglectful? \n\nBy serving spaghetti (instead of turkey) for thanksgiving. I wish I was making this up",
            "TL;DR Client's ex \"disappeared\" her dog to hurt her; ended up in jail\n\nI was contacted by a woman after her judgment was final. Her and her ex had a pretty short marriage of maybe 7-8 years. In the divorce, she was awarded 4 years of spousal support (alimony) at a modest $400/month or something like that. They also had a dog. Their divorce said Wife would have \"primary custody\" of the dog but Husband could request time pretty much whenever he wanted. Wife then promptly moved across the country to be with her family.\n\nIn the ensuing several years, Husband never once requested time with the dog. He paid his alimony, and the two went on peacefully hating each other like most divorced couples.\n\nFast forward to the final few months of his spousal support obligation. Husband gets into his feels and tells Wife he's not going to pay the final few months of spousal support. His basis is Wife is dating, and because she has a boyfriend, he shouldn't have to pay his court ordered spousal support. She tells him no, thats not how any of this works, and she tells him to pay. She later tells me that she really didn't give a fuck about a couple months of support and she was going to drop it.\n\nA few weeks later, Husband requests visitation with the dog. First time in years. Wife is surprised but hey, thats his right. So they make plans to meet at an airport where he can pick up the dog and take her home for a few weeks. (Husband is an airport employee, more on that later) \n\nThe day after the exchange, Husband (in his magnificent wisdom) *texts* my client and says that if she does not repay her the ~20k in spousal support he's paid over the last several years, she will never see the dog again. She flips out, tells him she needs the dog back at the end of his 3 weeks, and if he doesn't she will go to the court. He appears to back off and they make plans for him to return the dog.\n\nThe day before the scheduled exchange, Husband tells Wife that he can't make the exchange as he's in Mexico. Wife asks him when she can expect the dog back. No response. The day after the original exchange date, Husband texts wife and says he's back home in the states. And the dog is gone. It ran away from him *in Mexico* and was lost. He apparently hung around for a few hours looking and then caught his plan home. This is when she brings me in.\n\nNow, a quick word about normal remedies here. In family court, we basically resolve everything regarding property with money. But with a dog (which is property) that won't really solve anything. So we decide to pursue contempt of court, which is a pseudo-criminal action. So basically even though it is a family court judge, we treat it like a trial. There is an arraignment, criminal protections, the whole 9 yards. Now, any family law attorney who knows their shit will tell you contempt actions are basically just empty threats. Most family court judges aren't going to send people to jail over divorce crap. But my client insists because she's convinced this MENSA candidate is just hiding the dog somewhere.\n\nSo I proceed with the contempt action. His lawyer treats the whole thing as a huge insult to everyone's intelligence. They show up to the arraignment literally having prepared nothing. Lawyer and him are just sitting there with smug grins on their face expecting the matter to be dismissed. Lo and behold, I actually know how to string a few sentences together and the judge asks for his plea. His lawyer again scoffs with the pure rudeness of the concept his client did anything wrong and we set a trial date.\n\nDuring the prep phase, I subpoena what I can and try to nail down this guy's story. When combined with my client's background info, things pretty much looked like this:\n\n1. Husband picked up dog at Atlanta airport. He claims he then flew with the dog home to LA, and then later flew with the dog to Mexico.\n\n2. My client pointed out that you need a certificate to fly with a dog, and she had provided him with no certificate nor had he contacted the dog's vet for a flight certificate. \n\n3. So how did the dog get to Mexico? He then changed the story to state he drove the dog to Houston and then his mother *drove from Texas to Cancun with the dog* while he flew. For you readers at home, Cancun is roughly a 40 hour drive from Texas.\n\n4. Clearly all of this sounds bananas. So when we call him on it, he states thats how it happened. While in Cancun, they called a repairman to fix the A/C and the repairman left the door open. Dog runs away. Poof. This apparently happened the day before the scheduled exchange.\n\n5. So simple little me, I look at the timeline here. If he was going to be returning the dog to Wife the day after its lost, surely he would have had a plane ticket from Cancun to Atlanta for the next day right? But he called Wife from LA the day after the exchange to say the dog was gone? Well, show me the airline ticket change? Husband says no. Won't do it. Gotcha bitch. You never intended to return the dog, did you? Case rested.\n\nAfter disproving his entire itinerary, I also got the fucking *give me 20k or you'll never see the dog again* text admitted into evidence. Which, if his attorney wasn't such an arrogant prick, probably could have been kicked. Oh well, you old douche.\n\nAt the end of the trial, my guy actually gets convicted of contempt of court. Sentenced to 5 days in jail. After he left, both the court clerk and court reporter told me they had never seen such a clearly guilty person. I actually saw the fucking court staff shaking their head when he was answering my questions on cross. Thats amazing.\n\nFor my fellow lawyers, another fun trial tidbit: Several of opposing counsel objections were raised several times and repeatedly overruled. At one point, he requested *a continuance of the trial after we had rested our arguments.* His basis was \"that his client and he had no idea that the Court would allow the text message and other evidence, and they needed time to prepare defense for that evidence.\" Yes, you read that right. The Court said, **on the record** \"Well counsel, that might be an argument for your insurance carrier but it doesn't work here.\" It was fucking amazing.\n\nIn the end, Wife never did get her poor dog back. The prevailing theory is that he just gave the dog to a friend or something and couldn't ask for it back. But he did spend a whopping 3 hours in jail and had to pay my fees.

            "Long post, sorry for any mistakes, not my native language. There is a divorce in the story, but it is mainly about abuse.\n\nMy country, southern Europe. After graduating law school, I went to court one day and happened to watch a domestic violence/abuse criminal case trial.\n\nThe plaintiff is a quiet young women, perhaps in her mid thirties. The accused is absent, being represented by his lawyer, who immediately asks the court for an adjournment, saying that the accused is a medical doctor, working, performing surgery in a big town 2.5 hours away, but he wants to have an opportunity to testify, albeit in another date. The lawyer hands the court an official document by a state hospital, confirming the operation by the doctor. It's already 10:00-11:00. I consider the adjournment a certainty.\n\nThe three-judge court rejects the request. The presiding judge seems stricter than in previous cases. The court starts the trial *in absentia*.\n\nThe plaintiff testifies. She comes from a balkan capital, daughter of a university professor and she is herself very much educated (postgraduate). She talks in a soft, fragile voice, looking mostly down, or at the presiding judge.\n\nHe beat her. He locked her in their apartment. He left her with not enough food and no money to buy food for her and their some-months old baby. He had his parents, his brother and his sister-in-law, who lived in the same family-owned apartment building, bring her food and check her out. He locked everybody else out of her life, one by one, her friends, her parents. Obviously she was not allowed to work, she didn't even seem to have access to a bank account. She was ashamed and afraid for a very long time, increasingly reluctant or unable to call for help or inform her parents, although they suspect something is very wrong. On 1-2 occasions she half-asked her husband's SIL and his parents for help. They obviously told him, instead.\n\nOne day, a Friday afternoon, he comes home. She dares to ask for milk for the baby. He grabs her and throws her against the wall. He punches her repeatedly. She screams, the baby cries, the whole apartment building echoes the commotion but noone wants, or dares to help her. He is not an alcoholic or even randomly drunk. He locks her inside and leaves.\n\nThe next day, Saturday, he beats her again, even more violently: He grabs her, spreads her legs open and smashes her body on the bathtub rim, aiming for her vagina. She gets bruised all over her inner thighs and genitals. Again, she and the baby scream, but to no avail. He leaves.\n\nHer father-in-law visits the house. All he has to say is \"he's gone too far\". He brings his wife, the mother of the accused, to check her daughter-in-law injuries, hastily, before he comes back.\n\nI can't remember who was the one to eventually get her to the hospital or how she managed to escape, take the baby and ride a bus fleeing to the safety of her family and her original home (I feel awful just knowing what this woman's experience of my country was).\n\nHe finds out and, **to finally answer the OP's question**, what does he do? He immediately goes to the police and **files a complaint for parental child abduction**. She is stopped at the borders by the police, while holding their baby and a handful of belongings. **It's new year's eve. It's freezing, it's snowing. She doesn't have milk or diapers for the baby. She doesn't have extra warm clothes for either.** The border police are perplexed and sorry for her, they bring them in their offices, put them by a stove, bring diapers and food, while they inform the prosecutor. She is set free and continues (somehow) her travel.\n\nI listen to all this and I'm thinking, *\"this can't be true, it's all too textbook, the power-hungry violent husband, the totally unprovoked violence, the victim's alienation from their supporting environment, the shame, the secondary abuse by the attacker's friends and family... is all this hell for real?\"*\n\nThen the judge reads the medical findings on the victim's injuries. Oh, it's real. Apart from the heavily bruised face and head, it is clear he wanted to really hurt her vagina and managed to do so.\n\nAnd then, miraculously, the doctor shows up. He obviously wasn't operating on anyone, he wasn't even that far away. *And he looks like a cliche wife-beater!* Something out of a violent mafia movie, nothing like a respectable medical doctor. He looks annoyed to have to be there - his lawyer looks desperate. He denies everything. He is arrogant, over-confident, bullish to the plaintiff's lawyer, even to the presiding judge (but she shuts him down every time).\n\nHe is convicted, of course, and gets a jail sentence, suspended until his possible appeal is concluded. I'm afraid I can't be sure about his medical practice being suspended, though.\n\nI hope she is safe and happy, far away from him and this kind of people.\n\ntl;dr: Violently abusive husband severely beats wife and locks her and their baby in their home. When she escapes, he reports her of child abduction, having her arrested and forcing her to spend new year's eve in custody, in a cold border police outpost, while making a run for her original country.\n\nEDIT: Typos and clarifications.",

            "I used this technique at University where I couldn't stand the thought of having to answer questions in front of a group of people.  So if you find yourself in a group situation where someone (a leader, tutor, manager etc) is asking questions that must be answered and you want to avoid being picked so that you don't have to talk, then here is my tip.  If the person locks eyes on you as they ask the question, then just as they are about get to the end of their question you break eye contact and look towards another person in the room and hold it.  Their attention is diverted to that other person just as the question ends and the person they are now looking at feels compelled to answer.  If however the person starts asking the question while looking at someone else then look at that other person and hold it so you can't get suckered.  Use it sparingly because if you do it enough on the same person, they will be on to you.  ",

            "A few of my favorites\n\n- If you look happy to see someone eveytime you see them, they will eventually be happy to see you.\n\n- Be nice, even to mean people.

For example someone is obviously rude, just say you really like when they are nice to you, they can't really call you out on it and possibly make them realize their behavior.\n\n- Ask big knowing it will be dismissed, then ask for the thing you really want, there's a real term for it, open door technique or something.

People can get defensive when attacked, but no one can deny how you feel. \n\n- In a confrontation, stay calm, be gentle and focus on the problem, not the person (unless the person IS the problem in this case feel free to dispose of them). \n\n- If you have to make a critic to someone, try to sandwich it between two positive facts about them in this order [ Positive -> Negative -> Positive]. They tend to be received better this way. \n\n- Want to trick people into liking you? Ask them for a favor, even the smallest ones like \"Can you hold my pen for a second?\".

            "If I think someone is wrong or I want to directly confront them. I only ask questions. If someone is being an asshole and I say \"You're being an asshole\" I'm just arming their mental defenses against me. It's much more effective to act as curious as possible and be seen as someone trying to understand them.  \n\n\nSay someone cracks a mean joke \"But it's not like you're gonna be lifting anything with /those/ arms.\" for example. You're much better off with. \"Why did you say that specifically?\" Immediately instead of being guarded against a judgement they are going to assess their behavior, understand they were being an asshole and it keeps you off their mental targeting system. Even if they ask something like \"Why do you care?\" You can just say \"I'm just curious, I just don't know why you said that.\"  \n\n\nIf you want someone to think the answer to their social math is 48 and you start screaming \"It's 48!\" they will just raise the mental walls. If they think you're trying to get them to think 48 whether it's right or wrong. The fact they're being told to makes them resistant. It's infinitely more effective to be along the lines of \"I don't understand your math? How did you get this answer? What's this times that? That doesn't add up to me I thought it was this other number? What am I missing?\" Eventually in their \"Informing\" you they will often deconstruct their own thought processes and confront their own behavior.  \n\n\nIf I ever want to directly confront someone I do it this way. I've dealt with downright infuriated people who are /looking/ for a reason to turn things physical with me but can't justify hitting me for just being aloof and trying to understand them. Don't supply the ammunition that they shoot you with. Be kind, curious, without overt judgement and willing to disengage if they express they don't want to interact (This is them backing down from you. Don't aggress them further or you're gonna give them enough justification against you.)  \n\n\nIf you want to be untouchable but not passive, it's done through to control of others perception. They can't act against you if they can't see you as an enemy. Lot's of men put on airs of \"Don't fuck with me.\" but the air of \"You can't even imagine fucking with me.\" is a lot more powerful and yields much greater social results. Obviously this technique isn't gender exclusive. I just find more men to project that insecure air of \"Don't fuck with me.\"  \n\n\nIf you're condescending, you're giving them ammunition. If you're overly aggressive after they've opted out of continuing, you're giving them ammunition. If you're curious, respectful and genuine to those who you've targeted to approach about something you don't like that they do/are doing. You're unfuckwithable.  \n\n\nLiterally my favorite psych trick and enjoying the satisfaction of directly confronting someone belligerent with the right line of questioning and having them be the ones to disengage or even thank me for the conversation is so satisfying. They get fresh self generated insights, I get better at confrontation. Win win.  \n\n\nFinal note: Don't ask obviously leading or hostile questions: \"Why are you being an asshole?\" \"Why don't you think before you act?\" \"Why do you talk over other people?\" These condescends will get you on their mental targeting system. The whole concept is \"I don't understand this, can you explain it to me?\" Then watch them crumble under the weight of their own understanding.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

The thing is that my mental toils grow stronger with every other struggle I have to deal with. Summers used to make me extremely happy (well, content is maybe a better word) because I could only be focused on work and making money. College was horrible because it took almost six years and the only thing I envisioned my diploma to be was a giant question mark instead of a marker of success. I was tired, angry and overwhelmed for those six years. I thought about killing myself a couple times because of all the strain. But I thought that if I killed myself, I wouldn't have known if I'd have finished school. *But school was so difficult to complete*. Your whole life you hear that a degree brings happiness and success. It doesn't...but school is done with.\n\n\n\nDo I have a career to show for it? A nice new car and a house? No. I have debt but at the same time I'm carefree. So to answer your question, depression might not go away but *you* will mature and things will get easier. But it's never truly gone.",

            "I'm late so this will probably get buried. In 2008 I lost my job. All I could get right away was McDonald's so I took it, but it wasn't enough to pay all my bills. My car was repossessed, I got kicked out of my apartment, and I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me all within the space of a month or so. It was the lowest period of my life. I struggled with depression, considered suicide, it just wasn't a good time. I was homeless, but I had good friends who gave me a place to stay so I was never actually on the streets. It took awhile, but today I have a good job, I apprenticed in the tool and die trade and I make good money for a guy who barely graduated high school and never went to college. I'm married, and my home life is stable. It's not perfect, life never is, but I'm far better than I was. I hope everyone in this thread who is struggling is able to find a way to better days as well.\n\nObligatory edit: Wow this blew up! By far my most upvoted comment as well as gold and silver. I'm glad so many people found this inspiring.",
            "I saw some of these mentioned in other comments, but I'm just going to make a list. A previous employer chose to see my mental health and my work performance as \"two separate issues,\" which led to the worst panic attack I've ever experienced and a case of burnout that I'm still wrestling with \\~3 years later...so a lot of these things come from what I had to fight through over those years:\n\n* Counseling/Therapy. Professionally is probably best, but you also have to \"shop around\" for a therapist you work well with, sometimes. Barring that, I'd try talking to a family member or very close friend, someone you know you can talk to anything about, even if it's just to vent. I live alone, but I have a dog (service dog in training); I've resorted to talking to her a few times, and even that has helped.\n* Don't let yourself sit at home all day. I know full well I can only speak for myself, but I was always amazed at how the simple act of walking through the door suddenly lifted a huge weight off my chest, put a little spring in my step, and made it that much easier to just...be more like my old self. Hang out with friends, keep devoting whatever time you can to your hobbies/interests, just go for a walk to clear your head. Even just a few minutes at a time is better than not at all.\n* Take time to reflect. This has always been an invaluable tool for me (again, I hope it's just as useful for you), and as I've recovered from various bouts of anxiety, depression, and whatever else I've dealt with over the years the insight I seem to gain as I improve has helped me learn more from these experiences than I would have if I had just said \"Oh good, I'm on the road to recovery\" and pushed the bad stuff out of my head on the spot.\n* Try to find things in your life you have full control over. Are they good things? Awesome! Keep them that way, or make them even more awesome if you can. Are they not so good things? Do what you can to mitigate the bad and make them better, or just get rid of them if there isn't another option.\n\nI can't think of anything else at the moment, and I truly wish I could. I was also in a...horribly toxic relationship for most of the last 3 years, and I feel like everything else I'm coming up with is too specific to just that circumstance and all the insanity that goes with it. Or specific to other things I'm trying to deal with that I brought upon myself when things were at their worst for me. But know that you're not alone in dealing with this stuff (as cliche as that line is). Please feel free to drop me a DM if you want/need someone to talk to, or even just to listen.\n\nEdit: Welp, this blew up when I wasn't looking! Thank you everyone who left comments. I figured it would be easier if I just made an edit to touch on a few key things:\n\n1. What I shared are things that have helped me over the years. I do not expect them all to work just as well for others as they do for me, I'm painfully aware of how drastically the effectiveness of any one thing can vary from person to person. Even if my suggestions don't work for someone else, maybe they can at least lead others to a similar trick or habit that *does* work for them.\n2. In most cases, a therapist is supposed to be a professional you go to for help, yes. I was not trying to insinuate otherwise when I also suggested family or close friends; I have been incredibly lucky to have a lot of friends that made the effort to reach out to me periodically, make sure I was still surviving however I had to, and remind me that I can always talk to them about whatever, whether it's to vent or seek additional opinions. I've been even luckier that the therapist I've been working with for several years now actually is something like a friend, as well. After all the therapists I've worked with in my life that didn't help at all (or made things worse), I count my lucky stars, and I hope that others can find someone like that as well.\n3. The previous employer thing...this is a bit of a long story. In my mind, it's only the first chapter of the story, because from that point up until now I've just been endlessly trying to get back on my feet, and I've only started actually holding onto the progress I make within the last couple of months or so. But basically, I started having a harder and harder time keeping up with work and an increasing number of things going on outside of work. I thought I'd be able to get back on track again right around the first time my boss expressed concern for my performance at work, and within a week my father called me while I was at work to basically say \"Hey, I might have cancer, I'll keep you posted, love you, bye!\" and leave me with nothing else to go on for the better part of a month. Next chance I got, I told my boss about what had happened, only to have him respond with, \"Yeah, I'm still concerned about your performance...\" So I went to HR and told them about the mental health issues that had come back after over a decade. I told my boss the same thing, so everyone knew what was going on and everything I was doing to get back on track again.\n\nTwo weeks later, I had an annual performance review (I knew it wasn't going to be good, but I figured they'd at least cut me some slack given everything else). I was hit with a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), which gave me 30 days to get myself up to where they wanted me to be. They could fire me at any point in that 30-day window if they thought I wasn't gonna reach that level of performance, and even if I did there was another provision that said if my performance started waning again they could still fire me on the spot without another warning because of the PIP on my record. That was when I asked about the mental health conversation and they made the \"two separate issues\" argument. Their head of HR even claimed that that was true under the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), which my doctors all scratched their heads at because by their understanding the opposite was true.\n\nI went back to my desk, and for a half hour I just sat there, staring at my monitors. I don't even remember any other symptoms of a panic attack (racing heart, pounding heartbeat, etc.) because I was too distracted by how I could only see colors. I couldn't even make out shapes, just blobs of color that were all blending together. It still scares me to this day when I think about it and what it was like.\n\nI think that a case of burnout started then, if it hadn't in the weeks leading up to that...made the anxiety and depression that much harder to cope with, because writing code - what I had loved to do for work and for fun - now made me physically lock up every time I tried to do it.\n\n...And now I know I need to be done with this edit; my doggo just hopped up into my lap and got comfy in a way that made it a bit harder to type. Yes, she will get a treat for doing this. :3\n\nEdit 2: Aaaaand my first ever Reddit gold!

            "Everything in life is temporary. Good times, bad times. All temporary. But if you were happy you would never think to yourself, wow this happiness is gonna last forever and will never change! \n\nWhen depressed we have a tendency to think nothing will ever change. But this is the source of the depression. \n\nYou need to abandon the narratives you've created for yourself. You aren't some weirdo who is screwed up. Most people in your situation would likely become depressed. Hence why its endemic and suicide is the biggest killer of young men. \n\nYou are just a normal person. You're not the problem. It's our sick shitty world. You're just reacting appropriately to it. \n\nIt will changed for me when I started to view my depression and anxiety as non-narratively. They weren't a sign of weakness or failure. It was an underlying functional problem with my biology and thinking. It wasn't anything to be ashamed about. Indeed, it's not an emotion inducing event. Depression like all disease is morally neutral. \n\nRisk factors of depression aren't things like \"bad personality\" or \"boring\" or \"dumb\". Risk factors for depression are things like lack of  physical activty, poor diet, genetics. None are statements about you as a person. \n\nIt took years, but slowly I changed how I thought. I did some great cognitive behavioural therapy. I started to become aware of the thoughts that went through my head, and aware of how those thoughts would trigger negative emotion. By simply observing and discarding those thoughts I can stop tormenting myself. \n\nThe biggest thing you can do, is be kind to yourself. Give yourself a break. You're going through a really tough time. My rule when self talking is never say anything to myself I wouldn't say to a friend. I am a friend to myself. I take care of myself. I don't tell myself im pathetic for this or that anymore. \n\nAnother thing I really remember my therapist saying - Act don't feel. If you wait until you feel like going out to a coffee shop, you will never go. The act of going is what will make you feel better. Lack of activity is strongly linked to depression. It's why anxiety often leads to deprssion, your brain wants to act, but you are too afraid. So you do nothing. And that act of thinking about doing something and then not doing it, sends bad signals. Humans want to be free and have agency. \n\nIt's a long road, but you need to learn to love yourself. You're worth it. We all are. We're not weak because of this shit. \n\nAnd one day this rough patch in life will become your armor. Everytime life gets rough I remind myself its a cakewalk compared to the shit I've been through. Literally nothing can hurt me anymore really.",
            "Go to therapy/counseling. The other suggestions are great but I don't think these people understand what it's like to go through depression. You don't merely \"snap out of it\" by doing the things they suggested. Find a good therapist and if you cannot afford one, look for support groups of others who are also experiencing depression and talk about your struggles with them. Mental Health Counseling, along with the things the others have mentioned, will go a long way.",
            "I agree with a lot of the previously stated advice. If your loneliness and depression are connected, I agree that therapy or counseling would be a good move.\n\nIn addition to that, you can also re-frame your alone time. Not all activities have to be done socially. I don't have a lot of friends and never have. One of the things that I really enjoy is going camping or backpacking. It feels really good to be out in nature in a place where being alone isn't a bad thing. \n\nI garden. It felt really good to pick and eat a blackberry from a plant that I'd taken care of since it was a tiny little seedling.\n\nI also just respond to a lot of things on Reddit. Unless your name is your screen name, no one knows who you and never will. There's a Subreddit for pretty much everything, so much so that I sometime make a joke of it and type in [reddit.com/r/](https://reddit.com/r/)(insert random 2-3 word phrase) and more than likely it'll pop up as an existing Reddit. You can connect with people who don't know who you are, don't care, and still accept you. Think of some books or TV shows that you like, find a Subreddit for them, and comment away. I heard once that \"people are only normal until you get to know them,\" and Reddit's a great place to find fellow weirdos.\n\nIt's also nice to spoil yourself once in a while. I do this from time to time with cooking when my wife is out of town because I'm a little more adventurous an eater and cook than she is. Made coq au vin from scratch (I mean, I bought the chicken from the store, I didn't raise it from an egg and slaughter it myself). Took me like three hours to prep and cook from beginning to end but it tasted badass and I'm worth spending three hours on. \n\nI have three dogs and will stop and say hit to every other dog I meet. Always been more of a dog person than a people person anyway. But it's really comforting how a dog that doesn't know a thing about me will still wag his tail if I come up to say hi. Dogs are simple and awesome that way.\n\nI'm posting comment #96 on this thread, so keep in mind that you're not really alone.",

It's like a switch turned off and never got turned back on.\n\nSo I'm better, but I don't think I'll ever be the fun, funny warm and welcoming guy I used to be. I appear to be, but it's mostly a facade.",
            "No, not really. I mean it can, but your potentially best years are before 30. Best, in this case, meaning most vivid. Certainly you could get more comfortable with life, if you take that to mean best. Anyway, find bliss in loneliness. There is a reason that taoist monks would seclude themselves and live as hermits. It wasn't because they thought it was virtuous. Don't focus on being less alone, focus on making the most of what you have. That doesn't mean coming to terms with a shitty life, it means owning your life and realizing that you're doing exactly what you're here to do: experiencing. You aren't here to be happy, you aren't here to have a family and kids, you aren't here to save the earth. You're here to experience. The true point of life can be extracted only from the immediate moment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany think that at some point, life will just click. They've got a family, a spouse, a stable career, hobbies, etc. From that point forward, they will be happy, right? They will be satisfied, yeah? Wrong. Life isn't a journey. There's no destination. You exist to experience. Learn how to enjoy your life now, not for the future. Tomorrow never comes. Realize what a blessing it is to be able to experience anything at all. I used to be quite stoic- it was numbingly easy. I realized that I don't want to just skate through life, I want to experience the ups and downs. I want to be shredded, and rebuilt. I want to surrender to the experience. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou just have to figure out what 'meaningful' means to you. Meaning is semiotic, you extract it yourself. You could have a relationship that everybody else views as dysfunctional and/or pointless, but if you create meaning out of it, it is meaningful. In other words, any direct recipe you gather for creating meaningful relationships, will be futile. It's something that only you know how to do, for yourself. Search deep within, you will find what that means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for practical advice, find a therapist that uses psychedelic drugs in their treatment plan. Seriously, that will change your life.",
            "\u201cYou can\u2019t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.\u201d - C.S Lewis",
            "I've always been blessed with good mental health, so please understand while I can deeply empathize with people who have serious depression (my brother has struggled with it his entire life, and I have several other friends who grapple with it as well), my own experience has been limited. That said, my life has had it's share of ups and downs too, I've hit my share of \"bumps in the road\" as well, I've just been very deliberate about how I handle them. Here are some of the ways to address things when the future seems bleak.\n\n**0) Identify the source (or sources) of your emotional distress.** Is it a bad relationship? A shitty job? Is reading the news upsetting me? Is it an overall sense of hopelessness?  Naming at least some sources of depression is important. Sometimes that's not easy (self reflection is HARD), sometimes it's not just one thing, and sometimes your brain chemistry is just kicking you in the dick and it's not any specific things, but at least take the time to do an inventory first.\n\n**1) Frame your issues from above in context. An often given example is: will the things that are upsetting me matter in 10 days? In 10 months? In 10 years?** Sometimes the answer will be yes to all three, but this can help get perspective on things that are realistically trivial, but feel like a huge issue at the moment. For things that won't matter in 10 days, sometimes honestly you just have to muscle through. It's not going to last forever, just get through it. For things in the 10 weeks bracket, break it down and identify what you can do about it. Can you change the outcome? If so, work on it. If not, accept it's outside your control and either move on, or find a way to move away from it (ie, a bad job. It's still going to suck in 10 weeks? Either start applying for a new job, or come to terms with the fact that you don't like it.) Acceptance of the negatives in your life is powerful. Things will never be perfect - to expect everything to work out all the time isn't realistic. For the 10 year issues, you're gonna have to make lifestyle changes if you want to see any difference here. They're hard to do, but slow and incremental progress pays dividends surprisingly quickly. To quote Bojack Horseman:  \u201cIt gets easier\u2026 Every day it gets a little easier\u2026 But you gotta do it every day \u2014 that\u2019s the hard part. But it does get easier.\u201d\n\n**2) Remind yourself actively of the good in your life.** No matter how bad things are, there's always SOME good in your life. Sometimes you gotta dig a but, but it's there. Are you in good health? Do you have a stable roof over your head and food in your belly? Do you have a good relationship with a friend, family member or co-worker? Do you stable income? Do you have a pet that you love? Do you have functional and working electronics, even?? Make a list of things you're grateful for. Try to add something to it at least once a day, if you're having trouble seeing the positive things in life. Even something as simple as \"I had a warm interaction with the guy in the checkout line today\" can get me through a tough day. We've all seen those quotes about how \"you never know how a simple smile or a kind word might change someone else's day\" - let yourself be that person sometimes.\n\n**3) Do kind things for others.**  I really and truly believe that putting positive energy into the world brings back dividends. If you're being kind just cause you want something back I feel like that's missing the point, but honestly even selfish acts of kindness work sometimes. Genuinely trying to help someone else almost always makes me feel better - you've made the world a tiny bit brighter for someone; isn't that worth it all by itself?  Even when my own life was in the dumps, being able to make a difference for SOMEONE always made me feel better. And then, if you've been listening carefully to number 2, you might start noticing lots of tiny ways the universe pays you back. Sometimes it's the extra nugget in your take-out, sometimes it's a friend or your parents calling to check on you when you really need someone to talk to, sometimes it's as simple as the guy in front of you holding the door for you and smiling. But it's there.\n\n\nI've rambled on long enough, and I'm probably too late for anyone to read any of this. But if one person finds it and it helps, it was worth it to me. Testament to #3, I suppose.",
            "It's really difficult to give you any kind of valuable piece of advice or opinion, given how little information you gave us.\n\nIf you are extremely depressed - then, despite what other redditors wrote, i don't think \"exercise, proper diet and stop thinking negatively\" is going to help you very much (even though exercise, diet and thinking patterns are proven to impact our mood). I would assume it might be frustrating listening to such superficial advices, if you'r seriously depressed.\n\nProper medication and therapy is what you need. Chances are it will get better, but it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nAlso, being depressed doesn't mean you'r uncapable of being in a relationship.",

It sounds silly, but it's so easy to make friends while online gaming. It's something you can start with, and from there go to meeting people in real life."

They do sessions on friendship/romantic relationships, boundaries and consent, and other modules which try to teach social and emotional healthy behaviours.  \n\nIt's not quite the same as what you're saying, but it does have elements of this.  I think the key is you start young and then continue to build on it in different ways.  \n\nThe point I would make though is that this is not for teachers to teach, it's for social workers or therapists.",

            "I know this will be an unpopular opinion but no. \n\nFirst things first school has a lot of problems that need to fixed including more and better teachers who are paid a lot more than they currently are, as well as teaching some more relevant classes, more of a variety of classes, and having better after school activities. Not to mention the possible addition of a technical job training such as electricians or mechanics as well as a route that is more focused on studying and preparing for college. But that is another discussion. I would rather a class that teaches life skills a little more rapid fire but hitting several important ones like how credit cards work, how to manage money, how to find a job, and so on. So for starters with everything else that needs to be added this is farther down the list at the very least. \n\nAlso a therapy class for high school students would likely be unnecessary for a lot of students, a means to bully other for some, and not taken seriously by those that actually need it. Back when I was in high school a class like that would officially be designated daydream time in my mind. Not to mention that many kids have learned to deal with stuff like that on their own and the fact that different people process emotions and such through different means so there would be no blanket method to teach the class making it difficult to really have an impact on everyone involved. \n\nA better solution again involves better school funding to pay for more and better councilors who work with the students individually in a variety of ways. Training for teachers on how to identify at risk kids and get them to a councilor would also go some distance. Yes I am aware that some of this is already done in some districts but that is where better pay for those involved would bring more skilled people and allow the handling of these situations to be better. Lastly, I really feel an increased number of after school programs would be more beneficial than a therapy class. Looking back my years in Drama club did a lot to help my confidence, my people skills, and helped me learn how to make and maintain friendships in a healthy way. There was a strong sense of unity and acceptance amoungst the members and constructive yet encouraging feedback helped me to stop being so shy and what not. I don't think Drama club is the answer for everyone or even after school programs in general but having more of these and doing them well will allow for more and more groups of people to find something interesting and develop a lot of themselves with good leaders and teachers helping to guide that.",

            "Probably too late to the party, but I had a lady come in to the ER listed as \u201cMultiple Medical Problems\u201d. This usually means diabetes and the issues stemming from it or maybe bleeding issues from another disease or maybe odd blood tests results at a clinic. I hadn\u2019t seen the patient yet, but the Dr. came to the nurse\u2019s station asking who had room 15. I jumped up and followed him into the room.  \n  \nI walked in and saw what I thought was a corpse. Then the patient\u2019s eye swiveled over to look at me. She truly looked like one of the people they found in a concentration camp. I could see every bone and her body was twisted in a decorticate position with her jaw locked open. Then the smell hit me: rotting flesh, death, and body fluids.  I struggled to keep a neutral face and not gag.  \n  \nI tried to place a blood pressure cuff on her arm and her skin just started flaking off in my hands. I gagged. The dr. started removing her clothes to examine her. Her feet were black to the ankles. Her hip bones were poking through her skin and were black. The skin around her ribs was worn away to oozing muscle fibers. Her calves were incredibly swollen and the skin was splitting like ripped pants. I removed her Depends, and there was feces coating her entire genital area. Then the dr. went to remove a large bandage on her lower back. Her entire sacrum was exposed and the bones were BLACK! The skin around it was a black liquified mass.  It smelled like nothing I\u2019ve ever smelled. I can\u2019t even describe it. The dr. Told her family I would clean up her ulcers and wounds in preparation for surgery (liar, no surgeon would operate on her).  \n  \nI had no idea how to clean dead bone tissue and liquified skin (they don\u2019t cover that in nursing school). When I went to clean her sacral area, all the liquified skin separated and oozed all over the bed. I really struggled to keep my shit together.  \n  \nAfterwards, I needed a moment in the supply closet to cry it out for a second. I had no idea the human body could breakdown so much without dying. I still think about that woman sometimes and what led to her living like that. It still breaks my heart.",
            "In dental school, I had an emergency patient come in, complaining of sore gums. Upon examination, I found a massive calculus bridge (google it for pictures) behind her lower front teeth. She only had about 3 remaining lower teeth, but they were all connected with a whitish brown mineral deposit that was about the size of a golf ball. She had never had her teeth cleaned and she was probably 55 or so. \n\nI basically performed an emergency cleaning. She could speak so much better afterwords. Of course I had to play it off like it was normal, but in my years of practice I still haven\u2019t seen a case that bad again. Get your teeth cleaned people. Even if you can\u2019t afford every 6 months, once a year, or every other year is a hell of a lot better than never. ",

            "I showed up to a house for a possible overdose. Three firefighters and a police officer were on top of a man who was prone and naked from the waist down. They immediately told my partner and I to restrain the patient to the gurney because the patient was combative. It turns out he took something thinking it was weed but turned out to be laced with something else (possibly PCP?). During his trip he attempted to cut his penis off, but wasn\u2019t successful. As fate would have it, I knew the patient personally and tried to comfort him on the way to the hospital. During the ride he became somewhat cognizant and was ashamed of himself. I tried to comfort him as I held his penis in place. I would be lying if I said I had seen a severed penis before.",
            "I'm a nurse and I work in a pediatric ER.  A young woman brought her baby in to be seen for vomiting.  I ask her to put the baby on the scale.  While on the scale I notice a strong odor of bug spray so I asked about it.\n\nMom:  \"A roach crawled into her mouth so I sprayed a little Raid in there.\"  She said it matter of factually like it was no big deal.  \n\nQue up calls to the police, CPS and a 1:1 sitter for the child and the mom.  \n\nWhen all was said and done the baby was fine and turned over to her grandmother so no worries there.  I have no idea what happened to the mother.  \n\nI don't believe she was intending to hurt the child.  I think she was just butt-ass ignorant.  ",

            "A little late to the party\u2014\n\nNot the worst, but I had a patient once with a stomach bleed and a small bowel obstruction. We had to put in an NG tube (tube that goes in your nose and down to your stomach) to drain/decompress his stomach, which was pretty distended and hard. \nI\u2019m inserting the tube and has soon as it hits this guy\u2019s gag reflex he projectile vomits and SPRAYS very dark, half digested blood all over himself, the bed, the wall, and the floor. It\u2019s basically a scene from the exorcist. I had to dive out of the way and somehow was unscathed. He couldn\u2019t stop for almost ten minutes as we\u2019re trying to get this thing down to where it needs to go. Finally finish placement and it immediately suctions out ~3 liters of this black sludge that is old, digested blood. Pt was mortified and we had to play it off like \u201coh no no it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s really common to vomit during the procedure. We\u2019ll just go get some towels and clean you up!\u201d\nMy coworker and I left the room and just stared at each other in silent shock.",
            "Not medical professionals, but we were the patients. My daughter, who was 3 at the time, had to have a cavity filled. As we were leaving, the dentist told me just to watch my daughter because sometimes kids chew their gums because it's numb and feels weird. So the drive home took 30 minutes and I had been talking to my daughter the entire time to keep her busy. I park my car in my drive way, opened the passenger seat to get my daughter out, and her entire lower lip on the left side is gone. She had chewed it off down to her chin. She ended up in emergency surgery, but the surgeon kept telling us it would be fine and he sees this stuff all the time. She ended up having multiple surgeries, and when she was finally healed, the surgeon told us that it was the worst injury like that he had ever seen. He wasn't sure how she would heal, but you can hardly tell it happened now.",
            "Not a medical professional, but a story about my father. \n\nAfter years of a blood disease, his spleen had to be removed as it had swollen to a size that made breathing difficult. Apparently the surgeon had a photo taken, post extraction, where he is cradling my dad's ~22.0 lb spleen. \n\nTo top it off, one day into recovery, when doing on of those \"gentle push on the abdomen\" type exams on him, my dad's sutures catastrophically failed and he let loose a spray that coated the doctor, his nurse, and a good portion of the ceiling. Luckily for dad, the hospital staff was on point that day and kept him alive despite his body's best effort.\n\nI heard all of this from the doctor while he was removing the line of staples (that went from crotch to sternum) some weeks later.\n\nDad didn't like to share, apparently.

            "Had a patient who needed a lower gi study to find/fix a bowel bleed. To get a study done you need to poop clear mucus. Three days we bowel prepped with heavy laxatives and enemas. He barely pooped anything. He puts on the call light at 6:45, 15 minutes before my shift ends. He calmly says, \"I kinda want to try and poop.\" He said it so casually I figured he was going to toot out another gas bubble and walk back. \n\nHe stood from the bed, took one step, and the floodgates burst. 3+ days of the most rancid liquid stool I had ever encountered. It just wouldn't stop. He left a river of stool from the bed to the bathroom, coated the walls as he bend to park his butt on the toilet, and continued to dump out 7 people worth of poop. \n\nIn my 9 years I have never seen that much come out of a person. He was not a large man. \n\nHe was so embarrassed but I just kept my face as solid as possible, grabbed half the linen closet and 3 packages of cavi wipes, and sopped it up. Told him this happens all the time.\n\nEdit: Thanks for my first gold! \n\nEdit to my edit: Thanks for my first platinum and all the kind words. I love what I do! ",
            "Lots of stories, many already covered by others.  I will share this particular story with my legs crossed.\n\nMotorcyclist came in after some one left turned without checking.  He had gone over the hood, slid and somehow somersaulted landing on his ass sitting up.  He slid across intersection mostly on his ass, getting serious road rash.  Luckily he was only a block from hospital and ambulance.  They pack him and bring him to the ER.\n\nWe end up cutting off his chaps and jeans and begin the cleanup of gravel and sand embedded in his thighs and ass when all of a sudden, his testicles fall out of his scrotum.  He had basically sandpapered a hole in his scrotum while skidding on his ass.  \n\nThe attending pauses, grabs the saline, irrigates scrotum and nuts, fondles them back into place while humming.  I handed him some gauze to pack the wound and smiled at the patient who was under a local.\n\nThen I went on break, went fetal and dry heaved.  \n\nEdit: thank you for my first gold!\n",
            "Worked in a heart procedure lab that helped try to get rid of bad heart rhythms.  A prisoner came in for a last ditch effort to help his failing heart and had developed a condition called Ventricular Tachycardia.  Setting the patient up and looking at his rhythm / heart, it looked pretty bad. \n\n Before we got started he grabbed me on the arm and said \"I'm scared. Is it going to be okay?\"  \n\n\"We have very talented physicians here sir, and they do this all the time.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ventricular Tachycardia was set off during the procedure and deteriorated into Ventricular Fibrillation.

            "As a new nurse, I worked on a nephrology unit, which meant that we dealt with mostly patients who had kidney failure and needed hemodialysis three times a week to clean their blood. A patient was admitted through the emergency room and told me that he hadn't been to dialysis in 4 weeks. He had HIV, kidney failure, had lost custody of his kids after a messy divorce, and had no will to live. He planned to just stay in his home until he died. He probably wasn't far from it, but a neighbor, who hadn't seen him for a few weeks, peeked in the window and saw him sitting, unresponsive on the couch. They called 911 and he was brought to my hospital. \n\nThree weeks is an insanely long time to go without dialysis. Dialysis removes toxins and excess fluid from your blood. Missing a session can leave you feeling sick and swollen. Missing 12 sessions can kill you. This guy was SO swollen. I've never seen a person who was so full of fluid. He looked like that girl from Willy Wonka that turned into a blueberry. His feet and ankles were particularly massive. I wasn't sure that he'd live. Miraculously, after several dialysis sessions, he'd fully deflated. However, he was left with lots of loose skin afterwards, which had the fragile texture of an old balloon. \n\nOne night, he called me to his room and said, \"I think my foot is bleeding\". He was right. He'd slid down towards the bottom of his bed and used his legs to push himself back up towards the top. In doing so, the fragile skin on the bottoms of his feet and been totally sheared away, leaving only tissue and bone and so much blood.\n\nI had no idea what to do, so I just called a Code Blue. The patient wasn't dead or dying, but no part of nursing school or practice had prepared me for an HIV+ patient who had ripped the soles of his feet off and was currently laying in a 3ft wide, rapidlu expanding, puddle of blood. I just needed to get a whole bunch of people to the room as quickly as possible.\n\nI threw on a waterproof gown and some gloves and held pressure on the bottoms of his feet with a towel until help arrived. They didn't know what to do either. We called in the general surgeon, who seemed to think we might be exaggerating the extent of the damage and blood loss. He told us he'd be there in an hour and just to hold pressure until it stopped bleeding. We soaked towel after towel until, finally, the surgeon shows up.\n\nHe breezes into the room, moves my towel away, and says, \"hmph\". Then he reaches towards the patients foot, and pulls off a a HUGE, softball sized, blood clot. In that moment, time stopped. He held out his hand, holding the huge clot, and I, without really thinking about what I was doing, held my hand out too. He plopped the clot right into my outstretched hand.\n\nIn the next moments, several things happened all at once. I realized I was holding a big, coagulated mass of blood. I started dry heaving. I dropped it on the floor. It splattered. The surgeon exclaims, \"OH JESUS FUCK\", not in response to my gags or the fact that he was just splattered by the clot I dropped, but because the patient's foot is now profusely bleeding again. He darts off and tells us to get the patient down to the OR immediately. We get him down there and, on the way back, realize that he'd left a trail of blood down the hallways, into the elevator, and to the operating theater.\n\nI saw the patient during my next shift and he jokes, \"I thought you were going to pass out when the doctor handed you that mess!\" to which I replied, \"Sir, I was positive that you were about to bleed to death\".

            "Years ago (2000) I was playing soccer and noticed a little skin irritation underneath my arm.  I thought it would go away but it developed into a weird thing.  It was about 2 in in diameter and grew to be a collection of essentially looked like hundreds of skin tags grew together in a little circle.  I went to the doctor who didnt have a clue and he sent me to a specialist.  While there it seemed like he didnt know either.  This was further evidenced when 4 other doctors came in to take a look and were really interested.  They took a ton of photos and told me they hadnt seen this before and couldnt really offer any medication and said they would monitor it.  About a week later the 'skin tags' developed little circles on the top that turned into scabs within a couple days.  Then, the thing just kinda dried up and fell off me.  It was fucking weird and to this day I have no idea what it was.  \n\nI was not comforted",
            "I had to have my leg rebuilt after a car accident and was eventually sent to Duke university for my surgery. My surgeon was supposed to be like the best orthopedic surgeon in the country, I think he used to work for the Baltimore ravens. Anyway all the doctors from my hospital at home were very unsure if I would even have a functioning leg let alone walk normal again. The first appointment at Duke that dude told me it was really not a big deal and he would have me fixed almost good as new. I honestly thought he was just trying to be nice and optimistic but he was very serious. 5 months later I was walking and learning how to run again. He said I was one of the most complicated surgeries he has had to do and a group of surgeons flew in to observe him do it. ",
            "A huge subset of the population we treat are uninsured, blue collar, low educated people. A lot of smoking and diabetic noncompliance, that sort of thing. Therefore we end up seeing a lot of what happens with diseases if you never treat them and let them run their natural course to end stage. We've had so many diabetic foot and toe amputations I've lost count. \n\nHowever one lady that sticks out had a huge area of loculated, necrotic tissue on her low back. Usually you'll have a foul smell and purplish-black overlying tissue to tip you off. This ladys back had several areas that got so gangrenous and necrotic that there were basically just large pockets down to her subcutaneous fat and muscle. The appearance resembled a sponge with large holes that was filled to capacity with pus. The smell was indescribably atrocious. What made it worse was every time we cleaned out a pocket, we would probe with a finger and it would lead to another fucking pocket of pus and the smell would double up again. \n\nUnfortunately she lost nearly all the skin on her low back down to muscle/bone in some places. We slapped a huge wound vac on it and she ended up being shipped out to a specialist center. Took forever for the smell to leave my nostrils.",

A guy came in with the whole of the back of his leg and butt utterly and very deeply infested with maggots.

            "Young man (18) apparently comes in about something else (trying to work up courage). Right before he should actually be leaving (this can be really annoying if there are people waiting), he says 'I need your advice. \\`i'm having sex with my mother.' What do I say? 'Oh my god'? No, I didn't... I said, 'This isn't the first time someone has told me this.'  This wasn't true. Turns out that he knew it was wrong, that mother had initiated it, he was trying to extricate himself, and he was desperate for help. But the thought that someone else had been in his position meant to him that he hadn't been judged, that he wasn't doomed or would go to hell, and that there was hope. But he didn't know what to do because the person to whom he should've looked for advice was actually his abuser. But the lie helped defuse the situation.",
            "As a medical student doing my first placement in the emergency department, I was waiting outside the triage room to ask the nurse something. I was the lowest ranking, most clueless person in the department. I knew a lot about the Kreb cycle, not a whole lot about, you know, medicine.\n\nA young man came up to me and said he was sorry to disturb me, he just wanted to check, it was just, well, not to queue-jump or anything, but he wanted to check, can this definitely wait for triage..?\n\nHe then unwrapped a towel from his hand and showed me his thumb, which he had dropped a loaded barbell onto. It was shattered, just flattened, with splinters of bone coming out. I stared at it. He stared at it. I stared at it.\n\nThen I told him oh yes, no problem at all, he'd better take a seat and I'd make sure someone was with him right away.",
            "I was the patient actually.  I was sideswiped by a car, then ran over by the truck behind while cycling to work.  I was essentially impaled by my right femur, which shattered my pelvis and shoved bone fragments into my guts.\n\n  Last thing I remember before I got knocked out for surgery, was the surgeon telling me everything was going to be fine, and it was all routine.\n\n  I didn't wake up for a month.  When I did, I was missing the entire left leg, and most of the muscle tissue in the right.  I was too weak to move much, couldn't talk because I had a tube through my neck, and I was very uncertain about reality due to what I went through in my coma.\n\n  Parades of doctors came to tell me how I should be dead, and it's crazy that I lived.  I was told over and over that my survival was very much against all odds.  \n\n  My surgeon on the other hand, never said anything like that.  He always maintained that he was going to get me through.  His attitude honestly helped when I had to go back to his table a few more times before I was done.\n\n  For 4 years, I kind of blew off the people who made a big deal about my survival.  I adopted my orthopedic doctors attitude.  Then I met a woman who's in the medical field.  I fell in love, and eventually trusted her enough to let her read my medical records.  I had never read them, because it's a massive pile of paperwork.\n\n  She broke down crying and couldn't read anymore.  She told me that the beginning of my time in the hospital was full of the type of write-ups you find in the morgue.  She told me that when they opened me up, bits of my pelvis fell out.  I asked her to stop there.  She won't read anymore, and I don't want to know anymore.\n\n  I now know my doctor has one hell of a pokerface.",
            "In 2011 I had a saddle pulmonary embolism two weeks before my scheduled wedding. My quite seasoned heart surgeon seemed pretty confident that I'd be okay, and he even said he'd get me to my wedding on time.  \n\n\nLong story short, I was in the hospital for about a month due to complications. Several weeks later, when I was visiting my heart surgeon for a follow-up, he told me he'd only ever seen two other people as sick as I was. Those two didn't survive.",
            "I worked as a tech in the ER for a while and had a woman in her 40's present with \"burning and pain down below, discharge and a bad smell.\" I got the cart set up for a vaginal exam, got her vitals, blood and urine (she couldnt pee because of the pain she said), all the basic jazz you do when someone comes into the ER. I process my samples and let the nurse know everything is done and she goes to talk to the woman and it essentially goes as this: no, she hasn't had any trauma, no no assault, no she doesn't know what's going on, but it started about 3 weeks prior. Long story short, we get the Dr as the woman refused to let the nurse take a look, and we are all in the room when the Dr turns the light on under the drape and immediately asks if she's been using any medication vaginally, there's clearly a lot of irritation and swelling as well as a VERY strong odor and she hadn't even inserted the spec yet. The woman says no, nothing. At this point the nurse goes to get some saline and I'm left to hand off tools and handle any swabs. The first swab handed to me was literally tinged a pale green, clearly infection. I'm capping it and the woman smells the odor slowly filling the room finally and starts apologizing. I had to say while trying not to gag \"no no need to apologize, I've seen much crazier things, just relax and we will get you all fixed up.\" Well, the nurse comes back with saline and the Dr starts essentially flushing this woman's vagina trying to clear out all this discharge and infection so she can see what's going on, and all of the sudden she stops and asks if she's SURE she hasn't been putting anything in her vagina to treat any medical condition, even something not given by a Dr. And that's when we found out for about a month, this woman had been douching with a bleach and water mix to try and cure a yeast infection, because she read that \"in hospitals we wash down with diluted bleach to kill germs and thought it would work.\" She was riddled with chemical burns and infection and was immediately transported to a bigger hospital. So yeah, that happened. \n\n**Edit:** *Thanks for the gold whoever you are! I've not a clue what it means but it sure looks snazzy!*",

            "Happened to me, not a medical professional. Friend of mine bought a house and I moved in with him to help fix it up, polish it and then maybe sell it. So we are in the backyard pulling weeds and cutting down vines and I see this 4 inch diameter vine with fuzzy roots attached to the brick, climbed all the way up the wall.  I'm not a particularly country boy, more urban, but my friend had warned me of poison ivy in back of the house. I called him over and he said \"oh don't worry, it doesn't grow that big\".    \n    \n    \nHe was wrong.    \n  \nLess than a week later I'm covered, up and down both arms bad enough I look like a 3rd degree burn victim. It has gotten into my bloodstream and appeared on my legs, back, chest and even my feet (which all had been covered of course). I remember my GP looked at me with my shirt off and said in the most nonchalant voice \"oh, that's not quite the WORST I've ever seen\" with serious emphasis on the one word. It took me two weeks of steroids to even return to work and another two weeks to lose the last of the boils. I spent that time researching poison ivy and I have to brag, I'm an expert on how to track down and murder that fucking plant. I hate poison ivy.   \n   \nEdit - People are asking me for tips on killing the stuff.  Go to your local hardware store and they will sell a container of poison ivy killer. The stuff is good but if you use it as directed I can guarantee the stuff will return time and again to haunt you. The vine originates underground, not very deeply though. Dig around (while covered in protective clothing etc) and find the main trunk of the vine. Drill holes through the vine about half the diameter of the stalk and space them about 3-5 feet (1-2 meters) apart. Pour the poison ivy killer directly into the hole. Do not dilute it. Just pour it right in. Soak the vine well, maybe 50-100ml or 1/4 - 1/2 cup, depending on the size of the vine.  This should do the trick. Of course it will need to be dug up and out but it ought to be pretty dead within a week. If that doesn't do it, repeat the process a second time. Also, do this when there is no rain forecasted. Good luck and kill it dead!\n  \nEdit 2 - Also, it seems everyone either has a story about getting it all over and hating it (I'm so sorry for you!) or telling how they are immune to it. Fun fact about that, allergies change. You can be immune all your life and then one morning wake up allergic to just about anything. Funny story to illustrate this, I told someone about my poison ivy situation once and she told me about her little brother who was apparently not allergic. He would play pranks by grabbing it and rubbing it all over himself to try to convince other people that it wasn't poison ivy. He pulled the prank one day and had a wedding to attend two days later. He suddenly developed the allergy under the suit.  Moral of the story, kill the plant when you find it. Evil evil little bastard...  \n  \nEdit 3 - Last tip I just remembered. If you go out in the woods and suspect you are going to encounter poison ivy etc at all, bring a can of spray deodorant with you. The aluminum chloride  (I think that's the chemical) in it will neutralize the oil and prevent allergic attack. Otherwise scrub with soap and water within ten - fifteen minutes after exposure. ",

I gave him an extra infusion of Platelets, vitamin K, and multiple doses of afrin (nasal spray which vasocontricts). It would stop for maybe 20 minutes before it would start bleeding like a facet again through the family's pinching fingers. The whole time I was \"nose bleeds are common, it is the dry air from the heater ect.\" I ended up personally holding his nose for over an hour while straight we waited from someone from ENT (ears nose throat) to show up to pack it.

He claimed he broke it during sex.\n\nShe had to put a catheter in. The guy was freaking out and she had to reassure him that this was a walk in the park for her, but she was seriously questioning how to get the catheter in.

Got it in the first try, thankfully. She still doesn't know how she managed to get it in but was thankful she did lol\n\nEventually it came out that he hadn't broken his dick during sex but actually masturbated after cleaning his fish tank without washing his hands and got an infection from it \ud83d\ude10",
            "I am a surgical tech. I got called in on a Saturday for a lady who had an infection from a component separation. Basically they put a giant piece of mesh in you for hernias. I wasn\u2019t prepared. When we lifted up her gown.... the smell wafted and I have never almost puked before until that moment. About 20 cm circle around her umbillicus was black and necrotic. It was absolutely awful. We basically removed the entirety of the necrotic tissue all the way down to the peritoneum. Just gray and black slimy mass of fat and skin. The worst part is that I had to measure the necrotic tissue and it requires me to lean in a little close to it. The surgeon was laughing because I was green when I got back to the surgical field. Then during that surgery another person who had the same procedure had come to the ER with an infection. AND THEN A THIRD! We stopped using the mesh because that\u2019s what was getting infected. ",

            "ER Tech here, a few months ago we had an elderly gentleman come in presenting with shortness of breath. As I was getting him into the gown and into hospital socks, I noticed very old, yellowing bandaging around his foot. I inquired to its purpose and he told me it was a large wound on the back of his heel that wasn't getting better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I asked him if I could unwrap it to inspect it/possibly re-wrap it (basic wound care is one of my duties), and it was a literal hole in his heel about 4cm in diameter, skin necrotic around the edges, with a large flap of skin covering the middle. I wasn't terribly shocked...until I swore I saw the skin flap writhe a little bit. I got the patient's consent to look under the skin flap and sweet galactic Jesus, there were 3 sizeable maggots just chilling. I've read about it before but I have never seen it in person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brain went \"what in the solar f\\*ck\" and despite my attempt at a poker face, the gentleman read my reaction and asked, \"Is it that bad?\" I was straight up with him and told him that the wound had maggots and needed immediate treatment and the poor guy started apologizing for \"bringing something disgusting.\" I told him, \"I see this more often than you think. Maggots are actually great at cleaning out dead tissue and are used as treatment sometimes.\" He seemed relieved by that but it was definitely my first time ever seeing a maggot infected wound. \n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for the overwhelming support, the silver/gold and the education!!! This is my first healthcare job, so I definitely have a lot to learn. The patient did have the maggots removed by a wound care doctor and was admitted for pneumonia if I recall, where his wound was also watched carefully. ",

            "When I was a med student on the trauma service, there was a gentleman who decided to attempt suicide using a shotgun aimed at his heart. Unfortunately, the first thing that comes out of a shotgun when it is fired is a gust of air... which changed where the gun barrel was pointed when the shot came out. The shot pellets ended up hitting everything but his heart - lungs, ribs, spleen, stomach, liver, pancreas, and large and small intestines.\n\nIn the OR, the attending surgeon told me to put my hand on his beating heart because that will likely be the only time in my medical career that I would touch a beating heart. I did. It was cool.\n\nIn case anyone reads this in a thread with 1500+ posts... he survived.

They were fused to his skin from the middle of the hip all the way down to his calf. \n\nThey had to surgically remove his jeans by basically cutting the skin around the point where it was fused, and the moment the scalpel made the first incision, she described it as \"As if Slimer from Ghostbusters barfed out of his leg.\" \n\n\nApparently, there was enough gushing, green fluid, filled with maggots, that it covered the floor in the (small) examination room, and the nurse ran out of the room gagging. \n\n\nAfter getting over the initial shock, they managed to peel a good amount of the skin off with the pant leg, and revealed that his lower leg had basically rotted all the way to the bone, and was full of maggots.\n\nApparently that's the moment when she knew she was meant for the job. Even the surgeon was having a pretty hard time keeping his composure, but she was fine. More fascinated than anything, and apparently not affected by bad smells as most people are.\n\nThey had to tell him his leg was going to be OK - he was severely mentally ill and might have freaked the hell out - despite knowing he could die from the infection.\n\n\nApparently he survived and they managed to save the leg, which is beyond incredible.

Worst thing I\u2019ve smelled in my life. The patient has to be pushing 400 lbs and has the worst edema (soft tissue swelling) from congestive heart failure I\u2019ve ever seen. His scrotum and penis foreskin are about the size if a small watermelon, and the foreskin had swollen completely over the tip of his penis. \n\nThe nurse had a speculum (tool OBGYNs use to look inside vaginas) inserted into the man\u2019s foreskin while the resident took the catheter in a hemostat (pliers type thing) and jammed it into the man\u2019s pee hole for 20 minutes. They finally got the catheter in and took the speculum out. It was covered in a thick brown discharge that looked like fermented piss-shit. I still don\u2019t know how he let his scrotum and penis swell that much. \n\nEdit: We comforted the patient the whole time and kept telling him we had done it like this before. Total lie. No one in the ED had ever done or seen anything like it. ",

Think of the leg bone as a capital L, with the bottom of the L hooking into the hip- his were cleanly broken through the bottom sections on both sides.\n\nTurns out he'd had occult fractures on both sides the X rays didn't initially see, and walking on them collapsed them.

Eventually got so bad I nearly passed out and was on my bathroom floor screaming on the third night.  That morning I felt much better and went to work, but felt the pain coming on again that evening.  Also decided to go into work the next morning while running a fever that was getting steadily worse.  Finally decided to go to the doctor, where they immediately referred me for a CT scan.  My appendix had been ruptured for a day and a half at that point, and I had sepsis/gangrene/massive infection.  I was in surgery within a few hours, but prior to that the nurse that was with me said, \"Yeah, this will be no problem.  You'll be fine.\"  Surgery was ok, but was followed up with a bunch of time in the hospital on intravenous antibiotics.  My primary care doctor called me while I was recovering and told me the CT scan was one of the worst they had seen.  The doctors I saw post recovery all had a \\*holy shit\\* look when they saw scans and read the surgeon's report.  Kudos to that nurse who kept me calm before surgery.

He then sat in the waiting room, and it was mere moments before the smell seeped into the administration office.\n\nThe receptionist put him in an exam room as quickly as possible, and upon her return, she informed me that the infection was literally oozing out of his sneaker. All we could do was open the widows and apologize to other patients as they arrived. It was foul, and when I entered the room after his appointment to clean it (the medical assistant was out that day), I immediately began gagging and had to forcefully push my manager out of the way as to avoid vomiting on her on my way to the restroom.\n\nAs it turned out, the dude had had the infection for approximately three months, and had been showering with his sock on since he'd discovered it. He literally hadn't removed his sock from his infected foot in three months, and his wife had somehow been living with the overwhelming smell.\n\nThe doctor said it was the worst infection he'd ever seen, but the patient was so incredibly anxious that he got the standard, \"I've seen it all before,\" throughout his appointment.",

There were no pediatric surgeons available, no plastic surgeons, she was in the ER with her face ripped open.\n\nAnyways, our general pediatrician (who is now my kids pediatrician, 30 years later), who had only graduated maybe 10 years prior, sewed her face back together.

She grew normally, her face is fine, her smile is fine, no long term damage. Apparently, a face is full of nerves and muscles, and thats why only plastic surgeons work on faces.

But in this case, there was nobody else, just a general pediatrician, and he managed to save her face, with no long term nerve or muscle damage, or even scarring now that shes an adult.\n\nWe found out 25 years later from our pediatrician's wife, that he spent an hour or so crunching his old med school books in the seat of his Plymouth Reliant in the hospital parking lot, studying facial anatomy, nerves and cheek structure, etc. He walked into the hospital and performed a multiple hour surgery, on her face, sewed it back together, perfectly. You would think a plastic surgeon did it.\n\nHis wife told us he came home that night, just flopped down on the couch, and sat that there, amazed that he'd done it. Proud, but cautious.

            "Saw a surgeon one time seriously screw up what I can only assume was intended to be a hernia surgery using abdominal mesh. By the time the guy came to clinic his stomach looked like a shuttlecock (not on the inside... he was just walking around like that)",
            "I was an intern (final year of med school in Germany) at the department of Urology at a huge hospital. \nAn older man (65 years) came into the ER, I was the intern in charge that day. So basically you could just have a look at him and tell that something was very, very wrong.\nHe stuttered that his wife was absent so he took some time to watch ''some videos of a certain sexy type online that inspired him''. Internally I started screaming, but on the outside I just nodded and acted like it was something I heard routinely. He proceeded to explain to me he had seen a video of someone putting a metal rod up his urethra and tried the same. But he used too much lube and it slipped inside. I remember stopping breathing for a second. He was just so embarrassed  that I told him that this happens sometimes and we had seen it before. Well, no. Stuff up the butt, yeah, we see that. But this was a first. I pulled up the ultrasound machine hoping this was just a training situation by my attending to prank me, but nope, there was a glorious 10 cm long pen inside this man's bladder. \nSo he  had hoped to have it extracted magically at the ER and then to go home. Well, he had to have surgery and stay overnight, his wife eventually found out. I kept the picture of the ultrasound as a souvenir and this memory as a great story to tell friends when they ask how my ''routine life'' is going as a (now) doctor.\n",
            "I'm the patient here and the nurses didn't even try to say they had seen it before but it still fits. When I was getting treated for cancer I got a really bad case of pneumonia and had to be intubated and put into like a semi-coma type deal (I don't remember anything that happened in those six days but I was apparently made sober enough to open my eyes for visitors every day so I don't know if that counts as a coma). It was some pretty serious pneumonia because it was like less than two days between my first cough and them making the call that I would need to be intubated to stop me from drowning in my own fluids, so they didn't mess around and gave me a ton of antibiotics. You know how some hospital beds have a track along the ceiling that they can hang IV bags from? I had enough antibiotics hanging from mine that it broke and fell to the floor (again, no memory of this).\n\n\nBut the thing that was truly unprecedented occurred when they were changing out my butt-bag (I don't fully understand what it was but they had something on or under my butt that collected all my bowel movements, they put it on after I was heavily sedated, and removed it before I was totally awake so I don't really remember it). For anyone who doesn't know, antibiotics can cause a lot of diarrhea. Apparently when they rolled me on my side that day I let loose a fire-hose of liquid shit that arched through the air across the room and splattered all over the door and window which were about twelve feet away from my bed. I think it's super cool and funny so they didn't have to pretend like it was normal to comfort me.\n\n\n\nEDIT: WOOO! New most upvoted comment",

            "Ooh, me, I have a story.\n\nI've been an RN for 12 years now, seen a lot of shit. I was particularly lucky in nursing school and got to watch open heart surgery, joint replacement, kidney removal, all kinds of neat stuff right over the surgeon's shoulder.\n\nThe only one that ever gave me a problem was this kid about 10 years old getting his tonsils removed. The doc had this hooked knife, he's reach into the kids mouth, hook the tonsil, and yank it back to cut it out. Blood flying out of the unconscious kid's mouth. So I'm standing there, I look up and all of a sudden everything's getting sparkly. I just said \"I need to leave. Right now.\"\n\nSurgeon takes his tools out of the kid's mouth and says \"OK. Someone please walk him out, thanks.\" \n\nSo I learned that for some reason, I get queasy when it's kids being hurt. Which is funny, because I was a pediatrics nurse for quite a while after school.\n\nAnyway, the actual story. I wasn't even at work, but maybe four years ago, was living with my girlfriend at the time and her three young boys. That day, the youngest (about 7), had been climbing up a big lilac bush in the yard that I'd trimmed the day before. He slipped and fell out. A sharp, cut branch caught him in the face on his way down. I was in the kitchen, and heard this blood-curdling scream and ran outside. \n\nI brought him in, sat him on the kitchen table and took a look. It seemed like he was pretty lucky, there was just a deep cut on the bottom of his nose. Well, it was bleeding pretty decently so his mother and I took him to the emergency room.\n\nWe get there, there's only a physician's assistant on duty. He takes a look and thinks maybe it could use a couple of stitches. Or, he says, he could call the on-call ENT surgeon for another opinion. We told him that, all due respect, we would like to have a surgeon take a look, just in case.\n\nGood thing we did.\n\nThe boy had nearly taken his entire nose off his face. The stick cut up under the nose, and traveled along under the flesh up to the bridge. The entire nose was hanging by a half inch of skin at the top. We just hadn't moved it much.\n\nAs soon as the surgeon came in and pulled this little boy's nose off his face, while he's laying on the exam table screaming absolute bloody murder, suddenly I got really hot, things start getting hazy, I realize I'm about to pass out. So I quickly exited the room and sat down, at the exact same time as my girlfriend, who was also a nurse. Neither of us could take it.",

As she's pushing, this purple lumpy mass keeps protruding out of her vagina. I asked the doctor what it was, and she said it was a piece of her cervix that did not reduce. After their baby was born, they repaired her vaginal tears, and the big purple lump of her cervix was just hanging out. The doc cleaned her up, simply pushed her cervix back inside of her, and called it a day.\n\nIn the postpartum period, part of my job is to assess vaginal bleeding by pressing on mom's belly, and making sure not too much blood or clots are coming out of her vagina. Every time I would check, the cervical mass would \"pop\" out.\n\n2. Burst vaginal varicose vein.\n\nWhen I was a brand new nurse, I had patient who was on baby number 6. With each pregnancy, the body doesn't \"bounce back\" as much, and varicosities around the vagina happen from time to time, not a big deal. She was a patient of a crunchy granola midwife group, and came in fully dilated. With women who've had more than 4 babies, bleeding is a high risk, so we tend to make sure we have IV access in case they need a blood transfusion. The midwives can be much more laissez-faire about some of the medical treatment aspects of things, so the midwife told me that it was okay that we didn't have time to place an IV.\n\nThis woman is pushing like a champ. Baby's head is almost crowning, when I hear a \"POP!\" The varicose vein on her labia had burst, splattering blood on the glasses and face of this poor midwife. The vein is now bleeding profusely. The midwife tells me we need an IV NOW. I'm trying to place the IV in this poor woman as she's crowning without an epidural. I can't get it, and she's bleeding a lot, so I called for help on the intercom. The anesthesiologist places her IV, and the attending physician delivers the baby via vacuum and helps the midwife stitch up the burst vein.\n\nI never let a patient go without an IV after that one.",

            "I was the patient. Years ago when I was an active alcoholic I would be in and out of the ER to be admitted to detox from alcohol. They take this very seriously because you can die detoxing on your own depending on how much you drink. I drank a lot. The last time I was admitted my BAC was 0.425. I drank so much that I had built up this tolerance over years. I was walking talking, joking, perfectly present. The doctor in detox told me that he sees alcoholic 50 year old men who have drank all their lives and aren\u2019t as bad as I was.

            "Nursing student here. I'm currently doing my preceptorship but maybe 6 months ago during my pediatric rotation my nurse and I were caring for a 6 year old post tonsillectomy. These are extremely common procedures so neither of us thought to much when the child was saying it hurt and he wanted ice cream. He was an hour post op so we were still waiting for a gag reflex and bowel sounds, but we still assessed him thoroughly and found nothing abnormal besides maybe a little more blood around the sutures than normal. \nAnother 15 minutes later he is crying from pain and starting to cough and says \"dry throat\" so we used wet sponges to correct some dryness. All of a sudden the coughing gets very deep and strong and then a final cough sends a suture flying out of his mouth and an obsurd amount of blood. His gown, originally green, was bright red to his feet and going onto the floor and soaking the bed. The parents started freaking the fuck out, shaking him and screaming at us to fix him. The nurse and I are trying to calm these two down. I've seen births go poorly but the amount of blood from this small child was mind boggling, I had blood all over me as I was suctioning and applying oxygen. The child eventually went into shock and was rushed to the OR. Long post but still to this day I can see and feel the amount of blood and the limp child and at the time we just had to tell the parents, this is uncommon but not the worse we have seen by any means.

            "Had a patient come into my ER once who had undergone some kind of stomach surgery. He had staples holding a wound around 18 or so inches horizontaly across his lower abdomen. He said he was watching TV at home after his surgery and sitting in his chair when he laughed at something and felt the staples give. He just pressed his shirt against the wound hopped into his truck and drove 30 miles to our ER. I got him to lie back on a gurney and took him back to do his vitals and check the wound. He had a split that I could have easily put both my fists into and I could see all the way into his vitals. Asked him what his pain level was and he replied that he was a mite uncomfortable. I would have been freaking out in his position yet he was so calm about everything that I followed suit until I could hand him over to the nurses and the doc. Toughest man I ever saw. ",

            " Not a medical professional, just a mom. \n I get a call at work one day from my husband that our daughter had been in a car accident and was in her way to the hospital, by ambulance. I get to the hospital first and wait near the ambulance bay for the ambulance. It gets there and they unload her and her BFF. My daughter looks rough, but she not dying. Her face is swollen, eyes, nose, cheeks and she is bleeding from her mouth (her friend just has a busted nose). My husband and I accompany her to the exam room and doctors immediately start looking her over. They look in her mouth, up her nose, trying to figure out what is causing the bleeding. Her teeth are intact. But there is a lot of blood. So the doctor goes to look again at her mouth and he pinches her top lip between his fingers and this time lifts it higher with more gusto and when he does we all see where the blood is coming from. The inside of her lip, where the top meets the gums, is completely torn away. When he lifts it, we could all see her nasal cavity, her cheek bones EVERYTHING and we could tell it was all broken to shit. Now, I grew up in a medical setting with a terminally ill brother, I have a great poker face. My husband, not so much. He starts dry heaving. I could see the panic set in her eyes. I tell her everything is fine, it\u2019s nothing. They immediately give her massive doses of dilaudid and send her for a ct scan. She had broken her nose, both cheeks and split her mandible.  \n A couple years later, she said something about how calm I was. I told her that I was dying inside because I knew it was bad but that wasn\u2019t going to do her any good. She also didn\u2019t know that when they took her to ct I told her dad that he had to get it together or go sit in the waiting room. We could both cry about it later. And we did we ever. \n ",

He has accidentally drilled into the end of his penis with a power drill. Needless to say, I was surprised (I hadn't heard the report and had no idea why he was there). \n\nAfter the ED doc left, I continued conversing with him, and he told me how ashamed he was of the injury. He had been drilling towards himself (a drawer, I believe) and the drill punched through. \n\nI told him: \"Sir, this is the ER, we see stuff like this *all* the time, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.\"\n\nHe thanked me for making him feel better about it, and throughout his stay, I reminded him that there was nothing to be ashamed about - we see stuff like this all the time.\n\nI have never seen anything like that. Ever.  But telling him that white lie seemed to provide some comfort, and eased his anxiety, so fuck it. I'd lie 1000 times like that to make someone feel better in that kind of situation.",

You could smell infection on her. Everything was alright til she started complaining of chest pain.

            "Awesome, finally I have a story to tell! I\u2019m an ICU nurse now for four years. We had this elderly gentleman that had suffered a non witnessed heart attack. With that he suffered an anoxic brain injury (basically since your heart stops beating it doesn\u2019t pump oxygenated blood to the brain therefore the brain suffers permanent injury- so essentially he was just a \u201cvegetable\u201d) Family was in complete denial and he of course was on life support  with no hope of meaningful recovery and his body was just absolutely rejecting everything. His skin was sloughing off and rotting off of his body. Every time we had to clean up a bowel movement  or a bed bath, we would try to wipe him gently but we still would wipe off chunks of rotted flesh off of this man. We had consulted a wound care team and they came to assess him with family at bedside. These family members had the absolute nerve to crack jokes about his wounds like \u201coh look at those holes in his skin and his feet\u201d and start laughing. I\u2019ve never been so mad that a family kept that poor man alive for their selfish reasons. \n\nAlso we had a man roll up after being found unconscious with maggots crawling over every inch of him. If only I could describe the god- awful smell.",

She knew he was paralyzed and thought maybe the catheter was pulling on his bladder or something else he had feeling in, and hiked up his gown to take a look.\n\n He must have rolled over in his sleep and yanked the catheter, because his willy was split down the urethra. There was blood all over and it was flopped open like a butterflied chicken breast. \n\nShe kept it together long enough to tell him she was going to get someone to help adjust the catheter and ran off to call the doctor, but the guy had no idea at all.

            "Medical student, during my internship at a clinic there was a patient who had pressure sores over his buttox. Anyways the doctors shu'd me out because they thought it was too traumatising for me. A few days later because they were short on staff I had to attend. Anyways, imagine sores all the way. It was rather \"where is no sore\". The bandages and everything we applied was somewhat soaked in feces well because it was all the way to the crack. They extended from lower back to below the gluteal fold. Some parts had pus coming out. Later on one of the doctors told me that those were the worst sores he had ever seen and was confused I \"took it so well\". That's because those were the first sores I ever saw and thought they always look like that. I genuinely didn't understand that that was extremely bad and not just \"oh, just a booboo\" ",

His scrotum was the size of a basketball. He had an unbelievable amount of liquid gushing from his abdomen. There was so much liquid on the floor that I had to use 3 blankets and 15 towels to clean it up. While trying to get him situated we were all very reassuring that this was okay. But internally screaming. Shortly after arrival he was transferred to ICU. ",
            "Not my story (I\u2019m a nurse) but my mother\u2019s (anesthesiologist). They have nascar type races outside the city I  grew up in. For some reason, at one of these events they let a 5 year old into the pit where the car pulls in to be serviced. Of course, the driver didn\u2019t see this wandering kid and ran over them. Huge trauma. The doc on scene stabilized them as much as possible until they could airlift the poor kid out. In the helicopter the kid coded (no pulse) due to extreme internal bleeding so instead of going to the far away children\u2019s hospital they rerouted to the adult hospital my mother worked at. They get this kid in the OR and there\u2019s not a paediatrician in the building. Everyone is freaking out, my mum hasn\u2019t treated a child since medical school 30 years prior. She\u2019s transfusing blood in small increments as is best practice and trying not to kill the kid with too much anesthesia. Suddenly the blood pressure tanks and my mum just goes \u2018fuck it\u2019 and opens two IV lines all the way so blood is pouring into the kid. They get the kid open, a surgeon finds the bleed, clamps it, and they all immediately step back and wait. 10 mins later the peds team from the children\u2019s hospital bursts in and takes over and my mums team all started crying with relief. Kid lived. \n\nI thought this was the coolest story ever but my mum won\u2019t take any credit for it. She says the doc on scene saved the kid. They had previously worked pediatric trauma and managed to get two large bore IVs (14 gauge) in the kid\u2019s brachial. That is wicked hard to do. ",
            "Not so much that I had to tell the patient \u201cwe\u2019ve seen it all before\u201d but something funny I did notice the other day. I\u2019m a firefighter/paramedic and we were called to the home of an elderly couple. Wife is wheelchair bound and had slipped in the shower. She wasn\u2019t hurt but rather simply needed help getting back up since it was slick and her elderly husband wasn\u2019t capable of lifting her. No big deal, we respond and a bored police officer responds as well. She\u2019s lying in the shower obviously naked, so we help her up and put her into the wheelchair. Her husband starts asking us questions then his wife joins in, so we all stand around for a few minutes exchanging pleasantries. They thanked us and we said goodbye and went out to the ambulance. That was when it hit me, so I stopped the police officer and my partner and asked if they realized that we just had a ten minute conversation with an old couple in their house and none of us - including the wife - payed any attention to the fact that she was completely naked the whole time. We\u2019ve been doing this so long that it\u2019s normal for us to see these things, and she and her husband are old and old people don\u2019t give a shit. So yes, four men had a completely platonic conversation with a fully naked woman and not one of us gave it a second thought. ",

            "RT here. Worst I've actually seen? Lady's foot rotting. With maggots. Chief complaint? Altered mental status. Worst I've heard of? Pimp slashed a young prostitute's ladybits and anus to shreds.\n\nThe lady is a diabetic who wasn't compliant with her medications. She lived alone, noone visited her except her sister, who died the year previous. She comes in because a neighbor reported her trailer being on fire (she dropped a cigarette, because altered mental status). When she got to the ER, the staff found out her foot was so badly rotted (thanks to diabetes, she had no feeling in her feet to tell her this was a problem) you could see her tendons, and maggots were all throughout her foot.\n\nWhat's surprising was that she lived. What's more surprising is she only lost her leg below the knee, so she was able to keep her knee. \n\nWorst I've heard was an 18 year old prostitute who got her lower area slashed to bits. By the time she was my patient, her bits were already stitched and bandaged up. The ICU nurses who I worked with were traumatized, and I let them vent to me (no pun intended).\n\nHer pimp had taken a knife to her anal sphincter, slashing it forwards so that she basically had a cloaca. He then sexually assaulted her with the blade, and cut open her clitoral area. He then *ripped* her clitoris out. Not cut, but grabbed her clit and *ripped it out*. When she was describing this to the care manager and MD, she could barely get the words out, she was so traumatized.\n\nI found out later that when he assaulted her with the blade part of the knife, he damaged her uterus so badly she had to have a hysterectomy. She had wanted children too.",

Bag of blood, then I would feel this sinking, dropping feeling in my uterus, and then PLOP! and I was saying to the nurse \"omg! Here comes another one!\" Ran to the toilet in the room, and sometimes made it, sometimes not. Blood was smeared all over, as I was, and the other nurses were trying to catch the clots. \n\nPoor women, they were all so nice to me, but I could see the horror on their faces. \n\nI mean, it looked like a massacre in there. I will never forget the feeling of this blood baby literally dropping out of my body.",
            "Guy came in complaining of leg pain and swelling. We talk off his socks and THOUSANDS of maggots come pouring out. I am not joking when I tell you the entire exam room (probably 8x12) was completely covered in maggots along with most of the bed.\n\nExterminator refused to come in since maggots are considered invasive or hard to kill. One of the techs and I spent and hour clearing out the maggots then another hour deconing the patient and the bed. After removing all of the maggots from the guys legs, I stepped outside to grab some water and air. Went back in 5 minutes later to see maggots crawling out of the guys exposed tibia.\n\nI kept a straight face and told him we'd get him taken care of. I put a plastic garbage bag around each leg, duct taped it tight, and noped the fuck out. \n\nEdit: I can guarantee the dude lost his legs. What happened from there is unknown to me. I don't typically follow up with my patients as it's easier to compartmentalize if I don't."

He worked his ass off to make my childhood as magical as it possibly could be.\n\nFor my birthday every year, he told me that the fairies would help me celebrate. He had me shove sticks into the ground outside, and he would always switch them out for my favorite flowers. One or two of them were always those fake roses with chocolate flowers. The fairies would also always leave me a pinata. It would usually be a sun, doused in glitter, and would always be left on our big tree in the backyard. Inside were all my favorite candies, and a toy wrapped in green wrapping paper.\n\nFor Christmas, he would leave special hand-written notes from Santa claus, and even paid our neighbor, who had a horse, to leave hoof prints in the snow outside.\n\nOn the days leading up to Saint Patrick's Day, we would construct a leprechaun trap. I'd wake up only to find tiny footprints everywhere, and a pile of gold dollars. They were always too sneaky for us to catch. \n\nOn Easter, the bunny would always leave me presents, and lots of eggs.\n\nBut aside from all these super awesome things my dad did for me, there were bigger, more meaningful things he was always sure to do.\n\nFor example, he always made sure that I feel heard. If ever I have a problem, he listens. He doesn't always have advice, but he's there. And that's what is most important. It didn't matter if the problem seemed small to him, because he knew it was big to me.\n\nHe's always been one of my best friends. There for advice when I need it. For a hug or a shoulder to cry on. Hell, he did some truly silly things that I *know* he got teased for. I can distinctly remember him letting me paint his nails before work, which looked silly af. My dad is about 6'2, and at the time, was easily 200lbs.\n\nBut he went above and beyond all that. He taught me self defense (he was a boxer back in the day), he taught me how to deal with anger and sadness in a healthy way. He also made it very clear that if *anyone* touched me, he'd kill them.\n\nHe was my rock. He both kept me grounded, and encouraged me to soar. He nurtured my creative side, and encouraged my scientific one as well.\n\nI want to be exactly that for my son. I never want him to question whether or not I love him, whether or not he can come to me for absolutely anything. I have done my dead level best to drill into my child that there is *nothing* he can ever do to make me stop loving him. That I will always protect him. That anything he says to me, will die with me. That his problems and concerns are never too small or too big for me to help with.\n\nI really hope that one day I have that \"Holy shit, I'm my father\" moment. ",

Anyhow, in one scene as she was exiting the stage she banged her head on one of the props - you could hear the loud bang- but she was a pro and just carried on.

            "I was local Production contact on Hugh Jackman\u2019s touring theatre production where he sang his favourite numbers from various musicals. Usually when a show comes in with big name stars, the star usually has a bunch of assistants and they do the job they are paid to do and that\u2019s it. The actor come on stage when needed then back to their dressing room and if you need anything or if they need anything you talk to the assistant. Prior to the first performance, I am on stage dealing with a few little issues, trying to stay on schedule when Mr. Jackman walks out on stage and my first thought was that he was going to be angry that we have kept him waiting to do his sound check. Instead he walks directly over to me, introduces himself asks me my name and asks a couple of questions and doesn\u2019t even mention the delays. So we spoke for a few minutes and then he went around and introduced himself to more of the local crew. I was a little blown away by meeting him as I am a fan and thought that was really cool of him. Fast forward a week and I am backstage after the performance and I bump into Mr.Jackman in the hall, I say hi but don\u2019t want to bother him but he stops me, he remembers my name (after meeting 100\u2019s of people that week) and asks a few questions that related to our first conversation. Here\u2019s the thing though. The guy just did a two hour performance and Instead of just politely returning my greeting he stopped and talked for a few moments with no false sincerity. \nTo this day I am still blown away by how genuinely nice he was and always wondered what he was like before he became famous. He would also spend a huge amount of time after the show signing autographs and answering questions at stage door.",

Rupert loved what he was doing, but didn't care about being famous and having people kiss his arse. Just a nice normal kid.",

            "I live in the town where Dolly Parton grew up, and practically everyone above the age of 50 who grew up here claims to either be a distant relative of Dolly\u2019s, or they claim to know her in some way. Everyone has their story of the time they met Dolly. It\u2019s pretty obvious, but regardless of who you talk to, Dolly has always been sweet and generous, but everything has simply grown exponentially due to her fame. Examples are the millions of books she gives out for free to children around the globe each month, or how she gave out $10,000 cash to many of my close friends after their houses burned in a fire a couple years back. Thousands of people are employed here and work for one of the businesses she owns, and it\u2019s a tad strange to see when you walk in, but the birthing center at the local hospital is funded by and named after her. I honestly can\u2019t think of one person I know who doesn\u2019t like her. Dolly\u2019s heart has only gotten bigger because of fame.",

He lived by himself in the centre of Soho, London, in a tiny one-bed flat that I think he felt like the romantic vision of a starving artist, or at least wanted to. \n\nHe had a weird side. He'd say random, violent, depraved things. He was obsessed with Jack Nicholson. He never really gave a fuck, he had confidence and he was always himself, and he knew he could be deliberately contradictory and he used that as a personality trope. But he was a good guy, and I get the impression he's very comfortable with himself now that he has developed his career, that he acts very well, and that he can pick and choose his roles based upon what he wants to do and who he wants to work with. \n\nTwilight for him was always a means to an end, and I think he worked it very much to his benefit, and didn't compromise himself.",

            "Jennifer Lawerence. I moved to Louisville middle of 7th grade year. She was my first friend, and the first person I had a sleepover with. We hit it off. She was very different from me, a cheerleader, came from a lot of wealth, but her family was really awesome and we were both kinda weird and outgoing so we become good friends very fast. Her family owned a farm that had a children\u2019s summer camp (Hi-Ho) and we went to it a couple of times, she had one of her birthday parties there! I remember her kissing our friend Jon under a trampoline. We talked about it for way too long! We hung out fairly often until she moved to NYC a year and half after we met. \n\nWe started taking acting classes together in 8th grade at a local theater here in town, Walden Theater. It\u2019s funny because on our first day, we had no idea we were both taking the class. I walked in to the first one, and there she was. We were both so excited to have a friend! We were in the first level of the theater but after a couple weeks, both moved to the intermediate class (we were the oldest people in the class, so that\u2019s why they moved us up so fast) \n\nWe carpooled together to Walden Theater every Tuesday and Thursday for acting class. I would ride the bus home with her, her mom would take us to class, then my mom would pick us up and take her home. She was a natural at acting, I\u2019ll tell you that. I was still somewhat shy, but she could pretty much be given any character and even though she was 14, you\u2019d believe it. She ALWAYS talked about how she had a photographic memory, and that\u2019s how she was able to remember lines so easily. And she did. It was insane. \n\n*i have read where she said she\u2019s had no prior acting, but this isn\u2019t true? I\u2019m not sure if she said this for a part of her look, or maybe she considered it informal, but we definitely took acting classes our entire 8th grade year \n\nI will say, what you see with her is what you get. She was always very quirky, kinda weird (which was funny because she was so preppy presenting, but really wasn\u2019t like that), she was very loud, made her presence known. It\u2019s been bizarre seeing her in interviews because she acts the exact same. \n\nI remember she moved to NYC to pursue modeling between 8th and 9th grade. It worked because soon after she was in a commercial for Burger King and a couple of MTV\u2019s \u201cMy Sweet 16\u201d commercials as well. She was doing online classes for our high school (Ballard High School) and came to visit one time in 9th grade and another in 10th grade. I squealed when I saw her, I genuinely missed her. I had no idea she was about to become one of the most famous actresses of our generation. \n\nI always hear she comes to town for holidays, but at this point I have no idea how to contact her. She had a private Facebook for a while (assuming it was really her, for a time, I had a few fake accounts for her request to be my Facebook friend, along with a lot of people we went to school with), the last time we spoke was for my 21st bday (I\u2019m 29 now) but I would love to catch up with her. I can\u2019t help but wonder if she remembers me.\n\nI still have her yearbook photo she signed hanging up in my room, our yearbooks and a couple photos from a disposable camera.",

Her parents were divorced which led to them both always trying to be her friend and never actually parenting her, so they basically let her do whatever she wanted. \n\nWhen she said that people from her high school made fun of her because she was \u201cpoor\u201d and that the parking lot was all bmws and range rovers I lost my mind because SHE was the bully in high school, and while the school definitely had some wealthy students it was mostly a middle class crowd.",

Back then I remember hearing his early stuff and I could dig it because I primarily listened to a lot of local rappers and helped produce music. He would dye his hair pink back then before the blonde. He celebrated his birthday one year (i think 25 or 26) at a local bar and we all came out. Drinking like fish ALL NIGHT. I remember it because my buddy and I had to call his gf to drive us back to his place to crash. I stopped producing music and went on to different things and didnt follow him until he made it big with the slim shady album. \n\nOf course now its very public how his life has taken many ups and downs since like 20 something years ago. But I will always remember how cool as shit he was, and how he was always complemented all music he heard.",

Or, when the author reads his or her own book you get the tone and inflection that they intended.

I am in my mid twenties studying to be a professional pilot, and have smoked habitually several times a day for the last several years.\n\nWhile I am still a large advocate for Marijuana.\nI stopped smoking entirely about a month ago because I realized a few things.\n\n1.) I became complacent with my life and my surroundings. Rarely wanting to make a change in my routine because I knew  when I able to spark up.\n\n2.)  I would spend extra cash on edibles, concentrates, weed. Etc. Essentially having extra spending money meant it was going to get me high\n\n3.) I felt as if I would make excuses to not see friends and family. So that I would ensure that I would be comfortable and at home with my shit in hand.\n\n4.) It becomes a nightly ritual. To the point where going to sleep without it sounded impossible.\n\n5.) following #4. You stop dreaming, due to the fact the THC hinders REM sleep. I never really understood this until I quit and started having incredibly memorable and vivid dreams.\n\nWith all that said. I still believe it\u2019s a beautiful plant that has wonderful benefits.

            "I've noticed after the initial uptick in chatter- people tend to get really quiet, and zoned out in their own thoughts.\n\nWhen I used to smoke it, I found it had a dulling effect on my personality and conversational skills after the fact, too.",
            "It seems like most of my response has already been said, but I want to reiterate three major observations what I've noticed from my own semi-frequently weed consumption.\n\n1. Demotivation: the impact from weed on motivation levels I find is in two parts. The first part is when you initially consume the weed, most people fall into a habit of eating food and watching something on T.V. The second part I found is the next morning, I experience a type of weed 'hangover' the following morning. I feel more groggy and more susceptible to just loading around the following day.\n\n2. Anxiety: things that aren't currently stressing you out may start to induce anxiety in you. While this isnt always the case, weed has the potential to worsen your mental state if you aren't careful. This impact became more pronounced when I smoked weed solo,  having other people around allowed me to be more present in the moment, whereas I was in my head when I was alone. \n\n3. Food consumption: I found for me that continued weed use led to some unhealthy eating habits. The munchies are real and for often that not you are craving food that is not considered healthy. If this becomes a more common occurrence than your overall diet can go south quickly.",
            "One thing that I never see brought up is the effect of marijuana on dreaming. Marijuana use can prevent the user from dreaming during regular sleep. When the user stops using Marijuana for a while, they can experience night after night of extremely vivid dreams. I can only speak for my own experience, but I have heard this echoed by a co-worker's dad who started smoking again because he couldn't handle \"having acid-trip dreams every night\".\n\nI suspect that marijuana has some potent effect on REM sleep that will remain under-documented until it is de-scheduled and more thorough research can be done.\n\nEDIT: Wow!

            "I smoked everyday for about 10 years, minus about 6 months in all that as I needed to be clean for a drug test for a job. Imo weed starts off amazing and fun but after becoming a habitual smoker it turns into a crux thats hard to shake. Its not that its super addicting its just nothing is as fun as being high so you want to be high all the time. It dulls feelings but highlights feelings of existentialism which can sometimes be over bearing. I would also feel stuck in my life a lot, like it would be hard to make changes but i would want better things for myself but it always seemed impossible to achieve. I did have problems with breathing but I have a history of asthma and took up tai chi to compensate which I found really enjoyable and it helped me to slow down greatly on smoking. The one most annoying thing with being a smoker is your tolerance level goes way up so even though you are smoking you arent getting that high you used to get, just a mind numbing insomnia almost. I also had a loss of appetite over time and ate less. It also made me feel comfortable with where I was in life and I had a lack of motivation, tho somedays like once a month or two it could really motivate you to do something but that would wither away quickly.\n\n Overall I would recommend it only at parties or every once in awhile but I have quit a while ago and never want to go back to being a daily smoker. Also me being an expectant mother now has changed my feelings towards it. I dont want my kids growing up around it or around me being high.I feel they should find that on their own if they want and I shouldn't influence them to think its ok.\n\nEdit: wow a lot of comments on this which is surprising for me. I will try to answer you all over time. Thank you everyone for the gold and silver and such. I just want to say I did mean crux instead of crutch. Like I said weed highlighted thoughts and feelings of existentialism in my life. So I felt like a martyr almost on my quest to find answers to these questions of mine. I felt like I was crucifying myself for a righteous cause to know what I wanted to know. \n\nAlso a lot of people saying I described addiction when I stated weed wasnt addicting. I always thought if something was addicting you couldn't quit cold turkey due to your body going into shock or death. Or that you couldnt quit without help like methodone for heroine addicts or something. Since I quit weed cold turkey and when I wanted too I didnt think it was addicting. Like I choose to eat eggs every day for breakfast, its not addicting but I like it and choose it. But maybe I am addicted? Lol just stating. \n\nAlso I did psychedelics for a period of time throughout all this. So maybe this changed how weed effected me over time. I had a lot of bad trips and can't even think about tripping again. \n\nGod bless all of you guys tho. I know weed effects people differently I just wanted to share how it effected me over time. I don't think it should be illegal tho and I think people should be free to use it as they see fit. I believe everyone has the personal liberty to choose their own path.\n\nEdit 2: anyone looking for advice on how to stop, I recommend changing your routine. My husband and I took up different activities like taking the dogs to the dog park, going to hockey games, spending more time with family, going to the beach,  tai chi, etc. We are both homebodies but we decided to go out and be more active and it helped to break the routine of sitting at home smoking. Find new stuff to do instead.",

[3](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.hsc.unt.edu/pubmed?term=23795762)  \n>  \n>Bipolar Disorder: A meta-analysis of two studies of individuals with bipolar disorder  found **cannabis use associated with a threefold increased risk (odds  ratio = 2.97, 95% CI 1.80-4.90) for new onset of manic symptoms**. [4](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.proxy.hsc.unt.edu/pubmed?term=25285897)\n\n~~Heavy marijuana use is associated with an increased risk of developing major depressive disorder~~\\*(struck rather than removed for transparency, I misinterpreted the study, odds ratio does not imply that heavy marijuana use increases risk of depression)\\*, and marijuana is associated with those with bipolar disorder being several times more likely to develop mania.\n\nThe list goes on to include anxiety disorders, lung problems (which should makes sense when thinking of inhaling any kind of smoke or vaping fluid), cancer risks, cyclic vomiting syndrome, decreased male fertility, increased risk of tooth/gum disease. Marijuana won't kill you as fast as some other drugs/alcohol/other vices, but that's a far cry from calling it safe. There are likely ways to mitigate some of these risks, like reducing lung problems through use of edibles, but many of these complications from marijuana use stem from the cannabinoids in the system rather than the route of use.\n\nThis also doesn't touch on the potential benefits of CBD, THC, etc. It's important to remember that when talking about any medicine that there are risks and benefits associated. e.g. aspirin can save your life in a heart attack but can cause stomach bleeding, so we give aspirin shortly after heart attack symptoms start but we don't recommend taking aspirin daily. Unless we do, because other factors complicate the picture. Medicine is complicated that way. Parts of marijuana may make for good medicine once it's further studied and the good things isolated, but it's extremely important to remember that being \"medicinal\" absolutely does not make it harmless in any way shape or form.\n\nEdit: References appear blocked to some, here are citations -\n\n^(1)Nader,  D.

            "Here are a few downsides that I know from personal experience:\n\n* Smoke in lungs bad, more so if you also smoke cigs\n* Can get expensive if you become dependent\n* Habit forming, like everything else fun\n* You have to deal with the social stigmas and bias opinions of friends/family/co-workers\n* If you're already prone to being lazy, indica strains tend to magnify that\n* You have to work around drug tests by planning when to abstain\n* If you hate working around drug tests and you've grown dependent,  you may tend to stick to jobs that don't drug test, which depending on your area, are only lower paying jobs\n* The smell can get on everything, especially if you're not proactive about preventing/containing it (see below for tips on how to do that)\n* If it's illegal where you're located and you don't have a dealer that will drive to your place, there is always a risk that you can get caught with it, like having cops bust down the door of your dealers place while you're there or pulling you over and finding it\n* If it's illegal where you're located and you live in public housing or a college dorm, you may get kicked out of college/housing or cause others problems that involves the law\n* Drug charges on your record can severely fuck your life up if you're planning certain career paths\n* When your dealer ghosts and you have to find a new one, there can be many risks involved, like getting robbed or overcharged\n* If you buy from the black market there are a host of issues that can happen like smoking mold or weed that was grown by a potato fuck that didn't properly use insecticide and now it's in your lungs\n* You can catch an infection if you don't properly practice bong hygiene (if you don't clean it thoroughly and let it dry out regularly, nasty shit can flourish in there)\n* Resin and ash can get everywhere, on your counter top, coffee table, clothes etc etc if you're not careful\n* If you struggle with addiction, depression or any other mental disorders, having a dealer that sells more than just weed can be dangerous if you're not stable at the moment\n* Some people literally only hang out with you because you have weed, second you don't have any, poof, they don't come around too often or not at all\n* If you smoke a lot before you're out of puberty (puberty can last till you're 25 fyi), you can magnify lazy behaviors and stunt your mental development\n* You can gain a lot of weight if you already have problems controlling your diet\n* You can develop G.E.R.D if you're constantly eating snacks right before bed\n* You can develop Costochondritis if you're one of those asshats that believe taking huge hits and coughing more is somehow indicative of better weed/high\n* When you're dependent, traveling and vacations can get stressful\n* If it becomes too important to you, you can base you're whole personality on it when in reality you're incredibly boring or a drag to hang out with\n* If you're not a habitual smoker (sometimes even if you are), drinking booze and smoking can REALLY fuck you up, spins, throwing up, etc etc\n* Ever deal with a dog that ate half a bag of dog food and some of your brownies and is now a puke geyser?\n\nTIPS ON CONTROLLING THE SMELL:\n\n* Don't smoke in ANY clothes you would wear outside of the house\n* Contain your smoking to one room, preferably the one with the most ventilation or bathroom\n* Smoking in the bathroom after a steamy shower while putting the exhaust fan on can control the smell to great effect (some of the molecules responsible for the skunk smell attach to water molecules in the steam which get sucked up by the exhaust)\n* Wash you're hands with a anti-grease/oil soap right after handling your stash or pieces, otherwise, those skunky oils from the buds will get all over your clothes, doorknobs, bed, keyboard, steering wheel, hair, face, etc etc etc\n* When traveling with cannabis, this is how you should pack it: 1. BEFORE touching any product/buds, take a clean unused baggy (preferably a ziplock or skunk bag) and wrap it around a glass or coffee mug (this will hold it open for you) and make sure not to let the buds touch the outside of the bag 2. Either make sure to wash your hands after placing the weed into the bag or use nylon gloves and throw them away before closing the bag 4. Put said baggy into a large container of coffee or something else that you can easily dig through to retrieve said weed. This is not to help stop the smell (dogs can smell through the coffee if you didn't package it properly to begin with) but rather to stop anyone else from possibly snooping.\n\nThat's all I can think of! Hope that helps!\n\nEdit: spelling, grammar, other stupid shit, I blame the weed",

            "So , i'm gonna speak from my 10 years experience with this. First off, weed is great. I love the stuff.  Though these are some things that I can pinpoint:\n\n1. The tolerance - After you smoke the same strain for a few days it gets less potent to you. \n2. Bad Dealers - The ones who will give you less for your moneys worth\n3. The waiting - To get sorted \n4. The Risk - Depending on location\n5. The Price - Depending on location and Dealer\n6. Social Stigma - From Family or Co-workers\n7. The Smell - Alot of weed has a LOUD aroma that will be smelled by others unless vacuum sealed, If smoked inside, the smell sticks to everything\n8. Wake and baking - This can be a two sided coin. You can have the best day ever or just be really hazy and tired with no motivation.\n9. Personally I feel that it drains my motivation but then again that could be the 40 hour work week and college that does that. \n10. If you need to wake up early after smoking all night. It's rough getting up in the morning. Nowhere near as bad as a hangover though, I call it a Dankover.\n11. Paranoia - I don't get this often but usually i'm in a safe environment anyway. \n12. If you are prone to depression or are depressed, weed can send you deeper into the spiral or help pull you out temporarily\n13. For me it dulled alot of emotion and thoughts so when i had T breaks all these thoughts would rush back super hard and impact me. Though I usually smoke everyday so that's more my issue. \n\nThere are positives and negatives to all drugs. Weed has a lot more pros than most. \"Pick your rose but be weary of it's thorns\" Weed don't have thorns so go ham y'all.",

No, it's not chemically addictive, and it 100% depends on each individual, but it is for sure possible to fall into an addiction.\n\nI fully support legalization and a personal right to consume it, but speaking from personal experience It can be one of the biggest killers of motivation, and leave you a husk of yourself if you let it.",
            "A few downsides that I noticed after a couple of years of daily use:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* People say it will make them more productive but for the most part it makes them content with boredom. \n* Relying on it for eating/sleeping will cause a lack of appetite and slight insomnia for a few days after quitting long term use.\n* After taking a break and trying it again I noticed the next day I had a slight 'hangover' where I just felt slower and more dull.\n* It can cause depersonalization/derealization where things just don't feel real and you're overly introspective (which is part of why I quit, along with the first point about being content with boredom). This stems from anxiety, and weed introduced me to heavy anxiety. \n\nLastly, I noticed my friends that still do it all of the time are just a lot less interesting to interact with. I realized that I was probably like this and am glad I have stopped using it honestly. I don't judge people for using it, but I don't deny the negative effects it can have with daily habitual use. I definitely think it has it's place both medicinally and recreationally but it isn't the miracle drug with no downsides people make it out to be. Usually the people that tote these ideas are just stoners defending their habit which I used to be.",

Buy a sports car, wreck it, sell it for scrap. He'd work contracts and then take time off to work on his own startup, but spend every weekend just going out and buying drugs and booze.\n\nI thought it was really fun and wild at first - haha, money really means nothing to you! - but when we became a long term couple I started feeling like his mother. *Man, will you not just fill out the insurance paperwork?!..*",

There was always money to pay it off each month, so it made sense to 1) build credit and 2) collect airline miles or whatever the reward was back in the day.\n\nWhen we got together, she always used cash or a debit card.  She had a credit card \"for emergencies\" and avoided using it otherwise. It took a long time to get her over her aversion/skepticism (we were fortunate to have two good paying jobs), though it also taught me a healthy appreciation for what it means to have a financial cushion.",

            "I Grew up with a poor family. I was told \u201ccredit cards were evil\u201d and to never get one by my parents. They had this outlook because they were never taught how to properly use them either.  When I finally did have to establish credit and got my first one, I didn\u2019t overthink it and just followed the rules and paid it off every month. Then they allowed me more and more credit, more and more cards. An emotionally abusive ex would use my cards for every day living, promising to pay them off with me. Soon the interest started to snowball and before I knew it I couldn\u2019t get out from under it. He ghosted me after 4 years of living together. I was on my own. For about a year I\u2019d get home from work every day and just sob. I was depressed as hell.\n\nI met current my boyfriend in the midst of all of this. I noticed him always using credit cards and talking about perks and points. He seemed so responsible in the way he used them. It took me a bit to open up to him about my debt, because I was so embarrassed, and it got to the point I felt like there was a weight on my chest 24/7. The late calls, only paying the minimum on each card every month, barely touching the interest. When I finally opened up to him, He sat down with me and said, we are a team, we\u2019ll figure this out together. He helped me go over all of my interest and cards and see what the best option for me was. He offered to pay it all off with his work bonus that year and I pay him back, but we hadn\u2019t been together long, and I didn\u2019t love him for his money. I didn\u2019t even feel comfortable with him paying for dinner often. I knew I had to get out of this myself.  \n\nOne day when I saw him, he gave me an envelope and told me not to open it till I got home. He gifted me 1,000. I did not want to accept it and felt horrible doing so. He told me he hoped it\u2019d help the burden and do with it whatever I wanted, or even something to treat myself since I couldn\u2019t do that for so long. I asked him if he minded if I used it to pay for a lawyer to File bankruptcy, he said he\u2019d support me in doing so.\n\nI did end up filing.

When we booked our first vacation (cheap road trip to Georgia) he couldn\u2019t pay for anything and was worried the whole time. The anxiety that would keep him up at night made me so sad. \n\nHe still never fills up his gas tank all the way, only $10 at a time. Drives me nuts.

She was blown away how aggressively mean people are to you when you drive an ugly old car.  When she got out of the car the spell lifted.  \n\nI got a lot of respect from her for that. She seemed to think I was a saint for not turning sour over it.  I was constantly getting pulled over by cops and let go, targeted by road rage, and also pedestrians felt too comfortable engaging with me. \n\nI drive a newer Honda (1 yr old) now and it is so different. I drive the same but probably drive a bit more aggressively now that I can\u2019t hear the wind roaring by when I\u2019m going over 40mph.

            "I'm from the poor family.  For my first car purchase, I went to a dealership and picked out a Honda Civic, and they proceeded to slap on something like a 10% finance rate on that sucker.  I saw nothing wrong with it - I was young, I had no idea the typical finance rates, and I had brought my parents with me.  Surely they would have raised a red flag if it had been a bad deal?  (No; I quickly realized later they had absolutely no financial literacy.  One of the reasons we were poor, but certainly not the only one.)  Also, I could afford the monthly payments, and that's what *really* matters, right?\n\nI was about a year into it before I did some research, wised up, and paid that thing off ASAP.  Drove it for nearly ten years, ended up being a great car, but I can absolutely understand why people end up in these terrible underwater loans with rates that make your head spin.  That was me!  And I consider myself a smart person, but financial literacy is a whole separate thing from being \"smart\".\n\nA lot of people have this idea that if you're rich, you're automatically smart, and if you make poor financial decisions, you're dumb.  Well, both my husband and I make 6 figures now and I like pulling out this little nugget of info when people start cracking on people making \"bad decisions and they deserve to be miserable etc\".  I was like, that was me once.  Ironically, once I started making money, I had the ability to take the time to do research and make better decisions (because things weren't done at the last second emergency).",
            "This is a story my mom related to me. I wouldn't quite say that my dad is rich (he's a doctor), but compared to the family she grew up with, he is very wealthy.\n\nAs a kid, my mom's idea of extravagance was buying gum at the movie theater. She had to pay her father back for this, and he counted every penny.\n\nWhen she started dating my dad, he would take her to the convenience store for a coke (those styrofoam cups of soda you fill up from the fountain). After they married, they continued to do this every week.\n\nShe was shocked. To her, the idea of getting a soda was a rare treat. For dad, it was nothing. Not even pocket change. \n\nTo this day (thirty years later), mom gets a soda every week. Sometimes it's hard to see their love for each other, but these little rituals tell the story of their relationship.",
            "It's the other way around for me. My fiancee comes from a 6 figure family. They have a beautiful home in the country on a very well-to-do road, three nice new cars, and they used to go on regular vacations when we were still in school. My single mom raised my sister and I alone in shitty apartments. The only way we afforded anything was through hand-me-downs and government assistance. We weren't dirt poor but I never bought anything new until I graduated college and moved out on my own.\n\nAnyway, throughout my relationship with my fiancee we have had a series of conversations where she realized her family's flashy lifestyle wasn't typical and I realized how the other half lives. She was surprised to find I had never been camping in an RV or cabin, only tents. We didn't go out to eat except for very special occasions and her family ate out every single weekend at nice restaurants in the area - which shocked me. For most gift giving holidays, we got practical gifts and she got nice electronics. \n\nI could think of more but you get the idea. Outside of little realizations, our financial backgrounds don't really affect us because her family is liquid garbage who has disowned her (long story there) and I love my family but they live far enough away that I don't see them a ton.\n\nThe most we get out of it is I make jokes about her marrying down.\n\nEDIT: fixed some awful spelling errors\n\nEDIT 2: Since so many people have asked, I'll add a tl;dr regarding my fiancee's disownment.\n\nMy fiancee is very different from her family. She's heavier set (her mom has struggled with an eating disorder her whole life and HATES overweight people) and, worse, bisexual. To make matters worse, I'm a trans man so her mom flipped her shit when we started dating. I don't think it was ever because my family is poor. She tried to scare my fiancee away from dating me, saying I'll tarnish her sterling reputation and that she doesn't want to be one of \"those girls\". \n\nThe actual disowning was the final straw in a series of incidents that had been escalating for the past three-ish years. The short version is that it was summer, my fiancee (then girlfriend) was home from college, and I happened to have a week off from my summer camp gig. She was working at a grocery store at the time and her stepfather woke her up two hours before she had to be to work, screaming at her that she was lazy, fat, disgusting, [insert slurs against LGBT people here]...just all the things he knew would really hurt her. He followed her around the house telling her she needed to get ready in five minutes so he could take her to work or she was walking (mind you he, my fiancee, and her mom all had their own cars at this point and it's like 7am and her job is at least 10 miles away). This turned into him screaming at her to get her shit and get out so she called me and begged me to get her.\n\nI couldn't drive so my mom brought me. When I got there, she was in her work uniform in the driveway with a bundle of clothes in her arms. She was SOBBING. Her stepfather had his hand raised but dropped it when we pulled in. I had to physically restrain my mom to keep her in the car because I knew if she left there would be a brawl. Meanwhile, her mom stood on the porch, saying and doing nothing while this unfolded.\n\nShe got in the car and never went back. She lived with us while she and I finished college and now we have our own apartment together. \n\nThere's A LOT more that went on but I don't have the energy to type it all out because it was happening long before we met and is.still in anyway continuing. But it's been three years since then and her mother still tries to tell her she's lying about what happened that day but I know what I saw and I reassure her that she's not making up being kicked out. She doesn't say anything about it but she talks in her sleep and I know she still has nightmares about what happened.\n\nSo yeah. They're awful people and she's better without them. Money can't buy a family that loves you, I guess.",

She basically got what she wanted when she wanted and never had to worry about whether or not she could afford something.  When you have no reason to care, you don't.

            "I'm the poorer spouse.\n\nGrowing up, I lived off of cheap / food stamp meals, like scrambled eggs, ramen, rice, and the like. Eating at McDonald's was like going to a steakhouse to me - we rarely did it. Needless to say, though there wasn't much variety, I was in the kitchen learning how to make these small meals along with my parents before they passed away. \n\nMy wife, however, had a lot of fast food, to go, and big, home cooked meals that her mom cooked. Most of her stuff was provided, and everyone ate and had enough for seconds.\n\nWhen we moved in together in college and got married, the kitchen was mostly my domain, simply because she didn't know how to cook many meals, besides a couple of recipes from a book her mom gave her. Her go - to was \"let's get pizza!\" or \"pick up McDonald's / Bueno / etc on the way home\". Being newly weds and broke, we needed the kitchen more than being served. \n\nTeaching someone how to cook that gets stressed out if there's more than one pot going on the stove or using the oven while using the stove was... Stressful.\n\nShe's gotten better, and I enjoy cooking with her and our son. But... We all still have a long ways to go.",

Also everyone seems to have a childhood molestation story. It happened at least once to every single one of the adults in the family I married into. Two of my now-nephews have already had an event like that. Our friend's daughter as well. And it's simply because folks in poverty have no recourse. They're easy targets. The parents care just as much as any other parent but they're so overworked that there's not enough supervision.  Also, meth is a big problem in the community my spouse came from, and that makes it all much, much worse. Organized crime groups like to come into poverty stricken neighborhoods and small towns, and they use them as pawns and foot soldiers. And the cops don't give a flying fuck.

            "I don't really come from a well off family, divorced parents and whatnot. But we did always have clothes and food, and normally got brand name clothes and some expensive things from our grandparents for presents.\n\nMy girlfriend though that I've been living with for the last year came from a family of 5, all with different dads and no actually dad that stuck around. Bounced around faster care when she was really young until her grandparents took her in. But at times went without eating because there was no money, and continued to live this way as she moved out right after highschool and could just barely afford what she needed. \n\nFast toward to now, she's starting to come around to the idea that we can always buy groceries, and spend a decent amount on them if she wants. She was always super against spending any money on anything that wasn't needed, always worried about something going wrong and suddenly needing more than what we have saved up. Its been a trip trying to convince her that we're ok and we have the money that we need plus that little extra",
            "Not \"rich\" really, but I grew up firmly middle class and married an immigrant from a poor family. I was surprised at just how expensive it is to be poor. Planning ahead to limit long-term costs tends to cost more up front, and his family just didn't have enough money in a given month's budget to do that.\n\nFor example, his family would go through paper towels like crazy, and didn't own any cloth kitchen towels. At first I found this horribly wasteful, but it's because a single roll of paper towels is much cheaper than a couple of kitchen towels. Even though you'll end up paying a lot more for the many rolls of paper towels you'll go through in the time it takes the cloth towels to wear out, you just can't justify the initial expense. And it became habit, so even when they were at my house, they would reach for the paper towels. Normally a roll of paper towels lasts me a month or two because I use cloth for most things. They'd easily go through a roll or two a week.\n\nSame with pots and pans and any other durable household item - they would buy the crappy pans that only last a year or two, while I have Revere Ware pans that I inherited from my great-grandmother. They also didn't treat these items well, which caused them to wear out even faster. I'm not sure why that was, maybe just because they had every expectation of needing to replace them, so squeezing out an extra couple of months of use wasn't worth the time it takes to be careful.\n\nETA: We did have some really tight times while I was growing up, but since my mom already had a middle-class mentality going into those hard times, that translated into looking for more ways to save money - like buying second-hand kitchen towels for the cost of maybe 2 rolls of paper towels, and making things last longer (by repairing and/or treating gently) so you don't have to re-buy as often. People who are generationally poor often never learn this. And wealthier people who are just going through hard times assume they will get out of it.",

            "I remember dating a guy in high school who was overweight and had also lost some weight so had some hanging skin and fat around his midsection. He was smart, cute, floppy hair, and genuine. I had a crush on him instantly. A year later we finally ended up getting together after I asked him to my prom. He had hugged me and kissed the back of my head once but never said anything or followed up on that because he was too shy. We dated for almost a year after prom.\n\nHe complained about his weight often but I never thought about it in a negative way. I saw his struggle with it as human and relatable. I was not overweight but many girls think about the extra 5 lbs they could stand to lose, especially in high school.\n\nOne night, we were having sex and he was frustrated about his skin and fat section flopping since he was on top. It honestly wasn\u2019t something I had considered at the time, I was having sex with him, obviously I wanted to do it and nothing about him repulsed me. It made me sad that he was focused on something so negative when here was a girl in front of him enjoying herself and wanting more from him.\n\nI\u2019ll add that for many girls, the pressure to be pretty and thin is overwhelming, especially in high school. Being with someone perfect, hot, skinny, six pack, etc, puts even more pressure on you to live up to that ideal. Dating someone with flaws lets you be human too. If he\u2019s overweight, suddenly I\u2019m not obsessing about the extra five lbs. if he can love me and be attracted to me, it must mean I\u2019m pretty enough. I so desperately wish he would have felt the same way about himself.\n\nStop thinking you are \u201cless than\u201d because you are overweight. Your flaws may be what make someone comfortable enough to get to know you better and fall in love with you. Be kind, be genuine, and be yourself. Girls fall in love with personalities, not manikins.",

            "He drove me to a comic convention while my shitty ex got his new wheels mounted. He chatted with me the whole way over, bought lunch and walked all over the con with me. I had a great day. Shitty ex showed up later screaming at me on the phone about getting lost on the way over.\n\n I mentioned that I wanted to learn how to weightlift and he volunteered to teach me. So we started to meet at the gym once a week for an hour or two. He taught me how to deadlift and squat starting with the bare Olympic bar and 3 months later I was lifting close to 90 pounds. He was always kind and patient and listened when I talked and could hold a conversation. I spent my birthday weekend that year getting yelled at by Shitty ex for losing my keys and he said that wasn't right.\n\nA few months after that, I dumped the Shitty ex and started dating him. We saw Guardians of the Galaxy while Shitty ex sabotaged my car and he paid to fix it.  We went hiking while Shitty ex blew up his phone. He sat with me through the restraining order hearing, and the calls to the police for the revenge porn. He bought my mom flowers.\n\nHe sold his Magic the Gathering collection to buy a house, took me to Disneyland and proposed. We got married. He is supporting me through school (six months left!) and has never stopped encouraging me, even when I came home crying and wanted to give up. He tells me I am beautiful and loved every day.\n\nHe also does a great Bane voice...very sexy when I stop laughing.\n\nEdit: And just to clarify since incel trolls do such a great job at assuming bullshit. I spent the afternoon at the con with him, Shitty ex showed up that evening and stayed at the hotel I paid for along with another friend. We were all in the same social circle for a few years. Shitty ex was chronically unemployed and living with me rent free at the time but maybe he was a diamond in the rough? I'm sure the subsequent misdemeanor conviction has only improved his prospects. \n\nHusband bought the house (its actually in his name only) before he proposed and we enjoyed a pretty comfy DINK lifestyle for two years before the opportunity to go back to school arose and he encouraged me to take it. He's thinking of going back to school himself in a few years and I will be able to return the favor. That's what partners do, encourage and support each other. \n\nBut still, it was the Bane voice that did it for me, it's a panty dropper.",
            "About to become a wife of gamer after 4 years of dating. I myself, have played a total of 10 hours of video games in my life. I am terrible at it and it doesn't interest me. However, my fiance loves it, and spend lots of time in evenings and on weekends trying new games and playing with friends.\n\nThe truth is, it isn't about the games and I am sorry if a woman has made you feel that way. Finding someone who supports your hobbies (in a healthly manner) is important. I like watching documentaries, swimming laps and following fashion brands and going to weird art shows and my soon to be husband supports all of that. I will ask about new games, the people he watches on twitch and if he is winning etc. Because I love him and I like seeing him happy.\n\nPlease, take care of yourself, dress like you care about what your wearing (doesn't have to be expensive) and make sure it is clean. A Sharply dressed man can make a women go weak in the knees regardless of his stature.\n\nEdit: WOW, you GUYS... I am so blown away by all the nice, thoughtful comments here. I have a rare case of the internet warm fuzzies. A few things:\n\nyes, it was a zztop reference but I think it holds up. Suits are basically male lingerie.\n\nAs a female in tech, I am not knocking comfort, I get it, you like your tracksuits and large sweaters BUT buying clothes that fit you (I recommend thiftstore shopping as well) make a world of difference. Also, clean and press them or steam them or really anything that doesn't make you a wrinkled mess. You can wear bargain basement shirts, but if they are pressed and wrinkle free. Seriously, it looks really really nice. I took this question at face value, and answered at the end that I like a sharply dressed man. I mean you wanted to me to do stuff to 'ya right?  A fresh haircut and  crisp button up is about all it takes.\n\nLastly, I am getting a lot of pointed comments about gaming, gaming culture and me not supporting my man by asking if he is winning. You all need to calm down. If only you knew that I called one game he plays \"Fire Hands\" exclusively.\n\nI urge you all, to spend time with you SOs doing things that aren't either of your hobbies. And go outside I hear trees are pretty cool. (My fiance and I both need to be better about that)\n\n2nd Edit: The gold and silver are wayyy too much. seriously thank you.",

            "Honestly dude, I\u2019m an overweight gamer guy and women tend to like me, but I\u2019m going to give you the same advice I would give anyone looking for love.\n\n1) be yourself- I know it\u2019s bullshit, but fuck off. I\u2019m done with pretending to be other people, if she doesn\u2019t like you the way you are; she\u2019s not worth your time.\n\n2) shoot your shot, and stand by it. If you\u2019re unsure, they\u2019re unsure. Be bold, be committed. Yeah you may fall on your ass but if she says no, see tip no. 1. But don\u2019t wait around. You need to take command or the opportunity will slip away. \n\n3) demonstrate value- buy her a drink, help her with her computer, make her laugh, show your strengths. But have the confidence to feel like you can also deny help if she seems to be using you. \n\n4) Be the best you, don\u2019t focus on your weaknesses. You may be overweight but try to put effort into your appearance. Work towards being a person people like, people find charming. Overweight doesn\u2019t mean ugly, but it can effect your self esteem, which no one finds attractive. Own your look, own your voice, be happy as you are and don\u2019t let the other people bring you down.",

            "Not a lady, but I am a really overweight gamer with a super cute girlfriend.\n\nThing is, being a gamer doesn't define what I am. All my conversations don't revolve around gaming, neither do my hobbies. And yet, I am a fierce gamer, but there is a time, place and priorities for everything. If gaming defines what you are and is your whole life from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep, if nothing else interests you in life, **that** may be your problem right there.",
            "Asking the wrong question, my friend. \n\nIt took my husband years of actual, IRL friendship for me to even consider dating him. During that time he demonstrated through his actions to me, but more importantly to everyone we knew, that he is caring, thoughtful, responsible, resourceful, funny, clever, and respectful. At every turn, he proved that he was a man of integrity. \n\nAnd I still turned him down when he asked me out. At which point he remained all of those things, most especially respectful. He was crushed, but he backed off, and respected my decision. We remained friends.\n\nEventually, I had an epiphany of my own. I told him I didn't want to live my life without him in it. We started dating soon after and have now been married almost 9 years. \n\nBecause when I'm looking for a relationship, I'm looking for a man whose life I want to share. And if you're not living that life, it doesn't matter how sexy you are or aren't.",
            "Can I just ask.... Do you happen to be over weight and play video games? Because I'll tell you nothing makes me want to surf my way through the web to a man then making an askreddit post like this. Woof",
            "Assuming this is a legit question...\n\nAs an overweight gamer myself with the same SO for the last 4 years or so... I'ma be real. It's an uphill battle. But it's not impossible. I'm gonna ignore the \"one thing\" part because that doesn't exist and if you don't know that already, then you need to take a long look at yourself.\n\nFirst off, be clean. Be fucking clean. Shower daily, wear extra deodorant (Because, my dude, we need it), keep your place clean and tidy, and make sure your desk is organized. Wear clean clothes, do laundry often, don't wear boxers more than one day, wash your hands, brush your teeth and hair, do all the things. Be fucking clean cause if we start building any kinda stank, that shit will cling. \n\nMake an effort to lose weight. Maybe it's a medical condition, or maybe it's eating too much. But just being chunky and doing nothing about it looks bad and sounds bad. If you're at least making an effort, it shows a desire to be healthy. And that works wonders. I bought a Ring Fit a couple months ago, and even though I haven't lost much (Fucking love food man) the attitude I have about giving it a shot has definitely made my SO more attracted to me.\n\nHave some nice clothes. Not expensive, just nice. If you have a female friend who is willing to go shopping with you and help you find a couple things, that's a bonus. Video game T's and sweatpants are A+ when it comes to a gaming binge, but they earn you 0 points in appearance. Leave that shit for when you're alone. Going to the grocery store? Throw on a plaid shirt over a V-neck with some fitting jeans. Easy shit. \n\nLastly, don't be a douche. \"I'm a nice guy but girls don't like me\" means you're not a nice guy. If you're shy and don't talk, that's one thing. But if you actively try and fail to get a girl to chat with you, you're not as \"nice\" a guy as you think. If you have caught yourself saying something like \"girls don't like nice guys\" then go work customer service for a couple years, learn how to treat people like people, and then try again.",

Plus the literal warmth that emanates from him is what keeps my cold-blooded ass alive.\n\nIf I'm gonna be honest, my love for him as a friend came first and when I realized how comfortable I was around him and how sweet and genuine he was, then came physical attraction afterwards",

I don't work in an office (my wife does which is where this complaint came from) but if I did I would personally benefit from having oversight and lack of distractions.

From how I see it, this was gonna start happening either way because it\u2019s usually teenagers and young adults and we\u2019re all insecure and scared that the people we like don\u2019t like us back, phones or no.  Still, it\u2019s very stressful and the best way to stop it is to break the cycle.

This is what makes it so hard to detect. Kids are always bruised, stinky, and secretive. What's important is to keep an open mind, and sort of observe a pattern of signs and behaviors.

The first is when people try really hard to be polite but you can (pre masks) see them smirking and trying their hardest not to laugh. The second are the patients that I\u2019ve seen either in clinic a few times or as an inpatient on multiple days who you can see come to the realization mid thought and their expression change, usually I say something along the lines of \u201cname?\u201d and they laugh.

In fact, it\u2019s been estimated to be about the 6th time they had broken into the DNC offices. The goal of that particular break-in was to repair a bugging device that had been placed at a previous beak in and had stopped working.\n\nThe CREEP had gone so far as to plant Nixon loyalists in the DNC. The objective was to discredit Ed Muskie, the early democratic front runner who was destroying Nixon in the polls. Nixon wanted to run against McGovern, a far-left fringe democratic who was essentially unelectable. Muskie\u2019s campaign limo driver was a Nixon plant and who was leaking intel from overheard conversations. Other \u201cstaff\u201d reproduced confidential documents and handed them over to the White House. This was electoral fraud on a wholesale level. He got busted for a coverup related to a minor break-in, but in fact a very real, massive conspiracy was in wide operation that gets more or less glossed over in the retelling.",

She passed away from a brain tumor when she was 5, and as a way to cope I started buying those seasonal decorations and now decorate my house with them as the seasons and holidays change. Her favorite were these colorful birds from Target. A couple of years ago just before Easter I was deep cleaning the house. One of the Easter birds went missing. I assumed one of my older kids had knocked it off the shelf with their backpack as they had left for school that morning. I looked around where it should have a fallen, but couldn't find it. We had a younger dog who loved to chew up everything he could find. I checked all his usual hiding spots, but couldn't find it. I continued to clean the house: vacuum, dust, full top to bottom cleaning of the common areas of the house since I was home alone for the day. Finally I'm done and still haven't found that bird. I've found a lot of missing socks, legos, and other crap! I grab my cleaning stuff and say out loud, \"[Daughter] it's ok if you're playing with it, but will you let me know somehow so that I know the dog didn't destroy it.\" I walk out of the living room and put the cleaning stuff away under the kitchen sink. I come back into the living room and there that bird is! It is standing on its feet in the center on the living room floor. These birds have pipe cleaner like feet, so they were difficult to get to stand right, and it is standing on its feet. I got a chill. I picked it up and looked it over. There weren't anything teeth marks or slobber, so it hadn't been in the dog's mouth. I just said, \"Thanks [daughter]. You're welcome to play with it whenever you want,\" and put it back on the shelf. I have no way to explain it other than the paranormal.",

            "Former Egyptian Airforce Mirage 2000 pilot here, I was one of the \u201cunlucky few\u201d that got selected to serve their mandatory years as pilots, it was considered unlucky because you stayed in the army alot longer than soldiers and officers because of the amount of training that comes with flying a fighter jet, anyway fast forward 2 years I\u2019m a fully trained mirage pilot though I don\u2019t know much about dogfighting and fighter jet weapons as I didn\u2019t take it on full time like I said this was mandatory service that everyone had to do, it\u2019s just I was selected to be a pilot for some reason, I only flew like 6 times in the 3 and a half years I served.\n\n Anyways picture this, it\u2019s a pitch black night and I go out for patrol on the Red Sea border between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. My friend is commanded to patrol the border on Sinai and Israel (that\u2019s usually the most actively patrolled border). Anyway here I am flying in Egyptian airspace when an extremely bright light shone through the cockpit almost blinding me for a moment, it was so bright it got right through the tinting on the windows and my helmet, it was almost like that memory wiper in MIB it lasted atleast a minute, so just as I\u2019m about to call this in to get a possible explanation the air tower guy starts frantically sort of shouting but not loudly like he\u2019s talking really fast and in a very worried tone and I can\u2019t hear him through the radio that well so I couldn\u2019t tell what he was saying, I tuned into the frequency the other pilots were on and they were all just as shaken as me. \n\n30 minutes later a calmer voice instructs us to all land immediately as there is an emergency being investigated by the more experienced pilots (dogfighters). So we land two at a time, I steer my plane into the hanger and I get out, everyone has this frightened look on their face eyes wide open, mouth shut and sort of lost. Like you talk to them and they\u2019re like \u201csorry what were you saying again?\u201d, So I go straight to the base commander hoping for an explanation that puts my mind to ease, when I get there I find that he\u2019s in his office on the phone shouting about unidentifiable aircrafts infiltrating Egyptian airspace and that\u2019s when I really got scared. \n\nI have finished my mandatory service years ago now and I\u2019m currently studying law in Washington but that night I constantly think about.",

After I refused to let him in, his facial expression inverted; as if he just realized something horrible. He let go of my car, said something to the effect of \"you're one of them, aren't you?\" Then he ran away behind the gas station and into the woods. Full suit and tie, nice shoes, extremely frantic in nature, zero explanation.

            "I was taking a trip with my then-girlfriend and we had to cross the Hudson River to get to where we were going. There are only a handful of bridges across, and I know them all from having grown up in the area. \n\nOn that particular trip we were supposed to take The Bear Mountain Bridge, but I got off the wrong exit and passed it. We decided it wasn't a big deal. The next bridge, The Newburgh-Beacon, was actually closer to where we were going. It would just bring us over little bit past our destination, but not enough to really matter. So we kept on driving, not really paying specific attention to where we were since it was probably 20 - 30 mins until we got there. \n\nWell, we never crossed the Newburgh-Beacon that day. We also never crossed the Bear Mountain. And we certainly didn't drive an extra half an hour to the Mid Hudson or turn around and go back to the Tap. When we did take a minute to check where we were, and how close the bridge was, we found we were already on the other side of the river. No bridge, we were just already there.\n\nSo either there's a secret tunnel somewhere under the river, we had our memories erased, or we found some kind of spatial rift somewhere in the Hudson Valley.",

I was born in a hospital... but the house my family lived in for 2 years prior to my birth, that we all moved out of when I was 7 or 8 months old.\n\nAt first I thought maybe my brain got it from pictures I had seen, but honestly the level of detail wasn't shown in any pictures we had of me at such a young age. Mostly they were closeups, so you couldn't really see the background much.

I saw three shadows on the wall but there was nothing to explain how the three \"human\" shadows were there. It was just really creepy and I got really bad vibes.

            "I was an RA when I was in college. All the RAs would come back a week before the winter semester started for training, which meant no students were back in the dorms - we were the only ones in the building. One night, I heard the door to my shared bathroom open. The sound of the doorknob turning woke me up, so I kind of groggily said my suitemate's name (she would sometimes come through the bathroom to talk or ask me for advice). Then I realized - my suitemate was on an extended holiday in Italy, so no one should have been in our suite at all. I immediately shot up and looked toward the bathroom door. It was almost pitch black in my room, but next to the bathroom door, I could see the perfect outline of a human face wearing a flat-brimmed hat - I couldn't see the details of the face, but I could see shadows where the eyes, mouth, and nose would have been. It was as if someone was standing next to the door, staring at me. I had no idea what to do - because no one was back in the dorms, I knew that the nearest RA was two floors away and wouldn't hear me scream for help. I stared at the face for a few seconds (and it stared back), then I shifted slightly on the bed and it completely disappeared. I got up to check the door, and it had been closed the whole time. \n\nIt's been almost 7 years and it still freaks me out when I think about it.",
            "*EDIT: sleep paralysis could probably be the closest explanation, but I should mention I was extremely aware and awake when I went to bed. I also know I hadn\u2019t fallen asleep as I was about 2 minutes into a Coldplay song and had it paused right at that moment when it started, as well as that I was moving around my bed and stood up at one point. Can also confirm it wasn\u2019t wind, wasn\u2019t at all a windy night (I wished it was). We did pretty much put it down to a kangaroo or something at the time, because there was plenty of nature around the house, but I would have heard whatever it was leave the bathroom. Also, I guess I can\u2019t really get it across strong enough via text, but it was something doing it very purposefully, especially opening the bathroom door.*\n\nNot so much something I saw (in hindsight, thank fuck), but rather something I heard that I can\u2019t explain. I was staying at my dad\u2019s place for the weekend when I was about 16 and he lived out of town in rural Australia, the kind of place you don\u2019t lock doors etc. The house was pretty long, with my dad\u2019s room being right at the front of the house in a loft style second floor, and my room was literally down the other end of the house, I would say about 20 metres away down the end of a hallway with a few other rooms and bathroom on the way. \n\nIt was just he and I there that weekend and I stayed up late on the computer and went to bed about 2am, got into bed and started listening to music to go to sleep to. About 2 minutes in, I hear the door at the end of the hall SLAM shut, and I had not closed it. I immediately take my earphones out and went to call out thinking it was my dad when a bedroom door right next to it opened (no one occupied that room at this time) and I immediately got that shaky shiver feeling all through my body, knowing something wasn\u2019t right and assuming someone had broken in. After about 30 seconds or so of silence, I hear a loud thud on the wooden hallway floor, like a stomp. After about 5 seconds, it happens again, and again, again, it was in a rhythm. About halfway down the hall to my bedroom, there was a little bit off the side where the bathroom was, which had an old wooden sliding door that was extremely loud to open and close. After about 30 seconds of the stomping in the hall stopping (at this point I was nearly throwing up from fear) - the bathroom door was reefed open with all the strength you could imagine, like how you would imagine someone to do it in a complete and utter rage. I sat there completely paralyzed, thinking \u2018my room is the next stop\u2019. I sat, waited, and nothing. I literally sat up in my bed until the sun came up at which point I ran up to my dad\u2019s room to explain what had happened. We go through the house and nothing, nothing out of place, all the doors shut (which he had actually locked all but one). My dad said he did not come down and he has never been known to sleep walk or anything in his life.\n\nI have never been able to come up with a rational explanation of what happened that night - I\u2019m not someone that is much of a believer in ghosts or anything, but that night I just had a feeling that whatever was out there wasn\u2019t exactly human. I still don\u2019t know who/what that could have been and why I didn\u2019t hear anything after the bathroom door being ripped open.

Further down the road, we both get into the turn lane to turn left onto a long, straight road with open fields on either side. The car in front of me turns onto this road and I wait for a car to pass, and then turn as well. It takes less than 5 seconds. However, when I turn onto the road, the car that had been driving in front of me was nowhere to be seen. This road has no turn offs and it\u2019s long and straight so you can see pretty far ahead of you. The car had just vanished and I still think about it today. I have a dash cam now but I wish I had had one back then because I question what actually happened that day.\n\nEdit: I am 100% sure the car didn\u2019t do a u-turn. The roads are really narrow, so they wouldn\u2019t have been able to complete the u-turn without having to make it a 3 point turn or drive partly in the field. I also would\u2019ve noticed because while there was enough time to complete a 90 degree turn in front of the car that was coming from the other direction, there was nowhere near enough time to complete a 180 degree turn without either causing a wreck or something.\n\nAfter I turned onto this road and noticed the car was no longer in front of me, I looked all around me and could see the other car driving away behind me but the car that looked like mine was nowhere to be seen. There was nowhere on that road where the car could\u2019ve pulled off or I would\u2019ve seen it. It was still very light outside (around 6:30 in June) and the road was surrounded by cotton fields, I believe, which do not grow high enough to cover a car.\n\nI have gone through every possible explanation and there just isn\u2019t a logical one!",

My bedroom had several large windows that looked out into the forest. \n\nI don\u2019t remember having curtains or blinds but I\u2019m sure I must have, because my mother never forgot details like that when decorating my bedrooms as a child, but I must have left them open one night.\n\nI remember waking up in darkness, with a faint glowing orb of light hovering just outside my window. I watched it in utter terror as it went slowly across one window, and then the next - before pausing, flashing briefly into my bedroom, before shifting into the third and final window and disappearing altogether.

It was terrifying and I remember that everything would suddenly get really dark around me and I couldn\u2019t move or speak.  It felt like I was suffocating and I would fight it (all internally) until it would abruptly ease up.   I started sleeping with a light on as it seemed less likely to happen when I did.   I moved out and tried to not think too much about it as it gave me an icky feeling.   I never told my family about this as I felt they would think I was crazy (there\u2019s some mental illness in the family).   Years later as I was talking to an older relative, she casually mentioned that my SIL used to live there in the exact same apartment shortly before marrying my brother; but that she\u2019d moved out pretty quickly.  I remembered that it was a fairly nice apartment and asked about why.   My SIL had felt like she was being awakened by something and kept finding her stuff moved.  About 8 years later, the relative that owned the apartment asked me to retrieve something from it.  It had been vacant for years and was being used for storage.   I took my daughter with me and my normally extremely talkative child was very quiet the whole time.  We got in and out of there fairly quickly.  That night as we were talking, I mentioned to her that it had been my first apartment.  She asked if I\u2019d been scared and then blurted out that she\u2019d seen something large and black on the ceiling that seemed to be sucking all the light out of the surrounding area.  \n\nI\u2019m usually skeptical about the paranormal and believe that most incidents can be shrugged off; but there\u2019s something about that vacant, decaying apartment that still terrifies me.",

Why are you hanging out with this kid? He\u2019s bad news. I really think the next time you want to hang out with him. Think twice.\u201d\n\nSo the following Friday he said he was going to pick me up and we were going to pick up some booze and hang out with these chicks. I told him unfortunately I can\u2019t tonight. I have to stay in tonight. That night he was in a high speed chase and lost control of his vehicle and hit a curb, his car went straight into an apartment building and he died instantly. \n\nSomehow, I ended up running into that police officer again a few weeks later. Which she made a joke that\u2019s it not good if she keeps seeing me. I literally busted in to tears and just hugged her. I feel like she saved my life. She seemed somewhat confused and I told her what happened. \n\nThank you for reading! This really shock me at a young age.",

For some reason, we actually came with him and we ate at this 24/7 joint, where he told us about his adventures around the world, showed pictures, etc. \n\nWe hung out until it was around 5 am and walked home together.\n\nI have no idea who he fucking was.

            "I am really not spiritual or have any belief in psychics, ghosts, mind-reading, fortune telling...any of that. But, only a couple weeks ago there was an exchange that shook me a bit.\n\nI'd taken the train out to do a hiking trail and camp for a few days, finishing up in a town I'd only ever briefly visited once a couple years prior on bonfire night. As I made my way towards the station I was stopped by a perfectly ordinary looking middle aged woman.\n\n\"You don't believe in souls\" She said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You don't believe in souls. But you also know you lost yours\"\n\n\"What do you mean.\"\n\n\"You have absolutely no aura\"\n\nI started to walk away and she just raised her voice to shout after me.\n\n\"You had a procedure, a medical procedure, on your brain and your soul left.\"\n\nOf course it sounded like madwoman bullshit to anyone that could hear, but fifteen years ago when I was eighteen I had sixteen sessions of ECT.  Being a large number of sessions in a short space of time at an young age, it left many difficult and long lasting negative effects on me that I still struggle with. \n\nBut one of the most pervasive feelings is what I have only ever been able to describe as whatever it was that made me me. Like the essence of me, my spark, had disappeared. I never really knew how to put this feeling into any accurate words, so despite my lack of belief, I'd always described it as feeling like I'd had my soul removed.",
            "I was driving one night in a really foul mood and speeding. Like when I say speeding I mean at least 25 over the limit. \n\nAnyway this car gets behind me and for some reason I can just tell it wasn\u2019t a cop. It was a full tinted Chevy truck with weird lights on it (like comically large after market front headlights). Once it got behind me I got a really eerie feeling I can\u2019t explain. Like my body just *knew* something was wrong. \n\nAnyway I figured if it was a cop they would light me up for speeding but for some reason they just kept pace with me, also speeding themselves. So at this point I\u2019m getting a little weirded out so I turn off the freeway and they follow me. \n\nI turn into a gas station and get out. I figure if I\u2019m going to get ax murdered at least the cameras will pick it up and give my family some closure. Something just didn\u2019t sit right with me. I knew something was up. \n\nAs I\u2019m getting out of my car the truck rolls it\u2019s windows down. And what I saw still haunts me to this day. It was a heavily disfigured guy the only likes of which I can compare to that guy Rocky Dennis from the movie about the guy with a crazy disfigured head who falls for that girl who loves him for him and not the abomination that is his face. And he starts to motion me with his finger like telling me to come closer. I don\u2019t care if he was going to give me the winning powerball numbers there was no way in hell I was going to approach his car. \n\nI bolt inside the gas station at this point my whole body is shaking. I try and tell the clerk what\u2019s going on as they stare at me probably thinking I\u2019m drunk or high off my ass as my story doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nI go to look outside and the truck is gone. \n\nI still have nightmares to this day.",
            "Fall 2009 I was sick - like superrrrrr sick.  It was a few weeks before my amputation and I was battling a severe bone infection.  I was hopped on all kinds of antibiotics (I had a PICC line and would dose my antibiotics through these little balls) and pain medication.  I'm a huge Yankee fan so my best friend got us tickets for the ALCS game at Yankee stadium.  She pushed me around the stadium in a wheelchair with a shitton of blankets on me (it was freezing) just to put a smile on my face.\n\nMy friend leaves our seats to go get some hotdogs and stuff.  This is where it gets weird.\n\nAs soon as she leaves (to my recollection) an older Irish gentleman sits by me.  He offers me some of his spiked hot chocolate, but I said no thanks and explained that I was on a lot of medication.  We begin talking and I told to him what was going on with my life. He asked if I was scared to have my leg amputated, and I told him that I was.  I was really frightened of the unknown.  He gave me some pretty valuable life advice and comforted me.  He assured me that it would be fine. He told me that, \"if you have to be an amputee, try to be the best damn amputee that there is!\"\n\nMy friend comes back with food and asks who I was talking to. There's no one next to me.  I guess I must've hallucinated this but idk..it felt more like some kind of angel or being that came to me to let me know it would be okay.\n\nI guess my guardian angel is an Irishman with spiked hot chocolate!\n\nETA: Not sure if this makes it more creepy or not but the Yankees were playing the Angels in that series!",
            "A tiny humanoid creature underwater.\n\nTo this day i still search the internet in hopes that what i saw was an actual type of fish but i still havnt found anything. I was snorkelling at the age of 16 off the coast of Australia with my Dad. Seeing all the fish was so beautiful. My Dad drifted a little far from me but there was a reef protecting us from any large sharks so I wasn\u2019t scared of snorkelling on my own. I swam down towards the coral to get a closer look at a small octopus when something caught my eye. A human face. A human face with an eerie smile and big eyes. It was sort of \u201cstanding\u201d casually leaning against the coral with a body about 4 inches tall and head no bigger than a grape. It resembled a naked human male but had gils by its neck and webbed feet. Smooth all over like a ken doll. I stared at him. He stared at me. I stared back and tried to rationalise what i was seeing. I reached out to touch him/it and he casually evaded me by stepping to the side, all while his creepy smile remained. I could see my Dad has turned around and was swimming closer to me. So i called him over to see this crazy creature. The creature turned toward where my Dad was swimming over, seemed to notice him, then look back at me coyly. Then it walked away. Like walked on its little webbed feet on the coral and disappeared down through a little whole on the rocks. I tried explaining to my Dad when he came over but he couldn\u2019t explain anything like that either. He just said something about Aboriginal spirits and i shouldn\u2019t mess with it. \n\nI swear i think about that little fish man every day.\n\nOkay I was going to wait until tomorrow to draw this fucker but i actually could not sleep until i got him/it out of my head. This is the best i could do. It\u2019s goofy looking but still sends chills down my spine to remember:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/J7m7kPo",
            "When I was in my 20s in the early 1990s I had a car accident that kept me in hospital for about a year. It was a Catholic hospital and most of the nursing staff were nuns and besides the normal checks they regularly just stopped in to chat and see how I was doing. \n\nEarly one morning there was a knock and this nun came in that I hadn\u2019t seen before and introduced herself as Sister Greta, a member of the nursing staff. She sat on the side of the bed and we spoke for a few minutes then she asked if she could say a prayer for me. She held my hand and said a prayer then wished me well and left. \n\nAbout five minutes later there was another knock and one of the regular sisters came in to say hi. I remarked it was going to be a good day because I\u2019d already had one visit from Sister Greta and now I was getting another one. She said there wasn\u2019t a Sister Greta on the staff and there was only two sisters around, it being so early. I pointed to the bed which clearly showed where she had been sitting and described her and the habit she had been wearing now getting a bit unnerved. The sister basically shrugged and bustled off. \n\nShe came back about half an hour later with a book about the hospital\u2019s history and showed me a picture of some nuns from the 50s. Their habits were exactly the same as Sister Greta\u2019s that I\u2019d described. Turns out that patients regularly mentioned talking to nuns in old garb that definitely weren\u2019t part of the current staff. \n\nI never saw her again or anything similar while I was there... kinda freaky but not overly disturbing. I can\u2019t really explain it but I guess it\u2019s the sort of ghost story I\u2019m okay with, if that\u2019s what it was.\n\nEdit: Okay heaps of cool questions that I\u2019ll reply to but a couple of common ones...\n\nNo, I\u2019m not religious by any stretch. I believe in getting a good nights sleep, steak, and the love of a good woman (or man, or what whatever lights your candle). I made some belief calls in my mid-teens and have stuck to them. \n\nNope, not once did anyone try and save or convert me. In fact, my Father marked the the \u2018Religion\u2019 question as N/A on the admission documents and neither of us were ever questioned on it. If a prayer was ever said, I was asked first if that was okay and, a few times, I did decline. Trust me, when you have been assisted to shit while lying down on your back with your legs in traction and experienced the clean up operation afterwards, it takes some time to want company again. \n\nThe first few weeks I WAS on meds... morphine and tramadol being the options on the menu. They bunged me up (see bedpan comments above) and the docs warned me about dependency so, with the exception of post surgical relief, it was Panadol, Disprin, and Doxipol (so).\n\nIf I remember right, the sisters all lived on the top floor of the hospital so, technically yes, there was someone living in the attic :)\n\nCould the nuns have been pranking me? Absolutely. Despite perceptions they are a funny bunch, enjoy a good laugh, read comics and watch Star Wars. Only, there was never a \u201cHa, we got you!\u201d\n\nYup, it absolutely could have been a hallucination (ignoring the bum imprint on the bed), and yup it absolutely could have been sleep paralysis, and yup I absolutely could have actually dreamed it all. But OP asked what strange stuff had happened that I couldn\u2019t explain. \n\nNo, I don\u2019t think she was Cthulhu or one of his followers but I\u2019ve been wrong about such things before :)\n\nEdit: So a few more things...\n\nI\u2019m originally from, and this happened, in Zimbabwe. The hospital is called Mater Dei and no, I haven\u2019t found any record of a Sister Greta working there. \n\nThe quick summary of what happened was that I was asleep in the back of a pickup on the way back from a rugby tournament. We had a head on with a drunk driver and I went through the back of the cab, the windscreen, hit the other car and ended up in the Bush some metres away. Multiple internal injuries (lacerated liver, kidney damage and collapsed lung), broken bones (ribs, jaw, collarbone, hip), and three crushed vertebrae (T12, L1, L2). The spinal cord was intact but compressed hence the lack of feeling and movement from my mid-torso down. The surgeries were to wire shit like my jaw up, decompress and remove bone fragments from my spinal column and fuse the fecked vertebrae. I am now 2inches shorter than I was and have a curve on my back that Quasimodo would be proud of. Despite this, I was the lucky one and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that. \n\nThis being where it was, insurance and medical aid were really not much use. My dad paid most of the bills by emptying his savings and taking out a loan, and the rugby community pitched in as well. The hospital trust waived a bunch of the cost too. It was a prick of a thing money-wise but I have managed to pay back or pay forward it all. \n\nI don\u2019t quite get the \u2018nun plays a wild prank to raise money\u2019 thing but okay :) I was never asked for money other than the bills which they let us to pay over, literally, years.  I also don\u2019t quite get the \u2018nun plays a wild prank to convert souls\u2019... some morphine in my drip and a tart in a robe with a halo would have worked way better and that\u2019s just off the top of my head. There was NO attempt to save my soul... none. Last thing about this - being a nurse (or any other medical job) is a nasty, hard, selfless, and rewardless job from what I saw and yet that is what they did. They cleaned up my shit, they helped me vomit, they sat while I cried my heart out for my friends and for my own future, they patiently put up with me when I got ranty and ravy, they found me blood when I needed it (because I have a stupid blood type), and they never ever told me to pray, look to God, count my blessings, thank the saints or anything like that. THEY asked THEIR God to help and then let me lean on them. \n\nAnyone calling bullshit, good on yer. I wouldn\u2019t believe it either and thats cool, opinion is a wonderful thing. \n\nOkay, way too many of you are worried by some inside knowledge I may have on Cthulhu. I don\u2019t, I just accidentally holidayed at R\u2019lyeh one year and let\u2019s just say the brochures didn\u2019t match the experience.",

            "It\u2019s a thing that happened to me firsthand:\n\nAs a kid I went to the kitchen downstairs late at night to get some snacks for midnight gaming. There was this bowl of candy on top of a shelf that my parents didn\u2019t think I knew about so I grab a chair and had to stand on my toes to reach it. The bowl slipped from on top the shelf onto the floor and I held my ears knowing there would be a sound of shattering glass in the middle of the nights silence and I thought my parents would wake up and be mad at me. But there was no sound and no trace of the glass bowl or any candy at all on the floor. I was so flundered so I just sat on the chair staring at the floor for a while before going back to my room wondering what the hell just happened. A few days later my mom was looking for the bowl but it was nowhere to be found and I never told anyone as they would just think I was crazy.\n\nEdit: Wow! First time I get this many upvotes! Thanks guys! I don\u2019t know how awards work but I see that I got one. If it means you spent money to give it to me; I am thankful.

            "I was a sophomore in college. I walked in to my math class like any other day and sat in my usual spot...about 4 seats in on the third row. Even though we didn't have assigned seats, there was always a girl sitting two seats to the left of me (empty seat between us), and her male friend to her left. They seemed to just be good friends, always laughing, never any reason to give me concern.\n\nThis day in particular, I sat down, got my spiral and pencil out, and just quietly sat there looking forward and thinking about what I was going to do after class. Suddenly, I got this eerie feeling, I looked up to my left, and my heart practically stopped. The girl was staring straight at me, blank face, and her eyes were shining like a bright, piercing electric blue. Shining like lasers. Nothing at all natural. I can't explain accurately. I was basically paralyzed and couldn't move or say anything. I eventually blinked and looked forward, then looked back and the girl's head was turned back to her friend as he was talking again.\n\nAbout 2 years later, I was with friends and we were driving to a restaurant. Traffic was building up since it was rush hour and were were stopped in the right lane. I'm in the back seat and I happen to look up, diagonally to the left, and through the windshield. I look into the car sitting in the lane next us - its back bumper is parallel to our front bumper so I can see the driver easily. He's turned almost completely around and looking back at ME, staring intensely. Even from that distance, I could see his eyes were that piercing, bright, laser-like blue and I froze again. Just like the last incident, I was eventually able to blink, look away, and then immediatley look back. The man was turned forward, the light turned green, and we all started moving forward. \n\nIt's been about 15 years and I haven't experienced anything like that again, but it fucked with my mind for a while.",

            "When I worked in the medical field, I had a dream one night about a patient of mine, a very kind elderly woman, whom I visited once or twice a week. In the dream she came to me, dancing, and called out to me that she wasn't hurting any more. I was so happy watching her dance after seeing her decline for years. \nWhen I got to work the next morning, I told my coworkers about the dream and later that morning we got the call from her daughter that she had passed away the night before. I cannot explain that, but I am glad I had told my coworkers about it before the call and not after otherwise they'd never have believed me.

So one night while my dad's away on business we both hear \"hey guys\" in my dad's voice and we both say \"hey\" back thinking he came home early.

We had just watched a horror movie as well so we were definitely in that spooky mood.\n\nDuring our drive home out of the city (I lived in the country) we counted 3 cars pulled over in different areas on the road. As we get onto the highway we count about 8 more, in various locations, all a decent distance apart, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re yielding to an ambulance or something like that. We get about halfway to my house and we ended up counting a total of 12 cars before my friend freaks out and begs me to take a back road. He was convinced it was a sign that we may get in a collision or a road accident of some kind. We were silent the rest of the ride home.\n\nI\u2019ve brought it up to him once or twice since then and he\u2019s gets really defensive and shuts it down immediately. It really bothered him.

I had never met her dog and she doesn\u2019t talk much about it, she just mentioned she had one. She answered that he is ageing but well. We moved on but I couldn\u2019t shake a weird feeling. Anyway, she goes home the next day and calls me after a while. She asked, Why did you ask about my dog yesterday ? how did you know? He passed away last night, around the same time you asked about him. I was both shocked and unsurprised at the same time. I don\u2019t have an explanation, it\u2019s seems like a weird coincidence since her dog was not something usually on my mind. It never happened to me again.",

            "Not sure if it's really seeing, but I had two experiences a couple of years apart that still spook me a little.\n\nFirst one was at university. Me and my friend were up talking, about to go to a pool hall to watch the wrestling on TV. We didn't have the channels on our dorm TV and it was on late at night (UK).\n\nWe were sober, pretty happily chatting away to each other, having a nice time, but the moment we step outside, there's this horrible feeling of dread.\n\nIt's like a crushing feeling of despair. Makes the air feel really cold - I mean, it was cold anyway, but in a different way - a bit suffocating.\n\nThe conversation dries up immediately as we walk down the street, but it takes a minute of us walking in silence for me to say to my mate, \"Air's a bit thick tonight, isn't it?\"\n\nHe looks at me, wide-eyed, and says, \"You feel it too?\"\n\nHe was a spiritualist - not something I believe in, but to each their own - and he remarks how it feels like death and how it's close. Not what you want to hear at 2am on a cold February morning in the middle of a city, but the moment passes. We get to the pool hall, go inside and forget it happened.\n\nUntil a few days later. I'm walking back to the halls/dorms and there's a police cordon by an abandoned building me and my friend walked past that night. I ask around when I get back and apparently a few homeless people froze to death in the building, and have likely been dead for a few days.\n\nI don't know. Could just be paranoia or something, but still makes me think several years later.\n\nSecond one is less tangible, but I remember it provoked worse feelings. Basically, I was holidaying in Central Europe with my friends. We weren't in a particularly bad area, it was a place by a large lake. Hostels and resorts and all sorts, so it was touristy.\n\nAnyway, we go walking outside of the main town, looking for somewhere nice to eat. We end up in this strange suburb, a bit lost. While we're walking, the feeling that I had that night at university gets stronger. I'm with different mates here, so I'm the only one that seems to notice, but the feeling gets worse and worse, to the point where I just wanted to break down and cry. It's tough to describe, but it was that same feeling of despair, like hope had been sucked out of you and nothing would ever be good again. It's a hundred times worse than the night at university, but I stick with my mates, all of whom are rational and smart blokes.\n\nWe stop and have a conversation about how we're not going to find a cafe or bar out here, so we may as well turn back. I don't really say anything - my lips are really dry, my stomach is in knots. You know that creepy feeling you get when you think you're being watched? It was that, only multiplied many times over. The others don't seem to notice anything.\n\nAnyway, that's really all it was. We turned around, walked back the way we came, and the feeling gradually subsided. Ended up having a nice night. It might just be some extreme paranoia on my part, but it still makes my hair stand on end when I think of it.",
            "I once met this young homeless guy, probably about 10 years ago. Acted like he knew me.

Who are you? \n\nHe responded saying it wasn't important and to ignore him as sometimes he gets confused between the present and the future, and just left. \n\nI never saw him again. It threw me off completely. I abandoned the idea to go into radio almost out of fear.",

            "When I around 16, my parents used to let me and my sister throw house parties. After the party was over anyone who wanted to, was allowed to sleep over in the living room.\n\nWell one night after a party there's ~30 of us in living room, chatting, shouting, laughing, generally being way too loud and annoying.\n\nNext to the living room, through a door were the stairs. As we were all talking EVERYONE hears someone coming down the stairs, clear as day, loud footsteps, coming down each step. 30 teens, all at the same time stop talking, thinking we're about to be told off for being too loud. \n\nSo I got up and went to the door, ready to apologise and tell my parent, whichever one it was, that we'll be quiet from now on. The second the footsteps reach the bottom of the stairs, I open the door, and there was nobody there. Not a soul. I turn around mouthwide open, too look at the room filled with my friends behind me, and they are all white as a sheet. Some of the girls actually left after that.\n\nThis happened about 10 years ago now, and I have NEVER, been able to explain it. There was no time for someone to run back upstairs and no alternative exits they could have taken. 30 people, all experienced the same thing that night.",

            "I was suffering with a brief depression a few years back, it was a really hard time in my life. My family was getting ready to go to a barbeque. I was brushing my teeth and randomly out of my peripheral vision, I saw the torso and arm of a man in a blue and green flannel. I didn't see a face or anything, but I'm fairly certain he put his hand on my left forearm. I looked up and there was nothing there. This really creeped me out, and my mother who is an extremely devout Catholic gave me a rosary to see if it would help. \n\nI brought the rosary with me when we left, and in the car I started to have an unnatural tiredness where I went into a weird daydream like state, followed by dark thoughts that really bothered me. Then suddenly afterwards I had this bizarre feeling of sheer peace, and clear mindedness. I felt as if I could die that second and I was happy and content with my life ending at that point. I wasn't suicidal, and I didn't want to die, but I felt as if even if I died in that moment, that things would be ok. After this event my mental health got better, and I feel more put together as a person.\n\nI don't know what happened, I'm not sure if what I saw was supernatural or just a figment of my imagination. Or even if I really saw anything at all. Nothing like that has happened since, and I've been in a way better mental state.",

            "I was around the age of 10 and my younger sister was 7. Usually, whenever my sister was scared during the night she would wake me up and so I would comfort her and tuck her in bed. However this night was different and she was shaking me furiously and crying, couldn\u2019t speak, etc so i rushed to her room and after a few minutes she could finally tell me that she could hear faint footsteps up and down the small hallway outside our rooms (our rooms are opposite from each other in the hallway). \n\nSo we tried to be quiet and listen for the footsteps and couldn\u2019t hear anything and I thought she must be hearing things, etc. then after we calmed down we started hearing the footsteps and they were actually so clear it sounded like there was someone right outside the room. We both feared that someone broke into the house and was wondering around our house. So (funnily enough) I grabbed a pillow to protect myself and my sister in case the \u2018intruder\u2019 came inside. At this stage myself and my sister are both crying and nothing is happening after 2 minutes of hearing footsteps I gain the courage to scream \u201chelp!\u201d And I run down to my parents room on the other end of the house. Wake them up and let them know what happens, dad checks the entire house plus backyard, nothing. He then goes to sleep. \n\nRelieved, I decide to lay in my sisters bed with her so she is less shaken up from the situation. Around 15 minutes later, wide awake, a very very loud screech happened in the kitchen for around 2 seconds (like something dragging on our floor tiles). Immediately, we both jump up and scream and cry, it was so loud my parents even woke up to see what it was. We left our room before my parents and saw our wooden kitchen chair somehow dragged on the tiles around 5 metres away from the kitchen table. We were all shocked and could not explained what happened. We thought it might have something to do with the footsteps. This is hands down the scariest thing I have ever gone through.\n\nUpdate: Wow! What a wonderful response to wake up to. Thanks everyone for the likes, comments and awards :) I see there are a few questions and theories that people do have and I\u2019d like to further elaborate on what happened after the event.\n\n- I live in Australia, in the area I live in there isn\u2019t a lot of wildlife other than birds, snakes, spiders (no raccoons, koalas, kangaroos or larger type animals etc) so I doubt any of those animals would have entered the house and caused the noise, moving chair and the footsteps.\n\n- My mother was still frightened a couple days later and decided to contact her friend that was a spiritual medium (I think?), and my mum was told that there were around 40 bad spirits in our home at the time. She decided to get our house blessed with holy water. I didn\u2019t know this additional information until recently because she was afraid it would affect my sister and I even more. I wasn\u2019t a big believer in spirits or any sort of paranormal activity, but after our house was blessed and spirits were gone, nothing else has happened up until now.\n\n- Parents are definitely not pranksters in the slightest. Highly doubt they would have tried to pull such a horrible prank on their children.\n\n- I see many comments saying that there might have been someone who actually broke in and tried to loot or had some weird fantasy. There\u2019s a theory the \u2018intruder\u2019 tried to escape and hit the chair on the way out, however, my dad did search the house to make sure no one was inside or outside. Also no sign of a break in? Everything was apparently still locked and closed. It is still so freaky that someone may have been in my house - it definitely sends chills down my spine thinking about that possibility.\n\n- To be honest, I am leaning towards it being some sort of paranormal activity. My house was closed/locked everywhere, and we would have heard the intruder run or escape and close the back door(s) because my doors are quite loud when trying to open or close them.",

After 4 months I hit a rough patch and had to sell my car to get back home. One night while trying to fall asleep I had a mild anxiety attack from over thinking my current situation at the time.  Both of my roommates had left a few days prior so I had the apartment to myself for the last few days. During my mild anxiety attack I was talking to grandma who had recently passed away to ask for some help (note I have never been spiritual, and I identify as agnostic). A little while later (early morning about 2am) I notice a flickering coming from my roommates room. I open the door to find a freshly lit candle. I did not light that candle. As a child my grandma would always take me with her to church and my favorite part was getting to light a candle to say a prayer. Love you nana.",

Each night I would see the shadow of a hand in the window and get scared and bury my head between my mom's back and the bed. This went on for a couple of weeks and I remember being terrified. I finally worked up the courage to look at the windowsill in the day. Nothing was there. I went outside and looked up at the window. Nothing was near it. I can not explain it. Just weird.",
            " I was showering one evening and had the bathroom window open for condensation. This particular window opens out above our side passage on the side of our house, about 20ft above the gate below. I finished showering, wrapped a towel round my waist and was walking out the bathroom where I met my mum on the landing. She was walking out of her bedroom and had begun telling me something about my laundry not being ready when mid-conversation we heard the most gutwrenching, bloodcurdling scream I've ever heard.\n\n The scream entered through the bathroom window echoing throughout the house and in an instant I was filled with fright and adrenaline. The only thing I could picture when hearing this screaming was that a woman was being pinned down and stabbed to death in our alleyway. I bolted downstairs into the kitchen and I must have covered about 20 stairsteps in 3 strides as my waist towel trailed behind me. By the time I got to our backdoor I was stark-bollock naked fighting with each lock on the door. The whole time the screaming continued, it wasn't just one shriek, and it seemed to escalate to greater levels of anguish with each passing second. I was panicked but ready to fight. All I could think was someone was being stabbed to death in my passage, I HAD to save them. I leapt outside, swung round the corner and ripped open the gate ready to confront the attacker. The side passage was pitch black and as my eyes were still adjusting, trying to make sense of anything that was there, the screaming stopped and all was still. Nothing was there and there was no trace of anything having ever been there. I cautiously stepped back into the kitchen where by this time my mum had caught up. After securing the perimeter with all outside lights turned on and scouting the front and back sides, we made sure out cat was alright. She had also heard the scream and was on high alert standing on the kitchen table. To this day I have no explanation what the source of the screaming was. We have foxes running through the area and they can make some weird yapping vocals but this definitely wasn't an animal sound. It sounded like a human writhing and wailing for her life.",
            "In high school there was a smoky, greasy spoon diner my friends and I used to go to at night to drink coffee. It was one of the only places in town where teenagers could hang out without being made to order full meals. We went there enough (almost every day) that we got to know the waitresses by name at make small talk with them. \n\nOne night we go in and there\u2019s a new waitress, so we start asking her about herself. She says her husband\u2019s a truck driver and they move around a lot. We say that makes sense since he\u2019s a trucker and she replies with, \u201cNo, we move around a lot because the longer I live in a place, the more I know about people cause I\u2019m psychic. Eventually we have to move.\u201d\n\nShe leaves the table and we start laughing and talking shit about her and how she\u2019s crazy and how that\u2019s on point for this diner. Maybe twenty minutes later she comes back, sits down at our booth, grabs my friend\u2019s hands, and tells my friend her whole life story. Not vague stuff, but incredibly detailed pieces of her like history like, \u201cYou were sexually abused by an adult family member when you were three in the bathroom during another family member\u2019s birthday party. Your family knows about it and believes you but thinks you should just get over it.\u201d\n\nEvery. Single. Thing that she was accurate, and she talked for maybe five minutes, without my friend responding or doing anything except turning pale. \n\nWe saw the waitress maybe one or two more times and then she didn\u2019t work there anymore. To this day I still tell people that I don\u2019t believe in psychics, but that I met one once.",

            "I already commented but I thought of another story\n\nMy mum and dad bought a house before I was born on an old street, probs like 1600\u2019s dated. My mum had bought the house because she was really into looking at family history and some elderly relative of hers had lived theirs in the 1930\u2019s. My dad and my grandad were decorating before they moved in and every day my grandad would moan at my dad for not washing his brushes after he had painted.\n\nOne day my grandad went alone to paint and then when my parents returned later that night he had left but not washed any brushes which was super weird for him. My mum rang him and he came up with an excuse that he just forgot about it.\n\nYears later, when they finally moved out of the house he explained why he had left them. He had been painting the hallway where the stairs were and suddenly felt some kind of cold presence. When he turned around he saw an old lady walking down the stairs slowly and recognised it as the distant family member that had lived their years before. Naturally he shit himself and ran out, leaving all his equipment behind but didn\u2019t dare tell my parents what happened until after they left.",
            "When I was young my little brother and I would explore the woods and abandoned areas of the English Countryside. There was this one abandoned, overgrown farmhouse that we and a few other kids from the town broke into by kicking in the kitchen window which was the closest window to the ground as the kitchen was half in the ground. When we got into the kitchen the table was set and laid and very old, dry and shriveled food was still on the plates. To us it seemed like the family that lived there just got up during dinner left and never came back. \n\nWe explored the rest of the house and the furniture was all there, covered in dust, cobwebs, animal droppings. It was awesome. Our own little secret clubhouse. There was only one room we couldnt get in to the heavy wooden door was locked and no search for a key was ever fruitful. I couldn't explain it at the time but I *had* to get into that room to look around, consider it the video game completionist side of me. Myself and a few others found a heavy tree branch outside that we used as a battering ram and after many, many swings we finally got this door busted enough to open. Inside the room was no furniture except one cabinet, fastened to the wall. Inside the cabinet was a single China doll. And while it wasn't creepy looking the whole situation gave me, my brother and our friends the chills. We hastily pulled the door as closed as it would go and left the house for the night.\n\nThat night a thunderstorm rolled through town and the next time we got out to the farm house it was nothing but rubble and burnt wood, it had been a few days since the storm but we figured it had been struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Being curious boys we sifted through the ashes because why not? That is until I uncovered that cabinet, in near perfect condition, with very little burn marks on it and the doll inside, perfectly intact, just staring at the sky. It freaked me to my core and I've never ran away from anything faster in my life. I never went back and by the next year my dad had been posted elsewhere in the country and we moved. But I have never shook the feeling that the lightning didn't start the fire, nor did the family just leave.",
            "I didn't see anything but I heard strange sounds when I went camping with my dad when I was 12 years old back in 2007.\n\n\nWe were sitting around the campfire at night when out of nowhere we hear this loud sound. My dad and I couldn't tell what it was. At first we thought it was a jet but it was a clear night and we didn't see any strobe lights at all in the sky. It wasn't a car or any large vehicle on the nearby highway because automobiles don't sound like that. We couldn't tell if it was coming from the sky or the nearby mountains at this point. It was really loud and kept going on consistently for a long time too and we just sat there and listened. \n\n\nThe sound went away and it was time to go to sleep so instead of sleeping in the tent, my dad and I slept in my dad's camper in his truck because I was too scared. Then late at night, I had no idea what time it was, but that sound came back and it woke me up. I stayed awake with my eyes wide open until the Sun came up. The sound never came back after that night and we've gone back to that campsite multiple times over the years and never heard it again.\n\n\nYou know the funny thing is that around 2011-2012 people all over the world were hearing loud horn sounds coming from the sky and those sounds are exactly what I heard at that campsite. I still get chills talking about it.",
            "This happened when I was 16-17.\n\nI never met my paternal grandmother. She died 2 years before I was born and my father never really talked about her(because feelings aren\u2019t manly) and I never even had seen a picture of her because all of our photos were in a storage unit in a different city.\n\nI had a dream one night that I was suddenly walking around a nice little house and came into what looked like the living room. To my left was a set of two chairs with bright green roses printed on cream fabric. In one of them sat my grandmother. I don\u2019t know how I knew she was my grandmother, but I just kinda did. She didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all. Across from her was an old box television playing a program with a man singing for a live audience. When the man finished singing and audience started to clap, she clapped along with them. And then my dream ended.\n\nThe next morning I went out to the living to see my dad and I told him about having a weird dream about grandma. He kinda scoffed but when I mentioned the chairs his eyes went WIDE. He immediately got up from his chair and fetched from a cabinet in our entertainment center a small tin box I had never seen before. He opened it up and started pulling out tons of old photos until he found a picture of my elderly grandfather in the very chair I described. He said my grandparents had had those chairs since their wedding and he got rid of them when I was an infant. I then told him the rest of the dream and when I mentioned the clapping my dad said \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what she used to do, she always clapped when she watched a good performer on the television\u201d. We were both baffled. My dad dismissed it by saying \u201cWell that\u2019s very interesting.\u201d And then kinda shut himself in the den for the rest of the day. \n\nI still don\u2019t understand how it happened, I couldn\u2019t have known ANY of the information in my dream. I\u2019m happy that I at least got to see her once.",
            "Decided to watch paranormal activity for the first time with my dad up at our family cabin (in Northern Wisconsin, in the middle of winter, and as far in the country as you can get.  Not many other people around especially in the winter)  Anyway were big horror movie guys so we were really excited.  Got dark out, turned ALL the lights off except a little night light at the end of the hallway to see the bathroom door.  Fast forward about 75% of the way done with the movie and we take a quick break to grab a drink and go to the bathroom.  Walk into my bedroom and ALL the lights are.  Overhead light, night light, lamp, and even a flashlight in a closed shelf.  I specifically remember turning off all light and the way this cabin is set up is there is no way to not see someone go into my bedroom.  My dad never got up before I turned the movie on, so it couldn't be him and frankly he was just as terrified as me.  Usually id chalk it up to some freak coincidence, but 4 different lights that use different source of power all turn on when im 100% positive they were all turned off originally?  We ended up turning off the movie and watched the funniest movie we had near by(Ace Ventura).  I am an Athiest and have no belief in any \"paranormal\" or anything not really science based, but this really fucked with me when I was 12 and both my dad and I still have no explanation.",
            "I swear this happened.\n\nIt's a pretty long one so stay with me. \n\nWhen I was in college, I shared a house with 7 more students in an apartment/flat/whatever you want to call it. I live in 3rd floor. I was socially awkward so I didn't make friends with any of them. They'd leave the house at midnight to play football and there's always this one animation student that stays in the house with me.\n\nOne night, I was staying up because I didn't finish my assignment as fast as I thought. Everyone either slept at their friend's house or play midnight football, but that night the animation student tagged along. So I was all alone in the apartment. Let me tell you about the apartment, it fucking sucks. Almost all of the lights are broken, my door handle is totally gone (leaving a weird circle hole) so that I can use my finger to actually lock/open my door through the \"gear\" or whatever u wanna call it. We reported it to the college department but they never did anything. \n\n\nThat night I did my work in the dark on my study table in the living room. As I'm doing my assignment, I heard a chair noise from the room behind my back. I saw everyone literally stepped out from the house 2 hours ago, so I knew I was 100% alone. I decided to close my laptop and go to my room and sleep. I stood up, and naturally my chair made a _skreeechhh_ noise.\n\n\nThe chair noise replied louder from the room behind me.\n\n\nI went to my room, use my nail to close the door and sleep. I woke up the next day with my door half open. I called my roommate and asked him whether he entered the room last night. He didn't.\n\n\nSo there's that, I never really wanted to do work late at night again. At least that's what I told myself that day. Two weeks later, I got an assignment that requires me to stay up (I also took animation course and that shit was tiring). I started around 10pm something and then my housemates went out to play football except for the animation student, which calms me a bit. Around 12, he went out because he received a call from someone while holding his motorcycle helmet. He's 100% not coming back.\n\n\nSo I tried to do my job without overthinking about the  room behind me. I can't roam around at night because the security dude would ask me if I try to sneak into girl's apartment. I have friends but I don't want to knock their doors at 12 something. So I called my mom (I saw her online) and we talked a bit about life and stuff. I calmed down a bit and continued my work.\n\n\nAround 2am, I heard it again. You know its from the same floor because my floor was vibrating. I did what every stupid characters do in movies, I stood up and checked the room. I'm not sure why, I just felt like if there's no one in the room I'd convince myself there's nothing to be afraid of. I checked under the bed and shit. Nothing. I closed the room and then continue my work.\n\n\nFrom my peripheral view, I can see that the door opens slightly more and more, but very slowly. Subtle, but you can tell. I was shaking and tbh, I kinda froze. And then I felt something touched my leg. It was a hanger. It hit my leg and when I look down its still moving and rattles on the floor.\n\n\nSomething threw a plastic hanger from the room behind me.\n\n\nI decided it was too much for me and I got out from the house and I took a walk downstairs. The guard asked what was I doing, I lied and said I was waiting for my laundry to dry (there's a mini dobi at the lowest floor). I didn't sleep at my apartment often since, I decided to sleep at my house (which is around 40m to an hour distance) because of that shit.\n\n\nApparently my neighbour house experienced something weird too so I guess it's not just me. It's not really scary but I felt uncomfortable for not being able to explain what happened, and I don't like that. Now I'm doing much better, I have lots of friends and changed my course. Its a fun story to tell.",

I kept looking back at him and rubbing my eyes to see if I was just going crazy or some shit, but he just looked like this creepy ass scp monster.

A blurry figure stood in the window. I only could make out that he was pale and bald, and he held some red orb in his left hand. Idk why but he looked masculine to me, so thats why i reference to him as a \"he/him\".\n\nI got uncomfortable as I kept feeling his stare on me. I didnt see his eyes but i felt him looking at me. I looked around in my train, looking out of the other window to the other side of the station, thinking it might be a reflection and that he was actually on that side, but there was no one there. I looked back as the train started moving again, and as we rode off, the man moved with us in the window of that opposite train, until it was out of view and he completely dissapeared.\n\nI have never felt so scared before and once I got out of the train I went home in record time. This happened years ago, but its still creepy to me. the feeling I felt was indescribable.",

            "Went on a bike ride with a friend about a year ago in the summer. The trail we were on went through a woods, crossed a road, then went through a thin treeline that eventually left you between two fields. They were bean fields, this is important.\n\nWe stopped for a pee break and I took a picture of the sunset (for the gram) and I put my phone back in my pocket. I get on my bike and my friend is sitting on his bike just staring straight forward, dead silent. He points to a man wearing cover-alls with what looked like a straw hat walking toward us on the path. We look at each other and fuck right off.\n\nNow, there was no way we could have missed him. The nearest house wasn't for about \u00bd mile or so. Guy was clearly an older man, as he was about 40-ish yards from us enclosing. There wasn't any farm equipment out, no other trails, and especially nowhere to hide. Where the fuck did this guy come from? \n\nWe haven't been back since. I don't even believe in ghosts...",
            "A short while after my dad died and we were still in the phase of mourning where we were still working out what to do about the house and such, a shirt came in the mail that was my sisters exact size and had pugs on it (she\u2019s a pug owner)\n\nWhat\u2019s strange is that while it was addressed to our house, the name it was addressed to wasn\u2019t anything close to any of our names, nor did we recognize the senders name or know anybody from the region it came from.\n\nWas it meant for my sister? Or just a weird combination of coincidences that led to her getting a perfect gift that wasn\u2019t meant for her? Should we have sent it back?",
            "I work in film and tv production. For an ad shoot we rented a DV camera from a local vendor. It wasn't going to be our main camera but just a safety one for second unit or for continuity. Now these cameras are usually in constant use, so when you get it, it might have footage from the previous shoot it was on on on its tape or memory chip. You just delete it and tape over it.  \nThe cameraperson who was supposed to use it calls me over to show me the footage from the previous shoot, for some reason he doesn't want others to see it and is being furtive about it. He shows me what looks like footage from a PR event, where a popular actor is giving an interview, talking about some product launch they are at. In the middle she seems to get more and more agitated, loses her train of thought and then snaps at the cameraman. It's the kind of celebrity being an asshole clip that goes viral. I laugh it off, but the camera guy is still being very nervous about it. I suddenly realize why: this actor committed suicide a week ago. Honestly, the tape could have been shot on the day or around the day when it happened. Once I saw the footage with that context, it suddenly felt very unnerving, feeling like I was getting a sense of her disturbed mental state during that time.  I delete the footage and double check that its gone from the camera. \nA few weeks later, on another shoot we hire another camera. The same cameraman comes over and shows me the footage on it. Its the exact same one, the actor getting agitated, loosing their temper, snapping. The camera was different, I'm pretty sure even the vendor was different, but it had the exact same footage. I'm still not sure how that happened.",
            "When I was in my twenties I was spending the night at a friend\u2019s house.  She worked night shift generally, so at the point I was getting super tired she was still wide awake. She decided to stay in the living room and watch some movies and I went to her bedroom and went to sleep. After I\u2019d been asleep for a bit, I woke up to see her coming in the room. It was dark, but I recognized her by her long hippy skirt she loved to wear. I figured she was getting her contact solution or something, but she just set down on the bed with me and stared out the window. I asked her what she was doing, but she didn\u2019t answer. Normally if I get woken up in the night I\u2019m up for hours, but right after asking her I got so sleepy and went back to sleep.\n\n\nThe next morning I had completely forgotten about it until she asked me what I had come in the living room for last night. Apparently she had fallen asleep watching her movie but was woken up at some point by me coming into the living room and sitting on the couch beside the window. She asked me what I was doing, but I didn\u2019t answer, I just stared out the window silently until she fell back asleep. \n\n\nWhen I told her she was the one who had come into my bedroom we both got super creeped out. She told me the figure who came into the living room with her had on a long flowing skirt, just like the one I had seen. She had just assumed it was me and I had borrowed one of her skirts since I was the only other person in the house.\n\n\nShe lived in not the greatest part of town, which is why I was staying with her in the first place, her roommate was away and she didn\u2019t want to be alone all night. She\u2019s also very religious, so she believes that we were in danger that night and they were angels sent to guard us.",
            "Seen, felt and heard - the school I'm going to was built on a battlefield and \"low-cost military cemetery\". Don't know if it's important ; I live 5 mins away from Germany and as you can guess it, lots of fights and death happened, but more especially in the area surrounding the school because that's where most of the soliders were (because there's a big tower and people up there could see if someone was coming).\n\nAnyways we have three sport's rooms. Two of them are upstairs, and one is downstairs, in a sort of basement. That room is only for muscular exercises and I've never been here before because it was never in our program.\n\nSo this year we go there, and the first thing is that it's fucking FREEZING cold despite all the heaters being turn on and us running around, but the weirdest thing is that I felt like someone was constantly \"leaning\" on me. I didn't say a thing cause I didn't want to appear crazy, but after one hour someone ask the teacher what is it? Teacher just tell us it's normal and that happen as long as she can remember and tells us she thinks it's the wind.\n\nThat was the most unexplainable thing, the two others where random white flash and weird noises, like as if someone was knocking on the walls, or the sound when you knock a wooden table with your knuckles.\n\nI can't explain it, it's not super creepy either, just weird.",
            "2 things, neither really strange but they always felt really odd:\n\n1. I'd had a bad fight with my girlfriend in college and we didn't talk for a few days.  I sent some of the things she'd left at my place back to her by a mutual friend.  That friend brought back a note saying she'd like to talk.  So we agreed on a place.  I had to get on the train to get there.  I went to the train station and the train pulled up.  As I stepped onto it (I think of the lyrics from House of the Rising Sun, \"I got one foot on the platform and the other on the train,\" it was just like that) I had this moment of really intense vertigo.  I described it later as a feeling like the entire universe changed its course and rotated around me for a split second. And the power to the train just went out.  All its lights blinked out and there was a sound like when the Starship Enterprise breaks down (I may have added that sound into the memory.) So nothing really, just a weird power outage coupled with some stress-related vertigo, but it's really one of the oddest things that's happened to me when I wasn't high out of my mind.\n2. I lost my job in the Great Recession (2009) and moved into a house in the ghetto with a friend.  I stayed up all night playing video games, the friend kept a decent sleep schedule.  One morning he'd just gotten up and had come down and was talking to me.  It was still dark outside.  As we were talking, *something* zipped past the the window of the room we were in. I could see a light and we could hear this high-pitched whine.  We both later guessed it was moving about 80 miles per hour, which would have been suicidal on the street we lived on.  We both kept talking about whatever for a few seconds as our faces screwed up into a \"WTF?\" look and then we both asked each other, \"Did you see that?\"",

            "One night when I was 19 I was driving to and from my house to get clothes to sleep at a friend's. The drive is about 30 minutes each way, and there are only 1 road to get there. On my way there, I passed a grey and red house and in the lawn a yellow lab was taking a shit, a black truck was plowing the driveway, and I passed a silver jeep who was going the opposite way. I remember it so vividly because both my friends and I all joked that you never see that many living being on the road at one time. We get to my house, stay and eat/chat for about an hour, and then we leave again. This time, we were on the opposite side of the road as the house, but the same EXACT scene happened. Yellow lab was taking a shit. Truck was plowing the driveway, and that jeep passed me driving the other way. I said \"Wasn't that-\" Until both friends cut me off at the same time and said \"Yes\".",

            "This was only about a week ago. I'm a delivery driver and was taking a delivery, around 7 PM so it was dark out. I looked up at the stars cause I like stargazing and I saw some very unusual moving stars. I figured it was a plane or something but then I realize it wasn't just 1 or 2 stars, but at least 30 of them, probably more. They were all lined up perfectly in a row moving northeast relatively slowly. They literally stretched across the entire night sky. \n\nMy best theory is one of the military bases nearby (Colorado Springs) was doing some night training or something, but I've never seen so many aircraft flying at once before. I'm not even sure if they were aircraft, the lights weren't blinking which is odd for a plane, but I can't think of any reasonable alternative. One of the weirdest things I've ever seen.",
            "A few stories actually.\n\nSo for context, I was living in a rather small village with 300 inhabitants. the next bigger road is not to far away from us, but the road leading through our village is pretty small.\n\nThe first story: As I was younger, I had a tree house, it was pretty cool and we actually thought about having electricity and water up there, but we never did that. And one night, I couldn't sleep, I was watching my tree house, and all of a sudden, this thing lights up, we never had any lamps there, so how could this have happened? It went out after a few minutes and it never happened again. This story happened in the same time I experienced alien nightmares and having the feeling of being watched from something invisible.\n\nAnd the second story is even weirder. So as I told, i was living in a small village, the next train station is like 6 Km away and, sometimes, when my parents couldn't pick me up, I had to walk. Took me usually 45 Minutes, more or less. One night, I was at a friend's place, I took the train to the next station, and from there I had to walk. I remember, I took the train at 7pm, so I should be home at 8, right? 10 minutes train, 45 walking. It took 2,5 hours for me to get home and I can't explain what happened on the way home, still thinking about it today",

I got off at one and realized immediately it was the wrong stop and it felt strange. There were fairy lights hung between trees, and it was nighttime. There were people walking around but they looked lost.\n\nAll of a sudden, B came walking up to me. He asked me \"what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here\"\nAnd I simply replied I was lost. I asked him why he was there, and he replied \"...I'm dead. We all are.\" And walked away.\n\nI have a lot of strange and vivid dreams, a lot of them really beautiful but strange, and i go to www.dreammoods.com a lot and they always match up.

            "The Nice Young Man in the Blue Suit. \n\nI worked in a nursing home a while back as a cook. It was a good job, the residents were cool and the nurses rocked. Being a nursing home, however, meant that death came to our residents pretty frequently. \n\nOccasionally, staff would see strange things in the halls out of the corner of their eyes. The newer staff would always try to investigate; the older staff always knew they would find nothing. \n\nHere is the strangest thing, though. A day before a patient died, if they were lucid, they would report having had a visitor, despite no one being in the visitor logs. The visitor was always a young man; generically handsome, clean cut, and would sit with the patient and they would talk. The patients who spoke of this man always said that they felt better after the talk. But, inevitably, they would die within 24 hours. Even seemingly healthy residents would pass away within 24 hours. So, when a resident brought up the young man in the blue suit, the nurses would unofficially contact the family and strongly encourage them to visit the resident. \n\nEarlier in this post I mentioned the staff seeing things out of the corner of their eyes. A person walking into a resident\u2019s room, a little blur of movement at the end of a hall... several staff (myself included) got more direct looks at this... entity? It was usually in a restroom or a resident\u2019s room. Always in a reflection, but definitely there. It... he seemed to be checking on the residents, placing a hand on them, and then leaving the room and vanishing. He would show up for non-nursing staff in restrooms or via reflective surfaces in staff only areas...\n\nMy theory is that he was a psychopomp, there to guide and comfort the dying towards the end of their lives. He genuinely seemed tk ease the burdens hanging on the residents, and they seemed to pass away pretty easily.",
            "When I was a junior in college I went on vacation with my parents to Camden, ME. This was years before everyone had cell phones. So, unfortunately there was no way to document it. My parents had rented a little cabin in the woods. I was awake reading a book in a loft that had a gigantic window at about 1AM. There was a heat lightening storm that had been going on for hours, just flashes, no rain. I froze in place(seriously could not move for several minutes) when a began to see huge basketball sized balls of glowing light  slowly falling down through the trees. They glowed bright white. They moved very slowly downward. I managed to get down from the loft and make my way to my parents room. They awakened and walked over to the picture window to see what I was trying to explain to them. My dad ( a chemist ) went right out the door. I was so scared but made my way to the doorway to peer out. The balls continued to slowly fall. You could actually hear some of them touch branches and make a slight sizzle sound. Some never made it to the ground, but if they did, they slowly fizzled out, almost like evaporating with a little slight fizzle sound. It kept on going for a half an hour or so and then was done. The next morning we drove down the street to the next nearest home and knocked on the door to ask if they had seen anything unusual the night before. They had not been awake. For weeks I tried to research this. The closest thing that I can find to what we saw was ball lightening. I feel lucky to have seen this because it is very rare- if that is what it was. No one really knows for sure that ball lightening actually even exists."

Even if you don't currently have a special lady in your life... next time you're picking out cologne... find a girl you think is attractive that works at the store (or, if you know how NOT to come off as creepy, find a random girl shopping in the perfume section) and ask them if they wouldn't mind giving their opinion on which one you should buy.\n\nNot so strangely enough, ever since I started letting my fiancee pick out my colognes, more women have commented on how much they love my colognes.

As an age reference, I'm 27... But women between the ages of 25-55 have agreed.\n\nEdit2: Also, know the difference between eau de toilette and eau de parfum.

            "Going into the sauna naked while sharing the sauna with the other sex(es).\n\n\\---\n\nEdit: It's about Germany but we always welcome the Finnish, origin of a welcome invention. As this got somewhat hijacked about Finnish sauna culture, German sauna culture is very easy:\n\n* In public saunas usually everyone is naked. If you feel uncomfortable, you can wrap a towel around your waist and/or chest. Between sittings you'd usually wear a robe.\n* Most public saunas have half a day or more during the week reserved to female only. Check their website for details on that, if you are interested.\n* Be prepared that it will get crowded in the sauna when \"Aufguss\" are scheduled. Aufguss is the process of throwing scented water on the heater to increase humidity.\n* I don't know a public sauna where swimsuits are allowed. If there are pools, you'd swim naked but you can wear swimsuits there if you want to.\n* As long as you are in the sauna, you don't want to get too romantic with your spouse or whoever you are with. There is a difference between nudity and promiscuity. There are special clubs reserved for that. (I was asked to tell that these are so called sauna clubs. Hence I called them clubs. Basically those are brothels.)\n* In hotels you will often find a small sauna. Unwritten law is, the first to enter the sauna decides if it's fine to be naked. But in hotel saunas it's way more common to wear a towel than in public saunas.\n* Private saunas of course are up to the owners and/or users. Do what you are comfortable with - naked or towel.\n\nEdit2: There was some confusion with what I and some English websites called \"infusion\". In Germany, throwing scented water on the heater is very popular and generally done by sauna personnel (the saunameister). German spas usually have a variety of saunas in their facilities. Different types of \"Aufguss\" in different kinds of saunas usually follow a strict schedule. Most sauna regulars will follow the saunameister around and take part in the Aufguss.\n\nEdit3: Just to show how popular Aufguss is in Germany, go to [the German sauna Wikipedia entry](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna#Der_Aufguss). Chapter 8 is soley dedicated to Aufguss. Also, if you wanna get a glimpse of German sauna culture, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NseditMtDmQ) is a clip of the European \"Aufguss\" Championschip. IT CONTAINS NUDITY!>> The clip shows a typical sauna landscape in Germany right at the start (for a fraction of a second) and then goes into following a saunameister at an Aufguss. The naked people you will see actually depict the very reality of going to the sauna. Past half a minute the clip just shows Aufguss competition at black light. You can skip that. (Edit6: Someone enjoyed the remaining part of the video. I only told you to skip the rest as it does not depict sauna reality. You a free to watch the whole thing. Furthermore my girlfriend told me to tell you that Schuhplattler and Lederhosen are only part of Bavarian tradition and especially not part of everyday life in Germany) \n\nEdit4: Public sauna or Spa. That what you should be looking for and not to mix that up with sauna clubs or Saunaklub (NSFW if you do an image search). Those are basically brothels.\n\nEdit5: All you guys that are worried about boners. This doesn't really happen. Sexuality is tried to be toned down in sauna. No kissing or fondling your spouses, try not to stare at others. There are many people there that you will find not attractive. Your body is busy sweating. If you don't touch your junk, you'll probably not have problems with a hard on. If you feel the blood pumping, just leave and enter one of the icy water tubs and showers.",

            "To those not thinking about the impact abortion bans will have on the living, breathing women and existing families of this nation:\r  \n\r  \nOverall, 23.7% of women have had an abortion since Roe was decided. \r  \nThat number has dropped to around 18% for women in recent years due to better availability of contraception and more complete sexual education, even if via internet. <-- If you truly care about reducing abortion, this is where to concentrate your effort.\r  \n\r  \nThose wanting Roe overturned and abortion criminalized are in the minority (\\~30% and \\~20%). This PROHIBITION is not the will of the people. \r  \n\r  \nThose who think their lifestyle means it can never happen to them, look around you. Every 4th woman you see has made the choice to end a pregnancy. In your church. In your school. In your friend group. In your family. Maybe you and you're lying to protect yourself from, well, we all know what you're protecting yourself from. It happens. ALL. THE. TIME. Even the women screaming outside clinics, them too. \r  \n\r  \nRoughly the same number of women today have miscarriages as have abortions. Miscarriages look like botched abortions. \r  \n\r  \nMiscarriages often require a D&C to protect the woman from sepsis and other complications. A D&C is an abortion. If you think your wife, your daughter, yourself, will be treated well by medical personnel because \"not me\", I suggest you read some of the pre-Roe horror stories.\r  \n\r  \nAbout Forty percent (FORTY PERCENT!) of women will be directly and negatively impacted by this intrusion. NONE of that 40% owe you a single cell of their body.\r  \n\r  \nAt any given time there are over 100,000 children waiting to be adopted in the US. There's no shortage of children to adopt.\r  \n\r  \nThe women most likely today to abort are those of us most in need. Poverty-stricken women, often women of color, in their 20s or 30s, often having children already, who don't have access to decent healthcare, education, or contraception, who work constantly and still need assistance just to feed the children she has, these are the women most impacted. \r  \n\r  \nThe US has the worst maternal mortality rate of the developed world. Women of color die at 3 times the rate of white women. \r  \n\r  \nFor those thinking \"I don't want to pay for...<insert favorite soapbox>\" -you already pay for it, one way or another. As a community, we all do. The only question to answer is, does the community spend to educate and lift everyone up? Or does the community spend to shame, demonize, imprison those with the least? (Note to self: invest in privatized women's prison, it will soon be boom time! :S )\r  \n\r  \nThe clerk checking out your 99-cent plastic bowl from Walmart is likely working as many jobs and/or hours as possible only to still need public assistance to feed their children (that they then get shamed for needing/having). Before starting any \"back in my day\" stories, think...really think, about what it would have been like for you 30-40 years ago if you instead made $70 for every $100. What if you had no family to help? I remember taking $20 and a calculator to the grocery store to feed us for an entire week. Because that's all I had. Now take that $20 away and another $100 for good measure. That's where today's poor live.

It's bad enough that the door is opened for outlawing abortion, but the logic used to justify overruling a previous Supreme Court verdict can be used to roll back nearly *anything.*\n\nIt doesn't matter that they wrote in the decision that this logic 'shouldn't' be used for other situations, because that's not how precedent works. They set the precedent that decisions can be rolled back if they don't conform to an arbitrary interpretation of what the Constitution originally guaranteed, and so this can be used for just about anything.  They can always say \"Well, it makes sense this time. Not next time, but this time. We promise we won't do it again. Probably.\"\n\nIt's no wonder that people have little confidence in the Supreme Court now. They did it to themselves.\n\nEDIT - Quick edit since the Reddit algorithm has blessed my comment with visibility - I encourage people to reach at least the Syllabus portion of the full decision text, which can be found here: [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392\\_6j37.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf) It's short and lays out the reasoning behind the decision. Regardless of your feelings about the outcome, it's valuable to understand the arguments and form your own decision as to whether they make sense. Of course, the dissents are well worth a read as well.\n\nEDIT2- I feel the need to add this part because some critics seem to be misunderstanding my point. I never said that the problem is that the court overturned precedent. The Court mentions Plessy v. Ferguson being overturned *on the fourth goddamn page of the decision text.* You think I don't realize that the Supreme Court has overturned decisions before? My point is that the logic they used here is insidious. The idea of 'implicit' rights is foundational to many rights we currently enjoy and take for granted, such as the right to privacy. The decision here calls that very logic into question, and with it a huge number of previous rulings that can be overturned using this decision as justification.",
            "It amazes me how passionately America cares for unborn children and simultaneously couldn't give two shifts about living breathing kids getting shot and killed on a weekly basis. \n\nSeems kids lives only matter IN the womb. Or maybe, just maybe this is the ugly face of the subtle epidemic of mysogyny?\n\nEdit: additional point - I wonder how many of these pro-lifers will be willing to register to adopt? I've a feeling if all those pro-lifers were made to adopt the children that will now be given up, they'd quickly become pro-choice.\n\nEveryone's opinion on others changes when they start to impact their own life.",

Please, please, please read these words from a comment I saved a while back by a user u/TheBirminghamBear.\n\nSupport the women in your lives. Your family, your coworkers, your children, the stranger in the grocery store. It's time to show your unapologetic support.\n\n---\n\nTo wit,\n\nI would like to add, as many have already heard, that exhaustion is the point. The flood us with terrible news, terrible events, propaganda to make the most vicious and cruelest among us appear as kings, unstoppable, undefeatable.\n\nThe tyrant's greatest weapon is their ability to instill fear and despair.\n\nI would strongly encourage everyone to look across history. Look at all the horrific acts, the authoritarian regimes, the dictators who appeared to be indominable gods, until suddenly, they weren't.\n\nI know it's hard. But I cannot emphasize enough the power of even a single optimist. Hope is infectious. The authoritarian seeks to control our perception of reality. They are very skilled at it.\n\nBut just one individual in someone's lives who is a beacon of hope and positivity can have profound ripple effects on their community.\n\nDespair is the enemy. Without despair, there is only life and action. In bad times, you must act. In good times, you must act.\n\nWe live, undoubtedly, under a curtain of shit and terror and fear. The authoritarians are on the rise everywhere. The single best way that you can combat them is to not despair. No matter how dire the news makes the world seem, do not despair. Encourage action, vigilance, and most importantly, love and community.\n\nIt isn't easy. Lord knows. Sometimes, it takes everything. But nothing you can do with your life is more noble than to be a stalwart defender against despair and hopelessness. To be the person that even in the darkest hour, inspires others to turn on their light, too.\n\nThere are more of us than there are of them. Which is why they put all their energies into making people seem small, weak, and divided.\n\nThey are, in essence, trying to salt the Earth. To take away that which makes life rich and worth fighting for. To make you believe this world is dark and doomed and that it is not even worth challenging them for their dominance over it.\n\nBy being someone who inspires hope, by being that rock, that anchor, that beacon, you give others the strength to keep getting up, to keep taking action, to keep fighting back.\n\nNo one could run a four-minute mile. Until someone could. And then, everyone could. We look to those people who shine. We take our strength from them. They offer us an alternative to the climate of fear and terror around us. They give us a different path.\n\nThey will tell you its pointless. They will tell you its hopeless. They will tell you to give up, they will mock you, spit on you, and everything else to demean and degrade you.\n\nBecause they are terrified of that person who does not despair.\n\nDo not allow them to do so, and you've already taken the greatest step to victory that you can take.",

The car cannot tell a higher octane fuel is being used. It can only tell if a LOWER octane fuel MIGHT be used by virtue of the knock sensor. If the sensor detects knocking or pinging, the computer will retard the timing to eliminate the knock. Pulling timing can reduce the amount of power the engine makes.\n\nThe fuel map the computer uses to manage your engine is made for a specific octane rating. On high performance cars, the compression is higher and the timing is more aggressive, therefore high octane is necessary. \n\nIf your car says it REQUIRES premium, use it. If it says RECOMMENDED, regular can be used unless the vehicle is under heavy load. Don't spend 15% more on gas because your car \"feels like it runs better\" on premium.",

My parents don't understand what's happening, and I don't tell them, because it sounds absolutely crazy. I am not taken to a psychiatrist for years because we don't have insurance and can't afford it out of pocket.\n\nI have behavioral problems at school. No one can deny my seemingly preternatural intelligence, but I'm so bored by the required work that, instead of doing what's assigned, I make up and solve my own calculus problems. I write code in programming languages that don't exist yet. I do not have access to a computer, and frequently demand access to a computer. My grades tank, I'm often sent to the principal's office for disrupting class. But, this is America, so I graduate grade after grade after grade. My fourth grade teacher recognizes how much I already know, and feeds me high school textbooks. It's a good year. The next year returns to normal, and crushes me.\n\nIn 8th grade, my mom's insurance coverage shifts, and psychiatric issues are finally covered. I go to a psychiatrist for the first time. I have been living retrograde for about four years. The sharp edges of grief have somewhat dulled, but the boredom of an adult living as a child has not. I extract a promise from the psychiatrist. A promise not to tell my parents, or my teachers, or the police, FBI, or anyone what I'm about to tell him. He agrees.\n\nI tell him I've been transplanted back into my own life from 2018, that I should be 35 with a wife and kids, and I've been dealing with this alone since I was 10. He doesn't believe me. I write him some computer code in versions of languages that don't exist yet. I write calculus problems and polar equations that I shouldn't understand. He thinks I'm a prodigy, but crazy.\n\nI tell him George W. Bush will win the Presidential election. He thinks I'm guessing. I'm shouting now. I scream at him about 9/11, one year away. He's no longer laughing. I've made a mistake. He thinks I'm dangerous. He thinks I am planning 9/11. I try to backpedal, to say that it's Al Qaeda. He asks me if Al Qaeda speaks to me. I know I've lost him.\n\nThey put me on anti-psychotics. It kills my mood, stunts my mind, ruins my enthusiasm for everything. I'm no longer \"depressed\" or \"acting out\", so the treatment is hailed as a success. I get regular checkups from the psychiatrist.\n\n9/11 happens. I'm dragged into a meeting with my parents, the psychiatrist, a police officer, and two men in suits. My parents don't understand what's happening. They try and get me to talk, but I refuse. They have all internet traffic from my house, some of which is embarrassing, but none of which is incriminating. I demand to be taken off the drugs and allowed to return to baseline. They agree. I am under house arrest with an ankle bracelet. I can go to school and home. I don't care; I never made friends, even my old friends from my past life were too juvenile.\n\nA month later, a repeat of the meeting. How did I know about 9/11? I ask for a lawyer. They deny me one. I shrug and stop speaking. They get me a lawyer.\n\nI tell my lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.\n\nI tell my new lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.\n\nI tell my new lawyer everything. She doesn't believe me. But says she'll work on my behalf as if she did. I agree.\n\nWe tell them nothing. The house arrest is a violation of my rights, and the Patriot Act doesn't exist yet (barely) for them to be able to hold me on suspicion of anything. My lawyer threatens to go public. They back off.\n\nMy freshman year grades are terrible. I realize I need my grades up if I want to go to the right college to find my wife, so I double down on my school work. I go from a D average screw off to acing every class. My teachers are confused, but relieved.\n\nIt's senior year. I apply to only one college. My parents think I'm crazy. I get in. I apply to the Honors Program. The Honors Program, where I met my wife over 20 years ago on my personal timeline, where I'd live in the same dorm building as her, and work late on the same engineering team as her, the time when our relationship began.\n\nI don't get in. My grades are too low, after tanking my freshman year. I'm going to the right college, but I can't replicate the circumstances of our meeting.\n\nThere's hope, but it's a slim hope. I go to college. I know what clubs she goes to, what friends she has. I contrive to be wherever she is. I spend months in her orbit, working up to asking her out. How do you ask out someone you were with for 13 years, then lost 8 years ago, who doesn't remember you at all? How do you approach her with the baggage of your entire relationship that she has no knowledge of?\n\nEventually I do it. I ask her out. She says no. I don't understand. My entire world is crashing down around me. She is my wife, doesn't she understand? I go crazy, it scares her and she runs away. I try to follow her, but she hits a campus safety panic button.\n\nWith my history of \"mental illness\", I'm involuntarily committed. I spend a month in the asylum.\n\nTwo men in suits \"visit\" me one day. They say they can get me out. But, I have to tell them about 9/11. It's the FBI agents from all those years ago. I've given up. I tell them everything. They get me out. I'm setup with a nice house in the middle of nowhere, a good computer, state of the art internet. And I have to keep feeding them information about the future.\n\nIn my free time, I'm a software engineering consultant. The FBI pays my expenses, so anything I make is spare money. January 2, 2009 I've built a GPU beast of a computer. January 3, 2009 I start mining BitCoin. I mine a lot. I mine far more than anyone expected someone could mine so early. The BitCoin economy never takes off, because no one else can get in on the early mining with normal computing hardware. \"Cryptocurrency\" fails before it can even get a start.\n\nTwo years later the FBI approaches me, looking for more information about the future. I've got nothing left; I've told them everything I can remember.\n\nThey kick me out, and repossess all the computers they bought me, and \"appropriate as evidence\" all the ones I bought myself.\n\nI've got nothing left. I wander the streets of small towns, hitchhiking half-hazardly. I lay down on a park bench one night.\n\nThe next morning, I don't get up.\n\nSo that's a hard \"_No._\"",
            "Of course. It would be easy to use your knowledge of the future to become wealthy. You know all the right companies to invest in. You know about bitcoin before it becomes big. For me, the most frustrating thing would be having the mind of an adult and having to endure being treated like a child. Would definitely tough it out though. ",
            "Absolutely I would.\n\nI actually play this scenario out in my head all the time. It thrills me to think about going back to 10 years old with all the knowledge I have today because I could make something of myself and not make the same mistakes I've made later in life (I'm 22). I wouldn't be a disappointment.\n\nIt would also be fun to write music lyrics of current songs or discuss college level information and blow people's minds.\n\nI also want to wear a bathing suit and not care about how I look because I developed an eating disorder at 11. \n\nGod I wish I could go back.",
            "Absolutely not. I'm not spending one fucking second inside a school ever again.",
            "Yes. My brain/emotional/intelligence development was really hampered by neglect & emotional abuse growing up and I didn't know at the time because I had no way to compare it or prove it, and now it takes manual effort every day to learn how to \"be\" around people and to fight off the urge to be suicidal because it's so normal after years of training.",
            "If I can look up the winning lottery numbers real quick, then yes. If not, I know who will get elected president and who won the super bowl last year. That should get me a pretty penny.\n\nAnd I would need to keep a lookout for a company called Uber, and then invest, invest, invest.",
            "No.. I probably wouldn\u2019t choose my children\u2019s father a second time. But those kids are perfect and all my mistakes leading up to them were totally worth it!",
            "All the top comments saying yes are completely ignoring the emotional costs. It was my answer for a long time too, I used to daydream about this. But I have cherished friends, a blossoming relationship and two younger siblings that wouldn\u2019t have been born yet and I would not find that sacrifice worthwhile. I\u2019d also probably not be prepared for the loss of autonomy that comes with being 10 years old. I also imagine it would be quite lonely since I don\u2019t think other children and teens would be particularly enjoyable company. \n\nThough it would be nice to get a head start on my hobbies, graduate high school at 13, and make bank on stocks and bitcoin. \n\n",
            "10, no 16, maybe. 18, yes.",
            "Do I get to be 10 in the 1980's again or does it have to be present day?\n\nIf I could go back to the 80's I'd be all over it, nowadays not so much.",
            "Absolutely I would start over. I'd get to see my dad again, and I'd also get to avoid the botched medical procedure I had that's pretty much fucked up my entire adult life. 10/10 would start over if given the chance.",
            "No, I won't. check the replies here.\n\nA healthy diet, exercise, study or lost opportunities.\n\nGuys! C'mon! You can do it today, too. You do not need a magical wand.\n\nEven if you can go, you will not do them.",
            "Absolutely!!! So many decisions I would change.\n\nI would beat the crap out of my middle school bully first time he hit me. \n\nI would go with a different college degree.\n\nAnd I would definitely not be so shy about asking the girls out that I talked myself out of asking out.\n\nBut in the end, I would be able to make more informed decisions. Nothing to lose there.",
            "No, I don't think I would. While there's all the obvious things - spending more time working out/staying in shape, knowing enough to choose better jobs or careers, figuring out some things that I messed up, invest in BitCoin, the usual stuff... I think that by the time I'd be old enough to do anything, I'd have gone absolutely insane.\n\nDon't forget that you're now the mind of a full grown adult in the body of a ten year old. That means all the things you're used to being able to just... do, you can't. Either legally, logistically, or physically. Want to go somewhere? Can't unless your parents drive you. Want to watch that movie? Get mom's permission first! Hungry? Better wait for dinner! Hop on the internet? Even if you have it (which you might not!) get ready for kid blockers on most ISPs for a long time.\n\nYou're also going to become entirely isolated from your peer group. Again, you're a full grown adult that now has to relive years of elementary and middle school among kids. Yeah, it's cool you're smart enough to blaze through the school work, but you still have to have social interactions in a way that would be stimulating or interesting. It's going to be *years* before you can have discussions, debates, or even just conversations on the level you're used to having. You can't talk about your favorite media if it hasn't been made yet, your favorite book if it hasn't been written, your biggest interest if the research hasn't been done yet.\n\nAnd then let's not get into the crushing burdens of future knowledge. I was 10 years old in 1999. That's two years to prevent September 11th! Only... how do I do it? I'm gonna be 10, then 12 years old. How exactly am I supposed to convince a pre-9/11 world that something like 9/11 could happen. How do you do that without people or your parents being convinced you're just nuts? How do you try to report or warn of something like that without getting in trouble? And then you have to just wait... just wait for it to happen. You *know* it's going to happen. You *know* it's going to change the world\n\nAnd you can't. Do. Anything.\n\nAdd onto that all the little things like that. Family members fighting with each other, breaking up, dying from illness or accidents, all things that you'd have no way as a kid or even teenager to influence or impact. No matter what you do, that blood clot or stroke or tumor is still going to be there in that loved one. And while there's a certain joy to getting to spend more time with them, you still have to watch them die again.\n\nAnd then what if you're married now, or have kids? How long is it until you meet your spouse? How many relationships did you have before then? How many did *they* have? How long did you know each other before you'd actually started going out? Imagine seeing someone, someone you *know* you're meant to be with, someone you love with all your heart, but not only are they possibly far too young to really understand what you're expressing, but you're going into a relationship fully formed with all the knowledge and experience with them, and they might not even know you. \n\nMy wife and I were friends for almost a decade before we started dating - that would be a decade of seeing her going through other relationships or being with other people until the time was right. And if you try to change that, to get together sooner, how do you not come off like a total creep? You know all their little secrets, their likes and dislikes, things you don't even register consciously about them that you know or account for. Imagine a total stranger coming up to you and interacting like they've known you for ages, and you've never even met them before. How freaked out would you be?\n\nAnd what if you have kids? Assuming you actually manage to get with the same person you were originally with, will your kid in the new timeline be the same one? What if you had a son and suddenly a daughter, or even something where your child acted or looked a certain way, but a different sperm and egg connected because of your new life and they're entirely different? How do you handle that?\n\nSo you've got to deal with a sudden and total lack of independence, down to things like when you go to sleep, no relatable peer groups or interactions, foreknowledge of events that you'll be utterly helpless to actually influence, and the constant worry about relationships or entire people that might not even properly exist yet... it would drive you mad. It would be hell. And there'd be no one you could talk to about it that would believe it was true.\n\nAt best, you're that weird kid who thinks he's from the future and everyone just kinda looks at you weird. At worst, you're put on medication or therapy that will slowly break your mind and convince you the whole other life you had was just your imagination, erasing your entire reason to relive your life and fix things - after all, it was just a delusion, and thanks to your meds you can't even really remember that much about it anyway.\n\nWhile I'm sure there are people who are in positions where it would be a blessing to go back... I'm definitely not one of them. And I think realistically most people wouldn't be either, if you really think about it.",

So I watched it, it was slow moving, a bit boring.\n\nAnd then the grandma asks her grandson if he's going to become a doctor like his father, when he's older. The kid is too busy playing to pay attention to his grandma. At which point the grandma says \"I wonder if I'll still be alive by the time you become a doctor.\"\n\nGrandma and grandpa, seem really happy, but she lets it slip he used to get very drunk and be abusive. He starts drinking again, when they visit their children.\n\nThe children are too busy taking care of their children, to properly care for their parents. So the grandparents are also heartbroken about that, although they keep smiling.\n\nThe only one who cares for the grandparents, is the widow of their middle son, who died during the war. At one point the grandmother, says to the widow of her son: \"You may be happy while you're still young. But as you become older, you'll find it lonely.\" To which the woman who's been taking care of the grandparents replies: \"I won't get that old, so don't worry.\". Smiling politely all the way through, even though she's hurting so badly.\n\nI spent much of that movie, crying. Such a depressingly honest view on what life is often like. Tragic.\n\nHonestly, it hit me harder than Grave of the Fireflies or Come and See.",

But the hubby wasn't as on board with it as I was. Mainly because he didn't want to get attached to a kid and then have them ripped away. Which i get. It takes a strong person to be able to go through something like that. \n\nAnd I did look into adopting local older kids (I didnt want to adopt a baby. Everyone always goes for the babies. I wanted an older child). And I was told I needed to have close to $30,000 to adopt. I dont know why I was given that number but thats what it was. Im currently pregnant with my second and I would still love to adopt. Im hoping once the kids are a little older, we can find a way to do this. I love children and would adopt everyone if I could.

You're paralyzed by the fear of rejection and preemptively reject/hurt others to save yourself pain but drive yourself to further loneliness and self-hate.\n\nNone of this is your fault, but it is within your power to change. First you have to stop hating yourself.\n\nThat doesn't mean berate yourself more for not being perfect, that means accepting you aren't perfect *and being okay with that*. This will likely take you years. It will take you decades if you don't let someone else help you.\n\nI don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but the next step will be not judging others so harshly and understanding that other people don't have to be perfect, just good enough. I know I can't convince you that other people are safe, but they just have to be safe enough. You can have a range of people in your life. We don't really need to worry about this yet, but it's something you can keep in the back of your mind.\n\nI love you. Believe it or not. I wish someone could've been there for me the way I'm here for you now. You're still a kid and it's hard to believe that, for me, 3 years later, I was living on my own, pay my own bills, making my own way in the world.\n\nYou've been taught so few good life lessons first hand; what you know best is that life is arbitrary and capricious but it doesn't have to be that way. You don't have to make life worse for those around you. People will like you for who you are, and some won't, and that's okay too.\n\nI promise things can get better. And I promise you have the strength to make them better.\n\n----\n\nDoesn't sound like an argument, but 16 year old would not want to hear any of this.

It was a higher level than the PCs, so the idea was that they would need to flee every encounter and take measures to avoid being followed; having someone on their tail constantly tracking them that could and would actually kill them was supposed to inject a sense of urgency into the game.\n>\n>On the first encounter, the werewolf was shown methodically slaying a large group of town guards and a high-ranking paladin. The characters were around level 5 or so, the NPC was probably CR 12 and would scale as they leveled. They interrupted the combat, and the idea was that they would attempt to fight the werewolf (who didn't consider them a threat initially, and so wouldn't just murder the whole party), see it killing a high-level character, and go \"Oh shit, we need to run from it\" while it slaughtered the rest of the guards.\n>\n>So at first, they rush in to help and attack the werewolf, doing little damage because they don't have silver weapons and I gave this particular NPC a regeneration ability only stopped by silver. I have the werewolf attack one of the players with a secondary bite attack, which should put them to fairly low health without killing them outright.\n>\n>That player pauses for a moment, and then asks if he can try to block the attack with his hand. I'm not sure what he's getting at, but I humor him and say he can do that with a DC 10 Dexterity check, although it won't affect what kind of damage he takes. He succeeds. He then asks if he can jam his hand into the werewolf's mouth. I say... sure, but he's probably going to bite it off, and you'll need a new hand. He says \"Even better.\"\n>\n>I describe the werewolf doing so. The rest of combat continues until the player's turn, who seems undisturbed by the loss of a hand, and on his turn he says \"I activate Quaal's feather token to make a tree.\"\n>\n>This token is a magic one-time use item that creates a 5 foot diameter, 40 foot high tree. It's a handy utility item that our playgroup was fond of- previously we'd used it to do things from just making bridges and crossing walls, to providing a druid with a way to use a particular spell in plant-less areas that require trees. It didn't seem to have much use here.\n>\n>I ask him where on the board he's activating it. He points at the werewolf. I say that the most that's going to do is knock the werewolf prone, and he gets a fairly easy save to prevent that. He smiles. \"No, it's in the werewolf.\"\n>\n>\"What? How?\"\n>\n>\"I was holding it when he ate my hand.\"\n>\n>Me and the rest of the party are kind of silent for a second. I'm trying to think of a valid reason why this won't work. I fail. The werewolf now has a five foot wide tree growing out of him. The fact that he has regeneration doesn't particularly help when little bits of him are plastered on walls twenty feet away.\n>\n>The entire party celebrated and they got a reward from the town and an ally in the paladin who was supposed to be dead.\n>\n>I had to make a new NPC.\n>\n>Clever players are awesome.",

We had an NPC stalking us through the travel portion of the campaign and would show up and do odd things like pull out his eye and show it to us, and then pop it back in, just gross stuff because he was undead. One time I used a pickpocket check to take it from him, and he insisted that I give it back to him. We were in the temple for the god of trickery, which we both worshipped... so I put his eye in the collection plate. He could either take it out and suffer the consequence, or lose the eye for good.\n\nThat was a great moment.",

            "I found a homebrew item someplace called a used bag of holding. It basically covers everything you put in the bag with a thin layer of glitter. One of my players took this and began scraping off the glitter and collecting it. Eventually he had enough glitter bags to where he could use animate objects on it.

What I didn't expect was them getting creative. They just made the bag bigger by sewing more onto it, and then rolled it up. Still cumbersome, as I forced extra turns to use the thing if they wanted to use it in combat, but was a great laugh at how they undermined my bullshit. Since it weighs 15 pounds regardless of internal weight, it was still a tool. \n\nFrost sock: Everyone's feet became blocks of ice. They did it, and immediately nat 20'd on a melee, so I went with it caused enemies feet to detach from their ankle and stay stuck to the floor. \n\nSwarm of flies: just a swarm of flies, no damage. Just annoying. They used it inside a tavern to create a wild distraction, and made their own entrance into the plot related area. \n\nBluntify weapons: a spell that creates a magical barrier that prevents the weapon from ever making contact with anything. Has to be done while holding the weapon. So they just snuck into a guards armory and did it to all their weapons, and then robbed a bank.

It was meant to add some colour, and the party wizard, a human woman, claimed it. There was talk of using it to fix and clean everyone's clothes etc, discussions about whether it could mend armor (it couldn't) etc. But the real effect was during a showdown with a BBEG.\n\nThe wizard also had a ring of fire resistance, as well as a unique item called a Blast Scepter. The Blast Scepter was sort of like a buffed wand of fireballs, but also gave the wearer resistance to both explosive damage and fire resistance. Stacked with the ring of fire resistance, the wizard would take 1/4th damage from fireballs, and no damage on a successful save, with huge saving throw bonuses. Facing off against the BBEG who happened to be a Fire Wizard, she taunted him out in the open to give her his best shot. Boom, huge enhanced fireball, smoke clears, and there stands the wizard without a scratch on her or even so much as a singe, except now her hair is done up in an elaborate style, her makeup is on point and her clothes are crisp and clean. She basically was immune to fireballs, but the psychological effect of giving your enemy your best shot and now their make up and hair is done and their clothes are clean and pressed made the BBEG run for it.\n\nPsychological warfare at it's finest.",

We then went on a two year long campaign of tracking down an evil time travelling wizard with antics that included poisoning a bunch of rich people with ice cream, crashing a zeppelin, a player character going insane and trying murder his way to the presidency, fighting a train monster, then finally confronting the evil wizard in a pocket dimension.\n\nWe were, somehow, woefully underprepared to fight the bath robe wearing wizard as he was immune to all forms of damage.

            "Either a simple barrel or (if you consider that an item) a seagull's corpse.\n\nThe barrel was used to simply roll down a corridor in order to spring traps in advance. Pretty simple and straightforward, I guess, but this one player carried a barrel through practically the whole dungeon. It is now an inside joke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe seagull's corpse was obtained during the very first session (we had only new players and they were toying around with the world; it was still the most random act I've ever seen happen) and used during the second (I asked them what they wanted to do and they wanted a classic dungeon crawl, so I designed a very stereotypical crypt sort of thing), to more or less circumvent my first custom bossfight. Basically, it was a door with a bowl and a knife in front of it. There was also some writing on it, but noone could read it (basically a failsafe, should they not immediately understand what was going on; the wizard knew \"comprehend languages\").  \nAnyway, they immediately understood they needed to fill the bowl with blood to open the door, and the druid was about to just take that one HP of damage, because who cares. The wizard stopped the others though, saying: \"Ah, nono, wait a moment. I've got blood on me, just a sec. - \\[I pull out the corpse of the seagull I got last time.\\]\" - I had completely forgotten about it, and just planted my head on the table. \"Aight.\"  \nNow, the plan was for one of the players to offer their blood, which would then open the door. Afterwards, they'd find themselves in a room with a sarcophagus on some sort of elevation. As soon as they fully entered the room, the doors would fly shut and the sarcophagus open, with whoever offered their blood coming out of it (an empowered version of that, anyway).  \nApparently, the wizard immediately knew what I was going to do (with the other two not expecting that kind of boss) and even apologized to me; she didn't know \"\"\"derailing\"\"\" or simply cheesing bosses was very much part of the whole game.Anyroad, I thought about what exactly to do, but decided to just use the same mechanics I would've used for the players, as it was the most funny and practical solution to me. The seagull actually went first in initiative and managed to hit the Druid quite badly (I think it was a crit, but I don't actually remember), but the wizard just completely annihilated it.  \nMy other ideas were to either just not let it work with non-humanoid blood (which I immediately disposed of, because that's no fun) or to make it some large gull-esque abomination, but I was very inexperienced as a DM and I wasn't sure if I could balance that on the fly. Would've been the best solution, probably.  \n\n\nThere was also a broken wall somewhere in the crypt though, with a small natural cave thing adjacent. Inside was a Black Dragon Wyrmling which served as some kind of optional boss fight; it was not part of their quest, but they obviously decided to fight it.

            "We had an adventure that involved the characters delving into one of the character's dreams to heal some supernatural wounds.  \n\nIn one part of the dream, there was a guard who had a ticking heart, and they were able to use a small door in his chest to open it up and fix his heart - then they took the little door with them.\n\nAnother portion involved battling a tiny version of the Pope who could shoot lightning from his fingers.  When they killed him, it turned out he was made out of potato (La Popa, rather than El Popa) and one of the characters took a sample of the Pope Potato with them.\n\nLater, visiting the final island they found a dollar store stocked solely with brass items.  One of the characters who was a jazz fan used the opportunity to buy a saxophone.\n\nFrom there, wandering through the moors they were set upon by a ravenous piranhamoose.  The jazz fan managed to roll a critical success on his saxophone skill, and tamed the beast.\n\nHeading down into the final dungeon they ran into a rat spirit, and managed to bribe it with the Pope Potato to give them information and act as a guide.\n\nThen as part of one the character's traumatic childhood memory they were attacked by a swarm of golden retriever puppies that started dragging them into the water.  No one was able to start attacking or killing the puppies - but then they remembered the little door, and used than to open a hatch in the ground and pushed the puppies through the door.\n\nI hadn't planned the resolutions of any of these encounters, but the players were able to use these earlier found items that seemed weird and useless at the time to complete the adventure.

            "My family lives far apart and my siblings and parents and I rarely get to hang out. The last time we did, we were trying to figure out how to spend the last few hours before going to the airport, and my brothers asked me to run a freeform game.\n\nMy dad hates that I play and thinks it's a stupid game, but he stayed for it, at least. I had everyone create a character (focused on personalities: likes, dislikes, fears, etc) and when I got to my dad, he said \"I'm a rock.\" I asked his name, and he said, \"I don't have a name. I'm just a rock.\" He couldn't talk, and there wasn't anything special about him. He was just a rock. So my oldest brother scooped him up and pocketed him and said it was a cool looking rock he had found somewhere. \n\nYou would think that the rock would have been used as a weapon, or at least a distraction, but no. Dad's rock was far more valuable. You see, the quest I gave them involved recovering a stolen ring that a tribe of goblins had stolen from a giant. (The goblin king was wearing it as a crown.) My family fought their way through the guards and into the main hall to confront the goblin king. They barged in to find themselves surrounded by goblins, who were startled for a moment, but quickly started reaching for weapons. My brother held the rock high and announced that he had a magical rock that would destroy their whole tribe if they didn't give back the ring/crown. After a moment of hesitation, the goblins decided \"That's just an ordinary rock. You're bluffing!\" and moved to attack. At this point, my mom pulled out a magic wand (she had a bag of them with random effects) and cast a spell on the rock. By chance, this spell turned the rock into, effectively, a shiny disco ball. The next wand she pulled out made exploding sound effects. The goblins were astonished, and in the end, my family agreed to trade their \"magic\" rock for the giant's ring and the goodwill of the goblins. \n\nSo even though he refused to play, my dad was the hero.",

The castle has mostly normal rooms, but also one room that's just filled with chickens. This was meant to be a jokey room where they walk in, see the chickens, have a laugh, and then leave. Nope. They ask how many chickens are in the room. I let them roll for it (d100 since it's a big room). 40-ish chickens. They then proceed to steal the chickens. Okay, I can work with this. They decide to name the chickens. The chickens travel across the continent with them. They return to the beanstalk to take more chickens. Now my party has a chicken army.",
            "Several years ago, I played in a quick one-shot session where the DM wanted to make the rules really simple. We did a simple D&D attribute array but had no skills.   \n\r  \nInstead, we would roll a D20 and if the result was below your attribute score for the task you were trying to accomplish you would succeed. For instance, to hit with a bow was a Dex roll below your Dex score. 20's were critical successes and 1's were critical failures.   \r  \n\n\nI wanted to play a pixie fairy, which was not one of the races he had in mind, but he agreed as long as we would alter my stats. He gave me a huge negative to my HP and Strength, but in return super boosted my Dex. I rolled my stats and assigned my points and ended up with a Strength of 4 and a Dex of 23. This meant I could not miss a shot unless I rolled a 1. \r  \n\n\nHe then asked what weapon I wanted to use, and I said something ranged like maybe a blowgun. Since I couldn\u2019t miss my shots we agreed that instead of doing damage my darts would have a series of random comical effects: itching, explosive diarrhea, sleepiness, sexual attraction, blindness, etc. \n\n\r  \nThe game begins and our goal is to defend a castle from a coming threat of an Orc army. The Orcs brought two giant T-Rex's and the leader of the Orcs was riding a sabertooth tiger. We hear a war horn and see the orc army charging across the field, their leader galloping full speed atop his mount. With my high Dex I got to go first:\r  \n\r  \nMe: I fire an explosive diarrhea dart at the sabertooth tiger the Orc leader is riding. \r  \nDM: OK...?\r  \nMe: If the Orc leader was riding a horse, then it could run and poop at the same time. Unfortunately for him, cats cannot. \r  \nDM: Oh...Oh! Ok, so the tiger abruptly stops running (rolls a dice), throwing off his rider due to the sudden stop. The orc leader lands on the ground and (rolls another dice, crit failure) bashes his head on a rock and dies. \r  \n\n\nThis was just the start of the shenanigans for that game session. Front line Orcs were blinded and trampled to death. Orcs trying to scale the tower were put to sleep and fell to their demise. At one point I made one of the T-Rex's itchy (thus angry) and another one sexually turned on. Needless to say, that didn\u2019t end well for either of them and took both of the largest threats off of the board. By the end of the game, my tiny pixie fairy with no damage dealing weapon ended up killing more enemies on the battlefield than any other player.",
            "My DM once gave me a bag. just an empty burlap bag. i cut it into a shirt and gave it to a poor boy, recruiting him to follow me as my squire. him, his little brother, and sister became soldiers and once my character got killed, i went on to play as them. it became my most memorable campaign ever because my character(s) ended up existing solely because of roleplay and everything they owned they got during the campaign.",

            "Player here, and the system was Exalted, but the story still fits. Our party was off trekking over vast terrain that included going over an extremely dangerous (and desolate) mountain pass. The DM's intent was that we start shedding gear as we go along to travel lighter/faster and our rations were quickly running out. \n\nThe DM described the last bit of forest we went through as having huge mammoth-like creatures, so of course we killed one for its meat. It was supposed to be just a bit of background fluff, but we had no rations left and only a single tent to cram the whole party in for rests, on top of our fighting gear. \n\nAfter taking down the mammoth, the DM looked so pleased when he told us how much the thing weighed and how much we could feasibly carry. \n\nSo I suggested we make a sledge out of the mammoth's tusks and leg bones, tents and sleeping bags from the hide, and pile as much of the meat on it as we could haul. Saved the party from dying of starvation halfway through the trek!",
            "Was the player but I never get to tell this story. \n\nIn a game called Earthdawn, instead of zombies, they\u2019re called cadaver men. There were also fairy people called Windlings, who are generally 18\u201d tall. \n\nOkay, so my thief character is going through a dungeon with an illusionist when we enter a room to find 20 or so cadaver Windlings. Their wings have rotted off so they all start walking slowly towards us. A couple at a time wouldn\u2019t be a big deal but a large group of anything can kill you. \n\nSince they were moving at a snail\u2019s pace, though, I had my buddy help me remove the door we came through from it\u2019s simple hinges and threw it at the group. Crushed at least half of them and we quickly got rid of the rest. I was really proud of that.",

The next Halloween (yes, almost a year later) we had a Halloween themed quest with Jason Voorhees\u2026\u2026we were really struggling to beat him. Until one of us whipped out that Christmas bag and sucked him into the nothingness forever. Our DM was shocked. \n\nWe later discovered it just sucked him into a different dimension, and we encountered him during a new quest (touch\u00e9, DM).",

            ">The Ugly Stick. When a creature is struck by The Ugly Stick, they take one point of damage (regardless of the strength score of the wielder), gain a +1 bonus to charisma based skill checks and spells that target goblins, hobgoblins, and other goblinoid creatures, and gain a -1 penalty to charisma based skill checks and spells that target anything that is not a goblinoid creature. The bonus/penalty lasts until the struck creature kisses a goblin (with their consent) or the struck creature is kissed by a goblin.\n\n\nThe exploit was that I forgot to include a cap on the amount of times a creature can be struck, so a player could just keep hitting themselves with the Ugly Stick and become extremely attractive and persuasive to goblins, while also becoming extremely revolting and untrustworthy to everyone else. It got to the point where the gods themselves were affected, sending paladins on quests to smite the unbelievably ugly player, while the goblinoid deities granted the player their boons."

The main one from a healthcare point of view is education rather than restriction.\n\nThe primary way for a government to offset the added costs of healthcare is to tax the shit out of the activities like the ones mentioned. There are no restrictions to what you can eat or drink or how much tobacco you can smoke but the tax added to their purchase can absorb some of the added healthcare costs associated with them as well as acting to discourage some from using them to excess. \n\nEdit. rereading the question, the only one I would consider making illegal is smoking as that affects the health of people other than the smoker.

            "I'm just going to repost this from [an OOTL thread from a couple of days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/f34m9u/whats_the_deal_with_bloomberg_paying_meme_pages/fhh4ksi/). For anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the fact that Bloomberg has been paying people to make memes where he looks relatable... well, here you go.\n\nMike Bloomberg is spending a truly *astonishing* amount on his run for the Presidency. Between October 1st and December 31st of 2019, he outspent [literally everyone else in the Democratic field](https://www.axios.com/bloomberg-spending-2020-election-2ceac839-1efc-4914-afe2-66016ac20faf.html) -- not individually, mind you, but *combined* (including Tom Steyer, who's *also* a self-funding billionaire). He's said he's open to spending [a literal billion dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/11/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-spending.html). (That's would still make it the most expensive run for a single candidate of all time, but it's also doubly important to note that it's largely *his* money, whereas other candidates are generally funded by donations. Bloomberg is worth some $62 billion, so the amount of money he could throw at the campaign if he chose to outstrips pretty much anyone else who might enter the race.)\n\nThis has led to somewhat serious concerns that Bloomberg is attempting to buy the nomination (as writer Naomi Klein put it, ['This is what plutocracy looks like'](https://twitter.com/NaomiAKlein/status/1226957955691618304)), and memes about the extent to which he's throwing money around -- Bloomberg being so old and out of touch (he's 78) that he's resorting to throwing money at Instagrammers and YouTubers to get a foothold in the youth vote. On the surface, this looks pretty ridiculous: the idea that Bloomberg is trying to get on the youth bandwagon -- by both reaching out to the 'cool' side of the internet with wads of cash and being comically bad at understanding the culture he's trying to buy -- is a joke that pretty much writes itself.\n\nThat said, there's an argument to be made that seemingly grassroots political movements (known as ['astroturfing'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)) have a pretty long history; the *Washington Post* warned about this [in 2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/26/the-three-types-of-political-astroturfing-youll-see-in-2016/), noting that 'third parties have become increasingly interested in pushing the sorts of amateurish online content that you or I might whip up in Paint'. Whether truly grassroots or funded by larger organisations, when it *seems* authentic it works: you can comfortably point to the success of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump alike as being built (at least in part) on their supporters' willingness to use meme culture to their advantage. (Figuring out precisely to what extent this willingness is organic is left as an exercise for the reader.)\n\nAt first, that's where I thought the story ended: the whole thing was a joke, simple as that.\n\nExcept it's not. And this is where things get weird.\n\nShortly after these posts were made, the *New York Times* posted [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/michael-bloomberg-memes-jerry-media.html), in which it claims that these posts are legitimate: that they *really were* paid for by the Bloomberg campaign, and they came from collaboration with a company called -- I shit you not -- Meme2020. As the *Times* noted:\n\n>\u201cMike Bloomberg 2020 has teamed up with social creators to collaborate with the campaign, including the meme world,\u201d Sabrina Singh, a senior national spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign, said in a statement. \u201cWhile a meme strategy may be new to presidential politics, we\u2019re betting it will be an effective component to reach people where they are and compete with President Trump\u2019s powerful digital operation.\u201d\n\nThe result? Things like [this](https://imgur.com/a/Gwl9hTM), where users have outright posted 'yes this is really #sponsored by @mikebloomberg' in the caption. This has led to a weird sort of hinterland, where users aren't really sure whether it's genuine or paid for, all of which is by design:\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s the most successful ad that I\u2019ve ever posted,\u201d Mr. Resch [director of influencer marketing at Brandfire and founder of @Tank.Sinatra] said, \u201cand I think a lot of it came from people being confused whether or not it was real.\u201d\n\n>Other influencers have been quick to praise the campaign. \u201cBest advert ever,\u201d commented Chris Burkard, a travel influencer who has more than 3.5 million followers. \u201cSo good,\u201d commented Jason Strauss, a partner at the Tao Group.\n\nThe *content* of the memes is obviously not real -- Bloomberg isn't sliding into anyone's DMs -- but the fact that they're memes-for-hire is. The *Times* also reports that this is fairly widespread; they've given a list of some of the memers involved (@MyTherapistSays, @WhitePeopleHumor, @TheFunnyIntrovert, @KaleSalad, @Sonny5ideUp, @Tank.Sinatra, @ShitheadSteve, @adam.the.creator, @moistbudda, @MrsDowJones, @TrashCanPaul, @cohmedy, @NeatDad, @FourTwenty, @GolfersDoingThings, @DrGrayFang, @MiddleClassFancy and @DoYouEvenLift, among others, none of which I'm going to be linking to directly), and note that they have a collective audience of sixty million followers. (For comparison, that puts it around [the entire population of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population).) You'll also note that the two people who commented on @Tank.Sinatra's meme up there -- @WhitePeopleHumor and @DrGrayFang -- are on that list. They're not just producing the content, but promoting each others' work.\n\nRemember: **this is bought and paid for by a political campaign, and is designed to sway your opinion of the candidate**. As strange (and, frankly, irrational) as it might seem at first glance for Bloomberg's campaign to be paying for people to mock him for being old and out of touch, they wouldn't be doing it if they thought it would hurt rather than help his chances at the Presidency. (The *Times* noted that the goal was to 'build a self-aware ironic character around Mr. Bloomberg'.)\n\nWe don't (as yet, and as far as I can tell) know what was asked of the content producers, nor specifically how much they were paid. Last week, the *Daily Beast* reported that the Bloomberg campaign was offering $150 to 'influencers' with between 1,000 and 100,000 followers for a post ['that tells us why Mike Bloomberg is the electable candidate who can rise above the fray, work across the aisle so ALL Americans feel heard & respected.'](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mike-bloomberg-is-paying-influencers-to-make-him-seem-cool-9?ref=author) This might seem similar, and on a surface level it is, but this is a whole different thing: the posts from people like ShitheadSteve have nothing to do with demonstrating Bloomberg's 'electability' (if anything, it seems to be dedicated to softening his image, considering that a lot of recent media focus has been on things like [his history of Stop and Frisk policies in New York](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/13/bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-114755), which have been getting a lot of flack as Bloomberg has garnered more attention). It's also worth noting that -- as one example -- ShitheadSteve has [comfortably over five million followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/shitheadsteve), so even though we don't know the exact figure, it's reasonable to assume that he got paid more than the $150 Bloomberg was offering to smaller producers.\n\nNeedless to say, pushback has been swift. The lack of authenticity of the campaign has rankled a lot of people -- you only have to look at the comment section of these meme pages to see how angry people are -- but by all accounts it seems to be worth it, and the concept is spreading:\n\n>After several large Instagram memers became aware on Wednesday of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s influencer campaign, many expressed an interest in creating sponsored posts for him. The campaign so far has seemed amenable. \u201cWe want to work with creators and we\u2019ve never been shy about paying people for creative work,\u201d the aide said.\n\n>Teenagers, many of whom can\u2019t yet vote themselves, seemed excited about the prospect. \u201cI would be down \u2014 bread is bread,\u201d said the teenager who runs the meme page @BigDadWhip. \u201cThat would be kind of dope. I could say I helped a presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nSo, to clarify, we're living in a world where the former mayor of New York City is paying struggling millennials, teenagers and a man called ShitheadSteve to make him look old and out of touch in an attempt to win the Democratic nomination to be the President and Commander in Chief of the United States of America, following on from [that guy from *The Apprentice*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#The_Apprentice) who may have made his way into the White House on the back of a [cartoon frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog).\n\nHold onto your butts, boys and girls. This is going to be a *weird* election cycle.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm getting a lot of comments about how the Trump campaign did the same thing in 2016, and my answer is, 'Yes... *sort of*'. I wrote about that in *somehow even more detail* (among other things) [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/c5txu6/whats_going_on_with_rthe_donald_why_they_got/es42drp/).",

            "Not defending his perspective, but I think I can offer at least some insight into the mind of one Bloomberg supporter I know;  my dad.\n\nMy dad, through the mid 2000's or so, identified as a republican.  But he was definitely on the more moderate side of that spectrum, conservative about economics, but anti-war, pro-environmental protections, and a \"leave people alone\" mentality on social issues.  He doesn't like talking about politics, but he pays attention.  He didn't like it when politicians lied or made outrageous claims, but would respect one if they seemed forthright, honest, and didn't treat him like an idiot.  He doesn't really pay a lot of attention to political gamesmanship, so things like whether Bloomburg bought his way into the party doesn't really matter to him.\n\nHe voted for McCain in 2008, but Obama in 2012.  It was during Obama's administration that he really started to sour on the republican party.  The more blatantly inaccurate GOP claims became, the more personally insulted he felt.  Trump seemed like the culmination of everything he didn't like about the party going into 2016, and so he switched his party affiliation to Dem for the 2016 election, and voted Clinton.\n\nSo now you have a man who feels abandoned by the party that used to represent his center-right views, in the Democratic party.  And here comes a candidate that seems straight out of that party he used to identify with.\n\nFor people like my dad, Bloomburg is the sort of person he'd always have voted for.  That isn't to say he'd ONLY vote for Bloomburg (he's essentially in the \"anyone but Trump\" camp), but if you were to poll him, he'd pick Bloomburg.  I don't know how much of his support comes from people that felt abandoned by the GOP, but from my sole, anecdotal example, I can at least kind of see it.",

He's never voted republican in his entire life.   \n\nHe was a fan of the Clintons, Bill more than Hillary.  He calls Obama the best president of his lifetime, specifically because of how moderate/centrist he governed (much closer to center than he campaigned as).  \n\nThe other candidate he likes best is Buttigieg but he thinks he's too young and inexperienced.   \n\nHe despises Trump, and wants to nominate the person with the best chance of beating him.

I'm fairly sure Reddit liberals skew harder left than the general population of American democrats. So while for us a Bloomberg presidency seems like anathema for them he's a perfect fit.\n\nDemocrats have a harder time choosing a viable candidate because there are so many \"groups\" in their movement:\n\nGROUP 1: you have a working class, primarily white \"wing\" in the Rust Belt and New England, economically liberal but socially conservative\n\nGROUP 2: you have the far left, \"Woke\" / Antifa crowd that wants to nationalize the means of production and guillotine billionaires\n\nGROUP 3: you have ethnic minorities like Hispanics, Asians and Blacks who while supportive of progressive economics tend to lean conservative in a bunch of issues like abortion and gay marriage\n\nSo it's not easy coming up with a candidate that is acceptable to all three groups. Sanders right now seems to have the most broad support with Group 2 and Group 3...but maybe not Group 1? Bloomberg obviously appeals to Group 1 but obviously not Group 2 or Group 3.\n\nThe secret then is to ditch all emotion and feelings and just make a cold mathematical choice: which candidate will most likely mobilize voters in Swing States.

            "I\u2019m not a Bloomberg supporter, but I do work in Democratic politics. From my point of view, here are the two best (and possibly only) good things about Bloomberg:\n\n1. He\u2019s paying his staff better than anyone. You can expect to make about 2.5x what you\u2019d make on other campaigns. And, he\u2019s planning to pay his staff through November. That combination of job security and pay is unheard of in politics. If I worked for Bloomberg through November 2020, I\u2019d make the same amount of money as I would in my current job through October 2021. It\u2019s life changing money.\n\n2. He\u2019s giving money to the party (this includes more than just the DNC). He\u2019s financing important, long-term projects Democrats need to build party infrastructure. That\u2019s important to sustainable success for the party.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to dislike about Bloomberg.

            "Likely will get downvoted, but heres a serious long reply from an independent voter:\n\nAs a person, Bloomberg clearly has an understanding of complexity and is competent without radical positions on most issues (something you really can\u2019t say about most the other candidates). Bloomberg actually understands business through building a service that almost all of wall street is reliant on and he understands the political game through being mayor of NY. Further, he\u2019s spending his own money to prevent trump from entering the office. People seem to be trying to make it a negative point that a billionaire is trying to \u201cbuy the presidency\u201d; however, I\u2019d argue it shows that he actually cares enough to lose personal money to try and improve the country. \n\nTrump is an atrocious business person as documented by various news outlets that explain really the fraudulent nature of his \u201cgreat business career\u201d Despite claiming that he somehow makes \u201cgreat deals\u201d he really is pretty incompetent, but a great marketer. Bloomberg is actually someone that would know how to operate and weigh different sides of complex issues\u2014his empire isn\u2019t inherited and a marketing scheme\u2014it\u2019s a business. As a realist I recognize the president needs to understand how to manage Wall Street and balance the desires of the common man otherwise they simply can\u2019t lead the country. Yeah Bloomberg isn\u2019t necessarily a champion of the common man, but I think he would be more left leaning that trump or some other right wing candidate. I also think Bloomberg wouldn\u2019t be as right leaning in terms of economics as people are making him out to be. \n\nIt\u2019s deeply deeply alarming to me that there is somehow sentiment in the United States that a person becoming financially successful means that they are immoral or corrupt. He clearly wants to win the election so he is using his resources to win. What else should he do? Not try to win? It makes no sense when people critique his spending or his resources when almost everyone would do the same in his situation. \n\nIn this conversation comes the other candidates and how I and likely other Bloomberg voters feel which really comes down to 2 groups (ignoring moonshot candidates):\n\nThose that are radical and we feel can\u2019t win the election because they alienate a significant population of the us: sanders and warren\n\nThose that are moderate and for some reason we don\u2019t like: Biden, klobuchar, Buttigieg \n\nI think the common opinion on other moderates is Biden is low energy and has just been declining this whole race, klobuchar is interesting\u2014but whether it\u2019s America\u2019s misogyny or her lack of taking strong stances she seems less likely to win as opposed to Bloomberg, and Buttigieg who I think sentiment is that he\u2019s just too young and doesn\u2019t represent the sort of strong leadership that Bloomberg seems to embody. \n\nNail in the coffin for downvotes, but I think it should be said: sanders and warren voters really need to evaluate what they think is more likely: a moderate dem or independent will fight hard to get sanders or warren in office despite them really not supporting their rhetoric, or that a more moderate candidate will present a better option for getting trump out of office. \n\nLet\u2019s hope trump gets out though/ remember we are all on the same team in the end!",
            "I was one of the only people on this site to be supporting Bloomie since November.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to to get sucked into quotes and attack ads, but I lived in NYC for a majority of Bloomberg\u2019s 3 terms, in addition to Giuliani\u2019s and De Blasio\u2019s. And it\u2019s ridiculous how much more effective, less corrupt, data driven, efficient, etc. Bloomberg\u2019s administration was. Economy prospered - despite 9/11 and financial crisis, crime plummeted, public health drastically increased (he doesn\u2019t get enough positive press for leading anti-smoking initiatives in the early aughts), government actually worked effectively and on budget, etc.\nIt\u2019s sad because I feel like a large portion of this sub hates a caricature of Bloomberg that the Sanders campaign has created.\n\nI\u2019m a neoliberal and he\u2019s the perfect candidate. He believes in capitalism (but not unconstrained capitalism and will reduce wealth inequality), believes in free trade and open borders, has led the fight on gun control and global warming (an actual effective plan - Green New Deal is ridiculous if you actually look at it).\n\nI also think he will be most effective at defeating Trump. His advertising and campaign apparatus is orders of magnitude more effective and well run than competitors. He takes away Trumps biggest advantage (Bloomberg is an ACTUAL billionaire and did it without a loan from dad), and is wildly acceptable to moderates. \n\nHe got a lot of shit - rightfully for stop and frisk. But I think the nuance here was missed. He was ASKED to implement it by leaders of these black communities. The victims of all the violence were other black people. Homicide and violent crimes DRASTICALLY decreased in these communities. It went too far, and went on for too long, but I feel like he\u2019s been typecasted as a guy just mass arresting minorities. Also I feel like this whole thing is white college students virtue signaling - Bloomberg currently has more black support than Sanders.\n\n Similiar with sexual harassment claims - this site wildly misreports this as being personally against him, when they were against his campaign. Look, every large companies has dozens of sexual discrimination law suits. Hell, I worked in M&A and most 100-200 person companies had 3-4 lawsuits. \n\nBut yes, if you\u2019re socialist or a leftist, obviously he\u2019s not your candidate.\n\nAnyways, even if you disagree with me, I hope you atleast engage / don\u2019t downvote...since every single upvoted post right now is anti-Bloomberg, which is the exact opposite of the question prompt, and I think it\u2019s important this sub understand why Bloomberg is currently running second in polling. Blaming it on advertising and astroturfing really misses the real reasons people support him (e.g., they want moderate who is effective at governing who can defeat trump)."

Domestic bins are too full (Can end up throwing trash around the place) or bags are placed outside of the bin (if you have a good guy driver, he'll pick them up too. He doesn't have to.)\n3. Commercial dumpsters have to be dragged uphill/across shitty ground/over drains to get to the pickup position (wastes time and causes injury again.

            "If you're driving behind the truck and someone's currently emptying the bins, DO NOT tailgate the truck! I know it's annoying to wait, but that won't make anything faster, instead it makes it more dangerous for the garbage man (and yourself if the bin becomes loose while the mechanism lifts it).\n\nDon't overfill your bins! If you have more material than usual, put it in a bag beside the bin, maybe together with a small gift (apple juice, chocolate, etc.). But don't be mad if they won't take it, sometimes the trucks are just overloaded, but usually if its possible they will take your extra stuff if you just ask nicely (bribe them a little bit).\n\nDon't call the company to complain if there are two leaves remaining in your bin. Garbage men have to empty about 750-1000 bins on a long day. Don't expect them to have a look into EVERY bin after emptying it and they will have to come back for your two leaves eventhough they would have come back two weeks later anyway.\n\nIf you forget to put your bin on the curbside in time, don't call the company and tell them that you forgot to empty their bin. It's your responsibility to get your bin outside in time and if every other bin in that street is empty, its usually pretty obvious that you just forgot.\n\nDon't park in front of heavy containers!

The two men thanked us and said they wished other people would do that once in awhile when they had that much trash. Anyways thanks to all the Garbagemen in this board :)",

But if I could give one piece of advice it would be pretty simple: please be considerate.\n\nSay hi and be nice instead of just dumping your trash at my feet. Make sure your garbage bags (if you don't have a bin) are tied, whole, clean, and not too damn heavy for me to carry.   \nLuckily I am in a position to decline trash if it's not up to our, so to say, standards, but I do feel for the professionals who, on a daily basis are just taken for granted.",
            "My brother is a garbage man. His thoughts: #1 put your cans out correctly (face the right way, a few feet apart & not over full). #2: stop leaving extra garbage & large items out with your trash. #3: get better at recycling. Some things require special recycling centers and some things aren\u2019t recyclable no matter how much you wish they were. #4. When you call claiming I missed your house because you forgot to put your can out, I have to go back and pick it up. It\u2019s a pain in the ass, we all know you lied, and the next time the wind knocks your can over - and there\u2019s trash bags all over the ground - I\u2019ll leave it there.",
            "Put your cans next to the road like you\u2019re supposed to, not 20 feet up your driveway. \n\nBreak down your cardboard boxes.\n\nNot EVERYTHING IS FUCKING RECYCLABLE. I\u2019m looking at all you god damn people that put broom handles, wood and steel and fuck even yard waste and diapers in the recycling. \n\nIf you have extra bags, maybe leave a note saying sorry for the extras or a can of soda or something. It honestly will make us go from being pissed at you to being, alright, whatever.\n\nRinse out your garbage cans. I have never ever seen as many maggots in my life as I have since I\u2019ve become a garbage man. It\u2019s disgusting.\nAlso bag and double bag any meat you throw away, this is why you have maggots in your cans.\n\nDon\u2019t park in front of your garbage can. We liked to be able to pull up to the curb, dump your cans and go. 15 seconds is all we need but parking your car in front of the can adds a good 10 seconds and while that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, that time adds up when you have 500+ stops in a day.\n\n\nAll in alll, be nice to your garbage man. Don\u2019t ALWAYS have extra garbage. Don\u2019t have stuff just lying around every collection day. We remember who is gross and who is not. On that note we also remember who tips and who doesn\u2019t. If you tip your garbage man through out the year and good on Xmas, we will remember and we\u2019ll take care of you!",

            "Not a garbageman, but have worked the phone complaint desk & bill payment at a garbage company for 10 years:\n\n1.) USE BAGS. If you cannot afford trash bags, please bag your trash in grocery bags/Walmart bags & tie them closed. Anything is better than nothing!!! No one wants loose garbage spilling over them, ever.\n\n2.) BE KIND. Garbage is necessary & collection is necessary. Your garbage collector is a human being who is doing a service. He or she has a family just like you do. If he makes a mistake, understand that he dumps thousands of cans every single day. Rain or snow or unbearable heat. Flies & maggots, dripping trash juice, dirty diapers, stinking cat litter. He dumps it all. A little kindness goes a long way in a job like this.\n\n3.) EVERYONE has extra trash during holidays. Delays are therefore inevitable. You are not the only person who has a full can. We know you need more space & we DO care about you, but we have to care about EVERYONE in your city or county. We do our best I promise you.\n\n4.) Your personal collector does NOT make the rules!!!! If your bill is unpaid or your can is not out on time or your collection goes wrong.... call your garbage company & talk to someone like me, who sits in the AC all day at a computer. Please do not scream at your collector who is working incredibly hard every single day doing a job most people find undesirable. I would 1000% rather have you vent & yell at me than at your collector or driver.\n\n5.) Garbage trucks usually have compactors. This means that after every certain number of dumps, they press a button & the trash is compressed to make more room. This means that despite the relatively small size of the truck, it is INCREDIBLY heavy & densely packed. BE AWARE in traffic & treat a garbage truck like you would an 18 wheeler!! They cannot stop quickly & if they DO hit you, your car will be crushed by the weight or you may lose your life. It\u2019s devastating to our drivers when this happens & often they have to quit entirely from the PTSD & emotional heartbreak of an accident. Please yield to trucks when you see them or be cautious.\n\n6.) Drill a couple tiny holes in the bottom of your can. If you are nervous to do this, call & ask someone like me if you are allowed to. This allows excess trash juice or standing water to drain out during a rainy day & can make the difference between a normal 100lb can or a behemoth 250lb can full of stinking trash water.",

            "This advice only applies to house to house garbage pickup done by hand, not the hydraulic arm kind.  \n  \nDon't buy a monstrous 96gal garbage can for obvious reasons.   \n  \nDon't buy a small can that's only knee high and pack it full of garbage.  Dragging heavy objects at that low of an angle is super bad for our backs. \n  \nDon't fill your can with loose garbage,  use a fucking bag(s). This especially if your can is on the large side.    \n  \nWhen it comes to bags, please stop using those 99c store bags that rip the instant I try to grab them. If they rip and spill at the curb its staying there, if it's in the street we're obliged to clean it up, but we will remember the next time and make sure if it rips, it's on you.\n  \nTie up your branches, broken wood furniture so we can easily pick it up. We are not there to clean the front of your house, if its put out sloppy we are going to leave the sloppy shit.   \n  \nIf your can feels like Nibbler took a dump in it, I'm going to leave it right where it is.  \n  \nIf you tend to put the can out with no lid , drill drain holes so it doesn't fill with rain water, as a matter of fact just drill drain holes regardless. I'm not going to try and toss your can with 12 inches of garbage water into the truck, I will cherry pick the bags floating above the water line and leave the rest for you to take care of and we will get it next pickup.    \n  \nThere's a lot more, but basically be thoughtful about how you put out your garbage. Yes we signed up for this job, yes we are strong,  but we're still human and we don't want your loose dog shit flying in our face when we tip your can.   \n  \nAlso,  go out and say hello to your garbagemen, especially if you have steady guys it's good to get to know them a bit.",

The garbage truck stopped at the house across the street from them and the dude hopped off the truck and grabbed a garbage bag.  It swung back toward him, and a piece of broken glass in the bag sliced his arm open from wrist to elbow.  They grabbed a towel from the truck and wrapped his arm up, turned the truck around a drove to a nearby hospital.  Ever since then, when my in-laws have broken glass to throw away, they put it into a box, tape it shut and label it \"broken glass\".  Then they leave it out separate from their garbage bags.",

Keep the cans 3 feet apart from each other (and the one that people miss more frequently than that is keep the cans 3 feet from anything else, like your car). Put the cans at the curb not halfway up the driveway, the arms on these trucks don't reach very far and if the cans aren't at the curb we have to climb out and pull them forward. Speaking of putting cans at the curb, make sure that if you have cars parked within a truck's length of where you placed the cab then the cans need to be out into the street by the farthest edge of the car because that's as close as we'll be able to get. Try not to have extras if you can help it. Please don't stop us while we're servicing your trash to run down with just one extra bag.\n\nAll of these things seem very small, but the reality is that we have routes that are up to 1200 stops long sometimes.

            "Being sued by the guy who crashed into ME from behind.\n\nWow! OK, edit:\n\nMy wife doesn't want a dashcam, but I'm gonna get some eventually. It's great advice. We've had other accidents since, but  that was the most consequential. However, the accident was in 1980, so not something I could have prepared for.\n\nSo, story time? It was the night before Thanksgiving and I was giving a friend a ride home from his gas station job. We were approaching their driveway (my former housemates had a rented house), a left turn, and there was a car coming toward us around the curve (unlit 2-lane country road) just past that, so I stopped in front of the drive to let him go by. I saw his lights, but I couldn't tell how fast he was coming. Then I see high beams in the mirror, 4 headlights, coming fast. I try for the driveway because I still have a second. I pop the clutch and turn the wheel, but I'm driving a 71 VW Camper with a 45hp engine so it's not like I'm burning rubber. Meanwhile, the guy behind me actually tried to pass, going at least 60-70 in a 55, saw the oncoming car, and tried to pass me on the RIGHT, but there was a GUARDRAIL right there because of a culvert or something, and he tried to wedge his car between us. So I get my van to about a 45deg angle and he catches my right rear corner. I wind up rolling into the ditch on the other side of the road and flipping into it, landing head up, facing the direction we came from. They took us to the nearby hospital to check us, and a cop gave me a ticket for not signalling a left turn. I told him I signaled, but I didn't see how I could prove it, so I didn't fight the ticket later. The hospital let us go and I'm still kicking myself for not demanding he get tested for alcohol. A month or so after paying the ticket, I find out he's suing ME for $100,000 for injuries. Not fighting a moving violation (it's NY State) lets him claim it was my fault. Should have gone to a lawyer, but I was good & broke at the time. (See above, Not Prepared) My insurance company got a lawyer, but I didn't get that he was working for THEM, not me. At the deposition a year later, he barely remembered what happened in the accident AND couldn't prove pain & suffering, but they didn't even try to shoot down his claims. Finally before the trial date TWO years later, they settle for $5k. My policy said they could only penalize me a little bit if they had to pay out less than $50k, so it was minimal except that I only had liability, so I was out the cost of an old van. Should have sued him, but young & inexperienced and just wanted to move on. In fact, a friend had an almost identical 71 Camper and was selling it right then so I bought that. The actual conclusion, 5 months after the settlement, he ran off the road and died. So I regret 2 main things: giving the oncoming car too much time, and not getting a lawyer to fight the ticket and go after him for the cost. By the way, the guy was a local business (dry cleaner) owner and his store was RIGHT next to the station of the trooper that gave me the ticket.",

            "Notre Dame Football coach Brian Kelly. \n\nKelly insisted on having student videographers record practices. Back in October of 2010, the region was experiencing a very bad wind storm (50+ mph gusts), and Kelly hated to move practice inside, so once rain/lightning was over, he moved it back outside, despite the high winds. The videographers had to climb into scissor lifts and ascend up to *40 feet high* in this weather.\n\nAs you can guess, the wind eventually blew over one of the lifts, sending it crashing down to a nearby street and killing the videographer, 20-year old Declan Sullivan. Just before the accident, Sullivan tweeted out some heart-breaking messages expressing his fear over the situation.\n\nThe team's practice continued for *25 minutes after the scissor lift fell over.* \n\nDespite the University being determined to be at fault for Sullivan's death, Kelly was never really held to account for his reckless decision to hold practice outside in horrendous weather and to continue to have the videographers up on unstable lifts. It should have ended his coaching tenure at the school that year, but collegiate sports money and power doesn't abide by such silly notions of responsibility.",

To elaborate on that, the church of scientology is almost entirely operated by church members that are paid literally nothing or as close to nothing as legally possible.

At any given time, Tom generally has dozens of people personally appointed to his properties to work as cooks, maids, butlers, handymen, w/e for no compensation on behalf of the church. Whether or not they should be called slaves is up to your definition of it. \n\nThey're technically there of their own volition, but when you consider that the church has systematically removed all outside sources from these peoples lives including their friends and family and they're now their only support system, or that these people have donated all of their money and worldly possession to the church and have nothing for themselves or anywhere else to go... Or for instance the kids that were born into the church whose only friends and family they've ever known will abandon them if they speak out against it... yeah, kinda slaves.",

            "Shane Dawson of YouTube fame has multiple photographic, video, and recorded podcast instances of openly sexualizing minors. In one video he and his then girlfriend are teaching his 12 year old niece about how to have sex in which the girlfriend demonstrates on a peep candy marshmallow. \n\nHe's kissed underage fans. He had a blog where underage fans were encouraged to submit sexy photos to be featured on the blog. He would proceed to comment sexual things on submitted photos.\n\nHe was in a puppet show series with The Fine Brothers for a character puppet named Millie who alluded to being raped and abused by her dad character. Millie would ask inappropriate questions to Shane to which Shane would explain very adult topics to what was supposed to be an underaged girl. Many speculated that Millie represented many of the girls in Shane's audience at the time. Shane would also say sexual things to the puppet. \n\nOn a few podcasts of \"Shane and Friends\" he discusses being sexually attracted to children. He also once tells a story of ejaculating onto his cat. There are a few videos of him sexualizing animals by humping them or mentioning how they look. There is one video instance where a young girl is encouraged to wear fake breasts with Shane commenting on how good she looks with them and then encouraging her to let a dog in the room lick them. \n\nThis goes on and on. Another YouTuber named D'Angelo Wallace put together a very in depth compilation of all of this.\n\nThere has been backlash against Shane and he was given a suspected 6 month demonetization on YouTube. None of this has led to any legal involvement or enough calls for it.\n\nEdit: Here's over an hour of [Shane doing terrible things](https://youtu.be/x2WBythSGoQ)",

It cause internal bleeding, a busted ovarian cyst and some other injuries. On another occasion, he threw her over a chair after an argument and broke her nose.\nShe asked to be compensated for her medical bills from the injuries caused by the abuse, and that's it. She didn't want the case to be prolonged, he never spoke about it. I think he settled it in private.

How the F anyone can stand to pee into something that is almost guaranteed to splatter urine back onto your legs is beyond me.\n\nB) I dab the urine off with toilet paper. Yes, a thick enough wad that it isn't going to soak through onto my fingers. And I ain't dainty with it either. If you can pound your dick like a madman when you are masturbating, them you can mash on it a little bit to get that piss outta there.\n\nC) I \"milk\" all the urine out of my urethra going all the way back to behind my testicles. No, just pressing on your taint is not like some magic spell that makes all the urine just jump out of your urethra. You gotta mash every microliter out for every millimeter of your urethra. I find it easier to just press my finger through my scrotum and between my testicles to get to the far-back part of my urethra. Again, every drop of that gets dabbed off onto the toilet paper.\n\nI have mild to moderate Asperger's. But one of the ways it affects me is that I can feel everything. I can feel a stray hair in my nose, and I can feel that tiny little bit of urine still in my urethra, and it just drives me nuts. (No pun intended.) Some may claim this is excessive. I'm sure there will be jokers claiming that I just like to play with myself (which is true, but beside the point). However, I always have clean underwear.\n\nI started doing this when I first started having sex with my first wife, before we were married. We were sitting on the sofa watching TV, and she was happily sucking on my dick. She looked up at me and said, \"From now on I want you to wipe when you pee, because you never know when I might have my mouth on that thing.\" That was all the motivation I needed, and it formed a habit that I continue to this day, simply because it is so much nicer to not have piss in my pants all the goddamn time.",

            "A pocket pussy.\n\nIt was back when me and my wife were still dating. We were out of town for a concert, a festival or maybe just the weekend, and there was this big, heavily advertised and kinda posh adult shop just a block or two down the road from our hotel. The last day of our trip, we didn't have anything planned, so we ended up going into this shop.\n\nThey had a whole floor devoted to dildos and vibrators, and my wife found one she really liked. I started joking around about how they have all these toys for women and nothing for guys and one of the shop employees overheard. He brought us up to the third floor, and showed us this large-ish section that was all fuck toys. It was like 4 whole rows, each one 20' long, packed to the brim with silicone pussy. They had feet with pussies, hands with pussies, tits with and without pussies, headless and limbless torsos, mouths of all variety and a whole line of head-to-toe, life size fuck dolls. \n\nMost of it was really expensive, but I managed to find this one that had a glove attached to a pussy and asshole for like $40. So I bought it.\n\nWe paid for our purchases and went back to the hotel to have fun. My wife really liked her toy, and after a while she asked if I wanted to use mine. I thought about it for just a second and then said \"no.\"\n\nWe had our fun, packed up the next morning and left. I stuck the pocket pussy on our coffee table to mess with some friends who were coming over the next day. After the friends left, it ended up in the back of our closet and stayed there through a move and more than a decade.\n\nUntil my 6yo found it last November.",

My first visit to a paintball shop, I apparently felt like flexing my brand new \"I have a job and no bills because I live with my parents\" income, so I dropped about $400 on a paintball gun that looked like an AK-47 (the way a Nerf pistol looks like a Glock.)\n\nWe did a few practice fights with each other, then went to a paintball field that weekend. The bell rang, the fight started, I ran out, aimed at a guy, gun jammed, and I got shot in the head, just above the part my mask was covering. That gun never fired again and I ended up replacing it with a cheap Tippman 98 Custom, which as far as I understand is the vanilla sherbet of paintball guns. It worked, but we stopped paintballing forever after like two months. So I guess the second gun was also one of the dumbest things I spent money on.",

She believes in owning as few things as possible, and, as best as she is able, existing outside of consumer culture. She\u2019s crazy, but in a loveable way. \n\nAnyway, last summer, we lived together in New England,  and she decides she needs a new wardrobe and wants to donate her current clothing to purchase one or two items of clothing she will wear. She wants something really plain and modest so she\u2019s not participating in fast fashion or supporting consumer culture. I figured she\u2019d go for some thrifted simple blouse and skirt or slacks but. No. Oh no. She decided to spend upwards of 150 dollars on a custom recreation of Maria\u2019s habit from the sound of music. None of us thought it was a good idea. It was a black, long sleeve dress, and it was regularly upwards of 90 degrees last summer. She does not heed our warnings, donates all of her other clothes.

She can\u2019t return it because it\u2019s custom, and, I\u2019d like to reiterate, she donated all of her other clothes, but she\u2019s unwilling to wear it from the shame.

Thankfully, she\u2019s started growing out of that particular brand of insanity (she now owns... like five outfits I think?), but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever see someone waste their money like that ever again.",

            "Chef Boyardee beefaroni. One summer, because I was hella bored, I bought some chef Boyardee beefaroni and put it in my friend's mailbox as a prank. He didn't find it but his parents did, and they asked their neighbors who did it. He suspected me at first, but I managed to get him off of my tail. Now our neighborhoods were fairly close to eachother, so I could be over there in a 50 minute walk. Every night, I walked up to their neighborhood (walking anywhere at 2:am is creepy as hell but the Boyardee bandit does not stop for demons) and put a can of beefaroni inside their mailbox. After about a month, they call the police to find out who's putting beefaroni in their mailbox. Luckily the police really didn't care that much and just told them to get a camera which they eventually did. Meanwhile my friend is telling me all of this from his perspective, right, so I usually know what they do before I strike. So I start covering my face, and pretend to hunch over. I have no idea where this camera is, so I can never be too careful. They call the cops again and give them a profile, and now the cops are looking for a crippled beefaroni bandit. After a solid 3 months of this shit, one of the baggers at the store gets word somehow, and starts getting suspicious because he sees me buying tons of beefaroni. He confronts me, I tell him the truth, and I shit you not he starts helping me beefaroni my friend's house. We're putting it all over hiding it in the lawns, porch, fence, you name it. Halloween rolls around, and I dress up as chef Boyardee. I go to my friends house and say \"your daily subscription to Chef Boyardee beefaroni has ended. Would you like to renew?\". I hear laughter in the background, and it's the store clerk. Turns out he recently started dating best friend's sister, and that's how he heard. Truth be told, I don't think I've ever been punched harder than when my friend found out. Good times. We still laugh about it from time to time.\n\nTLDR.

One of my employees is helping him, and I am not paying too much attention, until I hear a \u201chuh that\u2019s weird\u201d from my employee.

He then says \u201clooks good to me\u201d. And opens the till to get change. \n\nI curiously intervene and look at the bill to see what was so interesting, and it just all looked off. The feel of the paper wasn\u2019t right, the color was off and none of the ink was embossed, it was all flat. It was also a blue note $100, which at the time was somewhat new. I notice the strip in it isn\u2019t straight and luckily I had bought the store a UV flashlight a few weeks before, to make sure the bathrooms were completely clean for customers. I shine the flashlight on the bill and nothing is UV on it. I mark it again with the pen and notice that the corner I marked it on is peeling, and was poorly glued. \n\nI tell the kid the bill is counterfeit and that I cannot return it to him, and must phone the police.

I immediately say, \u201cwho is your son ma\u2019am\u201d and she fucking loses her shit never to find it again she goes \u201c Maam?! I am a state employee, I demand to know who kicked my son (name) out and took his $100 that I just got from x bank\u201d I said, \u201cma\u2019am , your son gave us a counterfeit bill, you should be thankful I don\u2019t call the police. The bill is with us and I will personally drop it off to the nearest bank\u201d. At this moment, Karen is fucking evolving. I\u2019ve never seen anyone get so angry in my entire life. She fucking goes into some type of autistic rant and demands her money back to which I say no can do. Cue the \u201cI need to speak the fucking manager, right MEOOOOOOOWWWW\u201d and this is the moment I am so fucking proud of... \n\nI said \u201ccertainly, please don\u2019t report me I was just doing my job\u201d and she goes \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to have one soon you spanish racist term. \u201c I\u2019m not even Spanish. But worse. I\u2019m an Arab. A muslim Arab. I walk to the back room, where \u201cthe manager\u201d is (Lol) take off my tie, and at this point the employee who was first laughing is behind the back room door (I told him to leave when he first laughed) and fucking loses his shit again and is on the floor literally struggling to breathe, I feared that he may go into cardiac arrest, or worse: never laugh this hard again. \n\nI tell him to pull himself together and come witness our doomsday. He tells me I should put his eye glasses on, so I do. I walk out with him and I say \u201chello ma\u2019am, I am the spanish racist term manager, and I am actually not Spanish, I am a Muslim. An Arab. How can I be of assistance?\u201d CUE GODZILLA METAMORPHOSIS- Karen fucking discovered a new form of fuckery: a felony. Karen pushes our monitors on the ground, all 3 on that counter, takes this little android plastic bobble head thing we had on the counter, and whips it at me, hits me in the chest. She whips her keychain lanyard at me keys first like a whip and hits my hand, cutting me just a little, spits on my co worker, and during all this she is going super sayan. She is fully enraged and is on fire, so much so that I\u2019m pretty sure all the solar panels on every house in the state were over performing. \n\nMy employees both are laughing yet trying to stop her with their words ( help me you fucks I\u2019m a good boss ). One of them calls the police, which miraculously arrive in like 4 minutes. By that time, she had pulled nearly every phone off of their displays, right out of the security alarm cord, and smashed them or thrown them at one of us. Oh yeah she smashed 4 out of our 8- 55 inch TVs. I\u2019m not leaving, and want to be abused as much as possible to rack the charges up. \n\nCUE THE POLICE- I see the cops arrive, with just their lights on, and I don\u2019t say anything, I just keep getting stuff hurled at me and broken in my store. The police at first were walking calmly, then jogging then, full on sprinting. They accidentally broke the glass door pulling it open so hard actually. Karen turns around, and just screeches at them at the top of her lungs and fucking charges them (by the way her flip flops weren\u2019t on and were found being the counter later on I\u2019m pretty sure she threw them at me or my employees). \n\nOne of the officers was a woman and fucking takes her down to with the most brutal tackle I\u2019ve ever seen. Now on the ground Karen is flailing like a fucking octopus, screaming like a siren and gets her shirt and bra ripped entirely off as the cops are trying to pin her while she\u2019s resisting arrest. I\u2019m watching a little too close, as are my employees, and the guy cop looks at me and says \u201cback up, back up\u201d and then yells \u201ctaser taser ta\u201d zap tik tik tik tik tik tik tik tik tik Karen is fucking planking so hard right now, they cuff her stupid ass. Pick her up, she\u2019s still screaming. \n\nHer son is outside watching, in fucking HORROR, looking so embarrassed. Cops take her in their car, and as they\u2019re doing that like 3 other cop cars show up. Cops now want a report and I give them the whole story, show them my battle scars, and offer them the store camera footage, from 4 angles lol. They take the fake 100$ and then go over to her son and ask him questions outside. They don\u2019t arrest him. \n\nAfter the cops leave the son comes inside and I was like \u201cplease leave sir we are closed\u201d and he just says \u201cI\u2019m so sorry she made me do it, I\u2019m really sorry what can I do to help\u201d etc. I talk with him briefly only to find out Karen\u2019s government employee job was at one of the DMVs. The store was closed for 2 weeks. Karen was in the paper. Karen got several counts of aggravated assault, battery charges, counterfeit charges, resisting arrest, assault on a police officer and a whole mess of destruction of property and other charges. I had to go to court as did my employees and testify. Karen got several years in jail. \n\nAnyway this one time I bought a panini maker and it\u2019s pretty much ruined my life because almost all I eat are paninis now.\n\nEdit: made paragraphs lol sorry- And also THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE AWARDS!! That is very kind of all of you who upvoted and awarded this! I never knew a comment about a panini maker would make you all so happy!!"

            "Adopted a child who was 11 when I was 21. \n\nHe was my wife's younger cousin and his household was marred with substance abuse, filth, instability, and mental health issues. Knew it was bad but didn't know how bad. Took him (11) and his brother (14) for a summer once, just to give them a break from (what we thought was) a dirty house with an overwhelmed parent until I took them back the week before school started and saw the filth first hand, the smell and the random people coming in/out, the wreckage we were about to have to leave them in, the fact that in this time his Xbox and games (i had hand-me-downed him) has been sold along with their TV, the two had 1 mattress on a floor and the younger one said \"I can't wait for school to start back\" and when I asked why, he said \"Because then I get to eat every day, like when I'm at your house.\"\n\nI told them to just get back in the car.. His mother never even called to ask why he or his brother didn't come home until tax season, to make sure we didn't claim them on our taxes, etc; Never wished him a happy birthday, christmas, nothing.. my wife and I grew up very quickly. We worked hard and got full custody about a year later when he was 12, he grew up healthy and happy, successful with great grades and a good head on his shoulders. \n\nHis brother who was 14 lived with us for the first year then would go back and forth trying to help his mom get her life together before returning again, but for the most part during those years, the younger child we had full custody of and the older child came/went as he needed.\n\nIt wasn't until years later when the younger of the two moved out with his friends (instead of taking our offer to go to college right after school) and began having substance abuse issues of his own that we learned the extent of the abuse he had endured at home for nearly his entire childhood and kept inside, sexual and physical for years starting when he was about 5 from his mothers \"friends\" and boyfriends and even a family member due to their terrible situation. It was heartbreaking. He ended up going through a pretty severe addiction period in his early to mid 20s and regardless what we've tried and how many small successes we've worked with him to reach, he always ends up in a severe depression and turning back to drugs again. \n\nThe last time I talked to him(about a week ago), I told him I loved him and would help him get into a very nice rehab community when he's ready and help him get a good job and place for himself, but only when he's ready to be clean and until then, we simply can't do anything with/for him..and it was hard to do. \n\nI am in the 2nd half of my 30's now, have 3 children in gradeschool who need me like he did then who also love him (our oldest looks at him like a big brother) but unfortunately we have to keep our distance a bit so they don't have to see close-up the ugly side of addiction in someone they love. Now that he's an adult in his mid 20's himself making these choices, we can't have any real relationship other than the occasional call or letter until he's done. He loves them too, but he's got some demons that we cannot possibly understand and until he's ready to get help for them or help for his addiction, we don't have much of a relationship. \n\nHis brother worked hard and straightened their mother out over the years into a functioning adult and mother, got her life together, a job, a place, everything and as adults, never left her. (In fact, due to him, his brother spent the last year of his teens sharing our household and hers back/forth which wouldn't have been possible without him.) \n\nThe older brother and her are roommates now and we are very proud of him for the man he's become, what he's persevered, and the incredible progress he's made with their mother and how he's stuck by her side now providing as equals. I never realized it, but he and I really grew up together, only being 5-6 years apart in age and were best friends for years as young adults even after his younger brother moved out. One of my biggest regrets is somehow letting those days end. He loves his brother too, but his and his mother's relationship with his brother is the same as ours, the delicate balance between helpful/love vs enabling due to understanding the pain he's probably trying to understand/repress, until he's able to beat this.. and he will. \n\nNothing is perfect, just what you make of it I suppose, but it has highlighted to us how important the early years of a child's development are and how damaging all forms of abuse can be, regardless how much effort you put into trying to change things afterward..and also how important it is for a child to have an adult who genuinely cares about them, since sadly many don't. \n\n*****\n\n**Would I recommend it?** Yes.. but be honest with yourself why you're doing it and know what you're getting into. You're not getting a good/bad kid..you're getting an opportunity to be a good/bad parent.\n\nChildren this age need you as much as a baby does, they bring happiness the same as a baby does and also present their own unique challenges the same as parents do (which is what they're signing up for too without knowing), and most importantly **the reason** you should be adopting **is for them**. You get to give your love, time, affection and a portion of your life (and heart) too. \n\n**Would I do it again?** Every single time.",
            "My wife and I adopted an older girl from our state's foster system, the girl was 13 when we adopted her and we were told she had a rough childhood full of abuse and she had been diagnosed with \"General mood disorder\". Little did we know that the psychological assessment was done by an unqualified state doctor and this little girl had severe issues that required more care than my wife and I were prepared for. We spent 5 years dealing with fighting, arguing, run away attempts, drug use, alcohol abuse, constant emotional manipulation, constant lying, stealing, etc.... She was also in constant contact with her  schizophrenic birth mother behind our backs, the woman kept feeding our daughter conspiracy theories and lies and constantly making the situation worse for all of us. We tried the best we could for 5 whole years, trying various different therapists, trying different parenting methods, seeing different doctors, all to no avail. It wasn't until about 5 months before her 18th birthday that we had to have her committed and we finally got a proper diagnosis. She was diagnosed with bi-polar and BPD and we finally had an answer to the years of hell we all had to go thru. We did our research and learned the proper way to parent a child with these conditions and things began to improve over the last few months she was with us, but on her 18th birthday she bailed and we haven't seen her since, that was 5 years ago.",
            "I feel I got lucky. He was 9 when we adopted him, but he was just grateful to have a home and people who loved him. My wife and I love him dearly as he does us.\n\n*thank you for the silver. This is my first time getting one /u/christianhughes649\n\n*TWO SILVERS!!!! Thank you /u/ExactlyAccurateJoe\n\n*3 thanks to /u/HighOrNotHighEnough",
            "My pre-adoptive son just moved in 6 weeks ago. He\u2019s almost 10. Him getting here has been a bit of a long and wild story but he\u2019s been in care since he was 6. It hasn\u2019t been easy but there\u2019s SO many older kids who need families. My biggest thing is just to make DAMN sure you\u2019re committed. Know your limits. Be honest with yourself and your adoption coordinator. And demand honesty from the social worker as well. Ask for psych evals and treatment histories. Because if you convince yourself \u201cOh I can handle this\u201d and you change your mind? You are re-traumatizing that child. \n\nMy son has complex trauma from years of abuse but the thing he talks about most after his meltdowns? Having to leave his first pre-adoptive home because he kept losing his temper and throwing things. He\u2019s been in 4-5 placements and a PRTF since then. \n\nI work with girls involved in juvenile justice so I felt uniquely prepared for this situation and even for me, it\u2019s been physically and emotionally exhausting. I\u2019m a single parent and we\u2019re in the middle of a global pandemic so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a factor. But if you choose to adopt there shouldn\u2019t be any \u201cchanging your mind\u201d or \u201cthis just isn\u2019t working out\u201d. That kiddo is part of your family. My son and I have a little mantra \u201ctogether forever. Even when things get hard, even when things get sad.\u201d",
            "I took guardian ship of my sons half sister when she was 14.  They're father (who is not and will never be a part of my sons life) was abusive and tried to molest her once when he was drunk.  As a result she was hyper sexual and acted out.  Her mother was a pushover who didn't know how to handle her so she was put into the system.  I knew she wasn't a bad kid, so I stepped in and said I'd take her.  It was rough that first year.  She tested the bounderies a lot until she realized that I wasn't going to give up on her.  I think it also helped that her baby brother adored her and my parents welcomed her with open arms.  We found her a good therapist that she clicked with and that really helped her work through her issues.  She finished school with good grades, met her boyfriend who is wonderful with her.  She has kids of her own now and is a fantastic mother.  Best decision I ever made was taking her in.",
            "We adopted our eldest daughter at 10. We actually adopted her baby half sister first. After the mom met us (since we were doing this via foster care) she asked if we\u2019d adopt her other daughter too.  She had been in and out of foster care most of her life, and her bio mom selflessly made the decision to let her go for stability and safety. We definitely weren\u2019t planning to adopt an older child, we already had a 6 year old biological child, but after meeting the 10 year old, we knew we\u2019d want her to be a part of our family. It\u2019s been 16 years and it definitely hasn\u2019t always been easy, but we have no regrets. We love our daughter like our \u201cown\u201d. She was challenging to raise the first few years, definitely had some trust issues with us and some deep seeded abandonment issues. Family therapy helped. Every once in awhile (like once every few years or so), these issues resurface. She still struggles with depression and anxiety. Id be lying if I said this doesn\u2019t worry me, it does, but she seems to have a handle on it. She\u2019s always been incredibly smart and talented. She just finished her masters degree, has had a successful career thus far, and she\u2019s engaged to a wonderful man (they were supposed to get married this summer, now we aren\u2019t sure. Thanks covid!) It\u2019s almost odd that she has really excelled in everything she\u2019s ever tried (she thinks it\u2019s mostly due to good luck).  We call her (half jokingly) \u201cour achiever\u201d. Some of her success was due to our parenting I\u2019m sure , but most of it is just her and how she\u2019s wired. I\u2019m proud to be her mom.",
            "We adopted a 15 year old girl, after raising three bio kids to adulthood. It has been good but quite different from what we expected. 15 year olds are not \u201c fully formed\u201d but almost. She is a nice smart kid. But also got pregnant, hid it for 4 months. Had a beautiful baby. We expected to finish high school and hold down a part time job, save some money which she would need to become independent after graduation ( her goal) \nShe moved 1000 miles away.  Took up with kind of a rough crowd. Was immersed in a druggy thiefy homeless group that made her fear that her son would end up removed and back in the foster care system.  \nFor now  the baby is with us. Almost 2   Babies are a lot of work but also a lot of joy and laughter.  We are about 60. Occasionally I think \u201c this is not what we signed up for\u201d but in reality it is exactly what we signed up for. \nMost folks when they have a kid or multiple kids have a bunch of expectations. Part of what makes it interesting is that  the kids come with their own personalities, software, journeys, whatever you want to call it. \nCan make for a wild interesting 20 years.",
            "Long story inbound, I'm going to cut it down as much as I can.\n\nMy wife and I are a little older, so when we decided to adopt we opted for an older child for a host of reasons, one being it made more sense for us financially (healthy infant adoptions are crazy expensive for average people like us, plus the long waits, etc) and also because our hearts went out for older children whom society generally wants to look over and forget. These kids need a home too.\n\nWe chose to adopt from the foster care system. This meant taking the same set of classes as standard aspiring foster parents, so even though we had no intention of becoming actual foster parents we learned what they learn and became legitimate foster parents.\n\nWe took in a troubled 13 year old girl. I won't tell her personal story of how she got into the system, except to say it was not as one might expect. We stuck through it with her. There were lots of twists and turns in her story and we found out the hard way that she was not, in fact, clear for adoption months into the process; so we became what we wanted to avoid, foster parents instead of adoptive parents. I'll never forget during one of the regularly scheduled court appearances we were obligated to go to, of having the court workers review her story to the court and later having random people sob in the back from listening to it, and tell us \"We will pray for you.\"\n\nShe was angry at the world for her situation. Angry at her bio mom for abandoning her. Angry at the system for 'forgetting' her for so many years. She lashed out at us many times as well, thinking we would just give up on her. I'll never forget her slamming the door to her room and screaming at my wife \"I HATE YOU!\" over and over, and my wife barely holding it together and saying \"I love you anyway\" each time.\n\nMy wife and I had moments of despair. When one of us would grow weak and say we couldn't do this anymore and maybe we should consider giving up, the other would remind us well what would we do in this situation if she were *our* child? and we would nod, and press on.\n\nOne day, about a year and a half in, this child turned to me while I was driving her somewhere and said, \"I don't want to go back to my bio mom. I want you. I want you to be my dad\" and I, a grown-ass man, broke down and wept.\n\nThe adoption went final when she was 15 (yes, it was that long of a process, but the actual *adoption* took all of 5 minutes in a judges chamber, for which this girl quipped, \"That's it? Just the stroke of a pen? Hell I'd have lent you a pen years ago!\") People who didn't know us back then honestly are surprised to learn she was adopted. She's an honor graduate from high school now, and is planning to attend college in the fall for nursing. We couldn't be more proud of this child, our daughter.\n\n\\----\n\nEdit: It seems I made a lot of people cry.  I still get a lump in my throat and moist-eyed every time I talk about the day she asked me to be her father - even now, 5 years on.\n\nI share this story every chance I get because it is my sincerest hope that maybe I'll move even one person or couple to consider adopting an older child, or maybe at least help in other ways such as donating clothes/toys/etc. (These kids move from home to home so much that in many cases all they have is the clothes on their back and maybe a knick-knack or two. Our child had a single suitcase's worth of loose ill-fitting clothes, some books, and a single photograph of herself as a baby that she kept in her sock everywhere she went in case she had to leave without her suitcase.)",
            "Teen years were rough. It's hard to be a kid again after having to parent yourself and younger siblings. But now that she is an adult, things are better and calmer for us all. \n\nI would 100% recommend it. Even with the struggle, my child is a huge blessing and I can't imagine life without her in it. She is one of the strongest people I know.",

            "I adopted a 7 YO from foster care in 2017. It was an absolute failure. My wife pushed me to choose this child even though I didn\u2019t feel the \u201csparks\u201d everyone talks about when meeting or hearing about their kids. He has a background of being sexually predatory and it\u2019s triggering for me as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse.\n\nI separated from my wife in 2018 and we shared custody for about a year. I asked her for a short break, and she took the child and never returned him. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m unhappy about her choice. I didn\u2019t really fight for her to bring him back. I have seen him only a few times since then.\n\nI care for him as a human being and of course wish no harm upon him, but I\u2019m not his parent. It\u2019s one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve been through.",
            "My husband and I adopted my brother's two kids (at the time 2M and 6F) and their sister (4F). Our oldest was violent and abusive, to herself and toward me. She never acted out that way around my husband, which always made me feel as though I was doing something wrong. Maybe we weren't a good fit. Maybe I was too young. Maybe she was better off with her foster family. I would spend every night in tears, fearful that we were doing more harm than good, because she never acted out that way before adoption.\n\nShe was reading by 3, eating up chapter books before we could introduce them properly. We thought she was memorizing street names, nope. She read them faster than we could most times. She was (and still is) a brilliant young lady that shocks people when she speaks. But those fits. . .it took our dog almost a year to really trust her, at one point she kicked me so hard in the mouth I thought I had lost teeth!\n\nTherapy and counseling helped more than I can even say, for both of us. Her therapist reminded me that she was hurt by her mother, and never knew her father enough to not trust him. She was \"throwing knives\" (metaphorically of course haha) because she had never really trusted women before. She was wary, and rightfully so. \n\nWe both worked so hard to develop a healthy relationship, and honestly we're still putting hours into it. She's almost 10, and honestly just like me. It's odd, it's like we've always been a family, but it didn't always feel that way.\n\nEdit: Y'all. . .I woke up to so many beautifully written comments, I can't even begin to thank everyone for their kind words <3 I just got done making my kids french toast, and made sure to love on them extra when they were done eating. They're my absolute WORLD, and I'm so very glad for all of your support!! I hope everyone has a fantastic day, be safe and don't forget to remind your kids how much they mean to you <3\n\nAlso to clarify, their birth mom was almost completely deaf. She always had the TV on for the kids with subtitles, so our oldest was reading by a very young age. Our youngest had never been taken out of his carseat, so when he came to us at 2 the back of his head was completely flat. He was nonverbal until he was about 3, and would get upset that we couldn't understand him. He and our middle daughter (from another biodad) were homed together, so their bond was very strong. Even though she isn't biologically related to me, she's still their sister and we couldn't imagine separating them. All three are doing spectacularly well in school, and any delays we thought we would need to address before have completely disappeared. I couldn't be more proud of our little clan <3",
            "I adopted a 15 year old, he was hell on wheels and made a lot of really poor choices. He's now 20, and I am so proud of the man he became. It was a horrible time trying to get him to understand that abuse isn't love and that we wanted the best for him, but he's doing great now and is working really hard to create a loving family of his own.\n\n\nDo I suggest adopting older kids? Hell yes! The biggest reason is because I grew up in foster care, all I wanted was my own family, its hard, its taxing, and you have a lot of rewiring to treat their hurts and make them better so they know you're not going to do the same to them but every minute is worth it!",
            "Throwaway because this is personal. I\u2019ve been a foster parent for four years (have fostered birth to 15, about 20 kids total) and I\u2019ve worked as an advocate for foster/adoptive parents for two. \n\nI adopted my son last year after he had been with me for almost a year in foster care. He was 5, so still pretty young. He is autistic and nonverbal. His mom has severe mental health issues and he had been homeless his whole life before coming into care. He was wandering the street in a diaper and nothing else in November when he was found by police. \n\nI\u2019ve never regretted adopting him for a second. He\u2019s wonderful. He\u2019s ridiculously bright and funny and sweet. I love him more than I knew I could love anyone. We have many difficult days (or weeks). I gave up a lot of things to be his dad (I\u2019m only 27) - it\u2019s hard to find a sitter for him, his daycare keeps him in the baby room, he can\u2019t always go out to the store or anywhere loud/crowded, etc. But I adjusted and I don\u2019t regret it. \n\nFrom my work side, I can say I have encountered many adoptive parents who regret adopting. Usually these are folks who adopted little ones, like birth to two, and when those kids start exhibiting \u201cbig behaviors,\u201d having trouble in school, needing psych hospitalization, getting involved with juvenile justice - that\u2019s when they call me and ask how to give them back. (Jsyk, there are no givebacks unless you\u2019re willing to accept criminal charges.) [Edit: This is not true for all places. Some places have civil charges and some have nothing.]\n\nI often see people say they want to foster teens, which is amazing and I will never get in the way of that because it is so needed. I want those people to talk to people who foster teens before they do it. It\u2019s very hard. Not just \u201chard\u201d like remodeling your bathroom or getting a work project done. There\u2019s no finish line. It\u2019s always a struggle. \n\nThere are lots of good days and happy times and it is worth it. But people who talk about their kids going on to law school or even college, in my experience, are the minority. Kids with trauma often need lifelong support. That means when they\u2019re 20, 25, you\u2019re still lending them money or driving them to rehab or dispensing medication. And if they have kids, they may not be able to parent appropriately without a lot of help. I know lots of adoptive parents now raising their grandkids as well. \n\nTl;dr: Fostering is very very hard and not for everyone, but it is worth it. \n\nPS I\u2019m happy to answer questions any time.\n\nEdit: I was thinking about this (because it\u2019s 5am and my son is doing gymnastics in his room) and I wanted to clarify: People who call me to give their kids back aren\u2019t bad people. They\u2019re tired, burnt out, hopeless, scared, and desperate. Often there are other kids in the home who are being affected. You really don\u2019t meet a lot truly bad people who adopt from foster care. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nEdit 2: Okay, wow, this got a lot of attention! I\u2019ll try to answer the questions but tbh it\u2019s a little overwhelming, so don\u2019t be offended if I don\u2019t answer you. Also, I\u2019m not a lawyer, just a regular dude who works in the system. \n\nIf you want to look into fostering, google your region + foster care licensing. It\u2019s different in every county, state, and country, so if I don\u2019t know where you live I can\u2019t give you specifics. But good luck!",
            "My story is a bit different. I was coaching a soccer team and had a kid in the foster program on the team. He was 13. Over the course of the season my wife and I really got to know him and saw how shitty his foster parents were. At the end of the season we asked him if he wanted to come live with us instead. It\u2019s been 9 years since then. \n\nWe had rough patches, but for us it was easy. We were still a young couple (24 & 27) then but his social worker arranged continued funding for us which eliminated any financial burden. It was an easy decision for us and I\u2019d do it again in a heart beat. We\u2019ve had 4 of his other biological siblings live with us at one time or another as they\u2019ve aged out of foster care. They all have their own unique problems, but all kids do. His 18 year old sister asked to come quarantine with us so we\u2019ve got her staying here now. His brothers and sister are all just extra family and our biological little ones (3 & 5) call them all brother/sister. \n\nHe\u2019s 22 now and almost done with college and hopes to be a police officer. Sadly my wife and I will be moving out of state soon and we\u2019ll miss him like crazy, but know we\u2019ve prepared him for life outside our home. We\u2019ll still be there for him of course, but we\u2019re excited to see him thrive independently. His girl friend of 4 years is pushing him to move to our new state once they both finish school so they may still be back near us soon enough.",

            "I don't regret it and I do recommend other parents look into older children.  There are an abundance of children who need loving parents.\n\nWe adopted two siblings and we also have two biological children.  Our biological children were 9 and 7 when we adopted our 5 & 4-year-old children.  That was 11 years ago.\n\nBest advice: embrace an open adoption BUT adopted parents fully control any contact.  Our kids' biological mother has been a huge help in counseling our kids.  They misremembered so many details about how and why we adopted them that lead to blame against us and challenges in our relationship. They have a fierce loyalty to their biological mom that's decreased over time as she's openly reminded them how unfit she was.\n\nIt wasn't a cake walk, but we are all much better-off than we were when we stumbled into this.",
            "Not the parent, but the child. A bit of a different story. \n\nWhen I was 2.5, a foster family took me in. The had two slightly older adopted children in the home, one had adopted when he was a newborn, the other when she was about 2. I was their first (ish) foster child, and then they got into the swing of things and fostered a few more. \n\nFrom the time they got me until I was 5, it was a court case to determine who of my bio family would get me, and in the end it was neither and I would stay in the foster home. I can detail that but it's less relevant. It was a rough couple years which I have memories of still, over two decades later. Then when I was 6 my foster parents started the adoption proceedings, and they completed when I was 8. \n\nBecause they had me from a young age, you think that we'd still have a bond. But at multiple times during my adolescence my mother (adoptive) told me that because I'd been adopted at such an older age, she'd never love me as much as the older ones, never have that sort of bond. I argued that she still got me at 2.5 which was around the same age as the older adopted sister, but my mother still argued that it wasn't the same. I would always be lesser. \n\nThere is so, so much more to the story than that, but apparently there are people out there that love to their children is conditional upon when they got them. If that's you, either a) reconsider when you get the kid or b) NEVER TELL THE KID that you love them less than everyone else for something they had no control over. I was never a bad kid, great student, helpful/did everything at home, literally was called the \"other mother\" in the home since I helped raise other kids, but nothing was ever enough.",
            "I'm asking because I adopted my daughter when she was age 10. It was pure hell to begin with as it was not shared with us she had serious psychological issues. After 7 years of therapy and many many tears, we had a breakthrough. Now 27 years later, I was asked if I recommended doing it. I was at a lost if I should have been honest or just say yes because once you get past the issues that will surely arise, it's a wonderful thing to do.",
            "My wife and I adopted a 16 year old boy over a year ago. We originally went in thinking we are going to adopt much younger, but when we started reviewing profiles there were a large number of teenagers in the mix. Most people adopting children are looking for the full parental experience. For some, adoption is their only chance at raising a child, so I can kind of understand the desire to adopt a young child. The result is that the older children are skipped over. It's heartbreaking, as many unadopted kids 'exit the system' at 18 and almost all of their supports disappear. We kept running into these profiles and it was impossible to ignore them.  We were adopting to expand our family, already having kids of our own, so parenting wasnt new to us. He's been a great addition and has blended really well.",

The bio parents abused them and things were a bit tough at first, but other than matters of faith, it is the most rewarding thing I've ever done.\n\nMy oldest is a student at Purdue and is studying abroad in Ireland right now. My middle daughter will be attending Purdue in the fall. My youngest is learning Japanese in middle school right now, and I suspect she'll go to either IU or Purdue when she graduates high school.\n\n#ProudDad",

Much has improved, but she still has extreme anger issues. She has run away from home three times. She has been inpatient psych twice. Her school has reported us to DHR. (When she gets out of control we have to restrain her to prevent her from hurting herself or us. She told her teacher about an incident when we had to restrain her so they reported it and a social worker showed up at our door that night). \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend adopting an older child to someone unless I know they are willing to put in the work.

My wife and I started caring for them 3 months after that. We were granted legal guardianship about 16 months after the placement. In November of last year we were finally able to adopt them. Coming from someone who never wanted kids, it has honestly been fulfilling to see the HUGE leaps and bounds these two have taken. The youngest, when placed with us at age seven, had never been to school, couldn't read, didn't know shapes or colors, and still talked like a toddler. Just a few years down the road and now she is the top of her class and we couldn't be more proud.

            "In my family\u2019s situation, I wish we hadn\u2019t. My father was the baseball coach and this boy and my brother were friends on the team. This boy was from a terrible family and was getting into trouble a lot, my father wanted to help. My parents decided that they would foster him and possibly work towards adopting. Well, he was four years older than me, and he started molesting me almost immediately. At first I found it fun, he was cute and the older boy. I had never had anyone interested in me like that before. But then he started to do things that I didn\u2019t understand sexually. I\u2019d try to get him to stop, but he would hit me, and mentally abuse me. It was awful. I felt I couldn\u2019t say anything because he was terrifying and I also felt responsible for allowing it to happen and enjoying it at first. He Was my first crush and kiss. It was a really confusing time. He ended up spiraling out and became very violent. My parents decided he was becoming to dangerous to be in our home and ended the fostering. They never found out about what he was doing to me until a decade later. So I think each situation is certainly unique. This kid was unfortunately broken and wanted to break everything within his path. If you do decide to adopt and you have other children in your home, make them a part of the decision. Have open communication about what is and what isn\u2019t acceptable. My parents had great intentions, and I don\u2019t blame them in any way, but I\u2019ll be damned if I would allow an outside source like that to penetrate my home again.",
            "I'm late to the game but feel obligated to comment because I have a lot of experience with adoption and this question in particular.\n\nI am a 46 year old father of 5.  Ages range from 22 to 10.  My two oldest (by birth) are 22 and 19.  The three youngest are adopted internationally.  \n\nWe adopted my 16 yo daughter when she was just a few weeks old.  You would think this is so young that attachment would not be an issue.  That is incorrect.  We spent the first several nights getting no sleep.  We could not console our daughter, until one night out of frustration we fed her, put her down in her crib and left the room.  She went from wailing/crying to completely calm and went right to sleep.  In the first few weeks in the orphanage the routine was too feed the babies, put them to bed, and leave them for 4 hours until the night feeding.  No comforting or holding.  No exceptions.  This was already imprinted by the time she came to us.  She never got over it.  It was actually nice for our sleep patterns, but night bonding is an important part of attachment.\n\nA few years later we adopted two more children, siblings, ages 5 and 1.  These children had spent their entire lives in extreme poverty.  The older child had experienced severe abuse.  His body is covered in scars.  He was malnourished, had parasites, and fungal infections.  We were highly educated and warned about the challenges of adopting an older child.  We were warned about the tantrums, physical aggression, poop on the walls.  We could have not been more prepared.\n\nRegardless, we have spent the last 9 years treating our sons physical and mental trauma.  It has completely consumed and transformed our family.  The anxiety and stress was and continues to impact our family every day.  The aggression and constant attention seeking behavior has changed both my wife and I.  We are different people, and not for the better.  All of our children experienced a serious reduction in attention.  Their lives are worse off for the decision we have made.\n\nTo this day, it is a struggle.  While our son has made tremendous progress, and is now in a main stream school, and just now able to establish a semblance of a normal life as a 14 year old boy, he will struggle his entire life.  However, if we had not adopted him, it very likely would have been worse, or he might be dead.\n\nWe also have many friends who have adopted older children (5 and up, although in reality any child over 1 can be consider \"older\" when it comes to attachment concerns).  Many of these families have experienced similar struggles.  Any child coming from a trauma background is likely to exhibit behaviors and concerns as a result of that trauma.  Many of these adoptions lead to disruptions to the adoption, several of these children did not become successful adults.  One of these children died of an overdose.  In fact, in our circle, it is the exception for these children to become fully functional, successful, happy adults.\n\nMoral of the story.  No matter how educated you think you are, and how patient and caring you believe yourself to be, the emotional impact of trying to parent a child who had been abused and/or did not receive the care and attention they deserve will make you second guess your decision.  You will not be and can not be prepared for how this impacts you and your family.  Only people who have this same experience will understand you.  \"Normal\" parents will think you are exaggerating, and some will not want to interact with you anymore.  Be prepared for that.\n\nDo I regret our path?  Not one bit.  We love all of our children.  We work everyday to make them into functioning adults.  Our wish is for them to be happy.  We are getting there (I think).  But it has been a struggle.\n\nPS  Watch the movie LION.  There are two kids in that family.  The happy main character is not what you are likely to get.  Pay attention to the other kid, the one who struggles.  Pay attention to how THAT child impacts that family.  Pay attention to what it does to the mother, and how she transforms throughout the movie.  That is a pretty damn good representation of what we have been through.  I am a pretty manly man.  I was BAWLING in that movie.  In the theater.",

He had never driven, had serious anger issues, projected all that he'd been through on other people.  He's been with us just about a year now.

My son was and is the absolute perfect fit for our home, meaning that we had the ideal set of patience, skills and lifestyle to support him and bring him forward to where he is today.  But, I stress this, it was HARD! He tried to divide and conquer in the early days and I thought he was going to hate me forever.  \n\nFortunately, he had a therapist who knew him well from foster care who told me to put my foot down and be firm with him.  She basically told me not to let him get away with these things.  I saw a difference in 24 hours.  He started coming for hugs and just genuinely felt protected when I took charge which he hadn't had before.  \n\nI think of the first few years as a roller coaster that gradually flattens out.  He's ten now, so we'll definitely have more waves, but it's gotten so much better and we couldn't imagine our lives without him.  We are truly blessed. \n\nOne more thing.  I don't think adoption should come from a completely selfless place.  So many people want to adopt JUST to help someone else, because generosity makes them feel good.  You should adopt because you like this kid and you want to spend time with them because it's fun and meaningful for you. If not, they'll pick up on that and feel like a burden.

He is easy going, kind, and a typical teen in many ways- struggling to find himself, trying new skins, and has attitude when things aren't exactly his way. \n\nHe also has complex, severe, trauma from a horrific abuse history; when we went through guardianship, his caseworker said he had one of the worst backgrounds she'd ever seen in 25 years of foster care. We had no idea; when he came to us, the agency said he had no issues whatsoever other than a \"history\" of soiling himself.\n\nWhat we found as he grew comfortable and started to trust us is how much more abuse there was, and the last few years have felt overwhelming at times to get him the care (both physical health and mental) he needs, deal with his often unpredictable triggers, and then deal with our own second hand trauma when he tells us what he's been through. Second guessing ourselves the whole way, while family and friends ask us if we really want to be doing this. \n\nAfter 3 years we are still dealing with him soiling, and his defense mechanisms to cover that up (lying, hiding underwear, getting angry when you tell him he needs to take care of his hygiene), etc. He disassociates when you show anger and irritation about even minor things. He tries to skip school a lot because it can be too overwhelming.\n\n Being a parent of a traumatized child can be very isolating. It is very emotionally difficult to care for his needs. You feel like you never have enough time. It's also hard to balance self care so you don't burn out. You need to maintain a schedule for everyone's sanity but he fights it every step of the way. Burn out is a very very real thing, one extra stressor and you can feel like you're losing it. \n\nThe other unspoken thing, especially with kids that are cognizant of their backgrounds, is class and expectations. My husband and I both have master's degrees and both have professional jobs; he comes from a very poor family, where most people were in gangs and never graduated from high school. We have paid days off and salaries, the people he grew up with/his family work sporadic jobs and are often broke and sleeping on people's couches. He has a PPO now when he had only seen Medicaid providers before. He expressed a lot of guilt about being placed with us when his siblings are in much worse situations. \n\n When we started this foster journey, we had hopes about him going to college and getting a professional job. But, with all the schools he had missed and his PTSD, he has a hard time concentrating at school and getting things done. A lot of basic skills about how to study were missed. At this point, we have been told by both his therapist and our own that his success is going to look very different than our own. Success for him might just mean having a stable life, processing his abuse, and having healthy relationships. Sometimes we push back at them and say but he's capable of more, and that it feels like a cop-out to settle for less. I don't know. And our thoughts change on it daily. \n\nBut what I do know, is that if you are considering fostering, adopting, or obtaining guardianship of a teen, that you need to reach out to other foster parents of teens, preferably in your community. Their needs are so unique and often times I cannot talk to normal parents about what I'm dealing with at home; my co-workers talk about their kids doing all of these science camps or extracurricular activities and our idea of success for that day is our kid not soiling himself and not skipping class. I fully expect that he will live with us after high school. \n\nDo I regret doing this? Some days yes, honestly. I question every thing I do. Some days are really really hard. \n\nHaving a supportive partner to keep me in check and vice versa is huge. We have more good days now, and now that he is out of foster care, his mood has stabilized in a lot of ways. He has made an incredible amount of progress and is kind and compassionate given everything he has been through.\n\n I'm not going to lie, teens in general are hard. Teens with trauma are significantly harder. There is hope. Being as prepared as possible and having a support system helps tremendously. I am looking forward to the adult he will become, and want to be part of his life.",

            "My parents adopted two sisters when they were 6 & 7 from Ukraine. My biggest suggestion is do your homework on the past of the child before. I know people want to be the hero by saving a child that has had a hard past, but people need to understand that odds are they will be affected by that past. Once my sisters hit puberty they became monsters, manipulating everyone they could, turning people against my parents by making up lies and ultimately getting my parents arrested, again by making lies. My parents drained their bank accounts trying to help them as well. Yes my parents could have done some things better and I could have been a better brother at times but it would not have changed what they became. Eventually they both ended up on the streets, the older one is still there. Luckily the younger one realized what she did and changed, now I\u2019m proud to say she is in Navy boot camp training. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t help children in need, but understand that events in children\u2019s past affect what they become so do your homework, especially when adopting from Russia or Ukraine.",
            "We are working on adoption number 3. The first two our girls were older 11 & 13 when we adopted them. Our current adoption we are working on is 7 months old and we have had her since she was 2 weeks old. Our first daughter was easy. She did not come from a really bad situation. She got a long well with her siblings and was a tremendous help around the house. She is now 24 living on her own with her fiance and they have their first child. \n\nOur second daughter we adopted has been the opposite. She came from a situation where she had to endure physical and mental abuse. She likes to push the boundaries a little bit more. She tries to get her siblings to follow along with her. We have caught her smoking, sexting and other things. She is 14. We as parents have to remind ourselves that we did not do that damage to her but are here to show her what love looks like. We still need to provide for her and help her be successful in whatever she does. \n\nI think adopting older children is rewarding overall. They are often overlooked because they are older. They really just want a family to call their own and parents to help them. We will eventually adopt more once some older kids move out. We have 7 at home right now.",

            "Before I start I just want to say thank you if you are thinking of adopting. There are so many unwanted children in the world, especially older ones and after the age of 8 their chance of leaving the foster system diminishes drastically. With that being said, I have witnessed firsthand the absolute hellscape that can come from not being cautious during the adoption process with older children. \n\nMake damn sure that you have the full story of their history and if possible a psych eval. My aunt, practically a second mother to my sister and I adopted two little girls a number of years ago when they were 7 and 5, sisters. They were sexually abused by their father and brothers for most of their early lives and the state adoption agency did not reveal any of this until after the ink was dry on the adoption. The first 3 months were fine as could be but then the older daughter began running away in the middle of the night, hiding kitchen knives under her pillow, telling teachers that her mother cuts her, etc. After threatening her sister and my aunt with a knife, my aunt ended up having to have her admitted to a long-term psychiatric hospital. Thankfully the younger daughter is doing very well without her sister in the home, but this story took place over almost 4 years with the older girl slowly getting worse and worse before having to be admitted.",
            "I'm from the other side of this question.  I was adopted when i was 5 by a couple of narcissists that adopted children so they could say they did.  I was a pretty screwed up kid even by then.  They were obviously told that. Both being masters+  degree teachers were determined to \"fix\" me.  \n\nSo i got these people in my life that expected adult behavior and decisions from a child.  I was slightly physically abused, and just wrecked emotionally the entire time.  No affection was ever displayed.  There favorite line was \"we put food on the table and a roof over head what more could you want\".  There was never any type of teaching of life skills like money handling or goal setting.  Looking back now,  Negative feedback was the only way i learned anything. \n\nMy dad made it clear that i would join the army our of high school.   I did and it was the worst thing. I could have done as a screwed up young adult.  \n\nSo just consider what your real motivation is behind adopting kids.  Are you trying to give them a better life? Or are you just wanting something more complex than your cat to post on Facebook?",

            "I think be honest about how hard it was. Adoption (parenting in general, but adoption even moreso) is not for the faint of heart, and the kids need parents going into it with open eyes and the willingness to get help when they don't know what to do. \n\nMy parents adopted a 5yo and 3yo when I was 13, making them the youngest and me the oldest of 6 kids. Both boys (bio half-brothers) had prenatal drug and alcohol exposure, fairly severe, with differing long-term effects. The younger one has more cognitive delays; he can hold down a manual labor job, but he'll probably live with my parents forever. The older one was able to graduate with a real high school diploma but emotionally he's a mess; he's a compulsive liar, shallow and materialistic, full of grandiose plans but unable to follow through on most of them, lonely and awkward and vulnerable to being exploited by the worst kinds of people. He and my mom drove each other nuts until he moved out at the earliest possible opportunity.  Things have calmed down a lot now and he still has a relationship with the family and especially his younger brother, but it's shallow and intermittent. Both of my brothers, above all, need to be accepted as they are and not expected to meet normal standards; for one brother that is easy and rewarding, and for the other it is difficult and not very rewarding. \n\nMy mom became an adoption social worker after my youngest brother started school, and says that every kid in foster care should be considered special needs by default. Even if they don't have organic brain damage - and most of them do, of some sort or another - they all have trauma and baggage. Parents should be as committed to working with that as they would be for birth kids and then some, and prepared for their kids to never meet some (or many) \"normal\" milestones. She calls it \"redefining success\". Which is a healthy attitude to have anyway, really. \n\nIn practical terms, for prospective adoptive parents: my mom's favorite kind of adoption placement to arrange is called \"foster-to-adopt\", where the parents were the kid's foster parents first, and they just got on so well they wanted to make it permanent. It's just a much lower-pressure scenario because they're already successfully living together. So if you're interested but not quite ready to take the plunge, consider giving foster parenting a go!",
            "So I work as a teacher in middle school. Grade 8 to 10. While working in grade 10, this kid (grade 9, 14 year old) was all over the place, gave most of the teachers an headache, even the ones that didn't even teach him. He ended up in foster care, and he got shipped from one family to the next. We actually had a great relationship, we always joked around, and I think it's because I didnt have anything to do with him, and I never had too actually punish him. If he did something slightly mischievous while I was watching, I tried to not yell, but make a joke about is, but he at the same time understood why this behavior was wrong. \n\nThey ended up asking if I could take him in. I lived alone at the time at the age of 28,and said yes. Didn't really know what I was doing, but at least I knew he was safe. He's now graduating year 10 this year, and I adopted him last year before Christmas. He still annoys some older teachers, but at least he's doing great in school, and mostly behaving. Got him in therapy and that has helped alot. I also last year (november) ended up fostering one of my own kids in grade 8. He lost both his parents, and they asked if I could take him for a while. I ofc said yes, and he's still here.\n\nI would recommend everyone adopt older kids, you get so much joy from them surviving and thriving in a world that at some point was going agains them.",

            "I have fostered 7 children from ages 4 - 16.  We just adopted our 11 year old boy a few months ago.  He is sweet, tender-hearted, and creative.  He gives the best hugs and loves being our child so much that he says he wishes he could be born all over again as our child.  He is overly sensitive, shuts down very easily, and prone to fits of rage.  He has deep abandonment fears, a severe reading disability, PTSD, ODD, and ADHD.  He is a constant rollercoaster of moodiness.\n\nHe is not an easy kid and sometimes he really frustrates us.  But he's our kid, forever, and we don't regret our decision.  In fact, we are looking forward to adopting another child next year, as well.\n\nThere is no blanket recommendation anyone could give on whether or not you should adopt an older child.  It depends on the individual match between you and a specific child.  We were presented with several children we knew would not be a good fit in our family for one reason or another.  But along came our boy and he was everything we wanted, diagnoses and all. He's our perfect, beautiful, broken mess. See, my husband and I feel specifically called to parent children with mental illness.  It's a priveledge to be his mother and to have the opportunity to walk so closely with someone on their road to healing.\n\nWe have a heart for older kids.  Our easiest kids were actually our 14 and 16 year olds.  Our most difficult child was a 7 year old girl who attempted suicide in front of me.  But keep in mind, every child who is adopted, even the sweetest babies, have experienced trauma.  Even separating from the birth family is trauma.  And sometimes they have been exposed to drugs or are predisposed to mental illness, too.  I'd love to be a voice that ends the stigma around adopting older kids.  It's not about age, it's about the child.\n\nWe couldn't do it without support.  We have a church that is very supportive of adoptive families.  Our families don't care that our child is a different race; they love him regardless.  We are part of support groups on Facebook.  We take training classes and read parenting books.  I'd highly recommend anyone who wants to adopt to read The Connected Child by Karyn Purvis to understand what kind of parenting kids from hard places need.",

            "Throwaway account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I are infertile and wanted to adopt a baby. After so much heartbreak and struggles, we ended up fostering to adopt a baby via foster care.  We found out the baby had older siblings including a teen sibling. We were not prepared to parent especially as first time parents  a teen let alone older children. When the two middle ones who were 8 and 9 years old were  disrupted and had no home to go to, we took them in.  Seriously, the state called 45 foster homes all across the state and 45 homes said no or they did not have room. The teen was in a group home 8 hours away because most foster homes don't take teens.\n\nWe've experienced a lot of issues with the 8 and 9 year old. Very common issues due to trauma. They were both behind in school. The 8 year old had awful tantrums. I mean awful. They last for hours and in the process she would destroy things.  Both of the kids had food issues, would lie, and steal. They were also abused in two other foster homes. One foster home would force them to take cold showers, hosed them down, and force them to eat out of a dog bowl. They were also timed. They had a few minutes to eat everything before it was taken away. The other abusive foster home would beat them and lock them in their bedrooms. The foster mom would give them night-quill and did not want to deal with them. It was so bad my now daughter was losing her hair because her foster father would pull and swing her around by her hair. The home also had roaches and bed bugs. They had bites all over the place. They were separated for some time because finding homes for more than one older child is hard. The older one was \"mom\" and it was hard for her to trust us and be a kid. She would not eat at all unless we were not watching. Bedtime and bathing were a hassle. They would not sleep in separate beds or let my husband or I brush their hair or be next to them.  It was shocking to me they knew so much already. I never expected to give the sex talk, hitting does not equal love talk or drug talk so soon! They've seen and experienced so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLittle by little we started to fall in love with them and things started to get better. It is a feeling I can't explain. I remember the first hug ever the 8 year old gave me a hug and she let me brush her hair. Her tantrums went from three hours then started to subside little by little. We gave both of them a food basket with snacks and food. It was their basket they kept to make them understand food will always be there. The 9 year old started to trust she will  be sleeping the the same bed and we will not abuse her. They both started doing little things and open their hearts up to us. It is the transformation that gets to me. It is different with a baby. They changed so much and you get to witness that. When TPR (termination of parental rights) happened, we were asked if we'd adopt all three. The caseworker told us we did not have to take all of them. We could adopt the baby and they'll find someone to adopt the three older ones including the teen. I couldn't believe they'd separate siblings like that. Older kids usually wait years and don't have a good chance at getting adopted. A baby with older siblings is hard to place because many will not take the older siblings. There are people who adopt the siblings but disrupt the older ones after adoption.  We added the teen a few weeks later because that is their sister. We wanted to keep them together. The kids already had sibling visits so they kept connections with each other.  The teen who was 14 at the time objected to adoption. We adopted the other three and took legal custody of the teen. The teen had typical teen behavior. Missing curfew, not wanting to go to school, anger, self injury, defiance, depression but she improved a lot with us.\n\nIt has been almost 4 years.  It has been hard but worth it. The kids are great kids. I think the biggest shock is how much they overcame and their case file being miles long. They are nothing like their case file. People told us to stay way from  older kids. They will not bond to you or they are  broken beyond repair. I think people who take any child especially from foster care is every CHILD HAS TRAUMA.  Even babies. Let go of your expectations. I was told we would miss out on their younger years, they will never see us as mom and dad, or they would be so much trouble why go through the hassle?  If anything, the baby who is now four has a lot of anger and control issues. The now 4 year old we've had since he was a baby was kicked out of daycare and likes to hit. We don't know the full picture of his issues yet. Parenting is so much more than being called mom and dad or being there when they are young or for their \"firsts\". I think being called mom and dad by an older child and being their for their firsts is so much more special. It is a choice they make on their own and babies being babies are kind of forced into it because they don't know any better.  When an older child or teen loves you or calls you mom and dad on their own despite everything they went through, it is a very beautiful thing to experience. So no, I don't regret it at all. They are amazing kids who have trauma through no fault of their own. A broken lamp can be replaced, a child can't. I think adopting an older child or teen is letting go of everything you ever dreamed of in a child. How many people want kids who act and think like them? A lot. Parenting is about ego and it is hard to admit that. Being called mom and dad or molding a child is not something you should expect with any child. Children can't be molded because they're their own person. My daughter is nothing like us at all. We had to adapt to her personality. We love her spunk and energy. We had to adjust ourselves to her.  Getting a baby does not mean you will not have to deal with their issues. Their issues just take time to come out. It is easier to look down on older kids with a past and stacks of paper vs a baby whose past is undefined and unknown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould people adopt older kids? Heck, yeah. Prepare yourself. Older kids and teens need homes the most but are the least likely to find homes willing to take them in. There are kids waiting and praying to get chosen and to be adopted but people look at a number next to their name and brush them aside. If that was you, would you  want people to brush you aside because you are older?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: Our oldest who came to us at 14 and also had a long case file is a senior this year( worst year to be a senior right?). She already has college acceptance letters and is in the top 5% of her class. She wants to take a gap year next year.\n\nWe would  like to add more kids to our family. An older kid who is legally freed for adoption and waiting :) There are many kids waiting.  Don't let a case file or stereotypes turn you away from older children and teenagers.",
            "I didn\u2019t adopt, but did foster one of my fifteen year old students.  It was a hell I was not prepared for. It didn\u2019t help that I was only 25.  Long story short, she didn\u2019t like having rules, and decided she wanted to go back to her biological family. She was only with us because she accused her father of raping her and it was going through the court system. She recanted so she could go back to her house where there weren\u2019t as many rules.   She wound up pregnant within six months by some high school dropout who has either 18 or 19 according to one of her friends I also taught. Once she was back with her family she wasn\u2019t in my school zone anymore so I didn\u2019t see her directly. \n\nSome examples of things we dealt with in the 4 months she lived with us.   \n\nShe tried to date/hookup with a forty year old married man she met on Facebook.  We had to contact the foster agency to alert them to a threat to the child and contacted him to let him know if he ever contacted her again we would call the police, she did not like that. \n\nShe wrote all over her room in random obscure places that she wanted to kill my wife. Didn\u2019t act on it, but was threatening. \n\nAttempting to sneak out of house to go do things at night. \n\nThere are other little things that added up.  One month after being back with her dad,  the agency called trying to place her back with us, but we turned it down.   I felt terrible about that, and still do sometimes.  But I couldn\u2019t but my wife through it again. We both thought we were doing a bit of God\u2019s work. Never have I been so quickly disillusioned. \n\nThat said, I still believe I did the right thing in trying to bring her in.  I just wish I had been successful.",

            "So, I'll give you a couple different sides to this one (apologies for the length):\n\nI (38m) am half-adopted (biological mother, dad adopted me at 7), who adopted my daughter (met her and mom when she was 5, she's currently 15), and has a fully adopted brother (he was 5, I was 9 at the time). Wife and I have an almost 3 year old as well.\n\nFirst and foremost: Realize that no matter what, you're in it for the long haul. My parents babied my little brother. He has ADHD along with a slew of other mental issues. Between multiple foster homes (we get a different number from him than we were told, but it's somewhere in the double digits) that definitely abused him, and his drugged up mother that would constantly take him only to make his life hell, it was hard not to see raising him would take a lot of work. And it has, even now. He's been through therapist after therapist, relationship after relationship, and no matter what we've done, it just always feels like we're teetering on the edge of another downturn.\n\nMy dad has finally put his foot down for various reasons and stopped just bailing him out and paying for everything. This is only after they've practically taken over as parents to my first niece, helped him with bankruptcy after his soon to be ex wife caused trouble, and honestly, that's just the start.\n\nI will say this: while he's done some stupid things, my brother has never been in any legal trouble, and is a truly good person. He can be a good dad, but with the dynamic that's been built with my older niece, it's a little rough. Both the younger two kids' babymommas are being pretty tough to him, demanding money he definitely doesn't have just so he can see his kids. He's in the process of legal battles, and who knows how that'll go.\n\nSo, on to me and my dad. Things started out great, he has always been a wonderful dad. We had some rough patches, usually involving things around my brother, but he's taught me more than I ever would have learned without him. He paid for two years of college (we did get 75% off b/c he worked for the university) and now, has been an amazing grandfather. Occasionally he and my wife and I have butted heads, but they've smoothed out after some discussions and he's really taken on the role of advisor instead of boss. He's let me (us) make decisions that maybe weren't the best, and learn from them, while being there to help if need be. I truly love the man, and would do anything I could for him.\n\nLast, on to my teenager. A look at my post history will turn up something that many people will say I'm not a good dad. While I did leave a lot of details out for various reasons, I did take it to heart. It's been almost 4 years since the adoption and I still rarely get called Dad, I usually get my first name. Most days I get ignored when trying to give advice, but it doesn't mean I stop doing it. There are plenty of issues, although some are not her fault, but things aren't bad by any means.\n\nI will say this: I wouldn't change a single thing with any of the relationships I've talked about. Would I like my teenager to be a little nicer to me? Sure. Do I wish my parents did a little less for my brother over the years? A bit. I will say this: it's helped me as a person learn that family is not made by blood, but by your actions.\n\nSome advice: First, definitely go for it (provided you have the financial means). If you're selfless enough to be considering it in the first place, you've got your heart in the right place and that's 90% of the battle. You will need patience more than anything. Be ready for fights and arguments, hours of frustration, and days of questioning yourself. At the same time, you'll know a love that you never expected to. There is pride you take when a child that shares no genetic link shows some of your traits that they've picked up (although sometimes, you'll be kicking yourself for teaching them things like sarcasm). And at the end of the day, you're helping someone deserving gain a life they never would have had.\n\nOne last note: If you already have kids, talk with them now. Definitely explain why you're making the decisions and what it will really mean. No matter how prepared you and and think they will be, there's always going to be twists you never expect. Maybe any current kids feel at ease will help them with their new sibling.  \n\n\nEdit: Feel free to message me any questions you might have. I'd be happy to help.",
            "My wife and I have 5 kids.  This will take some explaining. We don\u2019t actually legally adopt until the child is old enough to make that call themselves.  so i don\u2019t know if it counts for your question. Our kids are kids who need people in their lives and the parents are oblivious or need help. If we can adopt them we do.  If not, which is most of the time, they choose to change their name after they are old enough to separate from their bio mom or dad.  But we do everything for these kids. Half the time they live with us only going back to their bio parents when their bio parent requests it. We pay for their school, food, clothes, medical, extracurricular activities.  We take them where they need to be and we attend parent teacher conferences when needed.   \n\nThe ages are 25, had her since she was 10. She has a bio sister who is 15 and I\u2019ve had her since she was born. And a bio brother he is 11. He is the hardest because the dad has something to do with him.  He wants to be a good kid but bio father contradicts everything mom and i say and do just for spite.  Their mom was a family friend and knew they needed a father. She has been very supportive of me stepping in as this role.  She was just in no way able to provide the best for them.  \n\nNext is my 20 year old. I\u2019ve had her since she was about 9. She is from a split home also but lived with her grandmother.  Mom just let that happen and dad was something.. She has been a bit more rough because of the situation with the split home she never trusted anyone and was down right hateful at first.  It has taken me until she was about 18 to really get her to trust and see that we weren\u2019t just gonna \u201cnot want her\u201d which is how she felt about her bio parents.  She is in college and doing good now tho. She has a little sister who is 15. She always called me her step dad. But she still lives with her mom. She and i have a good relationship and she does great and comes to me with any thing she needs. She stays with us on breaks and or during the weekends.  \n\n\nDifferent and strange to most. We love them and provide for them. They love us. My 25 year old the day she turned 18 went to the courthouse to file for her name to be changed and me be added as her next of kin. My 20 year old did that recently. My 15 year old says she plans to do the same. Simply because her bio father won\u2019t give up his rights.  My \u201cstep\u201d says she may. I tell them that\u2019s up to them i love them no matter what.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if this applies to the question but i can try and answer any specifics if you have them.",

            "My wife and I adopted a 5 year old boy from another country with some relatively minor special needs. The attachment issues we were warned about were much harder to deal with than we expected. He and us didn't bond. He ignored rules, discipline measures had no effect, he lied constantly, verbally abused his older sister, would hurt the pets, disrespected my wife and I, etc.  This went on for years. We read books and went to attachment counseling. It felt like it wasn't doing much. It's been ten years now, and over the years it's slowly changed. Now we are just dealing with typical teenage boy issues. We were more judgemental and strict when we started, and we couldn't see the dysfunction we brought to the relationship. We thought we were up for a challenge. It was more of a challenge than we were capable of. \n\nDo I recommend it? We could have done better, and I regret the mistakes we've made. These kids need a home though, even our home was still better than the orphanage he came from. He will launch capable, and well adjusted. \n\nHis older sister is only one year older, and that was too closely spaced, she still needed a lot of attention that we didn't have energy or time to give her, and she wasn't old enough to comprehend why we had to treat them so differently. I don't recommend doing that.",
            "In 1968, I was adopted at 10 days old because my parents had tried for four years and thought they were infertile.  I am a female, and about two years later they had their own son, and then another son the year after that. I know for sure they regret adopting me. Even my first memories I knew I wasn\u2019t really part of the family. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was a bad baby, or if it was because I was ugly. I had to have surgery to correct a cross eye at age 4, very poor vision which required me wearing Coke bottle thick glasses from the age of two, And grade school I had buck teeth with my permanent teeth came in so I needed braces. So maybe they didn\u2019t like me because I was ugly? Or maybe I had a bad personality as a baby or a child? Or maybe it\u2019s just that neither of my parents have been around babies and they didn\u2019t realize what a pain in the ass it is, so I became the family scapegoat because I was the first baby?  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure but I do know that my mother thinks she would\u2019ve had a perfect life if it wasn\u2019t for me. In fifth grade I overheard her telling my dad that I ruined the family. I still don\u2019t understand how. When I grew up and became a paramedic, they started treating me a lot nicer because it was when rescue 911 was on TV and I think they got attention for having a paramedic daughter. But they still don\u2019t like me to this day. \n\nOne of my brothers refuses to talk to me and hasn\u2019t for 20 years except the time he needed help with the resume one time. Other than that he just communicate through my mother what expensive presents I\u2019m supposed to buy his sons for their birthdays and Christmas. My nephews ignore me, in fact even though I see them at holidays one nephew was eight years old and my mother mentioned something about their aunt snarksnout, and the child was genuinely shocked and said oh I don\u2019t have an aunt.  That just crushed me. We just see each other at family gatherings and he ignores me still don\u2019t know why. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard you know, because I didn\u2019t know any better. To me they were my family without any caveats.  I grew up thinking of them the same way any child would think if their parents and siblings, but there was always this tension, and it was always four against one in the house: my parents and brothers against me. They would even pick fights. They really loved ganging up on me.\n\nBut to them I was just a defective product that ruined their family.  I always wonder if I had a different personality, or had been a prettier baby, or maybe if I had been a boy would they have liked me? Or was my fate sealed the minute they have their own biological kids? \n\nIt\u2019s very upsetting to know that I\u2019ve ruined two lives -my biological mother for having to deal with an unwanted pregnancy, and then the lives of the people who adopted me and who I consider family but they consider me a walking traumatic event. It is so hard to know that Adopting me was the worst thing that ever happened to my parents.\n\nI tried for years To find someone to love, my own family, I even got married but within two weeks of the wedding he was telling me I was a cunt and a bitch and I should kill myself and every morning he would tell me how he wanted me to die that day, most of the time he wanted me to die in a car wreck other times he wanted me to kill myself. It was just proof that I was unlovable, and when he started leaving a gun on my pillow when he was mad at me, and abusing my dog when he was mad at me, I knew I had to get out so I left and my brothers and parents made fun of me about I couldn\u2019t even be married a year, how no man wanted me (my dad even announced this publicly to the entire extended family at a family reunion when one of my cousins asked me if I\u2019d ever get remarried, so now the entire family knows that no man will ever want me in my dad\u2018s opinion). They all come at me about what a failure I was (even after my bachelors degree in nursing), how I wasted all their money on the wedding.  The husband was just one more person that rejected me and even though I begged him  to tell me why what is wrong with me what am I doing wrong, I never got an answer. \n\nthere\u2019s something about me that\u2019s just unlovable and so I try not to get involved with people because I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody because I still don\u2019t know what\u2019s so awful about me, but it\u2019s so lonely. I have a successful career, and no one in my family acknowledges that at all. It just would be nice to have someone to share life with you know?\n\nI wish I wasn\u2019t adopted. I would have so much rather have been aborted.  For almost 5 decades I didn\u2019t wanna believe it, but after 50 years it\u2019s clear the world would\u2019ve been better off without me. Some people just aren\u2019t meant to be born.\n\nSo what I would say to anyone considering adoption, your kid won\u2019t look like you or have the same interests as you and they might have some problems and they might have medical conditions, they\u2019re not going to be perfect. They might not be cheerleaders or the sorority girl or the football captain. So if you have this ideal of a wonderful perfect kid in your head, please don\u2019t adopt. I\u2019m begging you please don\u2019t do that to a child.",
            "No regrets and I would not recommend people not do it. We adopted a sibling group of 3 of varying ages. Oldest is aware of her biological mother and youngest two are aware of her after adoption. \n\nYou need to do research and parenting courses specifically aimed at adoption of children who have trauma before you adopt. It provides you the frank reality of what adopting any child will entail. \n\nThere are bad days and in the back of your mind, you have that self doubt - has this adoption messed them up, do they love me, am I a good parent. But every parent goes through these struggles. Raising kids is extremely hard. But I would not change it for anything.",
            "I adopted 3 kids from the same birth family, ages 6, 8 and 10 when they came to live with us. That was 10 years ago. It has been a wild ride, to say the least!\n\nA few things of some note. \n\n1. My kids have not ever fully accepted us as parents. Anytime they disagree with you something to the effect of \"You're not my real parent\" can and often does come out. It can be difficult.\n2. On the positive side, not having to potty train at least to me was a plus:-)\n3. The years between 6 and 10 are an often unrecognized period of time in childhood. This is the point in time where many kids dream big, and set up their lives. Having a confusing time during this time period can lead to some lasting scaring, leading to problems in later adolescence and early adulthood. Among other things, my kids have had problems with drugs, school, authority, teen pregnancies, extreme lifestyles, severe depression, and more that can be challenging to manage.\n4. Overall it can be very challenging, but very rewarding.\n5. My expectations of them weren't realistic. I am a successful professional, and I had hopes my kids would do the same, along with lots of expectations of behavior and other things that just weren't realistic given what they had gone through. I have had to learn to adjust my expectations of my kids to be more realistic, and that has caused a fair bit of tension.\n\nI don't regret it at all, but it has been far more challenging than I thought it would be. There are definitely some things I would have done differently if I could do things over again, likely including more counseling.\n\nI do know that we have made a difference in our kids lives. They are all on a better track then their birth parents were, although I still worry quite a bit about them. \n\nI suspect a big part of the problem is we were young to be taking on kids of the age. Right now I am 35, and my wife 32.\n\nThe biggest piece of advice I will give is make sure you have your own foundation sure, because your kids can and will test that foundation at some point in time. But it can be quite a good thing if you put the time and patience in to it.",
            "Here we go.  I have two boys that fit this criteria and I don't.  More story below...PLEASE stick with me OP. Incase you don't.  I do not regret it and it was hard.  if you read everything then you'll know most of what i can share.\n\nMy wife and I were unable to conceive but my younger sister was adopted from China and I have 2 cousins adopted from Russia.  One of my best friends in High School married a girl who was also adopted and had a huge heart for it.\n\n.\n\nSo  at first we were gungho on saying we'll just adopt a baby.  Truth be told that is EXTREMELY expensive through private adoption.  It is almost unheard of for DSS adoption.  We dropped off that baby kick after we did our DSS courses and had a cold hard dose of reality.\n\n.\n\nWe have something called the heart gallery and holy hell it wrecked me.  Its a website where you can see videos of kids who are legally open to be adopted and they are basically saying hey i'd like a mom and dad who are this.\n\n.\n\nI'm gonna be brutally honest.  I saw a lot of kids and didn't contact anyone about two boys who had on matching neon green batman shirts.  They wanted a sporty dad ( i hate sports) and no cats (we have a huge fat cat).  They wanted and outdoors family ( that's not really us).  But what they weren't able to really communicate....they just wanted a **real family**.  We initially said 7 was our age limit...\n\nThat being said literally a few days later I got a call asking if I'd be interested in hearing about 2 boys.  These boys were 8 and about to be 9.  We were told we'd need to drive about 2 hours away to another town to hear their story.  Within the first 30 seconds of the story I immediately broke down into tears.  These tiny human dudes had seen so much stuff...they'd had genuine terror and heartbreak.  I wouldn't string this together in the worst of movies.  I won't go into details but literally heart wrenching.\n\nThey told us to go home and talk about it.  I think we went out to the car and cried some more and then texted our case worker saying yes please yes we want to love these boys.\n\n.\n\nTheir foster mother was a complete mental case.  When we progressed along to have them staying w/us on weekends she would tell them horrible things.  She'd say that my wife liked Harry Potter and that is witch craft...if they lived with her then the devil would come torture them at night.  She said they don't need a Dad bc I'll do what other men have done to them in the past.  I'll leave them, I'll abuse them, I'll put them in situations that are unfair and extremely dangerous.\n\n.\n\nIf it's not clear my kids have seen some shit.  They knew all about drugs, sex and extreme poverty.  They didn't know about proper health care, how to properly talk about hard things and to express love.  My oldest was 100% convinced he was going to be abducted in the middle of the night.  One night he told me he knew someone was going to jump in his window and shoot all of us.  he was 1000000% sure of this and neither of us slept much that night.  He also was petrified to go into restrooms alone.  He soiled himself a few times and I had to have some very honest and difficult conversations.  Literally had no other choice but to tell him the cold hard truth about whats going to happen socially to him if he doesn't resolve the issue.\n\n.\n\nMy youngest was and still mostly is an asshole.  There's no other way to put it.  He will lie , cheat , steal and do anything he can to get ahead in life.  I think he's more polite now...but to be blunt he's still an asshole.  He has RAD (Reactive Attachment Disorder) and really has a hard time truly connecting with people.  He sleeps with an alarm on his door that goes off so he wont try to sneak out of his room anymore.  He's come very close to punching my wife.  He's come very close to being put in emergency mental care where he'd stay overnight.\n\n.\n\nLet me make this clear... adoption is not about you at all.  its about these children.  Yes YOU will have living and happy moments.  They however... they are in a strange situation. If a kid is up for adoption there has been some issues.  Maybe they aren't as severe as my boys issues were.  maybe they are worse?  Please be open to therapy and counseling.  Please be prepared to do research and be open to not knowing or being wrong.\n\n.\n\nPLEASE always let them know you love them and actually mean it.  So many situations I've seen these kids are testing the parents.  They've seen false hope of a family and had it fall apart right in front of them.  We repeat things we see and hear, we retell jokes.  Kids don't have as much of a moral compass as we do...they may not have been taught things that we would consider common sense.\n\n.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you...it may be extremely difficult.  You won't get to see them as babies, you won't get to see so many \"firsts\".  You will not be able to look at them and think \"well you were so sweet when x\"...at least not for a while.  There are tax breaks and if through DSS very like have some sort of payment if the child is considered \"special needs\".  Special needs doesnt' always mean handicapped.  I think in my state it was literally non caucasian above 7 or caucasian above 8.  \n\n.\n\nI don't know your story or anything. I will gladly PM you my personal phone number or email if you'd like.  I will be here to talk if you want or need it.  \n\n.\n\nYou can do it :)",

            "Here's from the other perspective. \n\nI was adopted when I was almost 7 and I didn't really understand what that truly meant until I was 11. \n\nPeople always would ask me a normal question and go the extra step to clarify they were asking about my 'adoptive parents'. I could break it down and explain it for everyone, but truthfully I never went out of my way to talk about my 'birth' parents. In my eyes I only had one set of parents, and they were the ones that loved me, fed me, taught me to play catch in the yard, etc. \n\nI'm 26 now, but all of my foundational memories that I carry on with me as an adult came from my parents, my one set of parents. The ones that cared for me. I think adoption is a great thing and when my wife and I are done having kids of our own, we are going to adopt.",
            "I adopted a sibling group,  three girls and a boy.  The oldest was six when we adopted them. She was basically mommy to the younger three as they had been severely neglected and was also undergoing treatment for leukemia.  Her life story was tragic.  When CPS collected them, she was feeding her brother and sisters dog food and jalapenos as they had been left for days without food. \n\nI won't lie, I was terrified of her.  I was scared that she would be psychologically broken or that she would never trust me as a parent.  For a while, anytime we were visited by a social worker or the kid's CASA representative, she would start crying because she thought she was being taken away again.   Over time, she relaxed in her new home and basically learned to be a little girl without the responsibility of caring for other children.  After she'd lived with me for a month, she called me \"daddy\" when one of her friends asked who I was. \n\nShe's turning 17 in June and, aside from general teenage shittiness, she's a wonderful, beautiful young woman.

            "Not that scary, but one time i was on a park bench just killing time. This homeless dude that everyone called \"red\" was at another bench. He came up to mine, and asked if i would watch his shit while he slept for a bit, and i said yes. So he layed down next to me, and after awhile he sat up for a cigarette.\n\nAbout 3 drags in, he starts coughing and his face turned all purple FAST. Never realized how fast people turn purple from lack of oxygen. He fell over on his side, and i jumped up and gave him a little smack on the back a few times, and i kept yelling at him to get up.  I was hesitant to call an ambulance cause of hospital bills that he obviously wouldnt be able to pay, but right as i took my phone out to call (he had been unconscious for like 30 seconds at this point) he starts gasping and gets up.\n\nI asked him if he was ok, and all he says is \"fucking COPD\" and then takes a drag of the cigarette that he never even dropped the whole time that happened. Blows my mind he didnt drop it lmao",
            "Honestly the first night really outside, everything is scary.\n\nI've been homeless for about 4 months some years ago. At first I could stay with friends, but I didn't want to overstay my welcome, I'd actually lie to them telling them I've got some place to go to.\n\nLuckily in those 4 months I only had to really sleep outside for about 2 weeks.\n\nThe first scary thing was just finding where to sleep. Where people can't see me and its relatively dry.\n\nThen when I finally found places to sleep (1st was in a park between some bushes, 2nd was in a tiny playhouse in a public playground, 3d was under a bridge, and then again some nights in the park between bushes) I was constantly worried about people seeing me,.\n\nThe other scary thing was every single sound, a car drives by slowly (are they going to hurt me?) some drunks in the distance singing (if they see me they'll definitely are going to fuck around with me and be idiots).\n\nThe next scary thing was the cold, I would only sleep very lightly for about 30mins at a time and wake up shivering.\n\nI was 19, 1m80 (I think that's about 6feet?) and 95kgs (uh, 190 pounds?) so not a small guy, and I was scared as hell. I imagine its so much worse for women. \n\nMy best advice would be; don't be an idiot and ask for help!\n\nAlthough it was extremely tempting, I didn't abuse drugs or alcohol, I didn't \"look\" homeless, I was just a big idiot thinking \"I can fix this by myself\" \"I don't want to impose on people\" etc...\n\nI was 19 back then, I'm 33 now and I'm happily married and we have a nice home.",

At which point he decided that he never had to work again. He lived on the streets and smoked cocaine all day. The best way to describe him is Tuco from breaking bad. He was generous with his drugs so people would naturally want to be around him. But he was unpredictable and dangerous. I have tons of stories about him being crazy aggressive but the last time I saw him he beat a man with a pipe for dropping a tiny crack rock in the dirt. We are talking like 20 bucks worth of dope and he probably either killed the guy or fucked him up for life. I tried to stop him and he threatened to turn on me. I walked out, went to a phone and called my sister to come get me. She helped me get my shit together and I never went back. That was 30 years ago.",

When the staff called 911 and tried to help him he was pushing them off saying he was fine.\n\n\nHorrible...There was a gas station down the street, a guy paid for gas, took the hose and doused himself in gasoline. I was smoking outside and I remember him walking by outside the \"Yard\" area with a lighter in his hand, arm fully extended out. He was very very mentally ill so I didn't think anything of it. I couldn't smell gas or anything like that. I continue to smoke, light another one up. About 10 minutes later I'm inside bullshitting at the front desk and a dude runs in the front door and shouts, \"Give me wet towels a guy's set himself on fire across the street!\"\n\nHomeless shelters aren't in good areas, so I just walked out casually thinking some idiot at the apartments across the street had set a rug on fire and the dude who ran in was just being a dumbass. I walk out the front door and sure enough, on one of the stairwells theres flames. My thought process was basically, \"Yep, some dumbfucks lit a ru - Oh fuck.\" \n\nThe \"rug\" sat up. \n\nMe and three other guys ended up being the ones to put him out. He wouldn't though, I don't know if the gas had to burn off first, but probably? I don't really remember putting him out, I just remember after. I don't remember a smell or anything. The morbid thing I do remember is he was out and he just kept shouting, \"My balls, my balls are on fire. Put out my balls.\"\n\nHe died 3 days later. I was told it wasn't the first time he'd done something like this. The shelter ended up sending me to therapy, and the woman was the best therapist I'd ever had.\n\nI still get weird sometimes and can't really watch people on fire in movies anymore.\n\n\n\nEDIT: This happened around 2011 in Kentucky so it's awhile back now. I've been slowly putting my life together again since then. The last time I was homeless was in 2014. I'm still struggling financially, especially now, but I'm studying computer programming in my spare time so I can hopefully get where I want to be in life. \n\nI'm sorry I can't reply to everyone individually, I know you have questions. I can try to answer them but I don't have a blow by blow on my feelings at the time and I'd rather state that outright than reply individually with bullshit. I can say that my in general way of dealing with things is through sarcasm and inappropriate times humor so I'm sure there was lots of that after it happened, but I can't say for sure.\n\nI'm not sure how to reply to the posts saying it's better off at some point just to let someone burn. I'm not sure what to say to that.\n\nThanks for the kind words!\n\nEDIT: Location added.",

I ask him what happened and he said he think his misses had cut his throat with a stanley blade, he was so drunk he was not aware of how bad his injury was, and insisted i did not call an ambulance.\n\nSo i called the police they called the ambulance.

            "I was homeless back when I was 19. After a few weeks of sleeping rough I was approached one evening by a man dressed as a priest, at this point I had no idea if he was a priest or someone out to deceive me.\n\nBeing wary of the priest outfit I straight away told him I have no interest in talking about God. What he said next has stuck with me ever since \"I am not here to talk about God, I'm here to make sure you are safe\".\n\nWe talked for quite a while until it was dark and that's when he offered me a bed for the night, alarm bells were going off in my head but he had seemed genuine so I went with him.\n\nHe drove me to a house in the suburbs and asked me to wait in his car whilst he spoke to someone. A few minutes later he returned with another man who offered to let me sleep in his garage for the night. Everything inside me was saying 'this is a bad idea' but I accepted as I had nothing left to lose.\n\nThe garage was pretty standard, tools, workbench etc. except in the corner there was a box spring and some blankets. There was a connecting door to the main house that the man told me he would have to keep locked during the night, he apologised but said he had kids in the house and couldn't take the risk.\n\nThe priest asked if he could come by in the morning and speak to me, then went into the house the man.\n\nI don't think I slept at all that night, I was terrified. I had no reason to be afraid of either man as they had been nothing but nice to me, however after living on the streets for a while you come to learn that nothing comes for free and you shouldn't trust anyone.\n\nThe morning rolls around and the most amazing thing happened, the man knocked on his own garage door to ask me if he could come in. This might not sound amazing but when you've been living rough with zero privacy, someone asking if they can enter your space (which is actually his space) gives you a sense of being human again, someone actually respects you enough to ask your permission.\n\nI spoke with both him and the priest every day for the 7 weeks I slept in his garage. Between them they managed to get me into a subsidised efficiency apartment (think studio apartment but a lot smaller), got me a job and helped me get my life back on track.\n\nThat was over 20 years a go and I will also be indebted to both of them.\n\nI still send Christmas cards to the man who's garage was my home and visited him two years a go for Thanksgiving. Sadly, the priest passed a way a few years back but I guarantee that if there is a heaven, he got fast tracked in.",

Don't know what was mosy scary, when he pulled a knife or crawling for safety without anyone helping me shortly before. \n\nI got out somehow. Don't even remember how. \n\nAnother time I went to sleep at this crazy place we were hanging out. It was messy and filthy with comforters and pillows everywhere. \n\nMy friend (now dead, died at 21 on the streets from bad extacy) called on me right as I was falling asleep. He wanted to sing Michael buble with me. Alright I said. \n\n10 minutes later the room was engulfed in flames. Has he not called on me I know I'd be dead. That sits with me. A shame I couldn't safe him in return. RIP CC.",
            "I used to wander around a neighborhood with lots of homeless people, with a group of maybe 8 or 10 boy n girls between 9 and 15 or so (I was in my early 20s). I shared some pot with them sometimes, but never stayed to make conversation or anything because they were into sniffing glue (the little ones) or heavier stuff and I wast just a hippie guy playing shitty life. \n\nThe thing is, they had managed to open an underground empty water deposit (I don't know the term for what I was exactly: some valves and pipes in there) and they used to go there to hide and do their usual bussines, but some spended the nights inside. I don't remember exactly a date, just that the autumn was close and the days were becoming rainy. A tragic night the rain became a storm very quickly. Don't know exactly what happened, I wasn't there, but four of the kids drowned inside.\n\nAfter that, the rest of them disappeared (maybe they were rescued, maybe they just moved on) and the place was soon sealed and forgotten. The neighborhood was gentrified not much later and I don't think anyone remembers about what happened.",
            "Not homeless but as a kid I got around a less sympathic part of town. I saw a drunk youngish homeless alcoholic (maybe more than that? he was all red, scabbed and icky) just throw a major kick to another dirty homeless old lady's head, which was just sitting & begging on the sidewalk. He screeched a string of mumbled unclear obscenities, violently grabbed her cup of money from her hand, and fucked off somewhere, not before giving me an absolutely bloodchilling look. \n\nShe was just sitting there later, her tooth knocked out, crying about not having another cup. I went inside a nearby store and told the seller what had occured, and he brought her a sandwich, some juice & cup with his tip money. It was like... 11am. Way to early for that shit. \n\nAlcohol is scary, too, don't you forget it.",
            "My mom and I were homeless from ages 5-8 years old. I remember the first night we slept on a beach when we still had our car. My mom parked us kinda close to the water. She took a handful of bars and passed out in the front seat. I stayed awake the whole night in terror thinking that the ocean would just swallow us whole. I tried to wake her up several times with no success.",
            "My uncle used to be a doctor in an ER in the Bronx. He said the homeless would try to sleep on roofs or fire escapes because gangs had a tendency to set them in fire as they slept. Just for laughs.",
            "This is not my story but I'm tangentially involved.\n\nOne of my friends does drops at the major homeless camp. Socks, thrift store shoes, discounted grocery store items etc.\n\nEveryone there knows her by the cart she pulls. They also know to stay away from her or she'll leave.\n\nWell, one dude either didn't know or didn't care to leave her alone. He snuck up on her, pinned her down, and started to try and get her pants off.\n\nThree men (also homeless) came up on him, tore him off of her, and beat him to death right in front of her. She told me she was too afraid to move or run away. After the one dude stopped moving, all three guys just turned and walked away.\n\nShe kept dropping stuff off once a month, but bought a taser to bring with her. No one has bugged her again and it's been two years. She has really bad PTSD from that incident. She's in therapy.",
            "I was homeless in L.A. in my early 20's due to untreated mental health issues, chasing drugs and a series of burnt bridges. I was staying in a car park at an abandoned apartment complex a block North of Hollywood Blvd. It had turned into a spot for a few of my street friends and I to shoot up, bucket bathe and crash when we needed. One night I was trying to sleep off some cotton fever (when you shoot up a bit of the cotton you use to filter heroin) and a friend who was staying there asked if I could watch a backpack for him. I agreed, since I definitely wasn't trying to go anywhere. I fell asleep and the next thing I know I'm woken up to someone right above me screaming at me. This random dude I'd never seen before had a knife next to my face and was screaming at me so loud that he was going to stab me in my eye that he was spitting all over my face. I was fucking terrified on top of being sick. This went on for at least five minutes and I've never been more scared for my life. Apparently he was mad that I didn't open the fire-door to let him in and he thought I was trying to steal his stuff. I managed to talk him down, but that was one of the moments that pushed me toward getting my life together. Lots of bullshit happened to me when I lived on the streets and every day I'm thankful to be in a better place; both physically and mentally.",
            "Scariest? I'll never forget it cause it was convinced we killed a guy but then seen him walking around a month or two later. Story time:\n\nI had been homeless couch surfing for like a year and scored and was able to spend a few weeks at my buddy joshes house (rip joshy I miss u) and we pooled our resources and just went on a bender. My thing was heroin and morphine.. He loved extacy so I smoked some tar, he smoked some weed.. Well shit I did to I think. Then we each popped triple stacks and decided to wonder through the night in Oakland. We had some cops pass us and slow down so we dipped from I think jack London Square and we end up by some grocery store. We both hear screaming.. But not normal screaming. Like screaming that makes your hair stand. Josh was a trained mixed martial artist before his downward spiral and this was still when he was a beast. Anyways I start bolting towards the screaming and he's right beside me. We round the back of the store and in a loading dock all we can see is shuffling and screaming.. A fight. Then we notice a chick, she the one screaming and there's some dude fighting to get her pants off. I instantly realize what's happening in my haze and me and him locked eyes as I hit him the first time. Then I felt something, figured I got stabbed and it fuckin pissed me off, right about then adrenaline overtook and I remember rolling him back over a few time so I could keep smashing his face. Josh was kicking the living shit out of him too. We stop and he's gurgling blood n shit and the fuckin chick.. Some crackhead starts yelling at his unconscious body and kicked him then went through his pockets. I asked her if she was OK and she told me to mind my own business. Lol, ok then. We just hopped the fence and ended up following some train tracks into Berkeley I think and ended up having a rough come down on the first south Bart train back into Fremont.\n\nHer screams still scare me when I hear them. She was tough as nails tho, those were primal screams and had we not shown up she may have been able to handle her own who knows. Af6er that I spent another 10 years fucking around w crime and drugs. Feels like another life now its been so long. I miss the adventures and not caring about anything but each other. We were little addicts with all these big dreams and had zero idea of what we were doing.\n\n\nEdit: thanks for all the nice replies guys, means a lot to me. And kinda neat to me that 103 people thought about my friend Josh today even if it was just for a second, he woulda thought that was neat.",

            "I should be able to think of a lot cause I've seen a lot of shit but honestly it just became so normal that I don't even think about it. A lot of tweakers doing tweaker shit. woke up in the back of a car and got screamed at cause the guy in the front was shooting up and apparently I was shaking the car too much. Watched one of my homies get stabbed while he was blackout drunk literally 10 feet away from me and had to bring him to the plaza for medical attention. A tweaker hit a pregnant lady and got jumped by like 10 ppl that I was hanging out with. Had guns pointed at me several times including held against my chest while I was pinned to the wall. I stayed at a teen homeless shelter and for a bit lived with people that were trying to beat me up (or worse)  and they would kick us out during the day so I always had to try to avoid them by slipping out before them or waiting for them to leave. Once I watched the car of a dude that I knew had a gun and was after me and my best friend at the time pull up and we had to book it and we hid out in a nearby Starbucks.",
            "The scariest thing was when I was crashing on a friend's floor and heard his boyfriend hitting him, and had to call the police to get them to stop, knowing that it would put me out on the street when I did.",
            "I was homeless (had warning, had jobs, knew it was coming and prepared,) with my husband. We had a minivan we modded for survival, put our stuff in storage and drove to his new job, then lived rough in the van while I ran my little telecommute business (not an MLM, don't worry, I was homeless, not stupid,) and picked up a part-time night shift gig in retail to help guarantee a safe parking spot. Six months of no rent, no utilities, and we had enough for a decent down payment on a house. So, most Millennial thing ever, basically, being secret homeless kinda on purpose.\n\nWe still saw some shit. \n\nSee, we were what I would call 'bougie homeless.' Husband and I had white-collar jobs and then I had a blue-collar retail one as well. (Eventually he got a retail one also and just didn't mention his other qualifications, took the same weekend graveyard shifts I was, and we'd stock shelves together purely to be indoors someplace with lighting and able to talk together. Not changing our last names to match was a good move. One manager suspected we might have a thing for one another and was very, *very* startled when we later purchased a house together and turned out to have been married for five years.) Gym memberships for showering and exercise. Study rooms at libraries can be a great, quiet place to sleep if you know how. State parks are very good for good, restful sleep on nights when the store parking lot won't cut it. The food options were pretty awful, but we eventually learned to eat mainly from the produce section or to spring for stuff like trail mixes that didn't need refrigeration, yet had a lot of protein and stuck with you pretty well. Excessive sodium is your enemy; it makes you thirsty as hell, which leads to restroom complications.\n\nI quickly learned that I was by no means the only employee of this retail store who technically lived in the parking lot on at least an intermittent basis. Nor was I the only regular customer. The homeless population wasn't the problem at all. The general-purpose poverty, lack of help for those who were trying and lack of comfort for those who were suffering, other than the most toxic kind, that was the problem.\n\nI called an ambulance for a little kid whose mom wasn't moving in the bathroom. The kid was very calm about this. \"She probably just needs narcan again. It's like how you have to plug in a phone sometimes.\" The mom's purse, and it was a real one, cost more than a month in the house I had left behind for this little bougie-homeless adventure, yet her shoes were some of the cheapest our store sold. I wondered, from that, what her story was.\n\nA drug dealer caught a kid shoplifting and marched them right back inside to return the stolen merchandise to me, dope-slapped them upside the head, then offered me some marijuana on the house for being decent about the whole thing. I declined, thumping my chest and going \"asthma,\" but thanked him kindly for the offer, and said dealer was polite as any neighbor to me ever after. I noticed there was often a car with very gaudy wheels parked not too far from the van, and once when I was walking back to the van late at night and some footsteps began to follow me, matching pace I glanced behind and to my surprise, the middle-aged white guy suddenly found himself distracted by the occupants of the car with gaudy wheels, one of whom was the pot dealer. I got into the van, told my husband to jump to the front and buckle up and we drove to a different overnight spot. Pot dealers don't seem like bad sorts at all.\n\nSometimes we heard screams and we'd carefully look. We learned quickly never to move the car if anything shady happened in the parking lot at night while we were in there. The cops would be looking for witnesses and if they thought you saw something and were leaving, you could be detained and that would blow our cover. So on the nights we heard a crash, screams, swearing, we'd point the dashcam over, click on the auxiliary battery, then go back to sleep until morning, then rotate the memory cards. If a cop asked, we'd be like \"Our car was parked here. We can check the camera,\" and thus be able to help with plausible deniability of our homeless-selves presence. \n\nOur jobs at the store were our alibi. At any given time, I had our real schedules and fake ones I'd knocked together on my laptop and printed at the library, with a little corner-dogear code to indicate which was real and which wasn't. \"They keep changing it,\" was perfectly believable to cops, as was disorganized paperwork and \"It's a hell of a long commute, sometimes it's easier just to get here early and have a nap.\" \"Oh! Well, in that case, yeah! Just stay safe, okay?\" That one probably knew we were bougie-homeless. But bougie-homeless people aren't a problem for cops. So long as they stay invisible, they aren't a problem for anyone but themselves.\n\nWell, and occasionally paranoid people. We had a stalker for a while towards the end. Older white guy with a cane. Saw me at the checkout one time and just seemed off. Recognized me at the library, where I used the Internet a lot, and seemed really weird. Saw me with husband, got edgy, at the store, and then he started to follow us. A big, awful, awkward confrontation...\n\n...yeah, did you know worker's comp hires private detectives to chase old people with bad backs and hip replacements to confirm they're really as disabled as their doctors say? \n\nHusband just cracked up laughing, dished the dirt and explained what we really were, showed our poor stalker some proof that no, we weren't detectives hunting him, we're just homeless, and the whole thing led to us having the first beer we'd tasted in six months in a VFW with the coolest old guy ever, who told the story to some of his buddies and suddenly we had help on our house hunt. Really amazing help. I sometimes tell my students \"my neighbor used to be my stalker -no, really, this is a funny story,\" and they are just like, \"Ms. Spidey, no...\"\n\nAnd then there was the young couple with baby twins, living in a 1994 Toyota station wagon because the fiance/husband's mother had thrown them out of her house for not wanting her in the delivery room. C-sections, they told me, the mom gets one person. They were younger than husband and I were by almost six years, somehow managing retail jobs at the store and community college, and I don't know how the social workers had missed them, but they had been well and truly missed. Never failed to make it to WIC appointments or well-baby Medicaid visits and they'd had the sense to get a PO box at a 'real-address' UPS Store (they told us that trick, actually,) because the MIL had been reading and stealing their mail before the blowup, so it looked like they were just slipping under the radar. \n\nTheir Toyota broke down and as the fiance wrestled with the idea of calling that awful woman back, my husband almost broke the kayfabe (first rule of being homeless, you never admit you're homeless, except maybe to someone who is equally badly off; second rule, if you have anything whatsoever, asset-wise, keep it a secret or someone will take it from you,) to help them fix it. He told them, truthfully, that we used to have a '94 before we got our current car, we took a look at it, and sure enough, husband bet he could make it to the local junkyard to get what he needed. \"Really?\" \"Sure!\" He was back awfully quickly for a junkyard, and I saw the AutoZone charge on our cards later. We could spare it. They sure couldn't.\n\nThe twins are a year ahead of our daughter in school and in one of those coincidences you wouldn't believe if this were a movie, they attend the same one. I ran into their mother in the parking lot of a school event just a bit over a month ago, in February, when I was wrist-deep in a fellow mom's leaky Mercury. She stopped, said my name, I bonked my head on the dang hood, then the years came rushing back. Her babies are so tall now and she's lost that thin, burned-out look. The '94 is gone, sold to her kid sister-in-law for a hundred bucks and somehow still on the road. (Toyotas, am I right?) She and her husband are doing great. He's a sysadmin, she's an LPN, he's grown a neat beard and she's grown her hair out. They were just about to close on a house not too far from ours, so for their housewarming party, we brought a present.\n\nThey knew all along the part wasn't from the junkyard. Our kids played together like cousins. We didn't discuss before, just the now. She knows, I know, but the now is so grand. \n\nI take groceries to our former stalker, since he's older and shouldn't be out in the quarantine, among a few other folks. The pot dealer's cousin sold me my most recent set of tires. I decided against a set of the gaudy wheels, not being all that good at parallel-parking without scuffin' the curb sometimes. My LPN friend is an essential worker, as is her husband, so I have my kid and her twins most days, because my type of teacher is basically off apart from some minimally challenging assignments-and-grading stuff. I have no idea what became of the kid whose mom needed narcan often enough that they likened it to a phone charger, or the people who got into late-night parking-lot fender-benders and fights.\n\nThe worst thing I saw while homeless?\n\nThat heinous fuckery can happen to perfectly nice people. \n\nMy former belief that good things happen to good people and that poor people are only poor because they make bad choices or don't try hard enough? Yeah, first casualty of the street.",
            "One night after being discharged from the psychiatric ward of the hospital I walked to a bar to try and score free drinks and a little cash.  I ended up staying up until close. I did manage to get some beer and soda, so that was nice. Anyway, after I left (2am) I went to go find a place to crash. I picked a spot next to a laundromat building where the outside vent was blowing warm lavender scented air. There was already some dude there but he was asleep in his sleeping bag so I just parked it about 4 feet away from his stuff and tried to get some sleep. \n\nSometime around 7am, my ileostomy bag broke and started leaking all over my pants and shirt! I had to strip naked and remove my shit filled bag, clean myself up and apply a new bag! All out in the open! I didn\u2019t have another clothes so I had to put my shit soaked clothes back on and try to get some more sleep. Later, after about two days, finally had to break down and head to the local Salvation Army men\u2019s center and beg for some clothes. \n\nWhile at the men\u2019s center I had caught pneumonia because my ileostomy stoma was putting out too much fluid (2 liters a day) and I\u2019d get dehydrated too easily. Plus it was cold and ranny outside (winter in Houston). I ended up at the hospital again for 4 months and was able to find a sympathetic surgeon who did the reversal surgery for my ileostomy. This was at a teaching hospital so once I told them I was suicidal and drug addicted they sent me to another psychiatric hospital for another 30 days so I could get off the drugs and depression.",
            "I was living in a $20 a night motel. At the time I was a 25 year old woman. One time at night I left my room go get something from my car. I opened the door and there was a man right there ready to force his way into my room. I opened the door fast and just saw a figure in my right side peripheral vision like one foot away so I pulled my foot back in and tried to shut the door. He pulling on the handle trying to open it but I was able to pull it closed. Luckily the motel had doors that locked automatically upon closure. \n\nI ran to the bed and called the motel manager and he ran out into the parking lot in his pajamas. Really nice guy. He said it looked like the guy had ran away. I went and bought a knife and pepperspray the next day but I never felt comfortable again. My window was also broken and didn't lock but luckily that person didn't know that or try the window.",

            "Never been homeless but I used to see a homeless addict couple in the city all the time. They'd either be passed out on the sidewalk or fighting each other in the middle of the street. Their favorite move was to grab the other then spin em around and throw them, kinda like a hammer throw except they'd both be flung over a meter or two and completely unable to break their fall. \n\nPretty scary seeing them repeatedly smash themselves against the road. Once the bus I was on almost ran them over.\n\nThey'd also just start sprinting across busy traffic for no reason. \n\nOne time the backpack the guy was wearing got stuck on a fence and he was begging for it (the fence) to release him.

            "Police, hands down. 17 years old, dead asleep in the back of a car belonging to my then-girlfriend\u2019s parents in a parking garage. It\u2019s freezing outside - February in Canada, 3AM. I\u2019m awoken by cops dragging me from the car, ragdolling my sleepy-self, (I\u2019m 6\u20192, 210), yelling about the weapon. They just won\u2019t shut up about a weapon - I\u2019ve no idea to what they\u2019re referring. I try to explain that I\u2019ve got permission to be in the car, gave them the number for the parents, worried about waking them up. The weapon! The weapon! I asked them to show me what weapon they found, thinking maybe a parent hid a bat under the seat for protection. They pulled on the handle of a window scraper with squeegee that was covered by a black garbage bag full of clothes intended for the Goodwill. I asked them how it was they felt threatened by a squeegee when I was FUCKING ASLEEP. I was urged to shut the fucking up, then driven to an all-night laundromat, and told to sleep across the super-comfortable plastic chairs.\nFucking cops.",
            "I\u2019m not homeless but in my town there was an incident a few years ago.. \n\nSome random guys set a homeless man on fire and killed him.. While he was asleep. The homeless man was an alcoholic and he used to drink a lot so I suppose he was sleeping unconsciously. They poured him with gasoline and set him on fire.. in the middle of the fucking night. Around 3 AM. The next morning it was on the news.. Very fucked up and unpleasant stuff and I don\u2019t know if those people are caught and in prison at the moment. \n\nBe careful, you never know who\u2019s walking around freely nowadays...",
            "It wasn\u2019t altogether too bad for me, luckily I was homeless in Southern Florida. The hard parts are finding places to sleep that accommodate snoozing while out-of-the-way enough that the cops don\u2019t come and wake you up. There was food was accessible (nearly everyone has a fruit tree in their yard that isn\u2019t being picked) and all but the worst two days of winter are manageable with a blanket or long coat. \n\nI was finishing school and holding down an income so the \u2018homeless\u2019 portion of my life was relegated to nighttime. \n\nThe part I remember most is how little anyone cared. Like one time, I was giving blood and plasma on a tight schedule and riding my bike across town for the privilege in the decent Florida summer sun. One time I was pushing my schedule hard and had to make it to the other end of town to get to a job interview(? I forget exactly what it was but it was important).\n\nI\u2019d JUST given plasma the day before and was giving blood this day. Now normally, I sit around and get my free drink and cookie but today I had to bail. So I bike about 5 - 7 miles in the afternoon and I\u2019m almost to where I need to be when thirst hits me **hard**, so I pull into a CircleK to grab a drink with my new windfall.\n\n* Now it is important to note at this point I was suffering from extreme heat exhaustion and dehydration, it\u2019s important because it makes the next part make sense. \n\nI opened the door to the very well air conditioned CircleK store and the blast of frosty air hit me like a brick. I stumbled inside forgetting what I was there for, fell to my hands and knees, and crawled to the bathroom because I now felt the very pressing need to pooh, while my brain tried to escape my head. \n\nI had a mild seizure somewhere down the isle and another one once I reached the restroom. Somehow, I was able to get on the toilet and do my business, but I remember feeling like death and close to passing out. \n\nSome time later, I\u2019m not really sure, I made it back out into the store and mumbled my way through making a fountain drink and purchasing it. I kinda flopped outside where it felt less disorienting, in the shade of the store, and tried to weakly drink my drink... still obviously having some sort of medical issue.\n\nThe people in the store didn\u2019t seem to care or want to give notice. The cashier was \u2018just another day\u2019ing\u2019 me out of his face. The biggest kick in the nuts was outside. A cop rolled up to get something from the store and as he walked past I told him I needed help. I was kind of delirious and still not out of the woods, but he just walked past like I was the invisible homeless. He saw me. We made eye contact. He heard me. Ain\u2019t that some shit.\n\nWell, the story ends with me living. I drank my drink slowly in the shade. I sat for about a half hour and I\u2019m pretty sure I missed out on whatever I was rushing for because I can\u2019t recall what it was, but I lived. \n\nIt was long after the fact that I realized I probably had a mild heat stroke at the age of 17 in the middle of a busy convenience store and no one really cared. Today I take it in stride. I remind myself it was Florida in the 90\u2019s it only got crazier over the next decade down there, people eating bath salts and shit. That said, I make an effort to always notice, even if it almost invariably reminds me how broken our mental health system is in the U.S., a good portion of the homeless you see aren\u2019t professionals, they don\u2019t want to be that way and are working hard to get out of that trap... a hand at the right time is all it takes. You just have to notice.",

Reddit is anonymous right?\n\nI have been kicked out of the house by my mom a couple of times (she doesnt do it anymore) and one time I got kicked out there was an active child predator in my neighbourhood. I was scared shitless out in the cold but still tried to sleep underneath the balcony of where I lived. At around 2AM I woke up and there was someone standing infront of me. I couldn\u2019t move and tried to pretend he wasn\u2019t there. I felt him touching me on my body (no inappropriate spots) and then he left. The morning after I woke up and noticed that there was an old blanket on top of me. It turned out that it was an old homeless man who found me because I was sleeping in his spot. After that day we were best friends, I brought him snacks and drinks occasionally up untill a few weeks ago. I don\u2019t see him anymore but I am very thankfull of him.",

            "My family was homeless.  My mom and brother and me.  We'd just gotten evicted and ended up with nothing. Someone stole most of the things the marshall put on the curb.\n\nAnyway, we ended up deeep in a bad part of town, the sort of place where the sound of police helicopters was always present.  My mom knew this guy who rehabbed houses and he had one half done which we could stay in.  It had no power or water.  Well, it had a 50-foot extension cord draped across the street for power. The house rehabber lived on the other side.\n\nWe were an extreme minority in that neighborhood and the people there made it clear they didn't want our kind there especially not poor and homeless.  So we were constantly pelted with glass bottles. The house was boarded up so the bottles just broke outside.  \n\nSo we stayed there a while.  No phone. This was before cell phones. So my mom had to walk to a payphone to call around and try to find a charity to take us in.  \n\nSometime during this period, one of the residents on that street got their gas turned off. It had been on illegally and they got caught.  They blamed my mom somehow for reporting it.  We didn't know and had no way to report it even if we wanted to.\n\nAnyhow, these neighbors tricked my mom outside where a mob was waiting and they beat her with a baseball bat while my brother and I watched.  They left her for dead with head wounds and body wounds.   Blood everywhere.\n\nSomebody called an ambulance and the whole street cheered and threw a party as we departed for the ER.\n\nSo that was it. Seeing my mom being beat up by this mob for something we had nothing to do with.\n\nMom survived but I know it shortened her life and she never really recovered 100%.",

Would just hitch hike or hop trains and travel around the U.S.  He was normally smart about it but when Colorado got marijuana legalized he stopped off there.

            "I was homeless for ten years. \n\nOnce in Riverside CA we decided to camp in a dry concrete riverbed. We were travelers and had cookware. We decided to grill steaks and vibe out with some whiskey. We saw a couple other rag tag fools and asked if they were hungry. Dude came over and kicked out grill over. His girl got beat up by our homegirl and I removed homeboy. Our dogs were so good during this altercation. We used our only water to clean off the meat and continue partying and passed out. \n\nI woke up that night to a blast to the head in my sleeping bag. As I'm climbing out I get hit three or four more time and the. Fall to the ground where I'm stomped for a good 45 seconds to a minute before I realize what's happening. I jump up and grab a pipe from one of the guys that hit me. There's like 6-7 people. Beating us in our sleeping bags using pipes and shit. It's dark. The dogs are quiet. Everyone starts climbing out of their sleeping bags and when we finally get centered and ready to kill the guys run off. Homegirl is leaking. Old man is unconscious and his 6 week old puppy is smeared into the asphalt. Our crews dog \"Captain\" has a very obviously broken jaw and is barely moving. My head is split wide open in the back and on top. Both my eyes are swelling shit and blood is pouring out of my nose. My body hurts. We walked to a store, carrying our dogs and call the cops. The cop walks us back to the campsite. Makes us clean it up and leave. We found an emergency vet number and ended up releasing Captain to the vet for adoption once she was nursed back to healthy. \n\nOne of the saddest days I spent on the road.",
            " This is pretty tame compared to other stories in this thread but when I was temporarily homeless for a few months after traveling, I set up a tent in the woods on the non-populated side of a local pond. My cousin lived on the populated side of the pond and I could use his kayak to get back and forth. This was the end of Summer so it was actually quite nice being out there until, what I referred to as, \"the omens\" started to appear. At first, it was simply stones piled up in front of the entrance to my tent. Large stone at the bottom, slightly smaller stone on top of that, etc. Clearly man made. Later it became forms of weird stick art tied together with twine (think Blair Witch Project) always in front of the tent door. It was probably some local person trying to scare me out of there but God damn was it freaky trying to sleep there at night after that.",
            "Guy grabbed me by my hood when I wouldn\u2019t give him money. I ended up beating him down pretty badly and broke my pinky. \n\nI should specify that we were both homeless, and I tried walking away from the situation. He then grabbed the back of my hood while following me. Which I then retaliated in a bad way. \n\nDifferent life entirely...crazy to think about it now.",
            "I was pretty young..I guess the violence really. At any moment you could get stomped into a puddle. My first few nights I just kinda walked in circles around areas I was familiar with. If I saw cops at like 3am I would just hide in bushes or something, but there were a few cars that pulled over late night/early mornings and it was always the same. Either it was a group of dudes who were like oh we're gonna flex on this thirteen year old and then would try to run up on me and shake me down or it was dudes trying to get their child molestation on. I got really lucky. Nothing really bad happened to me. Kept my butthole tight, got in a few fights but eventually a familiar face drove by pulled over and just made his mom take me in  and that's how I was able to get back in school and get a diploma. I know a lot of other kids like me and it's lonely as fuck cause there's no one that really gets what all that's like unless they've been there, but for me the others that have been there that I know became either an older dudes fuck doll, a gang member, or a drug addict so I just don't associate with them cause my life is pretty together. The violence though. I don't like to go places cause I can't carry weapons and I can't trust anyone enough to go somewhere I haven't been. So I'm the weird guy at work who no longer gets invited to parties and stuff.. Just always feel like I'm gonna walk into a beating.. Who knows maybe that's karma. I did some fucked up shit to people..I want to say it was survival and to an extent it was, but at some point it crossed over from survival to flourishing. I stopped acting like that and I don't know.. There's a little part of me that'll cut you as soon as I feel like an altercation is imminent so I don't carry any weapons anymore. I am working on learning how to connect with people and suppressing various aspects of how I communicate verbally and non verbally in professional settings so as to be more palatable. Which includes not talking about too much of my past life. \n\nThanks for this post it's nice to get that out every now and again.\n\nTo all altruistic foster parents, teachers, groups, programs that exist for kids in similar situations thank you. I know it's hard, and I know the odds aren't in our favor, but you do it. The last ten years of my life have shown me that there are good people out there and I'm trying to be who I needed when I was younger so I can pay that forward.",
            "So mine probably doesn't live up to some of the stuff posted here but I thought I'd share anyways.  I was homeless for around 4 months after being in a psych hospital on and off for suicide attempts.  Id like to note that the last stay was 2 months in a state hospital before being discharged into a local shelter.  \n\nI think the scariest thing was meeting a guy who I'd met before in the hospital, while I was walking alone in a quiet area of town.  This guy, when we were in the hospital, had been a major creep.  Asking me if I had a boyfriend,  what my type was.  At one point I reported him to staff when I was in the TV room and he started masturbating through his shorts while staring at me, while it was just us in that room.  I was told to stay away from him and not be in a room alone with him.  \n\n\nSo I see him while I'm walking and I try so goddamn hard to not be noticed, but he says hi and comes over and starts going on about how its great to see me and how have I been, etc.  I'm being polite and trying to be like \"I gotta go, I have things to do\".  He wants to know where I work now.  I lie and say nowhere for now so he doesnt know where I work.  He takes that as me having fuck all to do and starts trying to get me to come to his friends house for coffee, and starts trying to lead me to there.  \n\nI'm nearing the point where I'll give up on politeness and just stop telling him no and walk away, but its early morning and we're still pretty alone on the street.  \n\nThen some fuckin legend of a lady comes around the corner if the street and comes up to us and starts arguing with him about him not seeing her recently.  She just looks at me and nods and I just take that moment to walk away while she yells at him for some random different things and speedwalk down the road until I turn the corner.  \n\nI look back and she just yells a bit more then angrily turns around and storms off.  Like some kinda goddamn valkyrie or something.  \n\nSo yeah.  This random lady just saved my ass from this creepy guy. Then just angrily walks away like it was nothing from this now confused and put off creep.  \n\nBut yeah.  I've no doubt that guy had bad intentions.  He was nothing but pushy and the type to have no personal space or sense of restraint all through me knowing him.  I'm really glad that lady came along, and I'm hella glad she just kinda knew I wanted out and helped.",
            "Sorry for the long post, but it's worth it.\n\nNot homeless myself, but my friend was for a while, hopping from state to state. He was in Arizona for a few days so I booked him a room in the motel 6 and went there to hang out with him for a couple nights when I got off work and I have to say, the motel 6 is a great place to meet some interesting people.\n\n\nFirst group we saw was a guy in a wheelchair with a prosthetic leg. He had his leg off while he was chilling by the pool and he was using it as a cup holder for his polar pop. His girlfriend who was 6 months pregnant was chiefing on her vape mod and their silent friend was sitting in the corner. They were nice people though.\n\n\nThen we met this guy who called himself \"highway\". Dude was an ex marine who messed up his family life and bought a semi truck and became a trucker hopping from state to state. Super charismatic, 70s rocker type guy. He sounded a bit like Sebastian Bach. We spent the night sitting on the steps outside of my friends room drinking whiskey, and Highway spent 4 hours teaching me Kung Fu that he learned in the military.\n\n\nSo he kept asking us if we knew where to get some \"shit\" and would wipe his nose everytime he asked us. I thought he meant coke, but apparently he meant meth. My friend has been around a while, and was originally from AZ so he knew a guy. I left when the meth guy showed up, and my friend filled me in on the story the next morning.\n\n\nSo my friend and highway did some meth, and bullshitted for a while before highway went into the bathroom. He was in there for about half an hour before my friend checked on him. This big old tank of a man was naked, ass up in the bathtub moaning to himself.\u00a0\n\n[Yes, I\u00a0have\u00a0pictures\u00a0to\u00a0prove it.](http://imgur.com/a/Wj9fay5) (Obligatory NSFW)\n\nHe kept mumbling \"I'm just horny! I'm just horny!\" And everytime he said horny he would do a little dry hump thing.\n\n\nSo naturally, my friend had some ladies of the night on speed dial, and called 2 of them over (one for each of them)\n\nWhen they got there, highway was so out of it he wouldn't move from his bathtub, so my friend, not wanting to pay the full amount for his 2 hookers, had one of them stand over highway in the bathtub and pretend to pee on him while he took a picture to show highway in the morning so he would pay him back for his hooker experience. [And yes, here's the picture of that scene](http://imgur.com/a/dnvPjSz) (Very\u00a0NSFW)\n\nThen my buddy had sex with the hookers and they were on their way.\u00a0\n\n\nHighway didn't believe his story, so my friend was out $200 and we never heard from highway again.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd those are my tales from the Motel 6",

            "I've been homeless many times. I have 2 different \"scariest\" things.\nThe first day I was homeless and there was an actual homeless shelter in the area, I'm sitting by myself outback having a cigarette. A man walks up to me and says, \"let's go party at my house!\" I told him no, because a lifetime of true crime tv taught me a thing or two. He then proceeds to list off street drugs and says he has them all. I'm still looking at him like, hell no. \nHe then pulls out his wallet and starts showing me a 100 dollar bill. At this point, other homeless folk come I to the alley and he decides to ask them to go home with him. Creepy. \n\nI have Dissociative spectrum disorder, and at the time I didnt really know all that much about it. Of course being homeless can be stressful, but also smoking weed everyday disnt help me any. There is a small park next to a bread factory and kitty corner to that is a large office building with highly reflective windows. I was in between bags of weed. This in reality was less than 24 hours, but to me seemed like a never ending living hell. Nothing felt real. I was walking around because I was anxious, and I began to dissociate.  This is something I've done my whole life, and I just thought I was really good at daydreaming. So I'm walking around, wanting weed, daydreaming that Sam Winchester is around the corner. I dont know why exactly he would be there, but he was a frequent figure in my daydreams. He asks me where my dad is. Everything changed. I turned and looked into the reflective windows and could see the bread factory and the park, and had an intense fear that I couldnt find my dad. I kept asking this woman if she could help me find my dad. But she just kept saying my words along with me. I dont know how long it was, but eventually I realized the woman was me, my reflection, and I wasnt a preschooler looking for her dad. It was overwhelming.  To realize you stared at your own reflection for however long and didnt recognize yourself is scary AF. \nLooking back now I understand my brain and what happened, and feel bad for whoever was on the other side of that window as I begged and pleaded for help finding my dad.",
            "I was homeless for a year with my mom. There were plenty of unsettling nights but we had each other and a car so I always felt we were better off. I found an opportunity to get a place with some friends my age but I couldn't take her with me. \n\nThe scariest things were the nightmares and worry I had for her everyday. She moved to the same town as me so I could see her, give her money, and text her constantly but the thought of me not being there if something happened still gives me nightmares.",
            "Dad kicked me out for a stupid reason. I changed clothes by putting on dark shorts and a shirt and a navy blue to just look like anyother homeless teen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a small shortcut nearby where other homeless people sleep so i went there.\n\nIts like a little park that has swings and a few benches and a few plants. its about  25 feet wide and 90 feet long. It really is a short cut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just layed down on a bench and tried to sleep. The bench was made out of the hardest concrete i have ever felt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a couple that was furiously making out and I mean FURIOUSLY making out. THey were going at it like crazy but they werent having sex. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was another couple but they seemed like friends. They were on the bench next to me. THey were just talking about stuff but it was about a friends of theirs dissussing stuff about him or her. Just chatter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat was noticable was that at one point these 2 guys come in riding their big professional moutanin bikes that are super expensive. They were tall white, blond hair blue eyes, they looked like olympic gold medalists and they were very healthy and had big muscles. \n\nThey just stop next to me and start doing crack. Both of them. THey smoke the crack for like 20 sec and then they just leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also know where the drug dealers hide their drugs now. People pick em up real quickly.",
            "I was homeless in a major MI city. It isn't necessarily the violence that scared me, but how quickly everyone became desensitized to it and how little the general public cared. I slept by the river and every couple of days the dredge line patrol boats would go by and pull out body parts so they didn't get caught in the fish ladder. \n\nWould find myself talking to other homeless people saying \"yep they pulled 3 out this morning, and a few extra arms.\" Inevitability they said so and so was missing, one if them was probably him. All of it was just as casual as you can be, like I was giving a weather report.",

            "COVID-19 probably now, but when I was homeless stabbings were the scariest thing to witness, also saw a man get his fingers chopped off by a fucking crack head that was fighting \u201cthe evil\u201d with a samurai sword, cops shot the guy dead because they got attacked. I don\u2019t know man it was all crazy down on Wilkins Ave in Baltimore.",
            "Lived in my truck for nearly a year back in 2008-ish. Finding a spot to sleep could be tricky because my truck was a gaudy, jacked up monstrosity with sparkly red paint and color changing flames (don't blame me, I bought it that way at a price I couldn't pass up), and was a huge target for law enforcement during the day and thieves at night. \n\nOne of my regular sleeping spots was a dirt road surrounded by huge fields, and there was a \"sweet spot\" where no houses could see you due to a moderate size hill on either side of the road. People would occasionally illegally dump trash there, but otherwise there wasn't much nefarious activity that took place there. I thought I was safe there.\n\nSo I'm in the back of this old Ramcharger sleeping on this dirt road, and I was woken up because I thought I felt like I was gently swaying or rocking back and forth. As I was laying there trying to fall back asleep I hear a *tap tap tap* coming from the front seat. \n\nI wake up a little more and lift myself up to see some guy hammering a screwdriver into my ignition. My adrenaline immediately EXPLODED. I am by no means a tough guy, but I did my best to be scary and started SCREAMING at the guy. I thought he might try to hit me with the hammer or stick me with the screwdriver so I pulled out the tacky mall ninja machete I kept under my pillow and that was what motivated him to vacate my vehicle. \n\nI clambered over the seat after him for some reason and was met with two more guys standing outside of a waiting car. I admit I panicked internally at that moment, but I'm guessing they did too, because instead of escalating the situation they all dived into the car and bombed out of there, peppering myself and my truck with gravel. After that I started parking in this dried pond that was deep enough that I was hard to spot from the road during the day and I was effectively invisible at night. It was actually kind of nice, I was able to keep the back gate open and enjoy a nice summer breeze.\n\nNot a very scary story I guess, but it was absolutely terrifying in the moment.",

            "I\u2019m not homeless and it\u2019s going to be pretty tame but here I go.\n\nThere\u2019s this HUGE guy who was the nice homeless man where I lived. People tried to help him get back on life but his alcoholism sadly made that difficult. When I was younger (around 8) I got attacked by 3 teenagers who wanted money from me. He scared them away and protected me, so I always felt good when he was around.\n\nAs an adult now I don\u2019t live in the same town but sometimes I go there and sometimes he\u2019s around the station or near the mall.\n\nI always buy him packs of cigarettes cause I know he\u2019s okay with food and wine. \n\nOne day I decided to stay with him and just talk for an hour or so. We were seated on this cardboard piece on the street near the mall. I was wearing my usual hoodie and joggers so you could mistake me from another homeless guy I guess. \n\nWhat scared me and hurt me for him is the way people look at you. Most of them ignore them and that\u2019s okay I do that too often, but some look at you like you\u2019re a worthless piece of shit when you\u2019re just there in a corner not bothering anyone.\n\nI feel so bad about that I don\u2019t know him as a drunk, I know him as the nice man who stood up for a kid who was about to get mug. He does not deserve to be watched with so much content. And you know what? Neither do the others.\n\nSo yeah it\u2019s not as scary of fearing for your life but what scared me is that some people make you feel like it\u2019s normal that you\u2019re here, like you deserve this.",

            "Not homeless but I did do a lot of work doing direct aid to the homeless in DC.\n\nWe were doing the rounds handing out supplies near Union Station, and there was a woman laid in the grass near a bus stop. I went up and asked if she needed anything, she said some coffee would be nice, so I brought her some and gave her a supply bag. That's when she told me she'd been stabbed and she couldn't move. Our medic tried to take a look, but she (very politely) refused. She was so polite and sweet, like a grandma in a movie. I noticed the blood around her at that point, and the medic gave me a pretty grim look. \n\nWe called the local medical aid line after we walked away but the sight of this poor woman, all smiles, potentially bleeding out right outside of Union Station with no one giving a fuck about her is the most terrifying thing I saw doing that work. That and this diabetic dude's foot that was nearly rotted off.",
            "I was homeless from a long drawn out opioid addiction which ultimately led to heroin use intravenously. We (other addicts) grouped together in small encampments around the city. The small camp I ran with had about 50 or so people at its largest. It was a small community of sorts. \n\nWhen you\u2019re that low, people do what they have to do to survive. When you\u2019re hooked on drugs, using feels like part of survival so that is usually done even before eating and drinking, otherwise you get terribly sick. Sometimes people would reuse needles. And sometimes needles used by someone else in the camp. \n\nAfter a while rumors started spreading about this person or that person contracting H.I.V. More time passes and more names get added to the list. It got very scary. Even if you were not sharing needles. Seeing another person\u2019s blood was not an uncommon thing in the culture I was immersed in. People weren\u2019t exactly sanitary. And some of the folks who ultimately did have it, I believe had even less to live for and gave even less fucks about sanitation. An almost \u201cmisery loves company\u201d type situation. Needless to say, it got really scary. \n\nIn the end, my end of the road, I was arrested for a drug related crime. I spent 12 years addicted to opiates and was tired. It was the intervention I needed to ask for help. Went to treatment. Moved into a sober living home afterwards and emerged myself in building a sober community around me. I\u2019ve been sober from all substances 462 days today. Lastly, while in custody, I tested negative for all communicable diseases. H.I.V. HEP-C and any other disease they readily test for.

I guess people who were brought up in higher social classes might see that as scary.\n\nOh, and one time the highly epileptic lady who lived in the room opposite me had a seizure in the middle of the night, wandered outside in the snow and was found by one of the workers at 5am, unconscious with broken ribs.

The lady who ran the shelter had to find her a room, get her up there and then ended up having to feed the woman her husband\u2019s dinner.\n\nThe lady who ran that shelter was called Lesley and she was the greatest, nicest lady.

            "Ok, so where I was staying in Minneapolis was a predominantly black neighborhood.. there was a really drunk blonde white guy, who I think had been robbed or something. Someone took his phone is all I ever really knew.. Cause he walked up to the shelter line I was waiting at and started screaming at the top of his lungs.. \"some NWord took my phone.\" And basically kept repeating stuff like that.. I immediately yelled at him to keep his fucking mouth shut.. I didn't do to be mean, I just knew a lot of those guys had nothing to lose and if you're gonna try to take the last thing they have, there pride.. they're gonna fuck you up. Which of course happened within about a minute.. 3 guys walked up, laid him out.. I've told this story before and had people be like \"why didn't you help him!\" Lol... there was no helping him at this point, he was surrounded and alone. I was yelling at the to stop once he was out, and they kept kicking him in the head.. a nice old guy grabbed me by the shoulder and just shook his head and said \"please don't get hurt. You seem like a good kid.\" So I backed off and went inside the shelter and told them to call an ambulance.. funny enough. They didn't even want to do that, they tried to walk in this guy who was unconscious for a good 5 min.. to \"sleep it off\" in the shelter.. it didn't look like he was even homeless..  Anyway luckily somehow the cops came, and called an ambulance and they took him away.. but ya, the people there were basically just gonna throw him in a bed and cover it up.. the cops didn't even ask what happened cause they knew no one would talk.. I wasn't about too, I still had to stay at that shelter and if word got around I snitched I could be next... which might have been why about 2 hours later that night, for the first and only time in my life I was almost mugged.. lol. \n\nI was under a bridge, on the phone trying to find a place to stay cause while everything went down all the shelter beds filled up and I no longer had a bed.. so it was raining and I was on my phone under a bridge with some social worker lady.. some guy walks by.. and.. he didn't say anything. But he looked right at me.. it has to explain, but I just felt something was off.. and then about 10 feet away he turned around and started walking back toward me.. still no, hey man, got a smoke? Or w.e.. just a blank look.. I walked away back into the ran, and he followed me.. still without a word.. I'm on the phone telling this random lady lol. Who knows what she's thinking.. he seems to speed up a bit. So I tell her.. I'm gonna put my phone in my pocket and run, if you hear something..  maybe try to call someone lol and I ran.. but I had a big backpack on at the time and it was sunday.. where I was, no bars or anything was open.. it was a good 2 city blocks before I could even see traffic.. that's when it really hit me. I didn't have a way out haha.. Anyway, anyone who lives in a city has probably heard those \"car approaching\" under ground parking lot speakers say or w.e.. and there was two cars across the street coming from under a garage.. I ran towards them while screaming I didn't know this guy chasing me and to let me in lol.. the first guy put his head down and just shook it.. no. I can't even blame him, he didn't have time to take in the situation at all.. the second guy tho took the chance on me thank God and let me in.. the dude chasing me ends up walking around the jeep.. just mad.. staring at us.. guy who let me in, asks.. what do I want to do? I kind laughed and told him.. to leave. I didn't even want to deal with cops, I was a heroin addict at the time and had that whole deal in my bag.. so I had him drop me off 3 blocks away at a gas station... \n\nBeing homeless is no joke dude.. it was harder to do than anything else I've ever done.. be nice to homeless people, they definately don't have it easy.",
            "I got stalked and harassed for 3 months while living in a homeless shelter. Started with me helping out another person who got moved in, I found out they lied to me about the reason they needed help and called them out on it. Which in hindsight, was a mistake. From that point they'd try breaking into my room, sending their friends round to intimidate me, wait outside the property by my window for all hours of the day. It was one of the scariest things I've had to go through but there was so much going on in those projects that made the situation unsafe on top of that. I'm so fortunate to not be in that position anymore.",

Anyway, he was sleeping in the park one day (on the bench) and witnessed some police cars flash by, followed by 2 ambulances. He figured it was nothing but then a gang of 5 people with shotguns and knives started climbing the fence to enter the park. He told me his heart started pounding like anything and his body froze. Those people looked like they'd murdered someone, their clothes were stained with blood and all.\n\nThe guys ran in the opposite direction but one, tall man realized that there's a person who's seeing them. Luckily, the guy was decent enough to signal him to remain silent and the security guard quickly went back to sleep. They ran away.\n\nNo one knows who they were and what happened with them.

His dad had money troubles and drug issues so he apparently got into some trouble and owed money to a biker gang. The bikers rolled up while I was there, and they were talking to him right outside the window of the basement and I could hear and just about see everything. They had guns and was telling him that he better come up with either the money or some way to compensate them real fast or else he and his family was going to disappear.

            "The scariest thing I ever saw... it was in Skid Row circa, 2005-2007. I was selling a controlled substance, I had a fairly sizable portion on me and a bunch of cash. I\u2019m in an area of Skid Row, whereas dope (pills, crack, heroine,weed,etc) was being consumed and/or sold. \n\nAbout fifty feet away from me was senior citizen (67 yrs old,) eating a sandwich, while sitting down on the curb. He was quiet, kept  to himself, (fake name) Bob. Bob didn\u2019t drink alcohol or use drugs. \n\nAnout 100+ feet, up the street was a \u2018youngster,\u2019 headed in the direction of Bob. When the youth approached Bob, he kicked Bob\u2019s head onto the curb, and he began stomping on Bob\u2019s face and head. Within a matter of seconds, Bob\u2019s head had a hole bigger than a golf ball,. The hole was in the back of the head. Bob\u2019s blood was pouring out life a water faucet. Bob struggling to walk straight, gagging on blood, blood pouring from him, lots of it. Bob fought with such courage to hold onto life. His skin had already began to show a light shade of blue. His lips were discoloured. He began throwing up, uncontrollably in spasmodic motions. Bob\u2019s hands were clenched into fists, fighting back death. There were several men within a five foot radius from, Bob, that could have prevented Bob\u2019s demise. \n\nThe whole time, the youth who killed Bob, he watched Bob, expire in pure, bewilderment. Not a showing of any human emotion whatsoever. The police station is very, very close to where this happened.

This is fucking ridiculous!\" And just went off while I'm sitting there all :o and the principal is just red af.\n\nI got un-suspended on the spot, but she pulled me out of school for the day anyway. We had a lovely day and she explained very well how I shouldn't swear like that unless absolutely necessary and I've exhausted all civility. \"When being civil simply isn't working, sometimes you might have to call someone a piss ass.\" \n\nThe next day at school, I learned that I now had the stigma of being the kid who got the crayola super pack taken away :(",

            "We were choosing a mascot for a summer camp where I worked. It was the first day of camp and we\u2019d always let the campers vote on a mascot that we\u2019d use for the rest of the summer as sort of a bonding thing. This year, the kids voted for Wolves as the mascot. It was almost unanimous. But one kid, probably about 9 or 10, threw a fit because wolves are \u201cbad guys\u201d and predators and killers and he doesn\u2019t want to be a wolf, he wants to be a hero. He refused to participate in any team activities because he didn\u2019t want to be on a team with the \u201cbad guys.\u201d\n\nAt one point, we brought in a guy in a full mascot wolf costume for some anti-bullying program and the kid had a massive tantrum. I almost felt like we were going to learn at some point that his brother was killed by wolves or some other tragic origin story. I did feel bad for the boy because I was fairly certain he had some kind of unaddressed emotional difficulties or something, but we weren\u2019t going to change the mascot name that almost everyone voted for.\n\nThe really sad thing is that wolf populations have suffered a lot due to stereotypes that they\u2019re \u201cbad.\u201d",

If he was interested, I\u2019d be happy to continue it the next day when I\u2019d be at a desk.

            "Chef for 10 years, here's some good things to keep in mind when cooking at home.\n\n1. Clean as you go. It minimizes clutter and mess and makes everything easier.\n\n2. Sharpen your damn knives, seriously, dull knives are dangerous as fuck.\n\n3. Blenders are not just for smoothies, use them for sauces and your life will be changed.\n\n4. Please stack your fridge appropriately so cross contamination doesn't happen. Veggies and fruit on top, also eggs is fine, beef, fish, poultry. Chicken juice will contaminate raw veggies so quick.\n\n5. You don't need a fuckin knife block. I'm a chef for a living, I butcher 10-20 ducks a week and I have 6 knives? Even that is just cause I'm very particular. Your average home chef needs 3 at most. A standard lengths chef knife, a paring knife, which most home chefs never use from what I've seen, and I medium size blade for veggies can be nice.\n\n6. Label and date when you open stuff and keep it near the front. Keeping it near the front is most important as it helps encourage you to remember, \"Ah yes, I have this kale that I should use\" before you open something else.\n\n7. Olive Oil can go bad, lots of people think it can't, but it can.\n\n8. Canned stuff isn't the worst, just mix it with fresh stuff \n\n9. Diversify what ingredients you're using. Most Americans and Europeans cook with the same 20 things? Every time you go to the grocery store pick up a new ingredient and try it out! Beets? Amazing. Like mushrooms? Try oyster mushrooms instead of generic shiitakes. Like onions? Grab a leek. Seriously, CHANGE IT UP.\n\n10. wading in to more professional territory but try some Fermentation. Lots of great stuff out there but I'd recommend kimchi. If you wanna get serious buy the Noma Guide to Fermentation and actually read it. Best $30 you'll ever spend.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

            "When it comes to shopping, if possible, try to buy key ingredients for your meals the day of, and cook 2-3 days worth. Chicken, for example spoils so fucking fast, especially if your grocer is a dipshit (happens a lot in low-income areas).   \n   \nYou save money by buying in bulk, and although cleanup/prep takes longer, it's actually less work than trying to make something new every day.  \n\nI used to do one big shopping run a week, and it was impossible for me to properly use up all that food.  Everything ends up tasting better as well since most stuff on the shelf is ready to go right when you pick it up.  \n\nTry to buy seasonal. [Charts like this one](http://cookingmatters.org/sites/default/files/recipes/seasonal_chart_full.png) will help you figure out what's ripe. Fruit and veg in peak season tastes better than at any other time. Try to shop local. Long shipping times require food be picked before its ripe, and having to undergo an intense fumigation process.  \n\nCertain fruits and veg are more prone to absorption of pesticides and other not great shit, so try to find pesticide free variants of those, if possible. Barring that, wash everything pretty well, even things in bags that say \"prewashed\". \n\nWhen it comes to cooking, I recommend mainly using wood and stainless steel utensils. There's a lot of wacky shit out there, but metal and wood has been tried and true for centuries. Get one really good knife, and learn how to maintain it. Get a second small knife, this one you can cheap out on a bit, it'll just require more frequent maintenance. Get a serrated style bread knife. Peeler is a nice bonus item.  \n\nIf you grab stuff with the tips of your fingers in a certain way, and make your knuckles protrude, you can use them as a guide for your knife, and cut much faster while dramatically reducing the chances of knicking yourself. Keep your blade sharp, and study how to hold the knife in your hand. Your blade should basically cut in the exact same motion every time.   \n\nI see a lot of recipes online that go absolutely mental with the amount of oil, butter, salt, sugar, and other ingredients. It tastes great, but you really don't need so much. Try scaling back some of your favorite recipes a bit, you might find they taste just as good, if not better. You can always add things back later if you find it tastes too bland. In today's high sodium/sugar world, every little bit helps.  \n\nTry to avoid things with more than a couple ingredients. You can make a ton of shit at home, and they always taste better. I had one day where I ate a frozen pizza while hung over a couple months ago and thought to myself, this fucking thing cost me like 8 dollars, and it tastes like fucking trash. Pretty much the entire frozen food section should not exist as it currently does (except maybe fruits and veggies). \n\nWatch videos before you cook. Watch a couple. Decide for yourself which parts of the videos appeal to your style, and execute. Same thing for recipes. I usually just look at a bunch of different ones, and try to understand the flavors and texture that I want, and then I use what I've learned. A lot of my first attempt new meals turn out great when I do this.  \n\nIf you're looking you aint cooking. Let food sit for a minute when it needs to. Get a timer, double check it, and you're good to go. Meat thermometers are awesome, but I don't have one. If you just don't feel like buying one, like me, learn to feel the meet with your hand and always undercook it a little bit. Then, either put it in a bowl/plate and cover in foil, allowing the meat to cook itself to perfection, or finish in the oven. OR cook it on low heat forever, and get something altogether different.  \n\nExperiment and have fun. Always use less of something at first, because you can always add, but never take away. Try to avoid premade spices, rubs, seasonings, and sauces. You kill half the fun of cooking by doing that, and when you learn your herb and spice rack, you will be able to cook pretty much anything in your favorite styles.",

            "Moved into an apartment where my roommate was one of my best friends who happened to be a girl. Completely platonic relationship for 12 years at that point. 6 months later I'm stoned out of my mind, as per usual, when I get home from work late at night and she asked me to lay down in her bed with her because she had woken up from a nightmare. So I laid down, on top of the blanket, and she fell asleep. I had intended to get up and go into my own room and watch cartoons with the rest of my high, but I ended up getting comfy and fell asleep. The next morning she woke me up by lightly scratching my back, but little did she know that nails on my back are an instant turn on. Never had any feelings for each other. Never did anything even remotely physical. Nothing. Just boom, instant wood. Jokingly told her to cut it out or it's gonna get awkward and she didn't know what I meant at first until I rolled over and she saw the tent in my pants. We discussed the idea of us being together or even just casual sex between friends and one year later I wifed her. No regerts. Not a single letter. Married my best friend because she accidentally made me horny.",

I remember there was people in my class who worked on it for days, some even weeks, and some of them didn't get a 100. It's just important to me because my parent always says I'm smart and such so this really showed me. I'm in all honor classes and has been since middle school and was in GT in elementary school.

But my mom had her own, unique idea on what to do with the key: Make a wooden block to hang on the wall, attach hooks to said wooden block, and whoever wins gets to have the key under their name, until it is passed to the next person.\n\nIt only took my dad about a half hour to fashion the block and put the hooks on it, and attach it to the wall. I used a label maker to print \"Mom\", \"Dad\", and \"Daughter\", and he stuck them each to their respective hooks.\n\nIt's a pretty fun tradition. I'm considering, one day, getting the likeness of the key tattooed.

He said it didn't have to be weird because they weren't looking for a threesome or anything like that. I agreed because it sounded interesting, but the sex they had was extremely rough and unexpected.\n\nAt one point he started crying while she was doing a certain something to his backside while wearing a large attachment and I asked if he was alright which caused him to get pissed and yell at me for interrupting them. \n\nI stayed quiet after that and kept recording when he was able to get back in the mood. After they were done he left the room and his wife asked me to never to bring up him crying to him because he was sensitive about it. I of course agreed and she hugged me then  kissed me on my cheek which I really didn't like because she was still naked and covered in sweat and I just watched her eat his butt not more than 15 minutes prior :/",

Also a fair amount of vomit. \n\nI was once on set for a scene that involved faking accidental anal. So. Much. Poop. Then after the performer used the bathroom for an hour of douching, the scene continued. Every few minutes a cameraman or sound guy would wipe blood from the dudes dick. They weren't willing to halt filming because they had a tight schedule and the empty mansion they were filming in had a real estate appointment meeting in it that night.",

Nothing explicit, just a bit of topless stuff. Mind you, I didn't know her at all, she was a random person who reached out on Instagram. \n\nShe texts me and tells me that we are going to facetime... At 12am. I insist that we can talk tomorrow and that I'm already in bed and she persists that's it's fine. I hate facetiming, especially with people I don't know, especially at midnight when I'm already cozy in bed. \n\nShe calls me and IS IN THE MIDDLE OF TAKING A PISS completely nude and drunk off her ass. I was taken aback and told her we can just talk tomorrow. She gets upset and says that we need to talk now so she can show me her body and her tattoos.

            "I used to shoot fetish and bdsm porn in college and for a few years after I graduated college. 2010-16ish. \n\nI have a degree in photography and was in boy scout and I\u2019m very good at knots so a friend got me into it by helping tie up men and women and photographing them for her fetish site. This led to me doing tons of more work.  \n\nThe worst is feeder porn work. These poor women would just eat and eat on camera and then vomit and gag all over themselves it was pretty rough stuff to photograph and film. Also it would make me kinda of sad because these women would gain large amounts of weight quickly between each time you\u2019d work with them and it just didn\u2019t seem healthy. \n\nAs has been said already the worst part is the smells. Group sex scenes, and the feeder scenes the smells were enough to make you gag some times.\n\nAlso if you want to make decent money you have to do both gay and straight scenes which as a straight male at first is really odd but you get used to it shockingly quick. \nThe worst part is you become kinda numb to it all when you are behind the camera. Like you will meet your model and she will be very attractive but as soon as your behind the camera it becomes very much so a job and you become focused on getting a good shot and the lighting correct. The awkwardness of them being naked and masturbating or having sex in front of you disappears so quick. You sort of become numb to it all to the point in your personal life nudity and sex doesn\u2019t effect you the same. \nOne of the most awkward things was when models would show up with their boyfriends who would just be like really weird and awkward in the set background. Like it would almost always be buff military or former military dudes or wanna be mma fighter types and they\u2019d stand cross armed off to the side and being very encouraging to their girlfriends/boyfriends while watching them get fucked.  I personally just always found that odd. I understand they came I guess to make them feel safe but some of the weird things they\u2019d say would always make you scratch your head. \n\nOnly got came on once and it just grazed my leg. Got squirt droplets hit me a few times. Never really got involved with the scenes other then that and tying people up.\nHonestly sets were much more professional then I imagined when I was younger. Most of the porn girls were not like crazy whores who wanted to fuck constantly it was literally them turning it on and off for the camera. \nI worked with a smaller budget company so I never saw fluffers and I honestly question if they really exist. \nIt would be common to see the guys sort of just casually be jerking off between shots to keep it up. Which is sort of weird. You\u2019d be talking to them about asserting a shot up and they\u2019d just be jerking it the whole time. \n\nPay was pretty good. Usually on set days was about $60 an hour paid out in 4 hour blocks so even if you worked 6 hours you\u2019d get paid for 8 which was cool. Your an independent contractor/ freelance even if you tend to just work for one company. I\u2019m mostly out of that world now with the occasional shooting for some girls who I\u2019ve stayed in contact with to shoot for their only fans pages.",

            "I don't shoot porn or even erotic but I am a photographer who shoots a lot of art nudes and my models range from first time models who only shoot fully clothed to people who shoot porn. Before every shoot I give the model a safety talk, in which I say that I won't touch them, that I'll show them every shot I take, and tell them that if anything is making them uncomfortable I want them to speak up. I once had a model interrupt that talk to say \"My job is mainly shooting bondage and fetish porn. There is nothing that you are going to say or do that will make me uncomfortable.\" That felt awkward to me. I thought about it for a second and told her that I did not care what she did at other times, I was going to treat her like I treated every other model, and then I went on with my model safety talk. \n\nI have to admit that I am always a bit nervous working with a model who is new to me. Her saying that actually made me relax a bit during the shoot.",
            "Former porn producer here.\n  \nI\u2019ve mentioned stories here on Reddit that were more sad than awkward, and though I didn\u2019t run the camera all the time... there was awkwardness abound.\n  \n- During setups it\u2019s common knowledge that the guy needs to either start getting hard or remain hard. In straight porn the woman will intimately interact with the guy to keep those juices flowing. In gay porn (back in \u201803) the guys were straight, so they would watch straight porn. Or sometimes just stand there and jack off. On more than one occasion the guy would be jacking off and causally look at me and say \u201csup\u201d while I was working. You can make the argument that he was probably gay but I was the least attractive man on that set.  \n- On a straight porn set the guy was plowing the woman missionary style in between setups. The woman wanted a blanket from her car, but needed to tell me where the keys to her car were. So while getting fucked she was like \u201cit\u2019s in... my gym bag... side... pocket...\u201d\n- I once opened a dishwasher in a porn studio to get a plate and found the whole top rack filled with dildos. They were used by performers doing live cam sessions. Some guy came up and was like \u201cTHERE\u2019S my favorite!\u201d And took a blue dildo from the rack.  \n- Devon Davis, the now deceased wife of Jonathan Davis of Korn, was best friends with Jill Kelly back when I worked for her. They did a photo shoot where they were eating each other\u2019s pussies, like 5 feet from my desk. Devon kept her wine glass on my desk and kept walking up to me like \u201cyou\u2019re getting hard huh\u201d. I really wasn\u2019t and just wanted to work without causing any waves since Jill was my boss. She later got mad because she demanded I picked up dog shit from Jill\u2019s dog and I told her no.  \n- On a gay porn set this 5\u2019 9\u201d guy who had a massive 12\u201d dick was plowing this guy hard. Our set photographer, who was gay, was like \u201cI took a dick that big once and I got dizzy.\u201d Sure enough the scene stops and the bottom went to stand up and took a second step saying \u201cman, I\u2019m a bit dizzy.\u201d  \n- I guess some of those aren\u2019t really \u201cawkward\u201d, but the most awkward thing on every porn set is the whole crew sitting in silence watching a guy jack off. He announces when he\u2019s about to cum and the crew, and woman/man, swing into action to get the pop shot.",

James Cameron began his career shooting porn (edit: I did a little research on this and can\u2019t find a damn thing to back this up. Could be just an unfounded rumor).\n\nWe had a really long discussion about it once and these are the big things I remember:\n\n1) The job can be really boring from a creative perspective. Most production companies were very rigid with the shots they wanted and it didn\u2019t leave much room for artistic license. Keep in mind this was like 15 years ago, things may have changed.\n\n2) the worst part, by far, was the smell. Anyone that\u2019s ever shot a film indoors knows one of your greatest enemies is the massive heat generated by the lights and equipment. Imagine two people going at it for hours in a room that\u2019s getting steadily hotter... add in anal and all bets are off.\n\n3) drugs everywhere. Lots of male performers use some kind of viagra coupled with other shit to desensitize their penis. Coke is rampant among female performers. The more professional production companies usually ran a tight ship with regards to drugs but most of the amateur ones, lol, it was anything goes.\n\n4) a surprising number of creampie shots are faked. Apparently it\u2019s harder for a male performer to cum from vaginal stimulation than from just jacking off (remember, lots of viagra and hours of desensitized penis + other drugs). So, when a creampie needs to happen and the male performer can\u2019t do it, they use a special liquid that looks like cum and squirt it up into the vagina. Then they have the guy stick his penis in and after a few thrusts it looks like he came. He said you can usually tell because there\u2019s a tell tale transition cut right before the creampie shot. It\u2019s also why when there\u2019s an actual legit creampie the male performer will pull out and squirt a little bit to prove it was a legit creampie.\n\n5) everyone is surprisingly normal. They\u2019re just people doing a job for the most part. The industry has some assholes and creeps but in the mid to high tiers of the industry people treat it like any other professional job.",

            "I\u2019ve shot a lot of fetish and boudoir, and for the most part, it\u2019s like shooting anything else.  My mind gets focused on light, shadows, composition, etc, rather than \u201clook, there\u2019s someone\u2019s gaping butthole\u201d.\n\nShooting adult content is a lot less glamorous than people think.  I\u2019ve had past partners ask to bring the camera into the bedroom.  It\u2019s fun, but if you\u2019re going to get good content, it\u2019s not super sexy - there\u2019s a lot of starting and stopping to adjusting lights, set up timers, etc.",
            "My uncles best mate used to have his own photography business (he stopped about 8 years ago) \n\nHe always mentioned a story where a woman approached him and asked him to take photos of her so she could give the album to her husband for his birthday. Fully naked pictures of her using sex toys and so on..\n\nAnyway, she\u2019d apparently been using a dildo on her ass and she was around 2 hours into the shoot. She finished with the dildo and was spreading her cheeks when a little nugget of poo came sliding out, which just so happened to be caught on camera with her showing a face of absolute horror. She got changed and left and paid for the pictures several weeks later, except the one of the great escape.\n\nI never did see those pictures so can\u2019t say for certain.",

            "I do boudoir photography as a side hustle and you\u2019d be amazed how quickly tasteful can turn into tacky or downright raunchy. And, awkward? There\u2019s a TON of that just by virtue of the work, but here are my top three examples:\n\n1) A bride decided to do a photo shoot for her groom. She comes in with an assortment of outfits, progressively provocative, and one of them is the classic white bridal lingerie getup, which we decide to save for last. \n\nThe shoot is going well, bride isn\u2019t nervous and is actually pretty fun and chill. She poses in some cool looks, like a sexified baseball jersey to rep their team and a dorky ass elf outfit a la LOTR. We get the the end of the shoot and it\u2019s time for the super sexy wedding night look. Bride touches up her makeup and she is looking HOT. I send her off to get changed because the outfit consists of stalkings, garters, a corset, the whole shebang, and I want her to have enough time for a good assortment of posing options. \n\nAs I\u2019m making a few adjustments to the lighting, I hear a scream from the back. I rush to the dressing area and call the bride\u2019s name. I find her, half dressed and sobbing, clutching one of her breasts. I look a little closer and there\u2019s blood on her hand and her breast. I ask her what happened, but she\u2019s too upset to speak. I ask if she can show me, so she moves her hand and then I fucking scream. It turns out she didn\u2019t know what the garter clip was for and mistook it for some type of kinky nipple clamp shit. The thing cut her so badly she ended up needing stitches. \n\nA few weeks later, we were able to rush an appointment for her to finish the shoot in time for her wedding. But she decided to leave the stalkings and their accoutrements behind for the final go. \n\n2) Another good one was when a young woman treated herself to a photo shoot for her 21st birthday. She said it was all about giving herself a confidence boost, but I had a hard time believing it because she was definitely the conventionally gorgeous type. I asked her about it and she was very candid. She explained that, while she was physically attractive and in great shape, for some reason, whenever a relationship started to get serious (read: sexual), the person would just ghost her. For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t figure out why that would be, so I told her as much. \n\nShe got changed and we got started. Things were going smoothly and she was having a good time. She was an absolute knockout and a natural with posing. We were really enjoying ourselves, talking throughout the process and getting to know one another. The time came for some more ~closeup~ shots, so I talked through what that could look like, let her decide how she wanted to stage them and whether she wanted to be fully nude or partially. She decided on fully nude and went to the dressing area to get herself situated. \n\nShe comes back and I have her take her robe off and stretch out on a chaise in the studio. I start with some full body shots and move a bit closer every few shots. I get to be about a foot away from her and I am hit with the most intense smell. I know that it can\u2019t possibly be coming from anywhere but her body. I get a little closer to confirm my suspicions and yup, it\u2019s definitely coming from her vagina. \n\nNow I am not in the \u201call pussies smell\u201d camp AT ALL. I mean, have you guys every had your nose near some balls? So, I figure there has got to be something going on with this girl\u2019s health or hygiene and decide to bite the bullet and talk to her about it. I don\u2019t beat around the bush, I just say \u201cHey, lady, I have to be honest with you: there\u2019s a bit of a smell down here.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even look surprised and she looks at me like I have three heads and tells me \u201cOf course there is, I keep my flower wild.\u201d \n\nWe get to talking about it in depth and I learn that not only does she not groom her pubic area, she also doesn\u2019t WASH it. Her mother warned her against using feminine cleaning products and she took that to mean ALL cleaning products. Fam, I gave her a (clothed) demonstration of how I wash myself, handed her a bar of soap, and let her use the shower in my attached apartment to remedy that situation immediately. She came back with a smile on her face and a song in her heart and we finished the shoot without incident. That could\u2019ve gone a whole different way, but to this day she tells me I changed her life. \n\n3)I saved this one for last because it was the most awkward for ME. I don\u2019t often shoot couples, for various reasons. However, a really good friend of mine asked very nicely and I always had a little crush on her so I said yes. I was confused though, because I\u2019d never met her partner and was kind of surprised to hear she was dating someone AND it was serious enough for an erotic photo shoot. She admitted it was new, but she was just so into him that she had to go for it. We set the date and talked logistics and all seemed fine. \n\nThe day of the shoot comes around and I\u2019m nervous (I hate couples shoots, y\u2019all). They arrive and we do introductions. Something about the boyfriend seems familiar but also kind of off, but I just roll with things. They change clothes and we start off with some cheesy \u201clook into her eyes\u201d shit to ease into the naked stuff. We get into a rhythm and things are actually not terrible, so we take a break to get ready for the next set of shots. This is where it gets awkward. \n\nThe boyfriend comes out first and he just kind of stares at me. He starts talking and tries to pull the whole \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty to be behind the camera\u201d thing and I\u2019m like \u201cDude, chill.\u201d Then he looks at me with a weirdly intense expression and asks \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d To which the only answer, dear reader, was hell the fuck no. My friend (his girlfriend) returns and I can\u2019t wait to get started so we can be finished. \n\nAs soon as they remove their robes, shit gets reeeaally awkward. I notice boyfriend has a small tattoo on his left hip depicting a sort of hipster arrow adventure situation. That looked familiar, friends. But then, I look over at his right hip and see a tattoo of similar size with MY FUCKING (and rather uncommon) NAME. And that\u2019s when I remember the guy. I went on three dates with him, over the course of two weeks, and then broke it off with him because he had some serious red flags. \n\nMy friend notices my face and is like, \u201cOh, yeah, the tattoo. That\u2019s his \u2018one that got away\u2019 from a while back. Weird that you have the same name though.\u201d I look at her and I know I can\u2019t lie, so I flat out say, \u201cUhh, I think that\u2019s IS my name.\u201d Her boyfriend then starts crying and coming toward us both (naked and with a very confusing erection) calling out, not for his current girlfriend of nearly six months, but for me. I nope the fuck out of there and let them talk. \n\nIt gets awfully quiet so I head back in to check on things, only to find my friend is nowhere to be found and her boyfriend (ex-boyfriend?) is quietly sobbing and masturbating in the middle of the studio floor. I just left him there and sent my guy friend to get him out of there for me while I checked on the girlfriend. She broke up with him on the spot and left, because she couldn\u2019t face me. She made sure he still paid me, though, and promised to never ask me to do a couples shoot again. I did eventually do a solo shoot with her, but that\u2019s a tale for another thread entirely (**wink wink**).\n\nEDIT: Holy shit this blew up! Thanks all for reading! \n\nThree quick things: \n1) Yes, I know it\u2019s stockings Jesus H. Christ. I used speech to text for part of it and it\u2019s fucking Reddit not grad school so I didn\u2019t proofread. \n\n2) Stinkypuss wasn\u2019t even washing AROUND her vagina. She ended up having to use some type of cream from her GP because there was a ton of bacteria from years of neglect. She and I are friends now and yes she knows I call her stinkypuss (even though it\u2019s no longer \u00e0 propos of her *situation*). \n\n3) Regarding my friend in story 3: obviously we boned. She does not have my name tattooed on her body. As for the guy, he is somehow still single and I wish him well.\n\nEDIT 2 (Electric Boogaloo): \n\nEnough people have asked for the story behind number three that I\u2019ve decided I should just share it, too. Friends, see my comment reply below for story 3A. Before you read, please play the song \u201cBestie\u201d by Sizzy Rocket. Thanks and enjoy.",

            "Ooh an ask reddit I can actually respond to! \n\nI\u2019m a makeup artist in the porn world. I\u2019m there on set all the time so I see it all. Nothing has really been awkward for me, I\u2019m pretty laid back and it all just seems pretty natural for me, just like people doing their jobs. \n\nI guess the most awkward moment is if I can tell the two actors don\u2019t have chemistry or they\u2019re not attracted to each other. I feel like it shows on film. That\u2019s the only moment I could describe as being \u2018awkward\u2019.\n\nOh actually it was really awkward for me this one time filming a gang bang, I went into a different room to clean my brushes and one guy took a break from the gang bang to come and talk to me. He was stood there naked and masturbating while asking about my job. I\u2019ve seen literally everything but it was pretty awks one guy leaving a room from banging a porn star to come and talk to me about nothing multiple times. He was twice my age too. I asked him if he was probably needed on set and he agreed.\n\nSome people have mentioned fake cum and yeah it is used sometimes! Usually they\u2019ll get the real cum shot and use the fake one to get a better angle if needed? Like if he was aiming for the tits and misses, we\u2019ll use the fake one the make it look hotter. I\u2019ve been a spare set of hands on set before and have been the one to \u2018jizz\u2019 on an actress.\n\nJob in general is awesome. I met some really cool people and have made some awesome friends. I don\u2019t get turned on during filming before you ask, except maybe this one scene where it was one girl and two really attractive guys that were also both bi and all really enjoying themselves. Was a bit jel haha. It is pretty hot when I can tell the actors are super into it and enjoying themselves.\n\nI also knelt down one time to pick something up and got covered in squirt. That was pretty funny!\n\nIve had to put makeup on butts that we\u2019re covered in bruising from bdsm shoots they\u2019d had before.\nAlso put makeup on nipples that they wanted to look pinker.\n\nI can think of other funny things that happen if you\u2019re all interested! Most things aren\u2019t awkward honestly, they\u2019re all just human bodies and things happen, I guess most people that would find bodies awkward wouldn\u2019t be working in the porn industry.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m a bit late but feel free to ask any questions, I\u2019ve got nothing to do today!",

She'd been fasting to look skinnier for the shoot so she wasn't too picky on where we stopped. When we got there she practically ran to the corner booth before ordering a huge burger. \n\nThere were well over a thousand shots so going through them took a while. Surprisingly, our waiter was incredibly attentive the entire time despite us sitting there well after the food had been finished.  I don't think our waters or coffees were ever less than half full and he kept reassuring us that we could stay as long as we needed. It \n was almost annoying how he kept checking on us every few minutes. \n\nOnce we had narrowed it down to a couple of dozen photos to be touched up we paid the tab and got up to leave. \n\nThat's when I noticed the giant mirror right behind the booth. Every time the waiter came over he got an explicit eyeful of the woman sitting next to me on my laptop screen. \n\nThankfully the model wasn't exactly bashful about her body and found it hilarious.",

He got so sad but couldn\u2019t show it, so then he drove off.... which the \u201cproducer\u201d allowed him to do.\n\nThis was a truly terrible experience for me, the way sex can be so degrading to everyone involved if it\u2019s controlled by toxicity and shitty values.

            "My dad's in the industry as an erotic photographer, sometimes stepping close to the line to straight up porn. I help him out sometimes during shoots, they are a lot of fun most of the time, everyone is really chill and cool to talk to. He  offers courses for other photographers who are trying to start out in the industry, these often take place over the span of a few days in an exotic setting, for example on islands like mallorca or ibiza, we often had run-ins with the police from different countrys because tourists called them, lol.\n\nHe often gets criticism, people call him out for objectifying women and such. And yeah, the industry is brutal and some phototgraphers are assholes. This is why my dad has a \"moral codex\" written down on his website and online profiles, which is something that, surprisingly, not many photographers have. Some modeling agencys are straight up awful, going as far as only allowing the models to eat a certain amount of food per day (the only allowed snack during shoots for a former model he had some shootings where tictacs) or to restrict their personal life (preventing them from having boyfriends, controlling their social media,...), which is why my dad nowadys only works with freelancing models, both male and female.\n\nYou often hear stories about photographers and models fucking behind the scenes. This is true, to an extent. Some do it and fully embrace it, however not without consent from the models. My dad sees his work more as an art form than a pure sex thing (most of his work is pretty artistic or provocative, imagine nuns having lesbian sex using crosses as toys for example, or severely over/underweight models in stereotypically sexy poses).

Based in Central Europe.\n\nOnce shot a girl/boy set and only when the girl was signing the model release did we see that she was 16! Gulp! My assistant forgot to ask for her official documentation before the shoot. \n\nChatting with a model after work. She says that this is the only way she can get money for herself as her boyfriend is very controlling and jealous. Turns out he's a big mafia guy who just got out of prison for manslaughter. Never booked her again.\n\nThe worst were girls who were light on personal hygiene. Some of those smells could fell a bison at 20 meters.\n\nA model thought it would be a great idea to break it to her mum that this was her new work. But it turned out both the mum and dad were in town, and both showed up. That was super awkward as they were totally ashamed and gutted by her choices. \n\nModels would steal make up, clothes and anything that wasn't nailed down.\n\nIt was just a job. I ran my own websites, so it allowed me the freedom to live all over the world and party like a pill for all those years. The negatives are that I started to despise myself for depicting women in a certain way. Oh...and the work more or less kills any sex drive.",

            "I\u2019ve worked in porn for about 6 years total. Mostly working for gay studios.\n\nHonestly, feeling awkward has gone out the door. It\u2019s very... difficult... to be awkward when you work in that sort of environment. People ask me if i get turned on while filming \u2014 no. I\u2019m more focused on getting the right shots and angles + directing the model which takes the fun out of it. It has happened, but only with models who are extremely good at their job and move fluently. \n\nEh, I\u2019ve discovered working that closely and personally with people is just too much drama. I\u2019ve taken a step back for the rest of this year.\n\nBut I\u2019ve definitely been cum on a couple times. Also had to witness a couple positive STD screenings. THAT WAS AWK.",

            "Okay, story time:\n\nWe were working a soft core for late night cable, but the actors were generally hardcore porn folks. So the sex was supposed to simulated, right? Well, the dummies couldn\u2019t figure this out. Meanwhile, the director had a PA sound system wired up so he could direct from the monitor area (\u201cvideo village\u201d). Well, we were up in the Hollywood Hills in the pool area of a mansion. There are definitely neighbors up there. Anyways, the director had this PA turned up loud and he\u2019d be shouting at the the actors \u201cFuck her! Fuck her! NO DON\u2019T TOUCH HIS DICK! DON\u2019T TOUCH IT! Fuck her! Goddammit! Fuck! DON\u2019T SUCK HIS COCK! FAKE IT!\u201d and on and on and on...\n\nSame show: An actress comes out of HMU dressed in only a mid-thigh nightie. She\u2019s slinking along next to the pool, tip toeing around lights and cables when out of NOWHERE, *tunk*, her little early 00\u2019s Nokia hits the ground. Everyone freezes. Crickets. Where did that phone fall from??? She doesn\u2019t have enough cleavage... No purse... She wasn\u2019t holding it... She turns bright red, snatches the phone, and bolts back into the makeup trailer.\n\nAnother gig: Loser male actor can\u2019t cum. So the 2nd AD gets a squirt bottle filled with a little elmers glue and KY. At the moment of phony orgasm, he squeezes the bottle for the cumshot and overdoes it so badly it looks like a motherfucking HORSE was blowing his load on this poor girl. The whole crew falls apart laughing and pretty much kill the whole scene.\n\nThere are more stories, but they\u2019re all from years ago and I can\u2019t remember them right now. Maybe I\u2019ll add more.\n\nGod I hope this is the right account...\n\nAdd: \n\nMary Carey was running for CA governor. She was on a job I was doing and acting like the most popular person in the world. Hijacking conversations, butting in, super self-centered me me me behavior, (though at least she was nice about it). Obnoxious. Well, one day she decided pants were optional. She wasn\u2019t involved with a sex scene at all. Just decided to let her nethers air out for some reason. So she headed to the craft services table. She rummaged around in her crotch for a moment, then rummaged around the Doritos. Scratched her ass, grabbed a handful of M&Ms, more crotch, more Doritos, etc. I was standing there the whole time. So I got on my radio and said to the crew, looking directly into her eyes, \u201cThe Doritos have been compromised.\u201d \n\nThe next day, a very sweaty, naked, male actor who just finished railing a girl comes down to the crafty table and sweats all over it deciding what to eat. He\u2019s literally dripping sex sweat onto the snack, table.\nThe key grip marches right over and stiff arms the entire table of food into the trash.",

            "I mean, I film myself? So I don't know if that counts. It's a little awkward when someone requests you film something like pussy, ass, breast, toes and smile *at the same time*. So it ends up being like:\n\n* set up camera and lights\n* put on make up\n* get in position\n* check camera angle\n* repeat step 3 and 4 until results are satisfactory\n* take a bunch of pictures \n* check if they're OK, and if yes\n* do your thing\n* check and see if it actually turned out ok\n* upload to computer\n* edit your photos \n* colourgrade your skin and genitals (is that the right shade of pink or is the shadow a little too purple?)\n* edit sequence\n* add watermark and intro, outro\n\nI like my job, obviously, I like it a lot, but man. In the beginning, it's so fucking weird to stare at your vag and try decide if it's the right colour and best angle, never mind listening to yourself dirty talk over and over as you scrub the video or edit the audio. I've ended up helplessly laughing a lot. \n\nAnswering \"what are you doing?\" with \"Watermarking my ass\" hasn't gotten old though.\n\nETA: Check out Holly Randall's podcast (it's on all podcast apps and on YouTube), she's a well-known porn directory and photographer, and her podcast is great. Lots of behind the scenes stories.",
            "So my first time filming was my buddy and his GF. We went to this motel (definitely not a hotel) and I went out to drink (calmed the nerves) with his gf while he set everything up. I came back and threw in some headphones and we started up. I was pretty buzzed at this point and started getting really into it. The camera had a big microphone \ud83c\udfa4 that had a foam covering over it and stuck out on the front of the camera and I got too close too my buddies butthole and poked it. You can still here me going \"oh fuck\" in the video. Also another time I drove him around while he fucked this little doll. It was absolutely wild. \"LIAM BLAKE\" was his name.",
            "I have a cousin who set up a small \"Casting Couch\" style porn business. He was really pretty straight forward with it. He put a lot of his own money into it to start. He rented a nice little office, had a pretty secretary (one of his cousins) and a whole schedule book.\n\nThe first few weeks they were seeing 15-20 girls per day at 15-30 minutes a piece.\n\nThe first 'interview' was informational and letting them know what they would be required to do, if they so choose. \n\nThe second interview was a bit longer. A good shower, inspection, tasteful photos, and marking down what the were ok with and what they weren't. There they'd learn what the earning potential is and get offered their first scene.\n\nIt took only a couple of weeks for the awkwardness to start, and it was primarily in the form of boyfriends, girlfriends, and PARENTS! Yes PARENTS would storm in and demand all kinds of answers.\n\nThey'd call the police and landlord and anyone they could to try and shut them down. But in the end, they remained oppurating for several years.\n\nAfter my cousin and staff had enough money to go on and do something else, they shut down, moved, and did just that.",
            "There was a guy who worked at my previous news media company. He used to work for a pornstar before joining where I worked. He used to do the amateur cameraman work like inserting dildos and anal beads and all sorts of shit in her while filming it. He told me he was never personally involved in her activites and never intended to get personal with her. But one day during filming, she started ordering him around to put his dick in her ass and fuck her. He was baffled and that's where he noped the fuck out. It's one of the more hilarious stories I got to know from my workmates.",

            "This sounds odd but here goes, A friend was hired to do camera work on sex parties for wealthy clients( and I was part of his staff. The money he got was pretty good and he always liked barely legal hustles. The deal was pro camera work,equipment and professional makeup which we had 2 or 3 professional anesthetics people with fairly high quality makeup. So the women could look like porn sluts with good makeup and sexy outfits. Explaining to people it had to be a few degrees colder due to the amount of people and physical activity got aggrivating. The estate was huge,\nmassive!! Things I noticed, there was a few assholes but most of the people seemed to be fond of each other,everyone was chill and with their cliques and were relaxed, women were much more jealous of somebody with their partner than the guys. Really good looking men with normal penises always got action as did the hung dudes. There was drugs booze and finger foods everywhere. This was basically a club treat for all the swingers in this area and most didnt think about certain logistics. To do all the scenes with our crew we had to make a fuck/film schedule. Things you dont know or cant explain dont eat snacks all day when you are going to spend an hour or so taking it in every hole and doing ass to mouth. You will end up eating a fudgesicle. I think nearly everyone on our team had a lil fun of some sort. The weirder aspects is how high school it felt at times in a real odd way. The 67 yr old enterpreneur comforting his wife because no one wants to fuck her and she feels unloved because of it. The fuck buddy guy with a big dick trying to fight the husband who was both uninterested and unprovoked he had lots of money and security escorted the dude out. A lot of naked dudes and chest rugs. This was a lot of very wealthy people and we were paid well. Comsidering the type of money that these people had everyone was really nice to our crew. Outside of set a fairly strict schedule and us having to get everyone filmed, when these get togethers were just fuck parties typically. There was some oddities and a few fights but it was a lot more low key than youd think."

Snuggled in heavy warm furs with my husband the fire crackles, our wolf pup sleeps next to us. The wolves are howling outside and hyenas cackle on the plains. A lone cry of a large saber toothed cat or cave lion bellows over miles across the cold swept plains. Our hut is part of a lodge, connected by mammoth bones built by our predecessors, fortified with strong boughs, hides, even stones. It keeps us warm and dry. \n\nThe wind howls long and lonely like the wolves bringing snow and ice. Wrapped in furs, I cuddle with my husband as it keeps us warm underneath. I kiss him, and he wraps himself around me. I hear the low breathing of our puppy with slight running in his sleep. The elders talk long into the night a low chorus, against hide and stick walls. I can hear owls calling too, breaking a harsh cold silence after the wolves have moved. The wind is blowing and the soft hush of snow falling. I feel myself drifting in the warmth of the furs and embrace of my love. The last I see are the embers and soft orange flames of the fire.",

            "Went on a mountain hike in Transylvania with a group of friends from school, and way up, after maybe 12-14 km of trekking, we saw a house....was in the middle of nowhere. It had a barn, with a few animals, couple of cows, chicken, etc. As we get closer, we see a few people, a guy and 5-6 women. Not sure if there were more inside. The dude comes to greet us, barely speaking the language. We had a hard time understanding what he's saying. They lived without electricity, gas, anything. This is in the early 90s, so there's no internet, mobile phones to worry about. At least for most people.\n\nAnyway, they all looked weird, kinda dumb expressions on their face, we can barely understand eachother. They asked us who's the president now, and if we want some milk. They look at our clothes and shoes weirdly, curious...like who knows when is the last time they had human contact. Or maybe there were more crazies around those parts...dunno. Not sure to this day what was going on. It's not typical in the region, so we kinda freaked out, especially cause the dude looked a bit disturbed, and we were too young. We were looking around to see if there's more of them, paranoia was getting to us, thinking there must be a village nearby. What was also weird is that all the women kept their distance, and never got close to us. Like he was guarding them, or checking us out, if it's safe for them.\n\nOne of my friends kept saying we don't want their milk, and we need to go, cause it's getting dark. We walked calmly for a while, then when we thought we're out of their sight, bolted like crazy out of there. Needless to say, we camped after a few hours, and we always had one person awake to keep watch.\n\nWe told people that were living in the villages near that area, about the \"mountain people\", and they didn't believe us. They said nobody lives there, up in the mountains.",
            "A little over 18 years ago I had just gotten out of the military. I drove all the way from Louisiana to my home town in Montana, without incident. \n\nI spent a few days at home and then got back on the road because my new home destination was Boise Idaho. It was February so instead of going straight down the length of the state I cut across the panhandle of Idaho into Washington. The highway going straight down through the state is really twisty and very dangerous in the winter. \n\nSo I crossed the state line into Washington. It was a Sunday  and it was very very early in the morning. As cliche as it sounds there was quite a bit of fog in the air. I had been driving for a while and I really had to use the bathroom. Now normally given how I was out in the middle of nowhere I would normally just pulled over on the side and took a whizz but since it was so foggy and hard to see I thought it safer to just wait until I hit the next small town. \n\nSo I drove for maybe 5 more miles and I started seeing signs for a town. I can't remember for the life of me the name of the town but I think it was Linden or Linder something like that. It was on I90 going into the Spokane valley \nSo I head towards the sign which was a right turn off the interstate and its a short drive up this road and I reached the town. It was small but I thought nothing of it since I was from a small town in Montana. \n\nNow here is where things get odd. \nThere was not a single person to be found. There were cars and business but not a single person to be found no one walking the street no logging trucks driving everything was just as still as the air. I stopped at a gas station. It was one of those 1 in all places that did car repair tires etc, but no one was at the counter. \nI thought well maybe it's just really early. So I went around to the side to see if the bathroom was locked and it was. As I made my way back around to the front of the building saw a delivery truck it was a coke classic truck. Except it wasn't moving its head lights were on the hazard lights were on and the passenger and driver side doors were open  just sitting there in the middle of the street. Yes I was getting a bad vibe so I got back in my car and went back the way I came I got back to i90 and thought again about just pissing on the side of the road but honestly I was too afraid. I continued driving until I hit Spokane honestly I was more than a bit freaked out and had completely forgotten I had to piss. \n\nI didnt see anything creepy or hear anything creepy but the stillness in the air and the complete lack of life human or animal was just terrifying and unsettling. \nI looked on the map to where I was once I got to Spokane which was a rand McNally's map (because GPS on phones was just not a thing yet) and I could not find it at all on the map even as I was writing this I looked at Google maps and nothing by the name Linden Linder or otherwise is on the map. I still to this day will never forget that feeling of just freaky displacement I felt there. \n\nWhen I got to Boise I told my friend about it and he thought I was just trying to rip off silent hill or resident evil and honestly I can't blame people for saying that but  at the same time that was the reason I wouldnt piss on the side of the road. I kept recalling the part in RE 1 where the hikers were killed by the murderous dogs. \n\nAnyway if you stuck around this long thanks for reading and if you know of a town on hwy 2 between Coeur d'lene Idaho and Spokane Washington people let me know. If you are from there I mean no offense but your town is creepy as fuck.\n\n\nEdit: I have to correct myself after going back over my trip I didnt stay on hwy 2 I actually jumped on  i90 and then went over to Spokane. \n\nLast couple of days I have been thinking about this and I have a 3 day weekend coming up maybe I will take a road trip up to northern Idaho and see if I can find this place again. Maybe I'm tempting fate here but its gonna he my 37th birthday so here's  to adventure !",
            "Doing urban exploration in a dilapidated church at night, on one of the floors was this circular motif in the floor where i guess a podium or something was. There was fresh blood on it as if something was killed there. When we went in the basement later on, we heard someone running upstairs. I'll see if i can find a picture of it, if it's in my tower pc i probably won't be able to for a while though since it's fried.\n\nEdit: [Found it](https://preview.redd.it/myhpfxk1qr431.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=6a3ed8cbc9eb6056fe89dadfc36747cbfc8abb38)",
            "When I was really young, we were on a family trip and me and my older brother took a ride on a boat. I remember my mom telling us to avoid the \"big floating thing\". She thought it was a buoy to signalize a dangerous rock under water or something. Being kids, of course we went straight there to explore it. So turns out it was not a buoy. That was a body of a turist that went missing a week ago, as the police informed us a few days later. Creepy thing is he was one of a group of people that had disappeared together. I believe they never find the rest.\nSo, not a good childhood memory.",
            "Not sure if this is the kind of story you\u2019re looking for, but it\u2019s a fun one to tell so here you go. \n\nI used to work in low income home weatherization, basically giving free shit away to help lower electricity and gas bills and make the home more comfortable to people who really needed it; installing doors and insulation and so forth. \n\nOne step in qualifying a home is testing combustion appliances to make sure they\u2019re not emitting carbon monoxide into the living space, because if they are and we seal up the house we could kill the whole family. \n\nDuring a pre-inspection of a home on the outskirts of the city, I ask to see the owner\u2019s water heater. He tells me that it\u2019s in the basement, which is fairly normal, and I tell him I have to inspect it before work can start. So, he goes into the kitchen and starts moving the refrigerator. Turns out the entry into the basement is underneath carpeting beneath the fridge. I should note that I went and did thousands of homes over the years, and had never seen such a thing.\n\nBut, whatever, needs to be done regardless and so I pull out my flashlight and shine it down the stairs, to check out the layout but really to look for black widow spiders because fuck black widows. At this point I notice a dead cat, mostly down to a skeleton. Not my favorite sight but really common in crawlspaces and basements. I take a few steps down the stairs and continue my spider check, and notice another couple of small animal skeletons. \n\nAt this point I start to worry about gas, or poisons, or something equally dangerous, and start looking closer. There are animal skeletons everywhere, at least ten on a cursory look. Some of them are so degraded I can\u2019t determine what they used to be. I also happen to notice that this guy is waiting at the entrance a little too quietly, with his hand on the door. \n\nSomething clicks in my brain and I get this immense sense of danger. I\u2019m about four steps from the door being clear to close, I have no partner on the job with me, there\u2019s death all around me, and I realize just how hidden the entrance to the basement really was.\n\nI noped the fuck out, told the guy I needed extra tools and would be back, and marked the job as non-feasible for health and safety as I was driving away. I have no idea if I was actually in any danger, it could have been completely innocent; but I still remember the adrenaline rush and sense of doom, and sometimes you just don\u2019t take chances.\n\nEdit: obligatory \u201coh my god, first gold ever!\u201d Thanks, kind stranger!\n\nAlso edit: I\u2019m getting asked frequently if I reported this guy to the police, and there\u2019s a lot of concern about the dead animals. I did not file a formal report, mainly because nothing I saw was entirely out of the ordinary. Crawlspaces and basements have venting at the base of the house, and it\u2019s really common for animals to squeeze in and then not be able to get back out.  If you have space under your house there\u2019s a decent chance something has died down there. You get used to it when your job takes you down there frequently. \n\nNow, this was an extreme case and clearly everything put together raised concern enough for me to get the fuck out, but the sad fact of working with low income families is that you see how lousy their lives can be. You learn not to do anything to make their lives any harder, and I took a lot of pride from the fact that my job made their lives just a bit better. I didn\u2019t think that my being scared for a minute was enough to involve the police, you know?",

I never really liked it because the kids were mean, everything was either broken or not clean, and the counselors obviously didn't care. I remember the girl's changing room had a door that lead out to the woods but the doorknob was gone so it was unlocked all the time and you could see into it. This was primarily where the girls changed into their bathing suits and there was usually someone blocking the view while we changed so the boys couldn't look in. Well, one day I'm changing alone and someone wasn't blocking the door. I look over and see an eye peeping in through the hole watching me change. I pull the rest of my clothes back on quickly and run out to tell my twin brother. I tell my dad that I don't want to go back to that camp anymore and he begrudgingly takes us out of the camp pretty soon after because he knew how much we hated it. Years later, the camp has been closed down for many many years and I'm asking my dad about it. He gets really grim and tells me it shut down because a 13 year old boy had raped 7 year old girl in the woods right behind the girl's bathroom a few weeks after I had told him about someone watching me change.\n\nEdit: a word",

            "This was quite a few years ago now.\n\nBut me and my friend had this really cool spot to hang out , in the woods.\n\nYou had to walk in the middle of a creek for a KM and duck through sharp bushes and Thistles.\n\nThe hike was well rewarding though.\n\nThe spot was about half an acre big , it was pure green grass on a incline with beautiful clear water ponds everywhere . There was tons of wildlife and the butterfly's lived there . So there was always tons of butterfly's! \n\n\n\nSo the story begins on the way to this place\n\nMy friend Levi and I were walking along the river on the way to the spot .\n\nIt was in the middle of a valley and nobody else ever went down there \n\nSuddenly Levi stopped moving and ducked into a bush , I did the same because I thought there must have been a large animal somewhere .\n\nI saw him staring up the hill and so I looked up to \n\nThere was two people standing at the top of the hill heaving back and forth a lifeless body \n\nWe watched as they threw the lifeless corpse down the hill as it bounced off the trees and eventually got stuck on a tree at the bottom.\n\nThen they took off \n\nMe and him were terrified and I was shaking so badly I couldn't speak\n\nSo we decided to verify it was a real body \n\nLevi got about 4 feet away before screaming \"IT HAS NOSTRILS !!

            "So when I was 15, my friends and I liked to climb abandoned buildings. We found one down my the river. About 3 stories high and in pretty bad condition. I remember there were no stairs initially and we had to pull ourselves up.  We climbed to the top via broken stairs after that. At the top was a small open room where someone was living. We walked in to look around and immediately noticed the walls were covered in pictures. Pictures of women tied up, naked, obviously in pain in all sorts of positions. Some appeared dead but they were from magazines. We never got out of a building and away from an area so fast. Looking back, it was probably just serious bdsm porn but 15 year old me dipped out.",

            "In order to get back home from a popular kebab restaurant I need to walk a short path through the woods. Along the way there is an extremely old abandoned partially collapsed chapel and occasionally I'll stand there for a few seconds admiring it. It's quite beautiful in its own way. One day during winter season I decided to rest there for a minute so I placed my kebab on the bench right next to the chapel and just stood there taking in the scenery. It was already rather dark and the woods were almost completely silent but right as I was about to continue my walk I heard footsteps rapidly getting louder. It was a child running towards me and as soon as it realized I was there it started to repeatedly scream \"Run, he is coming\" or variations of that same sentiment. I was a bit perplexed by the situation so I watched the child run past me without moving an inch myself. It didn't take another second for a much more weighty pair of footsteps to appear. I could make out a silhouette in the distance which seemed to be their origin and at that exact point in time I got really scared. As opposed to running I decided to hide in the chapel next to the altar and after tripping over an old broken chapel bench I reached my hiding place. The footsteps got louder and louder but right as they approached the vicinity of the chapel they suddenly went silent. About 15 seconds of complete quietness had passed just for the words \"Oi! You fucking idiot left your kebab on the bench\" to break the silence. Turns out it was a resident of the very same street I inhabit, his nephew was visiting and he wanted to race him to the kebab stand. I don't know whether this was the right place to post this, ultimately this is more stupid than creepy.",
            "This took place in the Australian bush around 10/11 at night. \n\nI was 17, leading a staggered column of about 60 Cadets to our detachment campsite. Due to light discipline rules, only myself at the very front of the group and the other flight commander at the rear had torches on. This was so that any vehicles coming along the trail could see us and so that most of the cadets could maintain their night vision(we were camouflaged up and thus difficult to see at night).\n\n\nAs we walked along I periodically looked to my sides, and kept seeing what looked like dew drops on the ground. Almost like tiny blue gems glinting in my torch light either side of the road.I had to maintain my position in the formation, so I couldn't get a good look at what they were. \n\nHowever, after a while we stopped for a very brief break, and I took the opportunity to have a closer look. Walking over to the side of the trail I spotted a small cluster of the \"diamonds\" and focused my head torch on them. Rather than seeing diamonds or dew drops or anything remotely pleasant, I instead saw a group of about 5 large spiders just crouching in the leaf litter and staring at me. They looked like huntsmans which are about the size of an adults hand. Sweeping my head around, I realised there were thousands of the things. All over the ground, some on the trunks of trees, and everywhere around me; glaring at the light affixed to my head.\n\nI had a **very** brisk walk back to the formation and attempted to play it cool while screaming in my head.\nBeing a massive Arachnophobe, I have no fucking clue how I managed to set up a tent and spend the next week in that cursed forest.",
            "I was in a large wooded area near my bf's home, with him, hanging out nearly at midnight. We had gone in pretty deep and it required a good amount of climbing. The closest path was maybe 5-7 min climbing down so it was highly unlikely someone could be at that spot, that time of the night, besides us. \n\nAs we were kissing and stuff he thought he saw a shadow move 20 - 25 feet to the left of us, climbing, but it stopped suddenly when my bf looked at it. He told me to be wary and that exact moment we saw a dark figure climbing a little up but diagonally, like he tried to go directly above where we were.\n\nWe didn't move and watch him till he closed the horizontal gap and was directly above us maybe 15 feet of steep downhill thick forest. Then he began to come towards us.\n\nWithout skipping a bit my bf grabbed my hand and we almost ran downhill till the path. We made it in less that two minutes while still holding hands and listening to the man running behind us. We ran as fast as we could down the path and out of the forest where there was a cafe and some basketball and tennis courts next to the wooded hill, and of course, people. \n\nAs we realised we came really close to be mugged or worse, we vowed never to go there at night again. :)",

We had been backpacking for two days and stopped in a beautiful little clearing at the bottom of some huge tree covered hills. The sun started to set, we made a fire, and I began to climb up into the trees to dig a hole and fill it back up. You know what I mean. As I squat there, basking in moonlight and appreciating the glow of fire among the trees, I looked up to a ridge line a few hundred yards away where the moon was rising, and I shit you not I saw a DAMN big cougar crest the hill and just watch our fire. It was likely no danger to me, but seeing that outline, that unmistakable shoulder crawl they do, was haunting. I watched it sit there for a good fifteen minutes until I was called back by my worried buds. I pointed the cat out the them when I got done because it was still just watching us. Crazy.",
            "Super long story, tl;dr nearly got murdered backpacking in rural Tasmania\n\nMy boyfriend and I were backpacking through rural Tasmania a few years ago. While on a bus, we were discussing our plans for the ensuing two weeks. The girl in the seat in front turns around and offers us a place to stay in her town. We declined as we were headed elsewhere first, but she gave us her mobile number and said that she and her partner would love to have us.\n\nA few days later we decide to take them up on their offer. We call her, and she says they're happy to host us. So far so good.\n\nThey meet us at the train station and immediately something feels off. It's really difficult to explain, but it's that primal, ineffable feeling in your guts that tells you that something isn't right. We ignored our guts and followed them.\n\nThey lead us straight out of town. We ask them where we're going and they say that they live on the outskirts. This town is creepy as fuck. It's an old mining town that has been largely abandoned, and as we walk the 15-odd minutes to their home the houses get shittier, with boarded up windows, overgrown gardens and no people in sight.\n\nEventually we reach the house at the very end of the town. It's their house. We go in. \n\nSet up in the middle of the living room is a single mattress with a sheet hanging around it. They show us around the house except for one door which stays closed. When I asked what was behind it they pretended not to hear. Our room has a made bed, chest of drawers and looks like a normal room. It seems weird that they sleep on mattresses in the living room when they have a \"guest room\".\n\nWe go back into the living room and look around. Knives. A lot of knives. My boyfriend asks if they go hunting? No. The partner hands one of the knives to my boyfriend and asks him to open it. It's a massive fucking bowie knife with what looks like blood staining around the edges of the blade. My boyfriend laughs awkwardly and sets it down. \n\nThey have a tattoo gun - \"to practice\". My boyfriend asks if they have any tattoos. No. There's a small axe at the door. I ask if they collect wood. No.\n\nSuddenly the guy says he wants to go to the shops. We agree quickly because we're creeped out and want to get back into the town.\n\nThe four of us leave and they start walking in the opposite direction to the town. I say that the town is back the other way. The guy says this way would be more interesting because it goes up through the trees. He says that they have never been up the mountain before but he knows the area and it would take the same amount of time.\n\nI tell my boyfriend that I'm freaking out but he thinks it's ok. We follow them into the trees. The path goes up the mountain. We are going in the total opposite direction of the town. \n\nThe girl turns around to her partner and whispers - \"so where was the place again?\"\n\nMy boyfriend and I freeze. I say I want to take the road back to town and start walking.\n\nWhen the four of us arrive in the one shop in town - no one recognises the couple. And this is a really small town. We make an excuse that we want to go look at sights and that we'll catch up with them later, and instead book a hotel room and freak out.\n\nI did some snooping on the area. Their house had an extra room (behind the mystery door) and a basement. The path that we were taking led straight out of town and up the mountain. There was no way it could loop back into town.\n\nSo yeah pretty sure we narrowly avoided being murdered. Or maybe they were just massive weirdos. Tbh the creepiest thing was the fact that there was no drug paraphernalia at all - the state of the house and the weird behaviour would have been understandable if they were intoxicated but that wasn't the case.",

This was before iphones and GPS so we had mapquest directions. \n\nWe ended up going down a pretty country road for a while with no street lights, then turned down a legit dirt road that went through the woods. Pitch black. Went down it for like 10 minutes and finally saw an old house with a sign by the driveway that was handwritten and said \u201cHaunted House\u201d. No other cars or lights or people anywhere We pulled in the driveway and sat there for a second like \u201calright this is fucked up, we should leave\u201d. \n\nAll of the sudden an old pick up truck turned on about 15 ft in front of us facing us, lights shining right in our faces. It started driving towards us (down their own driveway).We backed out and peeled out. It followed us, like almost bumping our rear end. Right on our tail down this pitch black dirt road in the middle of the Alabama woods. We were flipping our shit. It was texas chainsaw massacre/hills have eyes stuff. He stayed out our tail blinding us and almost bumping us all the way back home until we got off our exit and he finally let us go. No idea who was driving.\n\nI always think what would have happened if we got out of the car when we were in that driveway.\n\nEDIT: thank you for the silver! Thats so tight.",

We walked down the path for a good 20 minutes until he suddenly started walking through some closely planted thin trees. \n\nDespite my confusion I followed him until he suddenly stopped in a clearing and there was a round mud hut infront of us, he told me he was too scared to go inside so I did instead. The floor was lower down then the floor itself and there was a little fire put in the centre, it was surrounded by DIY wooden bench things.\n\n Although that was odd in itself, the real show stopper were the walls, every inch or the mud walls were covered in animal skulls held up by wire, these would range from a small sparrow skull to a deer skull. It was a pretty neat sight tbf. Outside of the hut was another small bench which had the phrase \u2018Where heaven and earth meet\u2019 carved into it. \n\nCut to January of this year and me and my Mum tried to find the weird voodoo hut again in the woods, while we did come across the hut it had sadly been demolished and all but a few of the skulls had been taken.

It\u2019s kinda sad it had to go but I still remember like it was yesterday.\n\n\nEdit: Wow! Thanks so much for the upvotes! I saw a comment suggesting this might be for a film shoot but I think this is very unlikely as the fen was left there for multiple years and it looked like it had taken such a long time to find and tie up the skulls.

            "It's 2 AM. We're in a tent in the woods in Maine. I'm about 8.\n\n\"Mom, there's something creeping around outside the tent!\"\n\n\"Mmmph, you're dreaming, go back to bed...\"\n\n\"Mom, there really is something out there!\"\n\n\"No. There isn't.\"\n\nJust then, something WHAPS on the side of the tent, hard enough to shake the whole thing. And my mother - who is entirely too goddamned tired to deal with this shit - sits bolt upright and WHAPS right back in the same spot.\n\nAnd from outside the tent, we hear...\n\n\"Meow..\"\n\nEdit: it was a housecat. We didn't hear anything more the rest of the night.",

            "[This picture of my bathroom mirror. ](https://imgur.com/a/86baRMo) \n\nMy girlfriend got out of the shower and called me in a weird panic. The hand print in the middle was there on the steamed up mirror, very noticeable, all by itself. \n\nFor reference I put my handprint on the left and hers on the right. I live alone and she is the only one who had been to my place in at least 6 months. \n\nTo this day I have no idea where the hand print in the middle came from.",
            "Not creepy per say. But definitely scared the shit out my friends and I. Made on property that we didn't know was restricted. It was right around sundown. We had hiked for a while to a clearing we had been at many times. On a ridge .25 miles away or so, see a woman on a horse. Bottles are falling out of her saddle and she seemed inebriated. She was sluring and yelling at us about her property. And then pulled out a revolver and fired multiple shots in our direction. So we ran scared shitless and never went back there.",
            "I\u2019ve told this before and will stick with me till on my deathbed.\n\nWas a high schooler mid 90s. Went fishing off the coast of Corpus Christi with uncle and cousins. We were about 18 miles out. Been out all day. Was around 8pm and were gearing up to head back in. It was before DST so sun was already going down and getting dark.\n\nI was at the stern bringing in the traps. As I\u2019m pulling it in I see this glow about 100-150 feet off. It\u2019s nothing I have ever seen. Best way I can describe it. It\u2019s like if you stuck a toaster underwater and the orange glowing elements were still working. But still not quite. And it was very large. We were on a 38 ft boat. All I can guess it was 5-6 times bigger.(kind of hard to judge sizes on open water).\n\nThe water above it is not churning but you can tell that it is disturbing it. IDK hard to explain. Almost like it was pushing the water up. This whole time I\u2019m expecting something to break the surface and just frozen. You know like when your walking the dog or something at night not really paying attention and a cat or possum runs out. How you freeze and everything stops? I\u2019m like that the whole time.\n\nFinally I let out a call to my uncle. He comes around stops right by me. He\u2019s not saying anything just kind of like me. This thing object or whatever the hell just jets out towards the gulf. I\u2019m talking like not picking up speed. Instantly jets out. \n\nAll I say is \u2018you seen that before\u2019? My uncle just says \u2018nope, let\u2019s go\u2019. I say absolutely nothing the way back in he doesn\u2019t either. My cousins ask us what happened. All my uncle says is \u2018nothing\u2019.\n\nNow what could it have been? I\u2019ve researched it on and off for past 25 years. Especially when the internet came out. I\u2019ve found a lot of people seeing something very similar. There is a naval base down there but no sub bases we know about. It kind of took over my life for a lot of years. If we have something like that though. We\u2019ve been holding out on technology that could change our lives.",
            "One time my buddies and I decided to go for a walk at the cemetery at night, because it scared the shit out of one of my friends, and the rest of us are assholes. We were roaming around, until our scared friend started freaking out and pointed out that he saw some weird people. We thought he was just paranoid, but when we looked there were indeed three or four figures further back in the cemetery, wearing hooded cloaks of some sort. They were surrounding some large grave, with an angel statue that we passed earlier. We all freaked out for a sec, till we saw the figures group together around the grave with one of them taking  their picture. We concluded that they must have been in a local band that needed an edgy album cover.",
            "It was dark and I was sitting around a bonfire with four friends in rural North Carolina. We had been drinking and they had smoked a bit (I wasn\u2019t at the time) and were taking turns telling stories. A lull came in the conversation and the black silhouette of a sixth person stood up and faded into the surrounding darkness. We decided that we\u2019d had enough for the night and packed everything up before walking back to a friends house. \n\nAll five us swear there was a sixth person there but don\u2019t remember any kind of  discernible characteristic besides they seemed to be covered in shadow.",
            "I was delivering a sailboat from San Diego to Morro Bay California roughly 25 miles offshore alone... At around 1 am about 36 hours into the trip, I saw a bright glowing blue orb around 30 feet in diameter just below the surface at my 1 o'clock. It was a moonless night which made the blurry sphere  contrast well against the seemingly black water around it.  My first thought was \"oh shit\" a fast-attack submarine is surfacing (not uncommon in that area)! I started desperately looking for a yellow flare in the water (maritime warning for a soon-to-be-surfacing sub) but couldn't find one. It fluctuated in size and moved very slowly so I  quickly ditched the submarine theory.\n\nAfter some time I ended up idling and put the boat into irons to just watch it for a while. when it finally broke the surface in a large, bright, and loud boil i realized what i had been watching.\n\nTurns out it was a large school of sardines swimming together agitating the bioluminescence that happened to be present that night.  It still stands out as one of the most bizarre experiences I've had on the water and i will never forget it!",
            "Was camping a couple of years ago when I heard movement outside my tent.Thinking it was my friend I called out to him but there was no answer.After a minute the movement stopped so I left my tent and sat outside it for a while\n\n10 minutes passed when my friend that I thought had been moving came out of his tent looking for his phone.He denied that it was him who was outside the tent.It was only him,myself and my gf at the time so I said it must have been an animal.\n\nAt that point we both heard something move very close to us and saw the silhouette of a person watching us.Don\u2019t ask me why but we both got up and started to approach the person who began to run away.We chased him/her for a minute but gave up when we noticed them drop stuff from their hand.\n\nNot only did they drop my friends phone that he couldn\u2019t find but mine and my girlfriends as well\n\nThe person was in our tents.....",
            "Posted about this before, but back when I was a kid some friends and I came across people in robes chanting around a campfire out in the woods on the edge of the town we lived in. We were staying at a friend's house for a birthday party/sleepover and went for a late night walk. This was back in the late 80's during the satanic panic. Looking back now, I'm sure it was just some teenagers goofing around, but at the time it scared the living bejeezus out of us. One of the girls with us had a panic attack and started hyperventilating. Got pretty serious, but we finally managed to get her calmed down.",
            "When I was a kid, I used to live on a tiny property in the woods. My house was basically built around where stables were once. My room was, back when it was still stables, where the hay was stocked. Before getting to the creepy thing  I need to say some other stuff:\n\n\\- When you were in my room you could sometimes smell hay out of nowhere.- My dog was always refusing to go upstairs because something was scaring the shit out of it there.- You could sometimes hear knocking on doors (they were 3 entrance doors in my house), sometimes all at once.\n\nNow that this have been said, we can go to the fun thing. So my room had a big ass window that gave a big view over the woods and my garden was basically a clearing. Once, I fucking heard a kid giggling from upstairs. I ran there only to find my window open, and something running out in the woods.I spent 2 more years in this house and fucking felt insecure the whole time.  \n\n\nedit: for those who think kids were pranking me, I highly doubt that any kid would survive such a fall from my room into the garden + private property, the only entrance has a big ass portal that is \"unconvenient\" to climb.",
            "Not in any of those places but...\n\nI was a kid and was in this hotel like place, went to public toilet, guy walks in, grey skin, eyes/pupils really small like a zombie's eyes. He was just staring at me.\n\nSafe to say I got out of dodge real fast",
            "Kinda late to the post but one thing will always stick with me\n\nI was probably about 14 or so on a camping trip with my scout troop out in the middle of nowhere. Literally hiked into the woods for about 40 miles and set up camp. No phones no way of contacting the outside just us and some of our parents fishing and hiking etc. \n\nAnyways second night into the trip my dad myself and two other parents are sitting around the campfire talking and get on the subject of UFOs. We start talking about different stories we'd seen on TV shows and such.\n\nRight in the middle of a story my friends dad points up at the sky and goes \"holyshit what's that?!\" We thought he was joking around for a good minute til he goes \"seriously turn around theres more\"\n\nWe all turn around finally and see 3 massive. And I mean fucking massive fireballs screaming down from the sky towards the earth. They look like they're going in slow motion or maybe time just seemed to slow down but it took forever for them to disappear behind the treeline.\n\nNaturally were all freaked the fuck out and started talking about what it could be but theres no way of finding out for at least 3 more days. The hike out of the woods was the worst. Just walking quietly contemplating what could be waiting and what the world might be like if our worst fears happened while we were in there.\n\nTurns out a Russian satellite had broken up and fallen to earth that night and it was seen for miles and miles. Still the creepiest 3 days of my life.",

            "Felt like running at night last year because the park near where i live gets all pretty with the lights on in the dark.\n\nSo after 5 mins into the exercise, i feel the need to adjust my shoes because i forgot to wear a longer sock and they were hurting my ankle.\n\nI look up and i see this dark silhouette running towards me at full speed wearing a hoodie about 50 meters away.\n\nI was on the left side of the street and he was on the right so it was clear he was running towards me.\n\nI legit almost shitted my pants and felt an adrenaline surge, i thought about fighting him if he got any closer, but in a blink of an eye, the person trips, falls face planted on the ground...and starts crawling in my fucking direction again...\n\nFuck that, dude is committed, i'm leaving\n\nEDIT: some people mentioned the [scene from Get Out](https://youtu.be/SAp4gJwhNI0), it was exactly like that but he fell halfway through...",

            "Small town in a relatively rural area. A few years after the fact, I\u2019m now relatively certain it was a Skin Walker. \n\nAbout 10 years ago, I was at my dad\u2019s house for the weekend in Kentucky. The Appalachian people are very superstitious, hailing from the Scots-Irish people and just never losing that side of them. My dad wasn\u2019t superstitious, I thought, and was not one to be easily scared. It was about, I dunno, 10 at night and we randomly decided to go into town to get some McDonald\u2019s. \n\nDaddy always insisted on walking in front of me and I always assumed it was so I wouldn\u2019t accidentally step on a snake but now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. So, he turned on the porch light and opened the screen door. He had put one foot on the porch and there was this God awful sound. I will never in my life forget it. There was a screech followed by the sound of a crow. But it wasn\u2019t a crow. The best way I can describe it is if a person was mimicking a crow call. \n\nMy hair stood up on the back of my neck and my dad retreated into the house. He slammed the big door and locked it, something I had never seen him do. Before I could ask a question he said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t safe. We can go tomorrow morning.\u201d \n\nAnd so we did. But the rest of the night, we stayed inside. My dad didn\u2019t even go outside to smoke a cigarette. He even let the (outside) dogs stay in the house. We never talked about that again but that was one of the scariest moments of my life.",
            "I was jogging at night with headphones on in a park with dense trees and bushes. The over growth was taking over the path and it was difficult to see so I turned the flashlight on my phone on.\n\nI started to see a fire burning ahead but couldn\u2019t really make it out (I take my glasses off when I jog). As I got closer there\u2019s a clearing and I see a big big fire raging and no one around. So I pause a minute and fish my glasses out and find out that yes, there\u2019s 6 people standing there actually. Perfectly spaced apart from each other and they all turned at the same time to look at me.\n\nI turned 180 and sprinted the fuck out of there\n\nEDIT: The path I jog on at night is nice and bright because the city of Winnipeg uses those LED street lights now. The wooded area leads to a small area called Don Garry Park, where I get to a bench and take a minute to reflect on my day and my goals for tomorrow. \n\nAlso the bench I rest at it right beside this police launch dock for the Red River, I have never not felt safe there. My friends and I have speculated that the 6 dudes I saw were probably police just blowing off steam on a quiet night.",
            "When I was younger I went elk hunting with my uncle and some of his friends. And had an experience I'll never forget. One of the days I went on a hunt with his buddy Tyler. Tyler gets an elk down about 30 minutes before dark. We get over to it and as we are cleaning it we start hearing wolves howl in the distance, slowly getting closer. Every minute that passes the smell of death gets thicker, the sky gets darker, and the wolves get closer. \n\nIt's dark now. All I can see is what's directly in the beam of my mini maglite and Tyler's hat bill light as he works on the elk as fast as he can while I keep a watch on the wolves. We are surrounded. I don't know how many there are. Feels like dozens, it was probably only a few. I can hear them running circles around us and yelping back and forth at each other, occasionally I get sight of them in the light and then they are gone. Every once in a while, one would get brave and dart in within a few feet and try snagging a piece of the elk. \n\nFinally the elk is cleaned and we have the \"scent circle\" around the carcass to keep it somewhat safe. Now all that was left was a three mile hike back to camp, completely covered in blood and being trailed by wolves. \n\nBy far the most horrifying experience of my life\n\nEditing to add a few things, sorry I've been fishing with my kids for Father's Day. \n\nFirst off for the people saying it was coyotes and how wolves are rare, I live in Idaho, wolves are not rare by any stretch. Look up the 1995 wolf reintroduction to the Frank Church Wilderness. And they have exploded in numbers since then. I'll try finding a(dated) map with all the packs we have in Idaho. \n\nSecondly, we didn't break down the animal that night. We wanted to get the fuck out of there so we just gutted the animal so the innards didn't spoil the meat and left it over night, November at 10,000 ft is plenty cold to keep bugs and bacteria from getting to the meat. We came back with the whole camp of 8 guys first thing the next morning and got it processed out.\n\n[Map of wolf packs in Idaho](https://i.imgur.com/IUI2TqM.jpg)\n\nEdit number 2 for anyone interested in more reading here is the story of OR-7 a wolf that traveled through Oregon and into California, establishing packs https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OR-7\n\nAnd here's the story of a wolf that traveled from Wyoming to the Grand Canyon \nhttps://gcwolfrecovery.org/news-events/echo-the-grand-canyon-wolf",

The temp had dropped to 39F and we were freezing our asses off after tripping on shrooms all day and smoking to keep warm. We heard a weird laughter and then screaming in the woods near us. It was actually terrifying because we couldn\u2019t identify if it was a child or something else",
            "I was hiking deep in a desert canyon during the middle of night, pitch black, no moon dense shrubbery; and I saw a pair of eyes at about waist level.  I stood tall and walked with a two headlamps facing forward and back.  Every time I looked back for the next several miles those eyes were locked on to me. What ever it was that was stalking me never made a sound.  There was no crunch of rocks or sand, no rustling in the bushes, just the illumination of unblinking eyes peering back at me.",
            "This isn\u2019t nearly as creepy as other stuff. One time I was hiking in a state park near my house with my boyfriend. The park was deserted and we decided to stop at a little tiny body of water in the brush. There had recently been a lot of rain so it made this fairy-sized lake with a waterfall feeding into it. It was super pretty! So as we\u2019re standing there admiring a tiny paradise I start to hear growling. I honestly thought I was imagining things so I kept listening. It sounded like a low animalistic growling. I turned to my boyfriend and said jokingly \u201cI hear growling!\u201d Thinking he would dismiss it but he said \u201c..me too.\u201d. I spun around and quickly scanned everywhere around us but we looked to be alone. We quickly moved on and kept hiking. Still dunno what the hell that was about lol.",
            "Not super creepy, but I was walking in the woods, and walked for a bit. Heard a crack to my left, so I turned my head; there stood a moose. Not only a moose, but a fawn as well. I just walked slowly backwards until I built enough courage to turn around and sprint the fuck out of there. Moose are really aggressive when they're with their children, if anyone wonders.",
            "In my village ( just a little  two small to be a small town) I saw a person in a white full body suit with helmet. \n\nThey were in the bush it was one of those suit you can wear so you don\u2019t get stung by nettles. \n\nPoint being they were in the bush. Then he or she looked at me and then looked at me and backed up into the bush like Homer did in that meme format. Needless to say I legged it across 2 upfield hills.\n\nI just re read it a day after cause it got all those upvotes and upfield hill is probably a very smart thing.",
            "This happened 7 years back. I was living in a rented house where we had two bathrooms. One of them was broken and unusable. It smells really bad when you open the bathroom door. I always have this one bolted and locked. One night, a thunderstorm was approaching the city. The power went off since the winds were too strong. I was there sitting all alone in the living room when I heard thudding sound coming from the bathroom. I thought it could be because of the air pressure difference due to the thunderstorm. Continued on to do my assignments. And there was a loud thud and I swear I saw the bathroom door open. I freaked out and left the house and stayed at the terrace until the power came. I don't know where the lock went and how the f\u00fbck it opened. When I went back in, the door was partly closed. Locked it tight and tied it with a rope.\n\nObviously i chickened out of that house in a couple of weeks. Never going near there again.\n\nEdit : no visible creepy thingy. Just the setting creeped the shit out of me.",
            "My friends bought a huge chunk of property in southern Colorado in the San Luis Valley. I went out for a month to clear 10 acres of forest for greenhouses to be built. I was there by myself the entire time and had to stay in a tent because there was no infrastructure yet. One night I was sitting on the edge of this overlook before bed and the entire canyon below me lit up with a huge flash of light and then was gone immediately. I was kinda freaked out, but got over it and just went to bed. A few days later I was talking to a rancher a couple miles down the road and he said the morning after the night of the flash he found 3 of his cows in that canyon with all the blood drained out of their bodies and their eyes and some of their organs were removed. There weren't any tire tracks or any sign of struggle whatsoever near the cows. And let me tell you, this property was in the middle of NOWHERE. Needless to say I was pretty freaked out the rest of my time out there. Lots of weird shit like that was going and the entire area just had a very weird \"vibe\". I'm normally a very pragmatic person and not interested in the supernatural at all, but after my time in the San Luis Valley, I'm not so sure anymore.",

            "A few years ago, I delivered newspapers in a rural area. It was a peaceful route for the most part. I'd drive for a few miles, stop at the one house, continue down the road a few more miles, and so on. I honestly liked it most of the time (just not in the winter when we had entirely too much snow). The only thing that really got to me was the cougar. I could tell the nights he was out hunting. All my big herds of deer and my giant flocks of turkeys would just VANISH. All the birds would stop and the normal night sounds were just gone. If I stopped in a place too long, I freaked out but nothing was creepier than the night where I pulled over by some train tracks to grab some stuff from my backseat. I didn't get out of the car, just sort of twisted in my seat (perk of being short?). Turned around and there's a very large cat just looking at me through the front window. I...might have basically taken off in my car going about 80mph. But the worst part? A couple of hours later and several miles away, I was finishing up the route. And there's the cougar watching me from some trees.\n\nNot sure which was a more terrifying thought: the cougar was following me or that there could potentially be more than one of them.",

            "In southwest GA in the dense Hardwoods around 8 miles out of the town of Attapulgus i had a pretty disturbing encounter. I was around 16 years old(5 years ago). My dad and i went hunting, we always climbed different trees anywhere from 1 mile to 4 miles apart. We did this so that maybe if we startled any deer they'd wander towards the other hunter.\n\nAnyway, as i was climbing the tree with my tree lounge, i heard something below me (round 12ft down at this point) about 30 yards out, sounded like twigs cracking. So i stop and look behind me, to see just the dense woods. Figure its a small critter, squirrel or some such. About half an hour later im settled in my tree and the sun is starting to peak through the leaves, it's no longer in the twilight of dawn, its becoming morning. As im sitting in my comfy asf stand, i notice a Palmetto bush. Normally this isnt anything odd, but the fact that i noticed it threw me off. Why did i notice it? I sat and stared and couldn't figure out what it was that caught my eye. A palmetto bush looks like the top of a palm tree that sits on the ground, and has a few sort of hairs/tails that stick up and produce some pretty tasty berries. \n\nWell i couldn't figure it out, so i keep scanning the area. A couple hours past and i keep noticing this damn bush. Why? Why is it so spectacular all the sudden? Its a bush damn it! A normal palmetto bush! \n\nWhatever, i kept on hunting for these deer. Around 11am my pa rings me on the pager, says he wants to walk to what we called the honeyhole. A good hunting location full of deer around this time. Has a little stream, plenty of cover for them, and plenty of sneaky passages for us! \n\nOkay pa, I'll meet you there. As i begin packing up, i noticed twigs snapping again. It came from the bush. So i look. And i figured out what it was that stood out so damn much.\n\nThere was a MF man staring at me through the bush. He had a scraggly a** beard, a tan coat, and some jumper suit pants on. He had a hood up that was the color of the bush. Not only that, he had covered his face in mud. A common hunting camouflage technique. \n\nNoticing this, i grab my Remington700, and point it towards the ground near the man. Soon as i did this he let out a terrifying a** cackle and darted towards the direction of a creek about 150 yards away from my tree. I watched him through my scope, i could hear him and see him cackling the whole way. And the scariest part? He leapt across a creek thats about 9ft wide... In a single fu**ing jump... Now where he leapt it might have been only 5 or 6ft wide, but even then...\n\nI wasn't as scared as i was disturbed. I had a rifle, a damn good one too. 6 round capacity, bolt action. I have never missed a shot on any animal with my Rifle, so i felt safe and confident in my skills and equipment. But even then, it was strange as all hell. The land was a public hunting club's land, which is why i didn't shoot him. I got down and continued to the Honeyhole, where i told Pa about the situation. \n\nAnyhow, we kept hunting that location in the future after the incident, never saw him again. Told the club about him and nobody had heard of anything like it. But about 3 months later he was spotted by someone else who also used tree climber stands. They said they had been hunting a specific hunting site in a certain tree for a couple days at the time. One morning at dawn they climbed into the tree and after getting settled in they saw something eye level out the corner of their eye. When they looked it was the same description of the man i saw, but he was in an adjacent tree hanging upside down like a sloth, staring at them. Note this is about 20ft up. When they spotted him and threatened to shoot him, he cackled and climbed down the tree very quickly, in a matter of a few seconds. He dashed off into the planted pines behind the guy, and that was the last I've heard of the weirdo.\n\nSo yeah, long story but disturbing as all hell.",

We shat bricks! Long story short, French backpacker's car broke down, no reception, ran out of food and water the day prior. (For some reason he tucked his car away in the shrubs). He spoke little English, my gf at the time also a backpacker from Europe spoke French and was able to figure out his story. His car broke down (Shitty Ford Festiva not made for the outback) and had been there for days. We gave him a 20L jerry can of water and a bunch of tinned food. (He refused to leave his car despite explaining to him there's no way that car is leaving where it is). We drove until we got reception, called local police. We told them what happened. We told them how far we drove to where we were (Checked speedometer before we left him and when we got reception) so they could figure out where he is. We gave all our details to the police but never heard back from them. We hoped he was okay and assumed no news is good news. Still though, will never forget the feeling of a man standing over my swag in the middle of the desert when I woke up.",
            "I was out on the coast in the Pacific Northwest. You drive west through the mountains, hit the coast, and hwy 101 N/S has just the most gorgeous collection of habitats. You can be on sea cliffs, or near tidal pools, or in the coastal pines with ferns the size of small cars, or areas that get swallowed up by the Pacific that have little microbiomes inside the felled trees and you can see the natural battle for high ground. Areas in which ferns and fungi are more prevalent than any animal, emerald groves dotted with little amanita mushrooms, these little rubies and gold nuggets standing out against the reddish-brown pine needles.\n\n*For the most part*, out here, you're safe. Being keenly aware of your surroundings should keep you from disappearing, and using a walking stick will save you a broken leg or a fall, all of which are very real dangers.\n\nThere's big cats and bear and elk and moose but so long as you're not stupid and you stay aware, you're gonna be okay. But every now and then, a new large cat warning sign goes up for a few weeks, a new no-poaching sign appears for awhile, etc. If you travel through enough of it, you'll find the meth labs and hobo huts, and those really are the most dangerous animals you're going to run into.\n\nIt's early in the season and I'm on this spit, which by December is just nailed by waves and disappears in the storms. Part of it was engineered for this, and the main path has little hills on the left and right sides, so the whole path is effectively a massive game trail that's always the first thing to flood.\n\nThe wildlife chill at the very open end area at the sea, and every now and again a cat will chase a deer up and make a kill then drag it off to the sides. You'll sometimes see marks of struggle but more often just remains off-path.\n\nThe sea and I are very familiar with each other, here.\n\nBut just this one night, man. It was getting dark and I'm at the open wildlife area thinking how I gotta get back to the car. I check my flashlights but I had burned through them 12-16h earlier in the pre-dawn hours. I check the comforting rhythmic lights of two landmarks and triangulate where I'm at and tuck that away. I put the lights away, and figure if I can't find my way back in the dark then I don't belong out there at this hour ever again.\n\nI'm slowly walking back, keeping a steady and committed pace but not running or making myself a prey target. But something just wasn't right. I text my wife and let her know I'm okay just a little freaked out but I'll be back at my car when signal returns in 60 minutes. The faint glow of my cell was the last light I'd see.\n\n..something was wrong. I felt like I was being followed, but thought my nerves got the better of me. I heard some snapping twigs and rustling and all the wildlife waking up or going to sleep. All of it was normal - until it wasn't. I thought I'd heard whispers but knew it was just the whispers of the wind over the water and splash on the rocks and animals going to sleep. I reach for my phone and realize I'd have no signal and it would just give me away, so I get back to it.\n\nI get maybe twenty feet and there it is again. I didn't see any bear or elk or anything and if it was a large cat I'd never hear it or see it coming, if it was a deer it'd be stumbly bumbly loud. I hear a *snap*, more like a *thock!* and this was no tiny twig so whatever it was, it wasn't small.\n\nI keep thinking, it's a person. It's a person. Someone has seen me out here and either wants my gear and cash or to kill me. I make it in the final half mile stretch, and by now I'm sure I would've been attacked if it was an animal. I see the faint not-nature parking lot in the scant moonlight and could hit it with my light if it worked. \n\nI spin around thinking fuck it, I can bolt because it's definitely a person or people and I'm better off defending myself than I am just being attacked. I break out my phone and shine it down this looming corridor of coast, the trees flanking the path hugging the light and kind of holding it in. Nothing. I let out a sigh of relief.\n\nSnap. Again, but behind me now, so whatever it was made its way around me. It's close. A deer takes off in the sedge and I hear more and more snaps and shuffling and branches catching on jackets and it hits me and I put two and two together. \n\n*They're trying to get me before I can get to the car.* This goes through my head and I worry its the last thought I'll ever have. I move off the path one would anticipate and try to skirt around the whole situation because hey maybe it's still just me freaking out, man.\n\nI cut through the sedge and wildberries and get some distance, and cut back through to the main trailhead parking lot. I had seen no people all morning/day/evening which was odd because there's half a dozen cars and I would have seen *one* of them. I get to the car and fumble my keys and get in, fire the thing up before my ass hits the seat and rip it the fuck out of there. \n\nBehind me, in the light cast by the small restrooms and soft moonlight, are seven or eight males. Some are still running at the car but slowing down as I put distance between us. I saw the faint soft silvery glint of blades in some of their hands and one machete and the rest had sticks or other blunt type objects. I don't know what the fuck they wanted, but they wanted it really bad. I've been hiking there for years and will not be going back.",
            "This isn\u2019t my story, but my mom\u2019s. \n\nSo my mom lived in a pretty small town. The closest house was about a mile from her\u2019s (she lived on the outskirts). My mom invited her friend over for a sleepover. Well, at around 1 in the morning my mom woke up to her friend staring at something with wide eyes, not saying a word.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d My mom asked. Nothing from her friend she just kept staring.\nEventually her friend said, \u201cthe window,\u201d which was above my mom. My mom slowly looked up, expecting a random dude or something, but no.\nOne of her horses had stuck its head in an open window. My mom and her friend screamed and ran to my grandma. My grandpa eventually got the horse to go back outside to the barn and calmed down my mom and her friend.\nNowadays, my mom said it was probably the funniest thing that had ever happened to her.",
            "I was on a canoe trip down the Shenandoah River with my wife. The only public property on the river is the islands, so that\u2019s where people camp on multi-day trips. Came across two women around dusk using a machete to hack into the brush on an island to camp, and my wife and I decided the island would be a good place to stop. We paddled a half mile down the island and set up camp near the river bank.\n\nWe were woken later by the sound of a machete hacking through the brush on the island and the two women maniacally screaming and laughing and shouting that they were going to find and kill us. Didn\u2019t sleep much that night.",
            "The body of my friend. \n\nA former roommate who struggled with alcoholism was going through a rough patch after 7 years sober. \nHe walked out of hospital where he was waiting for a bed in rehab, and went to a large forest in our city to drink, and disappeared. \nThe police were no help. \n\nMy partner and I took 3 days off work. Each day we walked through the forest, looking. \nOn the 4th day, friends joined us. We started at the point where his phone had last been switched on. \n\nThat morning it took our group about 20 minutes to find his body - he had drunk too much and died where he fell down. \n\nThe police force that had refused to send one person to advise our unofficial search team managed to send 15 cops when we rang to report the body. \n\nIt was one of the most traumatic days of my life - but also one of the proudest, in a way.",
            "I went to a lake to see my grandmas friend with her and this lady found a dead body in the water. News came and there was a lot of screaming.\n\nEdit: I LEAVE FOR 11 HOURS AND HOLY \nFUCK WHAT HAPPENED WHY IS THIS POPULAR I DONT UNDERSTAND",
            "I remember going camping w/ my buddies. On the way there, we stopped by a small town. The car had heated up so we had to stop somewhere. We decided to park by a church. \n\nRight when my friend drove into the parking space I noticed how everyone (literally everyone) turned back at us at the same time. That gave me the creeps. It was like a scene straight out of a horror movie lol. They were dressed in old fashioned clothing. Kids were playing w/ jump ropes, signing nursery songs, holding hands jumping and singing in a circle, etc. I felt their eyes on us the whole time. \n\nThat shit gave me weird vibes. We decided to leave and park somewhere else.",
            "Just outside of Scranton, PA there's an old abandoned medical center that used to treat people with polio. \n\nAs high schoolers, we would go there at night for no other reason other than it was creepy and we were bored.\n\nI went there probably around 15 times over the course of 4 years.  It was always very creepy, but the only time I ever absolutely and completely noped out of there was when I walked into one of the rooms, found a (newish) mattress on a bed frame (there were many bed frames, but never mattresses, as the place was abandoned long ago), a circle drawn on the ground in the middle of the room, naked dolls sitting around the circle, a candle in the middle of the circle (not lit), \"play with me, children\" written on the wall in huge letters, and a few other things that freaked us out.  I'm 90% sure there was more writing on the wall saying something along the lines of, \"if I'm not here when you arrive, wait for me\", but that might be a false recollection. \n\nAnyway, if it was an attempt by the land owner to stop kids from trespassing, it worked, but to this day I think we accidently stumbled upon a crazy person's new living area.  I never went back after that.",
            "In Tasmania on a ten day solo bushwalk, middle of nowhere. I wake in my tent with a weight on my chest. A big old possum had got in and snuggled up to me. Scared the everlasting shite out of me. A belted him and he ran right through the side of my tent ruining it.",
            "I was hunting about 3 years ago, down in the south Texas hill country. I had went out at about 5:30 am so I could get to the blind in time before he feeder went off. I was walking through a large grove of pecan trees when I got a feeling I was being watched. I stopped and looked around me and loaded my .223 because I knew whatever was watching me wasn\u2019t friendly. I waited for about five minutes in some bushes before I saw the largest mountain lion I\u2019ve ever seen jump down from a tree. This thing easily outweighed me by 80 lbs and had me scared out of my mind. I quietly snuck out of its sight and booked it back to the house and didn\u2019t go hunting for the rest of the trip.",

            "Up in the bush around Rock Creek and Midway BC, there's a bunch of weird dolls tied up in trees in sexual positions/lingerie. My friends and I saw them and noped the fuck out. Later on the locals told us that if we continue up that road there's mutilated animals strung up in the trees and that we don't want to make it onto the people's property up there. \n\nI guess turning around was a good idea.\n\nEdit: [Here they are.](http://imgur.com/gallery/XsyaEix) Looks like some were on fence posts near the highway, still was creepy imo.",
            "I was deployed on a warship in 2016. At this point in time, we were entering the Philippine Sea. Weather had been foul, storms and the like, but it usually stayed far enough away where you can watch the lightning strike the saltwater. It lights up everything an ethereal shade of glowing radioactive green. \n\nI'm outside watching this storm, and I heard the faint sound of bells, like naval bells, ringing. It sounded a bit muted, like it was underwater. \n4 bells like this \"Ding-ding.......ding-ding\"\nThen a few minutes later I heard them again. \n\n4 bells are rung for a Captain whenever he steps on aboard a ship, and my only thought is there must be some forgotten wreck beneath us, and the dead are still keeping the traditions alive as we sailed over them",
            "Okay a bit of backstory, on the Navajo reservation(Not far from where this is) it is told that coyotes are the messengers from our world to the next. Now the day of my birth father's funeral we were all back at my parents house with all my siblings and family and my stepdad points out a coyote in the road, it's really rare to see these guys out in the day especially alone like that. It stood there in the middle of the road and looked right through the big windows at all of us for about 5 seconds before lazily going up the road. Idk if it was even creepy at the time but it was definitely a weird experience.",
            "Not exactly the \"creepy\" you were wanting to hear, but I find it just as strange. \n\nThere's this local forest near my college, and my buddies and I would always go there for camping and such and have a good time. One time we were tracing through the woods to our normal spot when we heard a lot of howling and barking, but it did not sound like any normal coyote or any other wild dog. So being the dumb college kids we are, we traveled to it. We saw this bright light in the distance, and so we traveled closer and closer until we flund what I will never forget. On all fours, circling and playing with eachother, we found a group of 20 or so furries. All decked out in their Furry outfit. All of them barking and doing 'Furry things'. My friends and I could not stop but laugh awkwardly. We left without our presence being known, but that night will never be forgotten.",
            "Backpacking in the woods and came across a ranger on horseback. He asked us if we had seen anyone nearby, but we hadn't. He'd been checking in on a spot maybe 100 yards from us, where someone had left a bunch of gear several weeks ago.\nWe walked over to see a campsite nearby that had been hastily abandoned. The fire had burned out but there was still a cooking pot and a kettle over it, as well as a bunch of dishes and sitting pads still neatly set up as if a couple was about to eat. The food was torn into and scattered by wild animals( no surprise there). But the tent was partially collapsed with a broken pole, and the door was unzipped and fluttering in the wind to reveal full backpacks, sleeping pads, and sleeping bags. Everything was covered in a fine layer of dirt.",
            "I was on a road trip to Vegas. About a four hour drive from where I live. \n\nOn the way up we witnessed a motorcyclist lose traction and hit the truck in front of him. The trucks trailer hitch must've caught his helmet or something because his head and most of his spine just got torn right the fuck off the rest of his body.\n\nThis all happened a lane over and a car's length ahead of us. We we're silent the rest of the car ride and drank the memory away when we got there.",
            "I was driving home from night classes in rural Virginia. It was around 10:30PM and I was on back road I have driven hundreds of times. I was going around 40mph when I saw a dog ahead in the road. I slowed down to almost a stop to let it finish crossing the road. The dog stood up on its hind legs and ran like a fucking human into the woods on the other side of the road. I wasn\u2019t the only one in the car who saw it, my best friend also saw it as well. The dog looked scraggly, super lanky, and was a dark color. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll never forget.",
            "Ima long haul truck driver, I used to run from Midwest to West coast. On my way back to the Midwest from LA I would run at night. Easier that way not as much traffic. Well 6 or 7 hours into my trip in Utah really can't remember the city name but I was on i15 getting on i70 heading towards the Rockies. Now if any of you have traveled especially but car, bus, or train you know you can see the night sky and almost all it's starts clearly. \nI remember I passed my favorite truck stop for a quick lunch. As I'm driving my xm goes a little haywire. Even though I just got it professionally installed. Im \"thinking great got ripped off\". Then I look up and I see a light, I'm thinking to my self idk where that plane is going, I've been up and down these roads awhile now. So I'm thinking did they build a new airport in this direction. Now I've been driving for a bit after my lunch and I realized I'm coming up to an area that is completely empty isolated nothing for hundreds of miles in any direction and I still see this light. I look down at my clock I have driven 3 hrs from when I last stoped. I remember 2 of those hours. So I pull off the interstate and look at my dash cam everything from when I stoped to when I pulled over was recorded. \nI look up and the light. Literally the light also stoped moving and just hooved over me. I jumped into my truck busted a u turn on the highway and raced back to my favorite truck stop called my dispatch told him \"fuck trader Joe's and it's food  , I ain't moving till I see sun light\" I hung up locked my doors shut my curtains and went to bed.\nNext morning I look over my body look over everything on my truck even the damn fuel and I find nothing wrong or anything new to it or me.\nTo this day I refuse to go pass the Rockies I tell my dispatch take the tip of Nebraska of the west side of it and draw a line from North to South. That's is my cut off to take my up to. \nTo this day I can't remember that 1hour and that damn light even followed me almost to the truck stop I lost about 5 miles before I pulled in for the night.\nSorry bout my spelling and grammar on mobile and just woke up. Any questions are welcome\n\nEdit:\n1. People wanna know if I have the video. Answer no camera was mainly pointed at the ground in case of accidents.\n2.people have asked about the shape. The shape of looked like a plane was coming in for a landing behind but never got bigger. It just looked like a light but no plane I could see if hear. Color was just a bright yellowish white light.\n3. People have asked if it was time zones or day light savings. No it was mid summer and wasn't near a time zone at all.\n4. All this happened about 3years ago. At the time I was 22 now 25.",
            "We live in Kentucky. Not rural by any means, but still woodland is mostly everywhere. I was about 12 and in the 7th grade, I believe. So, it's fall and I'm sitting outside Waiting at my bus stop, which was like 3 or 4 houses down from ours. My mother was sitting on our front porch smoking a cigarette when she points across the street and we see this lady walking out from the tree line. She had waist-length hair and a long white/possibly grey night gown on. We both didn't think much of it, because a little less than a block from our house was a nursing home and we figured that she was just a patient who has gotten out or lost or whatever. \nSo we're sitting there watching this woman pace and walk in circles, until she sits herself down at the foot of this tree, when suddenly it looks as if an invisible lasso was thrown around her and she was reeled from her waist up into the base and to the top of the tree, to never be seen again. My bus eventually came and my mom called the cops, but they apparently never found her or any signs of a struggle or anything like so. \n\nNobody EVER believes me when I tell them this story and had my mother not been there, I wouldn't believe it myself. Either way, I never went to that fucking bus stop alone again. Craziest shit I've ever seen that I couldn't rationalize.",

            "In advance, I apologize for poor English since it is not my first or even second language. I formed an Id just to narrate this.\n\nI come from a village fairly up in the mountains, the mighty Karakoram Ranges. As most of you might have known about the last hiding place of Osama Bin Ladin, Abbotabad. My village is further 40 miles northwards as crow flies. By road it is almost 2 hours drive through mountain road and then, a mountain trail. Last leg of journey is upon foot, the place being a steep mountain  side.\n\nI grew up there, and my childhood and adolescence was spent in the Jungle that surrounded the village, in the mountain streams. \n\nThere were local lore and legends about the forest, which were universally believed in to. \n\nWhen I was 19, or so, and was studying in an Abbottabad college, few of my friends decided to spend a few days trekking through the mountains. We were most interested to explore a cave, where, the legend says, a mountain spring just disappears. Supposedly, if you were lucky enough to go deep very deep in the cave, there was a Gold mine, with sand of Gold strewn by the stream. How ever, Djinns guard the place.\n\nSo, we gathered at my place, some 3 class fellows, from city. We were accompanied by 4 more from within my village. Thus, myself included, we formed a party of 8 young men.\n\nI am speaking of 1973. We did not have any maps with us. We knew the general area, knew land marks, and except for three city guys, all knew how to move about in Jungle, and walk the mountains. \n\nWe walked, slept in the open, fished, ate  wild fruits,and dried food from home and gossiped,  as we trekked along. The ascent wassteep,  unending with  jungle all around.\n\nA week later, we entered an area that we had never visited earlier. There were rocks, boulders, small springs and streams, and trees were less dense. We thought that the stream that disappears in to the cave must be around some where.\n\nThat night we were dog tired, after a very stiff climb, we took our meal, laid out our canvasses and were asleep very soon.\n\nI have no idea how long did we sleep. How ever, I was woken up as I noticed some one brushing my hair. Just as I turned in my sleep and was to emit the standard cry-what is it? I found a hand over my mouth and a whisper, I am XXXX name of a friend, quite, shhh, wake up others just as I woke you up, no sound. Before I could even ask why? I heard sound of a woman giggling. Then a low humming sound. I woke up the next friend, who woke up the next. soon we all were fully awake, and hearing giggling, woman laughing around and then we heard heavy foot steps in the distance, Some one or thing very heavy was walking with heavy steps, slowly, but, towards us. \n\nI had a torch on me. I turned it on. All we saw was trees, boulders, rocks, but, nothing else. It was all quiet .\n\nFearing that batteries would run out, I turned the switch off. We all huddled closer,packed the canvass sheets, and the bed sheets ,  some said in the darkness, put on your shoes, and make no noise. We just sat together  on a moonless night and could not see much since clouds were blocking the star light.\n\nWe could hear the sound of a woman laughing and heavy steps walking around us. Finally, my patience ran out. I was young, very foolish, and, patience was not my virtue. I said it loud to my friends, I am not sitting like a chicken fearing the knife , let us see who is this thing. Surprisingly every one said, yes, we must.\n\nWe decided to talk louder then on, and if we had to move, we planned to stick very close, and in pairs. Column of 2 people in pairs, 4 pairs. Then some said, who are you, show us!. With in a few seconds we could feel that ground around had lot of folks . We turned on the lights, and we saw at least 10 -12 things surrounding us.\n\nNot monkeys , there are many up there in mountains,but they were not monkeys at all. Not humans, but, human like. Hairy, broad,61/2- 7 feet tallish, but, not like gorillas either. Round, to elongated faces, dark hair covered them. \n\nThen some said, the air smells weird. Some else said, must be their stink. But, no, it did feel different, and it was not a bad smell at all. Then we knew another thing, The forest was completely silent. The sound of nights in the jungle, insects, birds, wild animals, had stopped, The wind had stopped, It was abnormally silent. The wind gives a sound as it flows through jungle trees.\n\nThen I turned the light ON again of my torch. Those things were gone. How ever, we all knew, they were watching us.\n\nSome how we knew. I could feel eyes piercing my being even though it was dark. We all agreed that we were being watched very closely and intently.\n\nAnother friend took torch from me and pointed all around us. On a huge boulder, some 20 feet away, stood a giant looking at us. Same appearance as the rest, but, far taller. 7-8 feet tall. Looking at us. We began to panic. The very still air, total lack of any sound at all, darkness, and these freakish things , belief in Djinns/Demons, all began to act.\n\nThen some said, do NOT run, IF we run, they will harm all of us. Stick together. Recite verses from Quran. And he spoke to that thing, Telling him that we came in peace, will not harm them, and bear no ill intent. Then we heard a giggle, and a woman approached us. She was dressed as a wealthy woman of that area, in mid 40s. Long hair, milky white, people in our region are fair btw.\n\nShe said in softest tone, do not get any further, We must return. Then she disappeared in the night. Just then, the jungle came back to life. Usual sounds of critters and insects, birds, air flowing through trees, the sound of air as it passes through trees. The strange things were -gone.\n\nWe stayed there waiting for the day break and returned.\n\nNow am old, 65 years old. I am a grand father. I have seen many places. I do not know what did we encounter. I never returned to that area.",

            "I use to be a tour guide for a world famous haunted mansion. In between tours, tour guides would have to walk through the mansion and dust and sweep. It felt a little eerie walking through an old and supposedly haunted Victorian mansion by yourself, but I didn\u2019t believe in ghosts so I didn\u2019t mind too much.\n\nAnyway, the long deceased owner was an eccentric old woman, who had stood approximately 4\u2019 10\u201d. One day I\u2019m approximately in  the middle of the mansion sweeping at the bottom of a staircase. No one was around when I suddenly hear a tiny voice say, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d I was very startled as I looked up at the top of the staircase. I was even more startled when I saw the owner of the voice. There, at the top of the staircase was an old woman in a flower print dress who stood about 4\u2019 10\u201d. My legs literally went weak and I believe I actually dropped my broom. I tried to speak but I was so scared I couldn\u2019t say any words. After I stood there shaking in silence, she spoke again.\n\n\u201cI lost my tour group. Can you help me find them?\u201d I never told the other tour guides that I quite literally nearly shit my pants because I had mistaken an old lady who had gotten lost from her tour group as a ghost.",
            "I was about 15 and was in Costa Rica for the summer, as I have a lot of family out there. Its a big family and most everyone lives in the city but we had this house in the deep country a few km outside a tiny town called San Pedro. It was mountainous and with thick jungle forests. A serene place really. Old little house with some hand constructed pools and decks up the hill. There was power and water and it was enough for a relaxing getaway. It was up in the mountains surrounded by jungle and some random ranchland and farm land. It was honestly the most beautiful place I've ever been. But, given it's isolation, it could end up being a little creepy, especially after dark. You'd see lights in the forest when there shouldn't have been and sometimes you would see weird shit in the sky. When under the tree canopy, it got dark fast and all kinds of things would come out and make noise. Noise in the jungle at night is honestly pretty normal but one particular night we had a wierd one. It was myself, my abuela, my tia and tio and my cousin. We were all settled in bed, reading as we didnt have any internet out there and smartphones were a new thing. It was actually almost dead quiet that night, more of an anomaly really. It was a sudden scream that broke the silence, and not just any scream, it was somewhat human and absolutely bloodcurdling. Like a woman mixed with a cat, vile and terrifying. It started pretty much right outside the house and travelled all the way up to the pool area, a good distance, still very loud. Meanwhile as it moved up somewhat quickly there was this thunderous sound of what sounded like a dozen horses in full gallop moving with the screaming thing. It got up past the pool into a field behind it all the way up to the river. A good minute of horror. Needless to say we were all shaken a good bit. My little cousin who was like 10 or something was unable to sleep again that night. Oddly enough once everything had settled the jungle carried on like usual. Bugs chittering and whatnot. The following morning we went to look and sure ebough, tons nof hoofprints. A local farmer said his horses had escaped, but that doesnt much explain the screaming. My abuela told me it must've been la bruja, or a witch. People out there believe in such legends. Elves and fairies. But you know in remote jungle countryside, who knows what lies within. Anyways, thats my little tale.",
            "I want to quote /u/OmegaFriend 's comment from [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6xdrcy/what_are_you_100_sure_of_you_saw_but_nobody/dmf43gj/) because I think it fits perfectly here.  \n\n\n\n\n\"When I traveled to India about 20 years ago, I took the buss bus/coach to travel from one city to another. It was a night buss, so I slept through most of the ride. It was dark and the road was surrounded by a forest. The road was only illuminated by the headlights of the bus and we were seemingly alone on the road. I woke up for a brief moment and just stared out the window. There I saw this creature on the side of the road hurrying into the dark woods. The moment lasted a second or two, but I saw the creature so clearly. It looked like something with a human body doing an inverted crab walk. It had the head of a doberman dog, or jackal. It had a waddling gait. With each limb moving independently, like an insect.\n\nEveryone around me was asleep, and I felt like a crazy person. I kept telling myself that I must've seen something else And misinterpreted it in my mind. Cause I just caught a glimpse of it. In later years I've questioned whether I was dreaming it. I feel extremely certain of what I saw, but I'm probably wrong. There is probably a logical explanation to it.\n\nA few years ago I stumbled upon this gif. It's not real, but the thing I saw looked almost exactly like this creature. A bit more jackal-like head, but pretty much this. https://imgur.com/gallery/9nx6vhv\n\nI'm a very rational person, and I do not believe in supernatural things. But being in an Indian forest at night will make even the most sane person doubt his mind. Those forests are truly scary.\n\nTl;dr i belive i saw the creature from the link I posted\n\nEDIT: This got way more attention than i expected. Unfortunately, i was unable to beat the story of the guy who got a grasshopper stuck in his ass crack, oh well.\n\nI'm getting a lot of questions about hypnogogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. I worded myself wrong. The only reason I mentioned sleep in the first place was to highlight that everyone else were sleeping. I should've specified that I was completely awake when I saw it. Even though I feel well versed enough in paralysis and hallucinations, to rule them out, I'm not gonna dismiss it completely.\n\nI just wanted to point out that this incidence instilled a child-like fear and irrationality in me as a kid. Because the thing looked so unnatural. It was a fear of something unknown, and inexplicable. I think about this incidense a lot, since its the only \"supernatural\" encounter I've ever had. While in medschool i learned about genu recurvatum (and i see a lot of people posting it here). It is certain that I saw a human or animal with a deformity, rather than a supernatural being. However, my childlike-fear became a different kind of fear when I realised that. Now i find it creepy on a different level. One, that a deformed human is roaming around at night, in the jungles of India out in the middle of nowhere. And the other thing I find even scarier, is that we as humans are willing to push fellow human beings out of society, due to stigma. It is scary to know that a person born like this, may end up living in the forest like an animal, instead of being treated with dignity.\n\nor i might've met a fucking alien. who knows.\"",
            "My friend and I used to go and off-road on random trails. One night we were putting around in East Bumfuck woods and came upon what looked like some plastic garbage farther up on the side of trail. We investigated. As we got closer we noticed they looked like dolls. Turns out someone had dumped a plethora of Barbie and Ken dolls and some toys. Except that they positioned the 12 or so naked dolls in various sex positions. Some were alone clearly taking care of themselves and some were Barbie on Barbie.\n\nNot so creepy I guess, but it sure was a surprise coming across this in the middle of nowhere in the woods.",
            "On exercise in kenya and we were sleeping out in just thin sleeping bags under the stars. We needed to just lay up for the night in a fairly impromptu and hasty little triangle. Now we knew we being followed by something (we guessed hyenas) and we could hear them. So we 2 guys on sentry at all times. But the one guy fell asleep and the other must've just been looking in the wrong direction.\n\nAnyways, my buddy had a hyena or wild dog or something grab the bottom of his sleeping bag and start dragging him off. He squealed at the top of his lungs but he was still dragged a few feet before all the commotion scared the dogs away. We were properly on edge the next few weeks after.",
            "My husband and I were driving my sister in law home one early evening. This was a well populated, well used road in the center of town. As we're passing a church, I see what I can only describe as a huge, black dog appear in the middle of the road. It runs toward the church and encounters a fence. The dog like legs then stretch out like arms as it crawls through a wooden slat fence; it's back legs pulling through as a human would.\n\nMy husband looked at me and said, \"So... You saw that, right?\"\n\nSpooked the hell out of him since he doesn't beleive in the paranormal.\n\nEdit: So I just talked to my husband about this, since I have trouble with my memory. He said we were talking to each other while this thing was running across the street, like, \"You seeing that shit?\". He jogged my memory, too.\n\nThe dog materialised in the left lane next to us; in the middle of the lane in a puff of smoke. It ran across in front of our car, and as it got to the church fence, it's legs went from bending low like a dog to having an elongated humanistic bend. It was maybe 100 feet in front of us.\n\nMy husband says it climbed over the fence, but I remember it going under the top rail. Either way, it's the single most creepy encounter we've ever had.",
            "Woke up to my daughter staring at me a foot from my face.",
            "We were visiting my aunt in Honey Grove, TX and she had a pasture near her house where the cows ate and hanged out. So me and my cousins went all the way out to the water hole and off in the distance we saw a figure watching us. We were out there for a while and it looked like it was coming closer. We ran and just shut ourselves in the house.",
            "My husband convinced me to go camping for the first time as an adult. I have a vivid imagination. Well, we go to bed and I am wide awake. Suddenly I hear an unidentifiable sound, almost like a horn blowing but we were out in the woods so that didn't make sense. I couldn't tell if it was real but then I heard it again. I woke up my husband so he could listen but he said he didn't hear anything and fell back asleep. The sound came and went all night. At one point it sounded like it was maybe 100 yards away. And every time I tried waking my husband, he said he didn't hear it. I started to think it was aliens and they were coming to get me and only me. \n\nAs it turns out, what I heard was just a bunch of elk bugling all night. Scared the shit out of me though."

He will sleep on your head at night and you might find scratches on your cheek or next to your eye, or he\u2019ll yell at the bedroom door if it\u2019s closed and try to turn the door knob and/or stick his paws under.  He screams like a goat.  On the bright side he learned to sit for food because food is the only true goal in his life.",
            "my cat drinks out of a glass on my nightstand rather than a bowl. a couple of years ago, she was having some pretty serious dental issues (all fixed now), and was being reluctant to eat and drink. she had always wanted to drink out of the water cup i had for myself, and at that point i just wanted her to drink anything, so i let her. \n\nthat was my mistake and now she refuses to drink out of a bowl on the ground, and will only drink out of cups. she has a permanent cup on my nightstand, to this day. oh well, at least it's easier for me to monitor her water intake.\n\nEditing this to reply to some repeat comments I'm seeing below:\n\n-i was aware that cats like to drink away from their food, and at the time she had two different bowls that were not next to get food\n\n-I've tried every material (stainless steel, glass, ceramic, plastic) for bowls, she doesn't care\n\n-i wasn't aware that cats like being high up when they drink, that might help explain it\n\n-i see a lot of comments to get a cat fountain, at this point, since the glass on the nightstand doesn't bug me, I'm probably not going to buy one, mainly because of how many different drinking options she's rejected in the past haha but if I ever want her to stop, that'll be my first try",

Sometimes he's not even facing me when he does it which is the funniest.  He'll get up on the bed, put his ass in my face, sit, and just wait. He knows he doesn't even feign loving me to get what he wants, he just knows it's going to happen so why put up a facade?  He's become very entitled about it.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2) Whenever I bring my dogs in from a walk or from the back yard, I give them a treat, which I keep in the kitchen.  So whenever we come in, they run to the kitchen and get in the sitting position ('sit' is always the first command in a string of commands that I use when giving them treats).  If I forget, they'll sit there for however long it takes for me to circle back around and give them a treat - sometimes this takes 5-10 minutes if I'm distracted; but they'll just sit there waiting. \n\nThey have trained me well.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________",

She's CRAZY about carrots and pumpkin and I usually chop it on a wooden cooking board, so it makes a characteristic sound when the knife hits the board. Whenever she hears the sound of chopping, she bolts to the kitchen to ask for some. She only comes when it's carrots or pumpkin. Any other vegetable and she couldn't care less.\n2. She waits until everyone had finished their meals to go eat hers. As soon as we leave the table, she goes to her bowl and eats her food. And when she's done, she turns it upside down to let us know it's empty.\n3. I live in an apartment building and the doorman always lets us know when there's visitors coming up, so when the intercom rings she goes straight to the door, waiting for whoever it is and barking like crazy (she only barks for this specific reason, she usually sneezes to draw our attention instead of barking.) \n\nThere's so much more but I won't linger on.

Theres a thing called resource protection where dogs will guard their resources, so if a human feeds, shelters, waters and walks a dog that dog could grow to see you as a friend and a resource meaning you're something to guard.  I don't know if that's what really what happened but it's my best guess to it.\n\nEdit 2: Since a surprising amount of people (surprising to me at least) are still upvoting this I want to say I hope you all have a fantastic day wherever you and remember someone out there is really thinking of you :)",
            "My dog was born deaf, (he\u2019s a double merle Australian Shepherd, if anyone\u2019s curious) and he\u2019s taught himself a bunch of different cues like this. I don\u2019t think much of it now, and I kinda forget that not all dogs do these things. But it really is amazing how adaptable they are! He\u2019s so perceptive, he picks up on things we don\u2019t even notice and has a ton of accidental conditionings.\n\nWhen he was younger, he had attachment issues due to being a former abandoned stray. He\u2019d always lean on our legs, or try and sit on our feet. We figured out he was doing this so that he\u2019d know when we got up to leave! He knows all sorts of cues, mostly relating to locating where people are in the house. He uses minute body language, vibrations, shadows, and even mirrors to keep track of who\u2019s where. He always wants to know who\u2019s coming and who\u2019s going, and he usually knows someone is about to enter the room before we do. Most dogs have a good sense of time and schedules, and he\u2019s no exception: he knows when breakfast and dinner should be, and that if I come down wearing shoes, leggings, and a jacket, it\u2019s probably time for a walk. But he\u2019s also able to tell when someone is leaving for a short time vs. an extended period of time, and somehow seems to know about when they\u2019ll be back, too. I accidentally trained him to jump up on the bed with me whenever we\u2019re alone in the room, because I always allow him up with a command in that situation, so now he just assumes he can do it, lol.\n\nHe used to have this (sort of annoying) habit of sticking his nose under closed doors and loudly inhaling/exhaling repeatedly, but this is his way of figuring out who\u2019s behind the door using his sense of smell. When someone gets up to go to the bathroom and closes the door behind them, he\u2019ll face the door and just wait for them to come back. But right before they come out, he perks up again. How does he know? He can\u2019t hear the water running or footsteps or anything. My guess is it has to do with him feeling the vibrations of the water pipes, and/or seeing the shadow from under the door move in a certain way. He can also recieve commands through a mirror; if he sees me wave or do the \u201cgood boy!\u201d hand motion in the mirror, he knows he can turn around, and I\u2019ll be there doing the same hand motion and he can get pets/happiness. It\u2019s all pretty amazing and interesting to me, especially considering most dogs don\u2019t understand or care about mirrors at all. \n\nHe was also never that into the game of fetch. I think the idea of running AWAY from his humans is just really unappealing to him. Instead, his favorite game is tug of war, (lots of eye contact and fierce competition!) followed closely by \u201cchase/herd the humans!\u201d and \u201cfood puzzle.\u201d Now that he\u2019s older, his attachment issues have improved a lot, he\u2019s much more secure and mellowed out. When we go on walks, I\u2019ve trained him to automatically sit and wait at crossing areas. He\u2019s gotten really good at this, but when I pat him to say, \u201cgood boy, time to walk again!\u201d for some reason, he always takes off at speed. My best guess is that I\u2019ve jogged across with him too many times to try and make the opening, so now that\u2019s what he always wants to do. (That or just, pure joy at continuing the walk?) He also complains if I make him wait too long at the crossing due to passing cars...lol.\n\nEDIT: Here are some [pics of my dog! ](https://imgur.com/gallery/IbLjHIt)",

He was well trained and never did anything out of the ordinary. Like, he knew to stay with us on walks or to avoid the street.

I think the deal is, I have extremely severe back problems, and my son had, had the dog about a year, until we moved next to each other, and the dog slowly moved into our house. He lays on the arm of my recliner, unless I get up, then he follows me. \n\n1. If I grab my keys and cane, he waits at the door, just in case I let him go, if I do he runs out the door and to the back door on the driver side, and waits, wagging his tail so hard his whole body moves. \n2. When we turn off the tv he runs and waits at the bedroom door, once we open it, he jumps up on the foot of the bed and waits for his nighttime snack. \n3. Once I get in bed and get comfortable on my side, next to my wife, he moves up and lays down against my back. \n4. If I lay down for a nap, and someone knocks on the door, he has a viscous bark, if they make the mistake of opening the door, before or after knocking instead of waiting on me to open it, he will hurl himself off the bed at like 90 mph, and he will bite. His teeth scratched my other son's (38) arm, and I had to grab him one day or he would have bit my wife, he was one his way, I just got lucky. \n5. I eat in my recliner because I can't sit in a dining room chair, when he sees me with a plate of food, he jumps down until I get finished. Never once asked him to, he just does it. \n6. Sometimes, my legs will just go dead because of some pinched nerves. A couple of times I have went to the bathroom, without him, and fell, he sat at the bedroom door howling, until my wife and son came in to get me up. They didn't know I fell, until he started. \n7. We have 3 dogs total, if I'm walking, or if it's one of my bad days and I'm hurting bad, he makes sure the other 2 dogs stay away from me. He just knows when I\"m hurting, one of other dogs is over 10 and acts like an older calm dog, the other is a 1 y/o boxer that I swear is on meth, or crack or both, she is hyper as hell, and he really works to keep her a safe distance when needed. the older one a yorkiepoo, he pretty much ignores her and let's her come to me, unless it's a bad day. He's not jealous, I can love on them all I want, if I call them, but only if it's my decision, not theirs. \n\nI guess that's all I can think of at the moment, sorry I wrote so much but this dog does so much. I've had smart dogs before, but this one is more than smart, he knows my feelings, and what I'm thinking without me saying anything, and he does what I think before I tell him that is what is amazing about him. But seriously unless you want to get bit don't open my bedroom door while I'm taking a nap. My wife and son learned it the bad way.",

            "If you're launching from Earth, the most difficult place to reach in the solar system is the sun.\n\nThe reason for this is that to fly directly into the sun you need to first launch from Earth, and then remove all of your orbital velocity around the sun.  Anything less will just put you into a different orbit around the sun rather than directly into it.  The amount of power required for that to do it directly is basically impossible currently.\n\nAs an alternative you could, for relatively little power, fly all the way out to Pluto distance, slow down much less, and then fall back into the sun.  The trade off being the travel time is now about 90 years.\n\nThere are other in between paths that will could get you there for different balances of energy and time but all of them are tougher than getting basically anywhere else in the solar system with an equivalent balance.\n\nThere's a mission currently traveling to study the sun, the Parker Solar Probe, it won't be flying directly in, but plans to make the closest passes than any probe ever has.  It's going to make seven passes by Venus to shed speed so it can get closer and closer to the sun.  The full flight time is planned as just less than 7 years.

            "Feeling uncomfortable or shamed for showing your emotions. It's a sad truth, but since the dawn of time, men have been encouraged to live up to the expectations of  having to be tough or being a rock for the family. As a woman, I think we feel more comfortable crying and expressing our sadness. Men get sad too, and it's about time they feel free to express it as easily as women do.",

Words kind of fail me right now, because I don\u2019t know what to say to any of you. What I want to say, though, is that you are all incredibly strong human beings. And you are that - a human being.

They will tell me how shitty the person who did that is, how difficult it must be to deal with, how strong I am for persevering in the face of adversity. \n\nOn the other hand, I've spent my life trying to be a non-judgmental source of venting for my male friends and I've found that basically everyone who I'm like that with ends up either thinking I'm into them romantically, or expressing how grateful they are for something they get so little of.

            "Most women think there's nothing wrong with being abusive and cruel with men. It's so upsetting watching women treat men like absolute shit. To top it off, men are expected to still act like \"*a gentleman*\" and also they're not allowed to feel vulnerable, or to feel sad, angry because some lady was just \"a little sassy\" when in reality she was being abusive piece of shit\n\nEdit: I'm a woman, not a heartbroken dude. Thanks for your concern lol. Also, it has come to my attention that I didn't get my point across very well. By \"most women\" I mean most women I know. I don't claim to know what most women think, I'm just talking from my experience. I've also been cruel to men, it's just too ingrained in our culture that being mean to men is acceptable. It isn't. We cannot expect to have an equal society if we don't treat men respect, tolerance and kindness. Thinking that you can treat men like shit just because they're men is sexist, an we shouldn't tolerate it. We are responsible for creating the world we want to live in.

I emphasized the parts that leaped out at me.\n\nExcerpts:\n\n> *Trystan Cotten, 50, Berkeley, California:*\n\n> \n> A couple of years after my transition, I had a grad student I\u2019d been mentoring. She started coming on to me, stalking me, sending me emails and texts. My adviser and the dean \u2014 both women \u2014 laughed it off. \n> \n> It went on for the better part of a year, and that was the year that I was going up for tenure. It was a very scary time. ***I felt very worried that if the student felt I was not returning her attentions she would claim that I had assaulted her.*** \n> \n> ***I felt like as a guy, I was not taken seriously.*** I had experienced harassment as a female person at another university and they had reacted immediately, sending a police escort with me to and from campus. I felt like if I had still been in my old body I would have gotten a lot more support.\n> \n> *Zander Keig, 52, San Diego, California:*\n\n>Prior to my transition, I was an outspoken radical feminist. I spoke up often, loudly and with confidence. I was encouraged to speak up. I was given awards for my efforts, literally \u2014 it was like, \u201cOh, yeah, speak up, speak out.\u201d \n\n>When I speak up now, ***I am often given the direct or indirect message that I am \u201cmansplaining,\u201d*** \u201ctaking up too much space\u201d or \u201casserting my white male heterosexual privilege.\u201d \n> \n>. . . I do notice that ***some women do expect me to acquiesce or concede to them*** more now: Let them speak first, let them board the bus first, let them sit down first, and so on. \n> \n> . . . What continues to strike me is the significant ***reduction in friendliness and kindness*** now extended to me in public spaces. \n> \n> ***It now feels as though I am on my own: No one, outside of family and close friends, is paying any attention to my well-being.***\n> \n> I can recall a moment where this difference hit home. A couple of years into my medical gender transition, I was traveling on a public bus early one weekend morning. There were six people on the bus, including me. \n> \n> One was a woman. She was talking on a mobile phone very loudly and remarked that \u201cmen are such a\u2013holes.\u201d \n\n>I immediately looked up at her and then around at the other men. Not one had lifted his head to look at the woman or anyone else. \n> \n> The woman saw me look at her and then commented to the person she was speaking with about \u201csome a\u2013hole on the bus right now looking at me.\u201d \n\n>I was stunned, because I recall being in similar situations, but in the reverse, many times: \n> \n> A man would say or do something deemed obnoxious or offensive, and I would find solidarity with the women around me as we made eye contact, rolled our eyes and maybe even commented out loud on the situation. I\u2019m not sure I understand why the men did not respond, but it made a lasting impression on me.\n> \n> *Chris Edwards, 49, Boston, Massachusetts:* \n> \n> ***The hormones made me more impatient.*** I had lots of female friends and one of the qualities they loved about me was that I was a great listener. \n> \n> After being on testosterone, they informed me that my listening skills weren\u2019t what they used to be. \n> \n> Here\u2019s an example: I\u2019m driving with one of my best friends, Beth, and I ask her \u201cIs your sister meeting us for dinner?\u201d ***Ten minutes later she\u2019s still talking and I still have no idea if her sister is coming.*** \n> \n> So finally, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and I snapped and said, \u201cIS SHE COMING OR NOT?\u201d \n\nVideos:\n\n[Raising Cain: Exploring the Inner Lives of America's Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9k0vKL5jJI) - This is a documentary.\n\nExcerpt of description:\n  \n> This two-hour documentary provides surprising new research about boys inner workings, dispelling a number of commonly held misconceptions, and highlights innovative programs that are bringing out the best in boys. \n\n[Self-Made Man: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWkgCEPFmXo) - Also a book.\n\nPodcasts:\n\n[The Lonely American Man](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594719471/guys-we-have-a-problem-how-american-masculinity-creates-lonely-men)\n\n[This American Life 220: Testosterone](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/testosterone) - This podcast was *fantastic.*\n\nArticles:\n\n[Are women more emotionally intelligent than men?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-brain-and-emotional-intelligence/201104/are-women-more-emotionally-intelligent-men)\n\n[Redditor to Redditor: Male Mentorship & Social Media](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/my-brothers-keeper/201504/redditor-redditor) \n\n[Men Have No Friends and Women Bear the Burden](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/?fbclid=IwAR07MjWXUdeCFw0sSY2dJ9pdd-3OL_iZCjafJC-X38crxhUhlqeiZaZdqvw) - Warning to guys: the first half of the article can be rage-inducing because it's like it's saying even when men are suffering, women are still the bigger victims. \n\nIf you want to skip that, on that article page do a ctrl + f for \"Scott Shepherd\" and start reading from there.

Dr. Vaillancourt said the experiment and other research suggest ***the stigma is enforced mainly by women***.\n\n> \u201cSex is coveted by men,\u201d she said. \u201cAccordingly, women limit access as a way of maintaining advantage in the negotiation of this resource.

In studies where women are asked to rate the attractiveness of photographs of men posed with a female partner versus alone, ***men pictured with a partner are generally considered more attractive***. \n> \n> This finding has been replicated when participants view speed-dating footage. Controlling for individual characteristics, men perceived to be more successful at the process were favored over those that were not (2).\n> \n> A caveat to these findings is that ***mate copying appears to only occur if the male\u2019s previous female partner is considered attractive***. In other words, men are considered more attractive only if their previous partner is regarded as beautiful. \n> \n> In socially monogamous societies, most men will become partnered at some point. A man with a highly physically attractive partner may have something desirable that a man with a less physically attractive partner does not.\n\n[If Only... Gender Differences in Sexual Regret](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201306/if-only-gender-differences-in-sexual-regret)\n\nExcerpt:\n\n> The three biggest regrets of women were, in descending order: losing their virginity with the wrong partner, cheating on a partner, and letting relationships progress to sex too quickly. \n> \n> The three most common male regrets were: being too shy to indicate sexual attraction to someone, not being (sexually) adventurous enough in their youth, and not being adventurous enough during their single days.\n> \n> . . . Surprisingly, one of the common regrets among women related to having sex with a non-attractive partner. \n> \n> A partner\u2019s physical attractiveness is commonly thought of as a male preoccupation, but apparently when it comes to casual sex, ***women tend to raise the attractiveness bar for agreement*** \n> \n> (\"I\u2019ll have a one night stand with someone, but only if he looks like George Clooney\"), while ***men tend to lower it***: (\"It\u2019s just a one-nighter, who cares if she looks like George Clooney\").",

It all seems like bullshit for men.\n\n**Men are expected to initiate the conversation most of the time.**  And yet...I've known women who will accept dates with men they have 0 interest in just to get a free meal out of it.  I've known women who want men to approach them, but if the man is unattractive to her she calls them creepy or mocks them for it.  Sure, not all women are like this...but you know what happens when I approach a man who isn't interested in me?  He says \"No, thank you.\"\n\n**I could easily get a one night stand if I wanted to.**  Yeah.  If people know about it I might be called demeaning things or people trying to shame me for it.  But I just think about a time a man approaches a woman in an elevator, gets turns down, and the next day there are news articles about how men shouldn't make women uncomfortable and that conferences need to make an effort to make \"safe spaces\" for women.\n\n**Men are shamed for their sexuality and no one gives a fuck.**  A man who is unhappy in a relationship because he doesn't get to have sex as often as he would like gets to hear how \"NO ONE OWES YOU SEX!\" up and down.  He's seen as a piece of shit for even considering leaving the relationship for it.  But if I am unhappy in a relationship for any reason?  People will happily back me or take my side...including if it is about sex.  While there are people who will shame women and their sexuality, there are just as many people who will try to empower women for being sexual.  Men?  Nah.  You're all pigs, potential rapists, creeps, and predators.\n\n**The Double Standard with Parenthood.**  This is going into the \"SO\" route and relates to hook-ups.  A woman gets pregnant and doesn't want to have a baby, she can get an abortion, she can give the child up for adoption, and in some states she can do the adoption route or even abandonment *without* the man's permission!  And a woman who gets an abortion or adoption...well, \"Her body her choice!\"  But what about the man?  A woman gets pregnant and he doesn't want to have the baby...he's a deadbeat.  If she keeps the baby, your money is tied to her and the child for years and you're a deadbeat for even considering anything different.  Not only that but, \"If a man doesn't want to support a kid then don't have sex!\" is often said in discussions about this even though the *same fucking line* is used against women by pro-lifers!  It's a gross double standard and a dangerous one making sex and relationships more tricky for men.  It doesn't help that women have a huge variety of contraceptive options available to them and men only have one that isn't permanent.\n\n**Marriage is tricky for men.**  With how easy it is for a woman to leave a marriage and claim a bunch of assets, sometimes get alimony, and take the children...why are men risking marriage?  Yes, not every marriage is so clear-cut and sometimes the woman is making sacrifices herself which could make it difficult for her to get back onto her feet after a divorce, but come on.  Women aren't helpless delicate flowers anymore.  Women aren't solely reliant on their husbands and will be devastated after a divorce...at least not in the United States.  And I acknowledge this as someone who is married to a man.\n\n**Lack of support for those who end up in abusive relationships.**  Abuse can come from either sex.  Men can be raped and abused too.  But there are so few options out there for men who need help in addition to people often saying or joking about how he probably deserved it or that he's being weak.\n\nETA; Since apparently I need to make it clear: Yes.  **I** ***am*** **female.  I was born female.**  I'm not a trans woman even though I have commented in trans subreddits.  It's weird to me that some of you find it hard to believe that a woman could be behind this response, but hey. Now you know why I use \"AssumeImNot.\"  Though...having people assuming I'm a trans woman is a new one for me!",

            "I was going to say \"make sure you use the right words\" but actually it's \"make sure you use the right words for the right audience\". Not everyone is at the same level of comprehension, so knowing what works for who is one huge hurdle to get over first.",

            "Practice. Arguments help as well. Debating skills are actually quite useful in being able to articulate what you're feeling into actual words. It's not uncommon for even well spoken people to fall apart when they are under pressure. They can think of what to say before and after but when they're under the gun they can't spit it out. \n\nPractice makes perfect.",
            "I have had practice from teaching my little sister when she was struggling with homework, and I take my time. \n\nI often pause so that I can take a moment to figure out what I'm trying to say, and how best to say it. People don't usually mind waiting a couple seconds when they see you're thinking. \n\nOne exception I have is with my mom, she can inject herself into anything I'm busy saying, and I used to let her just roll right over me. \nNow, I've bravened myself to focus on what I'm busy saying, and try and half shout my thoughts over her interruption. When she sees that I'm not going to give her control of the conversation, she stops and listens.\n\nAlso, breaking things up into digestable chunks helps with getting a message across clearly, imagine if this comment had no spaces between paragraphs. It would read like a muddled mess.\n\nThat's another problem with my mom, she will give you multiple instructions quickly and in one sentence, and half the time I never fully hear everything she has to say. \nI'm not sure how scientific this is, but I like to think that your memory has little slots.\nIf you tell someone something, a fact or instruction or anything else, their brain fits this information into a slot. Once it's done, then you can give it more information to put in the next slot and so on. \n\nIf you say things too fast, their brain can't collect information fast enough, and information gets lost and forgotten. This is just a way of thinking for me, and I'm only 15, so I'm not sure how accurate it will be. \n\nAlso, leave short gaps in between things you are saying, this gives people a chance to ask questions and, if it's an argument, make a counter argument. \n\nSo my tips are:\n\n> Practice\n\n> Take your time\n\n> Break up your information into digestable chunks\n\n> If people try to interrupt while you're speaking, try to learn to steamroll over them\n\n> Leave places for interruption, so that it's a conversation instead of a lecture",

            "It's a process of communication. It's not just me standing there saying things, I always finish up my statements with a question like \"Do you understand?\" or \"Do you get me?\" or \"Does that make sense?\" Then I take whatever confusion they have and try and correct it.\n\nI also try to preface my statements that may seem unclear. This actually happened earlier when I was explaining something to my friend. I started out like this.  \n\n\n\\> Me: It took me three days to do laundry this weekend.  \n\\> Friend: Why did it take you so long?  \n\\> Me: This may sound weird, but bear with me.  \n\\> Friend: Okay, I'll hear you out.  \n\\> Me: For me, laundry is invisible.  \n\\> Friend: Okay, I'm not sure I follow you.  \n\\> Me: Well, our laundry room is in a room separate from the rest of the house with a closed door. I'm usually only in there to do laundry. So when I'm trying to make sure all of the chores in the house are done, I don't see the laundry. I can see the pile of dishes, I can see the toys on the floor, I can see that the floor needs vacuuming. But I don't see the laundry, because it's shut away from the rest of everything. So I don't notice that laundry needs to be done until I go to get a new dishtowel and there aren't any. But if I need the dishtowel I'm in the middle of doing dishes. So I go and get the dish towel, finish the dishes, and by the time I'm done I've forgotten the laundry and it's invisible again. Does that make sense?  \n\\> Friend: Oh, I get it, it's like an out of sight, out of mind sort of thing.  \n\\> Me: Yes! It's exactly like that. \n\nI also use a lot of analogies, and narrative structures like putting things in threes, and make weird comparisons so that the comparison I make is unusual enough that the idea sticks in their mind. \"Out of sight, out of mind,\" is a cliche enough phrase that someone might get what I'm saying the first time but not understand it when it happens again. If I say the laundry is invisible, then it's unique and interesting. They make the connection to the two concepts themselves and feel smarter because they've had a eureka moment.",

            "The secret to success in life, in all situations, at all places, and during all times is very simple:\n\n**Shut your god damn mouth.**\n\nThe famous quote (some version of it is often credited to Mark Twain or Abe Lincoln) goes:\n\n> It's better to remain silent and be thought a fool then to open your mouth and remove all doubt.\n\nNothing good ever comes from talking before you're ready. Slow it down, think about what you're going to say, and only say it if you're certain it's necessary to say it. Everything else comes from that first rule. Tips such as:\n\n* Don't panic.\n* It's not a race to get an answer.\n* Don't talk to fill silence.\n* Don't answer your own questions.\n* Don't answer to please someone.\n* Don't use filler sounds like \"umm\", \"ahhh\", ...\n* Like, stop saying \"like\" like every 3 seconds.\n* Don't bullshit or make it up while you're talking. Even if you think you might be right, even if you *happen to be* right, think first, answer second.\n* You don't have to immediately know the answer to every question. You are just as wise if you know who knows the answer or if you know how to get the answer.\n* Leadership isn't having the answers. Leadership is empowering those around you to get the answers.\n\nAfter that, it's all about confidence. Open your mouth, use your diaphragm, don't talk to the floor, look your target in the eye and project your voice to be heard.\n\nBonus secret: The power of communication comes when you realize everyone else has no idea what they're talking about either.

He tends to pause between thoughts, allowing himself time to make sure what he says is the right thing, and that itll actually have the impact he intends. The more often you do it, the easier it gets, just like everything else in life.",
            "Reading books helps a lot.",
            "Empathy. Genuinely trying to understand the viewpoint that you're discussing from the other point-of-view allows others to know you care enough to try. This, more often than not, will open them up to at least hearing what you have to say.",
            "In my own personal experience, I've realized that you gotta be 100 percent sure of yourself and develop your own mindset. Once you master yourself & your psychic, then you be able to express yourself to the fullest. When you aren't sure of yourself then that's when the anxiety and anxiousness build up making you unclear of your true intentions. Learn about yourself inside and out, up and down, and critically critique yourself. Once you do that, your confidence will translate into your speech making you sound more assured of yourself.",
            "For me as an introvert, I naturally spend a lot of time listening, reading, and observing others and the world around me. Because of this, I have picked up on both how good speakers talk (speaking patterns/sentence structure), and what makes them compelling. While I prefer to have time to collect my thoughts before speaking, over the years of practicing those speeches/statements, etc., I have a firm idea of the concept I want to add to and how to speak on the matter. It comes down to having turned the ideas over in my head and having spoken about them before, so when the time comes to share with others, I feel both prepared and confident that what I have to say both makes sense, is concise, and covers the topic in the way I want to get across to others!"

Her twitter and instagram accounts were overrun with awful comments, racist criticisms, and death threats for weeks, but over time it tapered off.\n\nPart of a reality show producer's job is to know how the audience thinks of all of the stars. The company monitors media coverage and social media trends. They knew.\n\nBut right after quarantine started in Japan, they re-aired the episode.\n\nHana lived alone.

            "Paul Reubens aka PeeWee Herman. He had a reputation of being kind of a stuck up asshole when the PeeWee character shot to fame, but not really any better or worse than other famous folks. He got \u201ccancelled\u201d because he was arrested for public indecency. He was caught masturbating in an adult theater. Aside from the undercover cop who caught him, he was alone, and it was a normal adult pornography film. But the industry and media acted like he\u2019d been caught with child porn or had raped someone. He\u2019s made a bit of a comeback recently though. I think people finally realized that in the grand scheme of \u201csex crimes\u201d, jerking it by yourself in a porn theater is nothing at all. I saw his PeeWee revival on Broadway several years ago and enjoyed it, and I\u2019ve seen him on a lot of the celebrity game shows on TV recently.",

            "~~Can't believe nobody said this yet~~, but Star Wars fans shouldn't cancelled to these poor actors namely, Jake Lloyd, Hayden Christensen, Ahmed Best (who played as Jar Jar), Daisy Ridley and Kelly Marie Tran. What they all did is only doing their own job, but hating them because they played their most hated characters (not by separating it as an actor and a character) is such a shame and sad. I feel bad for them.\n\nEDIT: Turns out they did mention them at the replies in one of the top comments from this post (which is about Hayden). I'm just saying this because I felt a really bad for them. I also would like to add George Lucas too (even though he's not an actor despite being his small cameo on ROTS). Star Wars fans keep shitting on him (by creating prequels, focusing on CGI, and special edition of the original trilogy) instead of giving him an another chance so much he led sold his company and Star Wars to Disney and now they want him back. This fandom is one of the most toxic that ever existed on the Planet Earth.\n\nEDIT #2: John Boyega is also included here as I remember a backlash by fans over him before.
